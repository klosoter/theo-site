J. Gresham Machen and the Defense of Historic Christianity against Modernism

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Time and setting, 1881 to 1937 in the United States, centered in Baltimore, Princeton, and Philadelphia, amid the Progressive Era, World War I aftermath, and the Fundamentalist Modernist controversies of the 1910s and 1920s.
- Theological background, Old School Presbyterian shaped by B. B. Warfield at Princeton Seminary, fortified by classical learning at Johns Hopkins and studies in Germany in 1905 to 1906 during the height of Ritschlian liberal theology.
- Core apologetic aim, to show that Christianity rests on objective historical facts and defined doctrines, and to argue that liberal Protestantism is a different religion rather than a variant of Christianity.
- Principal works, Christianity and Liberalism 1923 for lay readers and church courts, The Origin of Pauls Religion 1921 for scholars challenging comparative religion theories, What Is Faith 1925 clarifying the relation of knowledge and trust, and The Virgin Birth of Christ 1930 as a detailed historical defense.
- Method or approach, historically grounded evidential argument tied to confessional clarity, using Old Princeton realism and careful exegesis.
- Distinctive arguments or concepts, antithesis thesis that liberalism is another religion, Christianity as history and doctrine, objectivity of revelation, the indispensability of the supernatural, liberty of conscience under the church and against state coercion.
- Interlocutors, Harry Emerson Fosdick as a popular modernist preacher after 1922, Shailer Mathews as a Chicago school theologian of the social gospel, and Karl Barth as a critical ally against liberalism yet a rival on revelation and history.
- Legacy cue, Machen helped launch Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929 and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936, shaping later Reformed apologetics while standing between Warfields evidentialism and Van Tils presuppositionalism.

### ESSAY
PERSONAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT
J. Gresham Machen was born in Baltimore in 1881 and died in North Dakota in 1937 while on a cold missionary tour. His life spans a period when American Protestantism wrestled with Darwinian science, German higher criticism, and social gospel activism. After undergraduate work at Johns Hopkins in the late 1890s and a brief turn at Princeton University, he studied in Marburg and Goettingen in 1905 to 1906, where Wilhelm Herrmann and the heirs of Albrecht Ritschl promoted a faith built on religious value rather than historical fact. That experience strengthened Machen by contrast, pushing him to clarify how Christianity depends on publicly knowable events. He joined the Princeton Seminary faculty in 1906, under the shadow of Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield, and taught New Testament until the reorganization crisis of 1929. The public controversies that shaped him include the 1910 to 1916 doctrinal deliverances of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., the Fosdick sermon Shall the Fundamentalists Win in 1922, and the ensuing church trials that culminated in Machens suspension in 1935 for refusing to dissociate from the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions, which he helped found in 1933. When Princeton Seminary was reorganized in 1929 to accommodate a broader modernist spectrum, Machen led the founding of Westminster Theological Seminary that same year. In 1936 he organized the Presbyterian Church of America, renamed the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1939. His apologetic was forged in precisely these institutional battles, where argument had direct consequences for schools, pulpits, and missions boards.

INTELLECTUAL FRAMEWORK
Machen stands in the Old Princeton tradition that tied Reformed confessionalism to a realistic epistemology and historical method. Warfield, who died in 1921, was a decisive influence. He convinced Machen that Christianity claims truth about events in time and space, such as the resurrection, and that those claims can be tested with disciplined reasoning. Machens framework combines the Westminster Standards, the historical reliability of the New Testament, and a high view of the supernatural that rejects naturalistic closure. His critique of liberalism distills this framework in Christianity and Liberalism in 1923. There he insists that the essence of Christianity is not an ethical ideal but a message about God and sinners, focused on the incarnation, substitutionary atonement, and bodily resurrection. The liberal project, shaped by Friedrich Schleiermacher in 1799 and developed by Adolf von Harnack in 1900, recast the faith as the universal fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Machen replies that such a recasting yields a new religion. In The Origin of Pauls Religion in 1921 he opposes the notion that Paul borrowed from mystery cults, arguing instead that Pauls thought derives from the historical Jesus and the facts of the resurrection. What Is Faith in 1925 clarifies that faith includes knowledge and assent, not bare will or feeling, thus undercutting pragmatist reductions associated with William James and the American philosophy of the early 1900s. The Virgin Birth of Christ in 1930 further displays his framework, engaging historical criticism and showing that doctrinal confessions root in apostolic testimony rather than postapostolic mythmaking.

EPISTEMOLOGICAL METHOD
Machen does not sever faith from reason, nor does he absolutize reason. Following Old Princeton, he argues that there is common ground in the shared faculties of human cognition and in the public character of historical evidence. He adopts a cumulative case method that includes manuscript evidence, the coherence of apostolic witness, the failure of alternative explanations, and the internal fit between redemptive doctrine and human experience of sin and grace. He contends that evidence does not force conversion, since the Holy Spirit gives new life, yet he insists that Christianity is not a leap into the dark. In 1921 and 1923 he pressed this point by appealing to the visibility of the resurrection in the earliest sources and to the unavoidable doctrinal implications in texts like Romans and Galatians. He rejects the liberal axiom that miracles are impossible, seeing that axiom as a philosophical prejudice traceable to David Hume in 1748 and to the naturalism that dominated American universities after 1875. His method therefore disputes the closed system before he evaluates the texts. Still, he remains distinct from the later presuppositional approach of Cornelius Van Til, who joined Westminster in 1929. Van Til argued that neutrality is impossible and that only Christian presuppositions make rationality coherent. Machen agreed that worldviews clash, yet he continued to argue that factual and logical considerations could be publicly marshaled to commend Christianity apart from an exhaustive transcendental critique. The difference is one of emphasis, not an absolute contradiction.

ARGUMENTATION AND CONTENT
The heart of Machens apologetic argument is found in Christianity and Liberalism in 1923. He states a thesis that the Christian message is news about what God has done in Christ, not an exhortation to follow Jesus as a moral example only. He defends the authority of Scripture as a trustworthy record, the real incarnation as God the Son taking flesh, and the necessity of substitutionary atonement grounded in passages like Mark 10 to 45 and 1 Corinthians 15. He also critiques the idea that the church can remain united by minimizing doctrine. In his view, doctrinal minimalism dissolves the church into a mere club, since the gospel has propositional content that cannot be evacuated without losing the thing itself. In The Origin of Pauls Religion in 1921 he rebuts the history of religions school that flourished in the 1890s and 1900s. He shows that resemblances between Christianity and mystery cults are superficial and that the decisive driver of Pauls theology is the resurrection event reported by the earliest witnesses in the 30s of the first century. In What Is Faith in 1925 he takes aim at the idea that faith is will to believe, arguing instead for a biblically integrated view where knowledge, trust, and assent are inseparable. The Virgin Birth of Christ in 1930 extends his historical apologetic, canvassing patristic testimony, textual variants, and narrative features in Matthew 1 and Luke 1 to 2, to conclude that the virgin birth is not a late legend but part of the earliest Christian confession.

Machen engaged particular interlocutors in concrete disputes. He counters Harry Emerson Fosdick, whose 1922 sermon at First Presbyterian Church in New York called for latitude on doctrines like the virgin birth and inerrancy. Machen answers that such latitude removes the center and confuses the flock. He disputes Shailer Mathews at the University of Chicago, who in the 1910s and 1920s taught that Christianity must be recast for a scientific age and judged by social usefulness. Machen replies that truth is not reducible to utility, and that the gospel as an event for sinners cannot be swapped for ethics without loss. He critiques the Hocking report Re Thinking Missions in 1932, which promoted a cooperative, less doctrinally defined approach overseas, by establishing the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions in 1933 to maintain confessional integrity. In a different register, he also critiques Karl Barth in the 1930s. Barth rejected liberalism and affirmed revelation, yet his dialectical account left Machen uneasy about the status of historical events for faith. For Machen, the empty tomb and the eyewitnesses in the 30s are nonnegotiable. That emphasis marks a consistent apologetic strategy across his writings.

INTERNAL COHERENCE AND LIMITS
Machen achieves strong internal coherence by aligning his epistemology with his doctrinal claims and ecclesial practice. His view that Christianity stands or falls with history drives both his academic books and his institutional acts in 1929, 1933, 1935, and 1936. He uses a cumulative case that integrates textual criticism, historical reasoning, and theological synthesis, avoiding a simplistic proof text method. His insistence on liberty of conscience, seen in his 1926 testimony opposing a federal Department of Education, matches his concern that state power not coerce church doctrine. Yet his approach has limits. First, his confidence in common ground presupposes a fairly stable public rationality, which eroded in the mid twentieth century as linguistic and sociological turns shifted the discourse. Second, his rhetoric of antithesis sometimes reads as stark boundary drawing that ignores degrees and trajectories within the broad modernist world. Third, he rarely developed a philosophy of science able to engage developments after 1925, such as the new physics, which others would later exploit to challenge older naturalisms. Finally, while he affirmed the Spirits role in faith, his apologetic style can be read as front loaded with historical demonstration, leaving some readers wondering how to bridge from probability to personal trust. These are tensions rather than fatal flaws, yet they show where later Reformed apologists, notably Van Til after 1940 and John Frame after 1980, sought to extend or revise the strategy.

SIGNIFICANCE AND COMPARATIVE INFLUENCE
Machen shaped the trajectory of conservative Protestant apologetics and ecclesial life in the United States. His founding of Westminster Seminary in 1929 created a hub for later figures such as Cornelius Van Til, John Murray, and Ned Stonehouse, and his role in the 1936 formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church entrenched a link between apologetic conviction and church polity. Compared with Warfield, who wrote The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible in the 1880s and emphasized the evidences for inspiration, Machen applied the same realism to the ecclesial battlefield, pressing the incompatibility of liberalism and orthodoxy in 1923. Compared with Karl Barth, who issued the Barmen Declaration in 1934 and rejected natural theology, Machen insisted more directly on the historical visibility of the resurrection and on creedal precision as boundary markers. Compared with C. S. Lewis, whose radio addresses in 1941 to 1944 popularized the moral argument, Machen wrote less imaginatively and more juridically, but with greater attention to confessional identity. Compared with Van Til, who argued from the impossibility of the contrary in the 1940s, Machen still pursued shared evidence leading to warranted belief, even while warning of worldview conflict. His writings continue to train readers in disciplined historical reasoning joined to doctrinal clarity. For graduate students and ministers, the enduring takeaway from Machen is this, a church that forgets its doctrinal center loses the gospel it aims to commend, and an apologetic that forgets history loses the ground on which faith can be publicly confessed and defended. The synthesis is rigorous and pastoral, polemical and constructive, and it remains instructive for debates about truth and tolerance in the twenty first century.
