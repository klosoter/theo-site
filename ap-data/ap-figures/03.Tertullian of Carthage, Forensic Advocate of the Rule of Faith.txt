### ESSAY
PERSONAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT
Tertullian emerges in Carthage around the turn of the third century, a Latin voice amid Greek theological dominance. Born in Carthage around 155, likely trained in Roman law and rhetoric, he converted to Christianity near 195. His first major public work, the Apologeticus, appeared around 197 during the reign of Septimius Severus who ruled from 193 to 211. Africa Proconsularis was a wealthy and litigious province, home to urban elites, temples, and spectacles, and these features furnish the texture of his polemics. The edict against conversions issued by Severus around 202 intensified pressure on catechumens and pastors, especially in North Africa. Tertullian wrote as a citizen of a city fascinated by the arena and the theater, and his invective against idolatry and blood sport reads as local reportage, not abstraction.

By the first decade of the third century he took a rigorist turn. Around 206 to 207 he embraced the New Prophecy associated with Montanus, Priscilla, and Maximilla, whose movement had begun in Phrygia around 170. He criticized lax penitential practices in Carthage and defended prophetic charisms and strict discipline. The treatise Ad Scapulam, likely written in 212, addresses the proconsul Scapula with a blend of legal warning and providential history, reminding the magistrate of disasters that had befallen persecutors. He seems to have continued writing into the 220s, though the exact date of his death remains uncertain, often placed after 220. The later third century North African bishop Cyprian, martyred in 258, would read him daily, calling him master. That reception in the same city underscores that Tertullian was not a solitary pamphleteer but a local school that would teach the Latin West how to argue, organize, and discipline.

INTELLECTUAL FRAMEWORK
Tertullian builds on three pillars: Scripture, the apostolic rule of faith, and the juridical habits of Roman Africa. Scripture for him is a public deposit held by the churches founded by apostles, and its interpretation is governed by the rule of faith, a concise narrative confessing one God, the creator, Jesus Christ born of the Virgin, his passion under a Roman governor, his resurrection, the sending of the Spirit, and the resurrection of the flesh. In De Praescriptione Haereticorum around 200 he calls this rule a prescript, borrowing from Roman procedural law. A prescript can terminate a case before trial by showing that the plaintiff has no standing. Heretics, he argues, lack public title to the Scriptures because they are not in fellowship with the apostolic churches that authored and preserve them.

His intellectual debts are both avowed and resisted. He attacks what he calls Athens in his famous question, What has Athens to do with Jerusalem, in order to reject speculative novelty that revises the rule. Yet he plunders Stoic categories when useful. In De Anima around 210 he describes the soul as corporeal in a Stoic sense, and he treats causation and substance with a material clarity that later Latin theology will temper but not forget. He coins the terms trinitas and persona and substantia to express the unity and distinction of Father, Son, and Spirit. In Adversus Praxean around 213 he calls God one in substance and three in persons, a formulation that anticipates the Nicene settlement in 325 and 381 while still bearing his concise juristic stamp.

Tertullian also frames the church as a visible commonwealth. Apostolic churches can furnish lists of bishops that reach back to the apostles, an argument shared with Irenaeus of Lyon around 180, but Tertullian gives it legal tone. The deposit is safeguarded in public institutions, not in private inspiration that departs from the rule. That is why he grudgingly welcomes the New Prophecy only insofar as it confirms the rule and intensifies discipline, not as a source of new dogma.

EPISTEMOLOGICAL METHOD
Tertullian holds that Christian knowledge is anchored in public, ancient, and universal testimony. He has little patience for those who move the boundary posts established by apostolic preaching. In De Praescriptione he insists that before one opens Scripture with a heretic one should ask who owns the books. If the corporate author is the apostolic church, then those outside have no right to plead them against their makers. This is an epistemic gatekeeping move rooted in communal identity. It does not despise reason or text, but it orders the act of reading under the church that historically generated the canon.

He supplements this with the testimonium animae, the testimony of the soul, in Apologeticus 17 around 197. The human soul, he claims, cries out God is great and God is good in moments of danger or gratitude. This spontaneous confession, even in the mouths of pagans, shows a natural awareness of the Creator, a faint memory of the truth that Christianity formally articulates. He also appeals to forensic probabilities and public records. Christians do not commit the crimes they are charged with, he writes, and their lives are open to inspection. His call for due process is an epistemic appeal to common legal standards that Rome professed to honor. He urges magistrates to interrogate properly and to punish only proven crimes. In Ad Scapulam around 212 he names prior governors by date and office whose cruelty rebounded on their heads, constructing a prudent argument from historical precedent.

His method thus blends ecclesial authority, natural witness, and legal rationality. He does not preach a private illumination. He prizes rule, custom, and the marks of the catholic churches scattered across the empire whose mutual recognition and liturgical practice form a living archive.

ARGUMENTATION AND CONTENT
Apologeticus around 197 is his most famous public brief. Addressed to provincial authorities, it rebuts charges of atheism, incest, and cannibalism. He argues that Christians venerate the true God and pray for the emperor, thus they are loyal subjects. He asks for the elementary justice of hearing before punishment. He points to the moral transformation of converts, the rejection of infanticide and sexual exploitation, as empirical fruits. He concludes with a paradox that history has made famous, the blood of Christians is seed, a phrase that compresses his theology of martyrdom into a mnemonic line.

De Praescriptione Haereticorum around 200 turns inward to the church and her dissidents. Here the legal metaphor dominates. He refuses to grant Marcionites and Valentinians equal footing in exegesis. The Scripture belongs to the church that has preserved it from the apostles, and the rule of faith is the normative synopsis by which texts are read. This is not a refusal to argue, since he will argue at length, but a setting of terms so that the debate does not reward novelty with a stolen authority.

Adversus Marcionem, a work compiled between roughly 207 and 212, engages the most powerful dissenter of the second century. Marcion had proposed a good God of the gospel who was different from the just creator God of the law, and he constructed a canon that excluded most of the Old Testament and edited Luke and Paul. Tertullian replies across five books. He defends the unity of God, insists that Christ fulfills Israel, and, in his fourth and fifth books, argues chapter by chapter for the integrity of Luke and the catholic Paul. He also defends the reality of Christ’s flesh, which he treats separately in De Carne Christi around 206. There he mocks docetists who shy from birth and blood, arguing that what is not assumed is not healed, a line that anticipates later soteriological axioms.

Against Praxeas around 213 is his decisive Trinitarian treatise. Praxeas, a figure active around the time of the Montanist controversy, promoted a modalist confession that collapsed Father and Son into a single person and also opposed prophetic gifts. Tertullian answers that God is one in substance, but not solitary in person. The Father is God, the Son is God, the Spirit is God, and the three are distinct yet undivided. He uses scriptural exegesis and the analogy of a root and shoot and river and stream to express derivation without division. The dispute with Praxeas is both doctrinal and disciplinary, since Tertullian thinks modalism and antibiblical rigor towards prophecy travel together as deformations of the rule.

Other treatises fill out his polemical portfolio. De Idololatria around 200 rejects compromises with trades that service pagan worship. De Corona around 211 objects to military garlands as symbols of idolatrous loyalty and defends the conscience of the Christian soldier who refuses the crown. De Anima around 210 explores the nature and origin of the soul and, against Plato, he opts for traducianism, the view that the soul is propagated with the body. Adversus Hermogenem around 200 responds to a local teacher who posited eternal matter, arguing that only God is without beginning and that matter is created. Ad Uxorem around 200 and De Monogamia around 208 to 212 commend marriage yet forbid remarriage for the baptized widow or widower, illustrating his tightening rigor in the 210s.

INTERNAL COHERENCE AND LIMITS
Tertullian’s corpus displays remarkable coherence in form and a few tensions in content. The legal method is consistent from Apologeticus to De Praescriptione. He controls the forum by setting the procedural terms, then he prosecutes or defends with sharp irony and precise citation. His ecclesiology, rooted in apostolic continuity and public worship, grounds his claims about Scripture and doctrine. His Christology and Trinity, while not yet the Nicene or pro-Nicene synthesis, aim at the same target, a God who is truly one and truly the Father of the Son in the Spirit.

Limitations appear. His anti speculative rhetoric can seem to conflict with his use of Stoic material categories in De Anima. He denounces philosophy as the mother of heresies, yet he borrows from it to name the faith. This is more a tension of rhetoric than substance, since he distinguishes between tools and conclusions. His adoption of the New Prophecy around 206 to 207 sharpened his ethical demands and isolated him from broader catholic moderation, visible in De Monogamia and De Pudicitia around 213 where he denies post baptismal absolution for grave sins in a way Rome and many others did not accept. His epistemic strategy in De Praescriptione can also be criticized as circular. He says that the church that owns the Scriptures sets the rule, and the rule interprets the Scriptures, a circle that is virtuous for a participant but unpersuasive to an outsider.

A comparison clarifies these limits. Justin Martyr writing in Rome around 155 trusts Platonic concepts as bridges to the gospel, whereas Tertullian treats such bridges as ambush points and prefers legal commonplaces. Irenaeus around 180 narrates salvation as recapitulation under the one God of Abraham, while Tertullian stylizes the same claim in procedural terms, that the creator is the same God who justifies in Christ. Origen of Alexandria around 248 will read Scripture with extensive allegory in a Platonic key, while Tertullian reads with literal and forensic emphasis. Each contrast shows both Tertullian’s discipline and his blind spots.

SIGNIFICANCE AND COMPARATIVE INFLUENCE
Tertullian’s significance for apologetics and dogma in the Latin West is difficult to overstate. He gives Latin its first systematic theological vocabulary, trinitas, persona, substantia, and he does so in arguments that directly answer modalism and docetism. The one substance, three persons line that he offers around 213 becomes a charter for later Latin defense of Nicene faith after 325. In ecclesiology he shapes the Latin sense that the church’s public structure and rule govern interpretation. His insistence that one should not open Scripture with heretics until the matter of standing is resolved reappears in later controversies, including the Donatist disputes in North Africa after 311, where questions of title and succession dominated.

In apologetic method he models a style that presses public reason. In Apologeticus around 197 and Ad Scapulam around 212 he demands due process, cites facts, names officials, and treats the magistrate as potentially educable. This is not servility. He also warns magistrates that God judges judges and that history teaches retribution. The martyrs of Scilli in 180 and of Carthage in 203, including Perpetua and Felicitas, furnish a context in which his rhetoric of witness is both risky and credible.

His influence threads through later figures. Cyprian around 250 adopts his rigorist tone and his legal precision about episcopacy and unity. Lactantius writing around 310 echoes his Latin elegance in a friendlier imperial climate. Augustine born in 354 respects Tertullian’s brilliance but rejects his Montanist severity and revises his traducian anthropology with a more nuanced account of the soul and original sin. Compared with Origen, Tertullian lacks speculative reach but gains in juridical clarity. Compared with Irenaeus, he offers tools that bishops under pressure can use in court and council.

Modern readers often repeat the line I believe because it is absurd. That is not Tertullian’s teaching. In De Carne Christi around 206 he uses paradox to show that the shameful cross confounds worldly wisdom, but throughout his corpus he trusts coherent testimony, the natural witness of the soul, the probity of Christian life, and the discipline of a stable rule. His moral severity can be a burden, yet his candor under pressure forged a durable path for Latin Christian reason.

Ultimately, Tertullian stands as the Carthaginian jurist who taught Christian truth to speak Roman prose while guarding the gospel with the church’s own law.
