### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
Humanism names the elevation of the human as the central measure of meaning, value, and purpose. Autonomy names self-law, the idea that the mature agent is most dignified when acting under laws that he gives to himself. Together they have become the dominant grammar of modern culture. The debate is not whether humans have dignity or freedom, but whether dignity and freedom are ultimate in themselves, imago hominis, or are gifts that flow from being made in the image of God, imago Dei. Around this hinge turn further issues, the rise of instrumental reason that reduces reason to calculation of means, the ascendance of technique that treats all problems as solvable through method, and the powerful emancipation narratives that retell history as the march from tutelage to sovereignty.

The arc begins in antiquity. Protagoras in the fifth century BCE declared man the measure of all things. His maxim is not a full humanism, yet it seeds the claim that truth is indexed to human purposes. The Christian tradition answered with a higher measure. Psalm 8 extols human glory and yet grounds it in divine care. Genesis 1:26-28 gives the cultural mandate to image bearers who rule the earth under God. Medieval theologies preserved this double truth, high status under higher sovereignty.

Renaissance humanism retrieved classical eloquence and moral seriousness. Petrarch, born 1304, lamented scholastic aridity and urged studia humanitatis. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola in 1486 drafted his Oration on the Dignity of Man, proclaiming a uniquely plastic human nature, capable of ascent or descent by freedom. Much of this was theologically clothed. Erasmus in 1516 championed ad fontes, Scripture and the fathers, uniting piety with humane letters. Christian humanism celebrated imago Dei, yet it tilted the language of dignity toward autonomous self-fashioning.

The early modern period placed autonomy at the center. Francis Bacon in 1620 cast knowledge as power and proposed a new method to relieve the human estate. Descartes in 1637 published Discourse on Method and in 1641 Meditations, relocating certainty in the thinking self and subordinating the world to ideas clear and distinct to reason. Galileo and Newton tied the new physics to mathematical law. Kant in 1784 asked What is Enlightenment and answered, it is emancipation from self-incurred tutelage. In his Groundwork of 1785 he gave the moral law as a law of autonomy, the rational will legislates the universal law it obeys. The mature person is an end in himself. The modern state and the liberal tradition absorbed this framework. John Stuart Mill in 1859 clarified liberty as a protected sphere of self-direction, limited by harm to others.

Positivism pressed the secular turn further. Auguste Comte between 1830 and 1842 taught the three stages, theological, metaphysical, positive. He proposed a religion of humanity, complete with calendar and liturgy, with science as pastor. Feuerbach in 1841 argued that God is the projection of human ideals. Marx in the 1840s translated emancipation into economic revolution. Nietzsche in the 1880s mocked humanistic moralities as life-denying, yet kept autonomy, the will to power, as a supreme aesthetic. The twentieth century gave a public face to secular humanism. The Humanist Manifesto of 1933, with John Dewey as a signer, declared a non-theistic faith in human potential. Manifesto II in 1973 reinforced this program with explicit commitments to personal autonomy in sex, reproduction, and education. Sartre in 1946 defended existential humanism, that existence precedes essence, so man makes himself.

Alongside triumphs came critiques. The Frankfurt School, especially Horkheimer and Adorno in 1947, argued that instrumental reason had devoured substantive ends, leaving domination masked as rationality. Jacques Ellul in 1954 portrayed technique as a universal drive toward efficiency that reconfigures institutions and character alike. Michel Foucault in the 1970s traced knowledge and power through modern disciplines, questioning emancipation narratives that code control as liberation. Charles Taylor in 1989 showed how buffered selves arise from moral sources, not simply from reason.

Contemporary expressions include liberal humanism, which centers rights and autonomy under law, and scientific humanism, which trusts evolutionary psychology and neuroscience to anchor ethics. Utilitarian pragmatism, represented by Peter Singer, often decouples human dignity from species membership and ties it to capacities like sentience, thereby redefining humanism. Transhumanism takes the next step, urging upgrades to human capacities through biotechnologies, artificial intelligence, and human enhancement. Its prophets speak of overcoming finitude and death through technique. These are not aberrations but natural fruits of a trajectory that treats the human as raw material for self-authorship.

To steelman the rival positions, we can present three strong claims.

First, the autonomy argument. It contends that dignity is inseparable from self-direction. To respect a person is to respect his capacity to set ends according to his own rational lights. Heteronomy, obedience to an external authority, undermines moral agency, reduces adults to wards, and has historically licensed oppression by church and state. The rule of autonomy yields a principled floor for human rights, since each person, as an end in himself, can claim inviolability. It also provides a basis for toleration in pluralist societies. On this view, only autonomy can reconcile moral seriousness with diversity.

Second, the emancipation argument. It contends that the scientific method and technical progress have freed us from superstition, disease, and scarcity. Child mortality plummeted, life spans rose, education spread, and democratic institutions grew in strength as secularization advanced. This correlation is explained by the power of instrumental reason guided by human-centered ends. Technology is the great solvent of unjust hierarchies. Societies that subordinate inquiry to revelation stagnate, while those that elevate technique prosper. If the aim is human flourishing, then humanism provides the best practical ethic and policy.

Third, the public reason argument. It contends that only secular humanism can provide a common moral currency in a world of many faiths. Appeals to revelation are by nature in-house. A democratic order must be justified by reasons accessible to all. Autonomy rights, the harm principle, and empirical cost-benefit analysis offer that shared platform. Even those with deep religious convictions can privately supply their motives, but public norms and law must speak in the language of human goods and human harms.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
We begin with first principles. The Creator-creature distinction teaches that God alone is absolute and self-existent. Creation is dependent, personal, and ordered. Revelation is self-attesting. God speaks with authority and clarity, in nature and Scripture, and his word carries its own evidence. The noetic effects of sin distort human reasoning, not by erasing rationality, but by bending it away from the truth, as Rom 1 testifies. Analogical reasoning means we know truly but as creatures, not exhaustively as God knows. These axioms are not negotiable endpoints tacked onto an otherwise neutral argument. They are the light by which we see and the ground on which we move.

Four theses follow.

1. Human dignity, rationality, and responsibility are grounded in the image of God, not in autonomous self-legislation. Genesis 1:26-28 and Psalm 8 locate human glory under divine rule. The imago Dei gives equality before we choose, across sex, race, age, and ability. It bestows a vocation to rule and cultivate. Autonomy as the criterion of dignity collapses at the margins where capacity is lacking or diminished. The infant, the disabled adult, and the aged do not lose personhood because they cannot legislate to themselves. The image is the unwavering ground of value. Historically, the most stable claims to universal human rights have leaned on creation in the image of God. Detached from this, autonomy tends to slide into elitism, however humane the intent.

2. True freedom is covenantal, not absolute self-rule. Scripture narrates freedom as being set free to serve God, not freed from all norms. Autonomy taken as ultimacy is idolatry, it claims for the creature the prerogative of the Creator. Rom 1 describes the exchange of the truth of God for a lie, worshiping the creature rather than the Creator. This exchange can be moral, intellectual, or technical. The form may be refined, Kantian self-legislation, or crude, the will to power. In both, the self becomes the measure. The biblical alternative is filial liberty, the glorious freedom of the children of God who receive command as gift and path of life. Only this covenantal pattern protects both authority and conscience, since God alone is Lord of the conscience while he binds us to love of neighbor in concrete practices of justice.

3. Instrumental reason and technique are good servants within the cultural mandate, but they are tyrannous and self-defeating as masters. Genesis mandates cultivation and rule of the earth. Science, engineering, and administrative skill are forms of obedience to that calling. Yet when reason is reduced to technique, ends thin and means metastasize. Ellul helps us see that technique expands by its own internal demand for efficiency and control. Scripture names that momentum as a species of idolatry, the work of human hands that we trust to save. The transcendental claim is this, for the intelligibility of rational inquiry, moral normativity, and personal dignity to hold, there must exist the personal absolute who created a rational order, endowed us with image-bearing capacities, and speaks morally binding law. Without this Creator, reason becomes either a contingent brain-secretion or an instrument of will, and dignity becomes either an arbitrary preference or a revocable social construct.

4. Common grace permits real cooperation and real achievement, but it does not neutralize the antithesis of worship. God restrains sin and bestows gifts across the human family. We can share laboratories, courtrooms, and canvases with neighbors who deny Scripture, and we should. We also must discern the liturgies beneath our practices, the tacit rituals and stories that shape what we love. The church should cultivate patient excellence in the sciences and the arts under Christ, teach members to test the spirits of technique, and train consciences to recognize when a tool is asking to be a master. In law and policy, Christians can frame arguments in terms accessible to neighbors while bearing witness that the source of these goods is the Creator. In art, we can portray human grandeur and frailty without yielding to either cynicism or hagiography.

From these theses flow applications. In education, teach students to love wisdom more than success metrics, to see technique as a craft accountable to thick goods rather than a god. In medicine, distinguish therapy that restores creational givens from enhancement that treats the given as raw material. In politics, defend rights as guardrails for image bearers, not as sacralized autonomy without content. In church life, preach Psalm 8 and Rom 1 together, so congregations learn to praise God for human splendor and to repent of vain self-worship. None of this is a retreat from the world. It is a deeper engagement under the Lordship of Christ.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection 1. The transcendental move begs the question. You declare that God must exist for reason and dignity to make sense, but that is simply a restatement of your faith. Others can claim that reason and dignity are basic features of the world and do not need theological grounding.

Reply. Every account of ultimate grounds is in some sense circular, because ultimate standards cannot be validated by appealing to a higher standard. The question is which circle can account for the preconditions of intelligibility without self-defeat. If reason is a contingent evolutionary adaptation, then its aim is survival, not truth, which undercuts confidence in its normative authority. If dignity is a social construction, then it is hostage to power and fashion. The Christian circle is not a bare assertion. It is the only framework that unites a lawful cosmos, normed moral claims, and personal value under a personal Creator whose self-attesting word provides the ground for trust. This is not a memo from a private world. It is a public claim about what must be the case for our common practices to be coherent.

Objection 2. Secular humanism provides an inclusive moral platform. Autonomy and the harm principle suffice to protect the vulnerable and to adjudicate conflicts. Religious appeals divide. The humanist tradition has delivered rights, welfare, and democratic stability on a scale never seen before.

Reply. Secular humanism has indeed contributed to many just reforms, often by drawing on moral capital it did not mint. Yet autonomy and harm, taken as master principles, do not yield a stable account of who counts and what harms matter. If dignity tracks autonomy, the severely cognitively disabled or the comatose lose standing. If harm is measured only by subjective consent, exploitative structures flourish as long as parties agree. The image of God secures value before capacity and provides thick directives for mutual obligations. Moreover, the humanist settlement is not religiously neutral. It smuggles substantive views of the good under procedural language. Christians can use shared terms where possible, but we should not cede the ground that the Creator makes all of this intelligible.

Objection 3. Religion has historically sanctioned oppression. Theocratic regimes, inquisitions, and churchly censorship testify that heteronomy breeds violence. Emancipation from sacred authority has liberated conscience, inquiry, and minorities.

Reply. Wickedness done in the name of God is real and grievous. Scripture itself condemns hypocritical religion. Yet the secular ledger is not clean. The twentieth century saw mass atrocities by explicitly anti-religious regimes. The problem is not religion as such, but idolatry of power, whether cloaked in altar or laboratory. The covenantal framework generates internal critique, since all human authority is ministerial and accountable to God. The Reformation recovered Scripture against coercive hierarchy. Abolitionists and civil rights leaders drew on the image of God and the Exodus. The answer to abuses is not autonomy without content, it is repentance, reformation, and renewed submission to the Lord who judges injustice.

Objection 4. Technology is neutral. Technique is only a means. Blame lies with users, not with the tools or the drive for efficiency. Critiques of technique romanticize pre-modern life and risk slowing down progress that saves lives.

Reply. Tools do not determine destiny, but neither are they neutral. They carry affordances that tilt practices. A scalpel can heal or harm, but a world organized around constant optimization will tend to redefine persons in terms of performance metrics. Ellul is right to warn that technique becomes a culture, generating its own values. Christians should not romanticize the past. We should weigh goods and risks with sober thanksgiving, asking what a given technology makes of the human and what it makes us become. There is no anti-technology bias here, only a refusal to let any tool claim the status of savior.

Objection 5. Your account cannot function in pluralist public reason. If policy arguments must be grounded in revelation, conversation ends. The only fair basis is a secular one that no one is bound to deny.

Reply. Christians can and should argue in terms neighbors can recognize, appealing to shared goods, natural law, and empirical evidence. We do not insist that lawmakers cite chapter and verse to justify a traffic code or a zoning regulation. Yet we also confess that our confidence in the coherence of these shared goods flows from the Creator. Pluralism is a fact, not a creed. It does not require us to pretend neutrality is possible. We can be transparent about our sources while honoring the common good. This honesty may actually deepen trust, since it discloses motives and invites accountability.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Consider a hospital ethics board in 2026 evaluating protocols for CRISPR-based embryo editing. The proposal distinguishes therapy, correction of a monogenic disease that causes childhood death, from enhancement, selection and augmentation of traits like height, memory, or temperament. The policy team argues that parental autonomy and the reduction of suffering should guide decisions. A biotech partner presents data on safety improvements. A patient advocacy group pleads for access. A disability rights representative warns that the program sends a demeaning message about life with disability.

Here the humanist autonomy frame sounds humane and compelling. Respect parents, prevent harm, let data guide us. Yet the frame quietly assumes that procreation is a project of choice rather than a reception of a gift, that children are products made to specification, and that human goods are fungible and measurable. Technique glows with salvific aura, promising emancipation from the lottery of birth.

A covenantal response reframes the questions, responsibilities, and hopes.

First, it clarifies who the human is. Every embryo who exists is an image bearer with inherent dignity. Dignity does not scale with autonomy, it is given by God. Hence, any research protocol that presupposes the routine destruction of embryos fails the most basic moral test. The dignity metric anchors discussion upstream of consent and downstream of capacity.

Second, it distinguishes therapy from redesign. The cultural mandate authorizes healing as an act of neighbor love. Correcting a lethal mutation in a child before birth can be an instance of faithful stewardship. Enhancement is different. It treats givenness as raw material for will, recoding the child as a project that expresses parental preferences and market fashions. The line is not always simple to draw, but the difference in posture is profound. It is the difference between receiving and making, between covenantal care and self-fashioning.

Third, it interrogates technique. The board should ask not only whether we can do this safely, but also what kind of world the protocol builds. Will insurance pressures and school admissions incentives coerce uptake, covertly transforming a choice into a requirement. Will disability communities be further stigmatized when their existence is framed as an avoidable error. What goods are being optimized, and why. These questions probe the liturgy of technique and expose how a means can become a master.

Fourth, it articulates limits and responsibilities. A covenantal policy would affirm gene therapies that heal without destroying embryos, reject protocols that require embryo discard or germline redesign for enhancement, and set safeguards against coercion and discrimination. It would recommend investment in treatments and supports for those living with disabilities, signaling that their lives are welcomed. It would urge transparency about risks, humility about unknowns, and attention to justice in access.

Fifth, it offers hope beyond technique. Parents facing devastating diagnoses need more than technical options. They need a community that will bear burdens, mourn honestly, and celebrate the fragile gift of life. Pastors and chaplains can remind them that Psalm 8 has not been revoked, that God remembers the least, and that Christ has entered suffering and conquered death. The church can offer respite care, financial aid, and presence. This is not a retreat to pious sentiments. It is a thick form of resistance to the banner that says emancipation is identical with control.

In the boardroom, the Christian member can speak in public terms. She can say that the hospital should not create or destroy lives for research protocols, that justice requires protections for those who cannot consent, that social pressures will distort choice unless we build guardrails, and that we do better to fund therapies that restore rather than redesign. When asked for deeper reasons, she can be frank. We are not our own, we are creatures and image bearers. The glory of human life is real and bounded. Technique is a gift, but it cannot tell us what a person is or what a life is for.

This posture travels beyond the hospital. In courts, it says that rights protect image bearers, not sovereign wills. In schools, it says that education forms persons toward wisdom and virtue, not just employable units. In laboratories, it says that curiosity is good within a moral ecology set by the Creator and clarified by Scripture. In church, it disciples people to recognize idols, whether of state, market, or method, and to reclaim gratitude as the fundamental disposition of the human creature.

The upshot is not a program of cultural retreat but a recovery of the true humanism that Christianity has always taught. Psalm 8 sings of a humanity crowned with glory and honor under God. That is higher and safer than the glory we can steal for ourselves. In the covenant, autonomy is converted into responsibility, technique into stewardship, and emancipation into obedience that is life. The world needs such a people, not to dominate, but to serve, reminding neighbors that there is a more excellent way.
