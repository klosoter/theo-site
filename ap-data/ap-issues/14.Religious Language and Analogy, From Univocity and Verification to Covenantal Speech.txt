### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
The issue is sharp. Can human words meaningfully and truthfully refer to the God who is infinite, transcendent, and holy. Three classic options have long contended. Univocal predication says the same word carries the same meaning when applied to God and to creatures. Equivocal predication says the same word shifts meaning entirely across the Creator and creature divide, so God is beyond our descriptors. Analogical predication claims a middle course, our words are not identical in sense yet not entirely different either, since creaturely perfections participate in or resemble divine perfections in a way ordered by God. On top of this trilemma stands a modern challenge about meaning itself. Logical positivists of the 1920s to 1930s, followed by falsification challengers in the 1950s, argued that the only genuinely meaningful statements are either analytic or empirically verifiable or falsifiable. Later Wittgensteinians shifted the focus from external verification to internal grammar, arguing that religious language functions within a form of life and need not satisfy scientific criteria to be meaningful.

The historical arc winds from ancient philosophy to contemporary analysis. Aristotle, fourth century BC, spoke of being as said in many ways, pros hen homonymy, an early gesture toward analogy. The Christian tradition intensified the issue. Augustine, late fourth to early fifth century, stressed divine incomprehensibility and the need for God to stoop in speech. Pseudo Dionysius, around 500, advanced a robust apophaticism, insisting that God exceeds every name, so negations purify affirmations. Moses Maimonides, circa 1190 in the Guide for the Perplexed, defended a strict negative theology, fearing anthropomorphism. Against this background, Thomas Aquinas, writing the Summa Theologiae around 1265 to 1274, offered the classic account. God names are not univocal, since God is not in a genus, nor equivocal, since that would preclude knowledge. Rather, names like good, wise, or just are predicated of God and creatures analogically, either by attribution, where a property is primarily in God and secondarily in creatures, or by proportionality, where the relation of a perfection to a subject is similar across different orders. Exod 3:14 and Ps 113 ground the claim that God is exalted above the nations and yet condescends to make himself known by names that accommodate us.

John Duns Scotus, around 1300, pressed for univocity of being. He argued that unless being is univocal across God and creatures, the middle term in demonstrative arguments for God would equivocate. Metaphysics would be impossible, and theology could not reason toward God. Scotus did not deny divine transcendence, he introduced a formal distinction and allowed degrees of perfection, yet he insisted that some conceptual content must be the same in God and creatures for syllogisms to work. William of Ockham, early 1300s, deepened nominalist tendencies that pulled apart universals and predication.

The early modern period exacerbated the dynamic. Descartes sought clarity and distinctness, which risked distancing divine attributes from creaturely conceptions. Locke and Hume tied meaning to ideas derived from sensation, and Humean suspicion about causality undercut natural theological inferences. Immanuel Kant in 1781 declared knowledge limited to phenomena, assigning God to the noumenal beyond cognition, though still morally postulated. In theology, Friedrich Schleiermacher in 1799 relocated religion to feeling, which reduced cognitive content.

The twentieth century delivered two seismic shifts. Logical positivists, associated with the Vienna Circle and with A. J. Ayer in Language Truth and Logic, 1936, claimed that talk of God lacks meaning because it is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. Rudolf Carnap in the early 1930s sought to eliminate metaphysics as meaningless. The famous 1950 paper Theology and Falsification by Antony Flew sharpened the challenge. Statements about God appear to die the death of a thousand qualifications, immune to any conceivable falsifying condition, which reduces them to vacuous assertions. R. M. Hare replied with bliks, fundamental ways of seeing the world not subject to falsification but still meaningful. Basil Mitchell replied with the parable of the partisan and the stranger, arguing that faith remains a responsible commitment under pressures and evidence. John Hick added eschatological verification, proposing that some religious claims are verifiable in principle at the end.

The second shift came through Ludwig Wittgenstein. Early Wittgenstein had resonances with verification, but late Wittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations, 1953, portrayed meaning as use within language games, embedded in forms of life. On this view, religious language operates with its own criteria. To grasp its sense is to be initiated into its practices, not to submit its sentences to external tests. D. Z. Phillips and Norman Malcolm explored this path, with Phillips treating religion as a unique grammar. Additional mid century voices recast religious talk as performative or moral. I. T. Ramsey spoke of models and qualified models that stretch language through disclosure. R. B. Braithwaite in 1945 framed religious utterances as declarations of moral policy.

Catholic theology reengaged analogy. Erich Przywara published Analogia Entis in 1932, arguing for an ever greater dissimilarity within a real similarity between Creator and creature. Karl Barth reacted sharply. In 1931 he called the analogia entis the invention of antichrist, insisting that only analogia fidei, likeness in faith grounded in revelation, can authorize God talk. Church Dogmatics begun in 1932 pressed this. The net effect was a deep contest between a revitalized natural analogy and a revelation only approach. Later Catholic figures like Karl Rahner forged a transcendental path, blending Kantian categories with Thomistic metaphysics, while Protestants like Eberhard Jüngel emphasized the grammar of God as revealed in the name and event.

Contemporary analytic philosophy of religion reexamined religious language apart from positivist strictures. Richard Swinburne from 1977 onward defended the meaningfulness and rationality of theism through probabilistic confirmation. William Alston in 1991 defended the epistemic status of religious experience and explored divine discourse. Nicholas Wolterstorff and others employed speech act theory to explain Scripture as divine discourse. Analytic Thomists revived discussion of analogy, precision of proportionality versus attribution, and whether univocity is needed for metaphysical rigor. Throughout, the Creator and creature distinction has remained the theological pressure point.

To steelman the rivals, begin with univocity. The Scotist argues that without univocal terms across God and creatures, any inference from effects to cause collapses due to equivocation. If being signifies something entirely different when said of God and creatures, the middle term in arguments like the cosmological argument could never bridge the gap. Moreover, revelation itself uses creaturely language. If the senses of words diverge utterly, Scripture would be unintelligible. Therefore a minimal univocity of core concepts like being or goodness is rationally necessary.

Second, the verificationist and falsificationist challenge reprises a strict criterion of meaning. Ayer argues that cognitive content requires either tautology or empirical verifiability in principle. Claims about an invisible, undetectable, necessary being fail empirical criteria. Flew presses the supposition that genuine assertion must rule out something or be open to falsification. If a believer refuses to specify any possible state of affairs that would count against affirming God is love or God is creator, then such sentences are not genuine assertions. Hence they are meaningless or at least empty.

Third, the Wittgensteinian claims that meaning is use within a community. Demands that theology pass scientific or positivist tests misunderstand language. Religious speech does many things, blessing, confessing, lamenting, repenting, promising, and its sense is internal to those practices. There is no neutral meta language that legislates meaning across games. Attempts to subordinate religious grammar to scientific grammar are acts of cultural imperialism. What matters is whether the rules of the game are coherent and life giving within the form of life that sustains them.

Finally, the analogia entis offers a metaphysical ground for meaningful predication. There is a real similarity between creator and creature, instituted by God. Romans 1 affirms a knowledge of God from creation. Aquinas stresses that God is the cause and exemplar of perfections. Hence our words, suitably elevated and purified, can truly predicate divine perfections. This analogical relation is not invented by humans. It is ontological, rooted in participation. The analogia fidei, by contrast, warns that any claim to read God directly from creation risks baptizing an idol. The Word of God, made flesh and attested in Scripture, must control language.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
First principles orient the response. The Creator and creature distinction is absolute. God is self existent and triune, the fullness of being and life. Creatures depend on God at every moment. Because God freely creates, speaks, and upholds the world, there is both a radical transcendence and a real relation. Revelation is self attesting. God names himself and interprets his works. The knowledge of God from creation is clear, Rom 1:20, yet suppressed in unrighteousness. The noetic effects of sin bend human reasoning and language toward idolatry or skepticism. Human knowledge of God is analogical because God is archetype and we are ectypes. Our concepts are true as far as they go, yet never exhaustive, Rom 11:33-36. The divine names and acts authorize our speech, Exod 3:14 and Ps 113.

Thesis 1. Scripture provides the authoritative grammar of God talk, which then governs all other uses of religious language, and this grammar is analogical. When God reveals his name in Exod 3:14, he gives a boundary and a bridge. His name declares self existence and faithfulness, and it anchors all subsequent predicates. The Psalms ascribe perfections and deny creaturely limitations, God is high above yet looks far down, Ps 113. Paul sings that God is unsearchable and yet the source, Rom 11:33-36. This is analogical grammar. It affirms, denies, and supereminentizes. It asserts that words like wisdom, goodness, and justice apply truly to God and to creatures, yet they apply first of all to God and by participation to creatures. The order is covenantal and revelational, not merely metaphysical. It arises from God electing to be our God and to make himself known in covenant history culminating in Christ.

Thesis 2. Human predication about God depends on the Creator ordained fit between world and word, which is secured by divine authorship of both reality and revelation. Analogy is not a human compromise invented to rescue language. It is grounded in creation and providence. God created persons in his image with faculties fit for speech and truth. He structured the world as an ordered cosmos that manifests his invisible attributes, Rom 1:20. He inspired prophets and apostles to speak his words, and he condescended to use creaturely signs for divine things. The analogical fit is covenantal, God stoops to accommodate. It is also cosmic, world order reflects divine wisdom. Therefore, meaningful God talk does not depend on an abstract univocity of being. It depends on the personal Lord who creates and speaks. His names norm our predication. When we say God is good, we intend the perfection as it is archetypally in God and ectypally in creatures. The same word names related but ordered realities.

Thesis 3. The intelligibility of predication, religious or otherwise, presupposes a triune God whose unity and plurality ground both sameness and difference in language and world. Here is the transcendental necessity claim in one line. For there to be meaningful predication rather than either equivocal noise or total identity, reality must exhibit both unity and diversity. Human language must be norm governed and directed toward a reality that is both lawful and richly differentiated. On the Christian view, the triune God is the ultimate source of unity and plurality. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God and three persons. Created orders reflect this, stable kinds and individual instances, universal terms and particular referents. The logic of predication and the capacity of words to reach realities are not brute facts. They are gifts of the God whose eternal Word is the archetype of meaning. Remove this foundation and either univocity flattens God into a creature or equivocity evacuates speech of reference.

Thesis 4. Verificationist and Wittgensteinian demands mislocate the normativity of meaning because they deny or ignore the revelational givenness of reality, though they can be partially redeemed when subordinated to Scripture. Verificationism at its strongest teaches theology a salutary lesson. Do not hide vacuity behind piety. Indicate what in the world would count for or against your claims. Yet the verification principle is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable, so it undercuts itself. More deeply, it mistakes the kind of access we have to God. God is Lord. He is not an object on a lab bench. He gives himself to be known by his works and words, and he disciplines inquiry through covenantal history. Wittgensteinian insights rightly remind us that religious language is lived. Yet a closed language game strategy risks relativism. The God of Scripture addresses all peoples and all times, which means his speech cuts across games and reforms them. Therefore, Christians can receive pragmatic and grammatical insights while denying any attempt to seal off theology from public reason or to bind it to a narrow empiricism.

Thesis 5. The covenantal analogical account strengthens the practice of the church and clarifies the public good. In the church, preaching and prayer draw confidence from divine self naming. We address God with reverence and intimacy because he has drawn near in Christ while remaining the high and lifted one. Conscience is steadied by clear predicates that are not hostage to cultural shifts, God is just, true, and merciful, and these words carry covenantal weight. Science is encouraged because the world is intelligible, God is faithful, and our language can genuinely refer to features of reality. Law and art benefit because the moral order and the symbolic order are grounded in a truthful God. A community shaped by analogical realism resists both idolatry and nihilism.

Covenantally, the Creator and creature distinction rules out univocity as a controlling norm for theology. God is not a member of a genus, so creaturely predicates are first and foremost names of the Creator in a unique mode. Yet the same distinction disqualifies equivocity as a default. The Creator does not leave his image bearers in the dark. He reveals his name, he orders creation to mirror his perfections, and he renews minds by the Spirit. The analogical way is not the midpoint of a spectrum. It is the properly theological way, a mode of truth telling before the Lord who names himself and names us.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection 1. The verificationist insists that without clear conditions of possible falsification, God talk is empty. Unless you can specify what state of affairs would count against your assertions, you have not made assertions at all.

Reply. First, the strong verification criterion fails its own test. It is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable, hence meaningless on its own terms. Second, religious claims bear on the world in ways that allow indirect confirmation and disconfirmation. The coherence and explanatory power of a theistic worldview, the fit between divine predicates and moral experience, the typological convergence of covenant history, these are public features that weigh for or against theism. Third, because God is Lord rather than an item among items, the relation between divine claims and empirical states is not one to one but covenantally mediated. A resurrection in history or the transformation of a people may serve as cumulative evidence that disciplines language. Fourth, believers can specify defeaters, for example, if the Christian God were shown to be self contradictory or to license evil as evil, that would count strongly against the claim that this God is good. We do not need a lab test. We need responsible epistemology that respects the kind of reality at issue.

Objection 2. The Wittgensteinian counters that you are smuggling in a privileged metalanguage. Your transcendental appeal to the triune God is just the grammar of your faith, not a neutral necessity. Other forms of life have their own games. There is no standing court of appeal.

Reply. All reasoning operates with ultimate commitments that are in some sense circular. The question is not circularity versus no circularity. It is whether the circle is vicious or virtuous. A virtuous circle names and accounts for the very conditions of discourse and inquiry. The Christian claim is not that we own a private grammar. It is that the God who created all and addresses all provides the preconditions for any speech act to be intelligible. This is a public claim, tested in contact with the shared world. Moreover, language games are not hermetic. They overlap and interact. Liturgical language speaks about bodies, time, bread, kings, and courts. Scientific language borrows moral predicates such as responsible or honest. The gospel grammar reforms every game by calling all to truth and love in Christ. That is not imperial fiat. It is the Word of the Lord who has rights as Creator.

Objection 3. The Scotist urges that your analogy risks vacuity. Without univocal content for being or goodness, you cannot guarantee that the predicate is the same across God and creatures. Every analogy presupposes some univocal core.

Reply. The analogy we defend is ordered to God as archetype. It is not a faceless middle. The divine names given in revelation secure the reference and sense. God tells us what goodness means in him, not by submitting to a genus of goodness, but by owning the perfection as his own life. Creatures truly possess goodness by participation and gift. The continuity rests on divine agency, not on a neutral concept. Logic still operates. We can reason from effects to cause because the causal relation itself is authored by God and because creatures are created to be signs. The need for a univocal core is a need imported from a scholastic theory of demonstration that presupposes a neutral ontology. But there is another way. The living God guarantees cross order predication by creating and interpreting the world. That alternative is not a slide to equivocity. It is a theistic metaphysics.

Objection 4. The Barthian warns that any appeal to creation in order to authorize God talk will become a natural theology that bypasses Christ. That is, you will baptize an idol.

Reply. The warning is critical. Romans 1 shows that fallen humans suppress the truth from creation. The answer is not to deny that creation speaks. The answer is to insist that natural knowledge is covenantally embedded. Creation knowledge is never a neutral platform. It is either faith or unbelief in action. Christ is Lord of creation. He is the Word through whom all was made. Therefore, creation, covenant, and Christ are not rivals. They are one economy. We refuse a natural theology that stands apart from the gospel. We affirm a natural revelation that is interpreted and healed by Scripture and Spirit. This leaves no space for idols and no excuse for silence.

Objection 5. The transcendental move is speculative and overreaching. You claim that predication requires a triune God. But polytheists and atheists make predications all the time. The practice works without your postulate.

Reply. The claim is not that people cannot speak without consciously invoking the Trinity. The claim is that the practice presupposes conditions that are best satisfied by the triune God. Unity and plurality, normativity of logic, trust in the fit between language and world, the moral obligation to tell the truth, these are not random. On atheism, they are either brute or emergent concessions with no ultimate authority. On polytheism, competing powers undermine rational trust. Only the Lord who is one and three, personal and wise, provides a stable source for the universals and particulars that predication requires. This is not a bare possibility argument. It is an accounting of the preconditions of the very debate we are having. The atheist or polytheist can use predication. That is granted. The question is what worldview makes sense of the use.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Setting, a secular university auditorium in late October. A student philosophical society hosts a forum on God and language. The panel includes an atheist shaped by Ayer and Flew, a religious studies professor influenced by Wittgenstein and D. Z. Phillips, and a Christian apologist operating from a covenantal frame. The moderator asks the first question. Is God talk meaningful, and if so, how do you know.

The verificationist student goes first. He says that propositions are meaningful only if testable. He asks the Christian to name a conceivable observation that would count against the statement God loves us. He concludes that because none can be given, the sentence is non factual. The professor then offers a different tack. Meaning lies in use. Religious utterances function like rules and commitments within the form of life. To ask for external verification is to misunderstand grammar.

The Christian reframes at the outset. He thanks both interlocutors for their demands. Verification warns against vacuity. Wittgenstein warns against uprooting language from life. He then clarifies his own first principles. God is Creator and Lord. He made the world and our mouths. He names himself in Scripture and interprets his works. Our talk about God is analogical, true yet never total. It is disciplined by the names and acts God gives. He invokes Exod 3:14, God names himself, and Rom 1, God reveals himself in creation, and Rom 11, God is both knowable and unfathomable.

He then responds to the verification challenge concretely. He names empirical and moral entailments of his claims. If the world were wholly chaotic and unintelligible, theism as classically confessed would be in deep trouble. If history yielded no covenantal pattern, no people transformed by the Lord, Christian claims would be hollow. If Christ was not raised, our preaching would be vain. He points to the public character of resurrection testimony and the church as a living epistle. He admits that God is not a lab object but insists that evidence in human life and history is real evidence.

To the Wittgensteinian, he affirms the significance of practice. Faith speaks in praise and confession. Yet he refuses the insulation of a closed game. The God of Israel and of Jesus addresses nations. His word judges all games. Grammar is accountable to reality because words are meant to tell the truth. The professor presses. Are you not privileging your grammar. The Christian answers. Everyone privileges some grammar. I claim that the God who speaks and creates has the right to set the terms for all. That is not authoritarianism. It is worship, and it is also rational, since it grounds the very possibility of meaningful talk.

The moderator invites final statements. The Christian offers a brief transcendental summary. For words to latch onto the world, and for differences not to devolve into unintelligibility, reality must be at once unified and richly plural, ordered and personal. A world that is the creation of the triune God fits this. A world of impersonal flux or competing gods does not. He then invites the audience to test the grammar by inhabiting it, read Scripture, join a worshiping community, observe how the name of the Lord reshapes speech, conscience, and hope.

For pastoral practice, the scenario turns to a small group afterward. A student raised in a church confesses that she is afraid to speak of God at all. She worries about saying something false. The verificationist sneer and the language game retreat have shaken her. The covenantal response reassures her. You are not asked to construct a ladder to God. God has stooped to you. He has given names that are safe if you use them with fear and joy. Say what Scripture says. God is merciful. God is holy. God is faithful. These predicates are true and life giving because they rest on God naming himself and acting in history. You can add that all our knowledge remains creaturely and so humble. We do not own God with words. We serve God with words. The pastoral counsel also addresses conscience. You need not master philosophical criteria before you pray. Prayer is the place where God trains your tongue. And because God made the world, your words about him are not nonsense. They can be tested in the life of the church, in forgiveness received, in a community learning to love enemies, in the courage to study chemistry or law because creation is intelligible under Providence.

Finally, the campus forum points to public responsibility. Christians should avoid two equal and opposite errors. One is to surrender to verificationism and treat the holy God as a lab item. The other is to retreat into a game and cease to bear witness. The covenantal path speaks with confidence and humility. It welcomes questions and evidence. It insists that religion is not a cloistered dialect but a way of life under a Lord who speaks in the open. It honors the Creator and creature distinction by refusing to force univocity and by rejecting the despair of equivocity. It honors God by insisting that his revelation is the rule and that his mercy covers our speech. This path equips students to speak wisely on campus. It equips pastors to preach the names of God. It equips artists to craft symbols that refract divine beauty rather than flatten it. It equips citizens to insist that truth can be spoken in public without being trivialized to what we can hold under a microscope.

The forum closes. The student who had demanded verification admits that his criterion is not itself verifiable. The professor admits that some games must answer to reality. The Christian admits that believers sometimes make empty claims and need discipline by Scripture and by life. The conversation continues. The covenantal hope is that in all such exchanges the Lord who speaks will gather hearers and purify their tongues. Rom 11:36 is a fitting guide. From him and through him and to him are all things. That is true of our words as well.
