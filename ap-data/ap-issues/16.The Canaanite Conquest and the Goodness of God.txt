### TITLE
The Canaanite Conquest and the Goodness of God

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Locus and sub-issues: divine justice in Canaan, the ban as covenant lawsuit, holy war as theocratic and typological, hermeneutics of conquest text, divine command and moral order.
- Rival approaches: secular moral realism that condemns the text as genocidal, Christian revisionism that denies God commanded it, analytic divine command defenses with and without hyperbole, critical non-historical readings that deflate the event.
- Principal figures: Augustine the just war theologian, Cornelius Van Til the presuppositional apologist, Meredith Kline the intrusion ethic exegete, Paul Copan the analytic apologist.
- Method tension: whether the question is adjudicated by neutral evidence and common moral intuitions or by presupposed special revelation and covenantal categories.
- Thesis: The conquest was a limited theocratic judgment and typological intrusion of the last day, morally grounded in God’s holy character and covenant lawsuit, non-repeatable, and intelligible only within the self-attesting revelation of Scripture.
- Pastoral angle: guiding a student in a campus forum through horror, justice, and hope such that conscience is honored, Christ is central, and modern violence is renounced.

### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
The Canaanite conquest presses into a single urgent moral question. If God is good, how can he command Israel to put populations under the ban in Joshua 6 through 12. The sub-issues are tightly linked. Is this a case of divine command and therefore morally right by definition, or is there an independent moral order that would indict such commands. Is the language of total destruction literal or conventional hyperbole. Is Israel an agent of divine justice in a unique theocracy, or a tribal power cloaking aggression in religion. Is the narrative historical, or a later theological construction.

Several robust formulations dominate the debate. The genocide charge insists that Joshua’s ban meets modern definitions of genocide as the intentional destruction of an ethnic or national group. The divine command dilemma asks whether the goodness of an action is because God commands it, or whether God commands it because it is good. The theocratic-typological thesis claims the conquest is a once-for-all covenant lawsuit, not a template for ongoing warfare. The hyperbole claim argues that ancient Near Eastern war reports regularly used totalizing idioms, so the text describes decisive victory rather than literal extermination.

Historically, Jewish readers framed the conquest as God’s judgment. Philo in the first century allegorized warfare as moral struggle. Josephus in the first century emphasized divine justice and Israel’s obedience. Early Christians saw a typology of sin’s destruction. Augustine wrote City of God from 413 to 426 and argued that only God can authorize war that kills without murder, since God is the giver and taker of life. Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologiae 1265 to 1274 included obedience to divine law within just war reflection. Calvin in the Institutes 1559 stressed God’s righteous judgment and Israel’s unique vocation, warning against private imitation. Post Reformation pacifists in the 1500s rejected holy war as non-Christian. Enlightenment critics like Voltaire in 1763 ridiculed the Hebrew God as tribal and cruel. Kant in the Groundwork 1785 grounded ethics in autonomy and universalizability, thereby casting doubt on heteronomous command morality. Danish existentialist Kierkegaard in Fear and Trembling 1843 highlighted Abraham’s binding of Isaac, often misread as endorsing faith beyond ethics, though his target was different.

Modern critical scholarship often treats Joshua as Deuteronomistic history composed after 600 BC. Julius Wellhausen in 1878 construed the narratives ideologically rather than strictly historically. After 1945, with genocide a searing modern category, many readers saw the ban as morally intolerable. At the same time, archaeological and comparative studies nuanced the question. Lawson Younger in the 1990s clarified ancient war rhetoric. Nicholas Wolterstorff in 2010 considered divine command and justice. Robert Adams from 1979 to 1999 articulated a modified divine command theory that grounds obligation in a loving God’s commands. William Alston in 1990 defended divine command metaethics. Paul Copan in 2011 and with Matthew Flannagan in 2014 argued for hyperbole and for the moral intelligibility of the conquest as limited judgment. Within Reformed circles, Meredith Kline in 1972 and 2000 developed the intrusion ethic. Cornelius Van Til 1895 to 1987 and Greg Bahnsen 1996 shaped a presuppositional method that insists the moral question can only be adjudicated within the covenantal framework God himself reveals.

To steelman the strongest rival arguments, begin with the secular moral realist. The argument runs as follows. First, genocide is a grave moral evil. Second, Joshua commands acts that meet genocide criteria, such as targeting an ethnic population for destruction. Third, a perfectly good God would not command genocide. Therefore, either the biblical God does not exist, or these commands were not truly from a perfectly good God. The secular realist adds that moral knowledge of genocide’s wrongness is secure without theism, since harm-based principles, rights, and flourishing provide adequate grounding. The realist also notes that the loyal love championed by Jesus would never permit such killing.

A second rival, the Christian revisionist, accepts Christian theism but denies that God commanded the ban as described. She may say the text preserves Israel’s sincere but mistaken attribution of divine will to their own violence. She invokes progressive revelation. The fullest disclosure of God in Jesus reveals an ethic of enemy love that corrects Israel’s understanding. Therefore, the conquest texts are morally mistaken within Scripture, though God accommodated them for a time.

A third rival, the evidential skeptic, says even if God might in principle authorize unique holy war, humans have no reliable means to know such authorization occurred. The evidential burden for killing at God’s command is impossibly high. Ancient texts and prophetic claims are too fragile to ground such an extreme permission. Therefore, either the Israelites acted immorally, or we cannot form a justified belief that this was good.

These critiques must be taken at their strongest because the moral weight is real. The Hebrew word herem denotes devotion to destruction, and the narratives include killing of noncombatants in Jericho, Josh 6, and Ai, Josh 8. The skeptic regards appeals to hyperbole as motivated. The revisionist insists that Jesus in Luke 6 calls us to love enemies, so any text that does not align must be subordinated. The realist appeals to near-universal human revulsion at massacre to underwrite the charge.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
First principles orient the path. The Creator-creature distinction means God is the absolute personal standard of goodness, and his will is the norm for rational creatures. Revelation is self-attesting, since God as ultimate authority can appeal to no higher court. The noetic effects of sin corrupt our moral reasoning, not by destroying conscience but by twisting its judgments against God’s testimony, Rom 1. Human reasoning is analogical, not univocal with God’s knowing. We think God’s thoughts after him in creaturely measure.

From these principles, five theses respond to the issue.

1. The conquest is a judicial act of the holy Creator who owns life and judges nations in history. Genesis 15:16 sets the timeline. The iniquity of the Amorites was not yet complete, implying patience spanning centuries. Deuteronomy 9:4 to 5 declares that Israel’s possession is not due to their righteousness but to Canaanite wickedness and to God’s oath to the patriarchs. Deuteronomy 20 distinguishes near enemies under the ban from distant cities approached with terms of peace. Joshua’s war is not ethnic cleansing, since the criterion is covenantal apostasy and moral corruption, not bloodline. The Judge of all the earth does what is right, Gen 18. He takes and gives life as Lord. Israel is the plaintiff and bailiff in a covenant lawsuit whose charges were long stated and whose warnings multiplied through prophets and natural signs.

2. Holy war under Joshua is a theocratic and typological intrusion of the last judgment into history, not a norm for national policy. God’s presence is manifest, the ark marches, waters stand up, walls fall at a word, Josh 3 to 6. This is not a general wartime economy but a redemptive-historical moment that prefigures Christ’s victory. The intrusion ethic clarifies why acts just at the eschaton can be temporarily intruded into history. The ban anticipates the final destruction of evil in Revelation, yet it is restricted to a particular epoch and assignment. Hebrews 3 to 4 reads Joshua in the key of rest that is further fulfilled in Christ. With the end of the old theocracy, the sword is sheathed. The church does not wield the sword for faith but bears witness and suffers. The Great Commission sends missionaries, not armies. This guards against any repetition.

3. The ban’s function is covenant quarantine against idolatry, with primary focus on dismantling cultic infrastructure, and the narrative uses conventional war idiom. Deuteronomy 7 commands the destruction of altars, pillars, and Asherim. The goal is to purge abominations that enslave and devour the vulnerable. The standard phrase left no survivor is a stock expression in ancient war reports that signals decisive victory. Evidence within Scripture shows survival, assimilation, and subjugation of many Canaanites, Judges 1. Rahab and her household are spared through faith, Josh 6. The Gibeonites are spared through treaty, Josh 9, though deceitfully obtained. The language of totality is real rhetoric serving a real judgment, yet it does not entail a literal demographic wipeout.

4. Divine command morality is neither arbitrary nor measured by an authority above God, since moral order rests in God’s character and flows through his revealed will. God commands what accords with his goodness, not because of a standard independent of him, nor because of bare will severed from wisdom. The fittingness between holiness and judgment secures the moral propriety of the ban as unique judgment. God does not seize private satisfaction but upholds creaturely good against corrupting worship. The cruciform balance of justice and mercy is shown when the Judge who commands death also gives life and pardon to repentant outsiders like Rahab, and later to Nineveh, Jonah 3. The Son bears curse for his enemies, Gal 3, and so discloses the deepest harmony of justice and love.

5. Epistemic restraint and canonical control fence the application. Only publicly attested prophets within the canonical history can deliver such commands. Joshua’s authority is endorsed by signs and the Mosaic commission, Josh 1 to 4. The canon is closed. The church is explicitly forbidden from wrathful force to advance the kingdom. Civil magistrates bear the sword for public justice, not holy war. This constraint addresses the skeptic’s fear of copycat zealots. The text itself blocks repetition. The church’s warfare is spiritual, 2 Cor 10, and its weapons are word, sacrament, prayer, and sacrificial love.

One-line transcendental necessity claim: For moral condemnation to be objective, universal, and binding as more than preference or herd instinct, there must be a personal absolute whose good character is the standard and whose revelation makes that standard known.

These theses connect doctrine to practice. They affirm the legitimacy of civil law restraining evil while forbidding the church from violent mission. They guard science from sacralizing power by demythologizing conquest as non-repeatable. They inform conscience by joining horror at cruelty with assent to divine justice. They strengthen art by allowing lament for judgment and hope after ruin.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection 1. Genocide is always wrong, and the Joshua narratives portray genocide. The defense that this is judgment is special pleading. Killing noncombatants, including children, is never right.

Reply. The term genocide misleads because it marks targeting an ethnic group as such. The criterion in Joshua is not ethnicity but covenantal wickedness and remedial justice. Deuteronomy 9 denies ethnic superiority. The narratives also show assimilation of repentant Gentiles. The ban is punitive and protective, not racial. On noncombatants, several points converge. First, God as the Lord of life may justly recall life in judgment, and human agents may be commissioned for that unique work when God publicly reveals his will. Second, the language of total destruction employs conventional hyperbole, as shown by surviving populations documented within the canon. Third, mercy is built into the program, as in Rahab’s rescue on the basis of faith, and the Gibeonite treaty that, though flawed, is honored. Fourth, the aim is to halt a culture whose practices included ritualized sexual exploitation and child sacrifice, an aim that moderns affirm in concept when they call for just intervention to stop atrocity. The moral core is the protection of the image of God against idolatrous systems that devour it.

Objection 2. Divine command theories render morality arbitrary, since if God commands X, X becomes good simply by fiat. If God can command the ban, he could command cruelty. A higher moral standard must exist to evaluate divine commands, which defeats the appeal.

Reply. The covenantal answer rejects bare voluntarism. God’s commands express his unchanging character. God cannot deny himself. He cannot command cruelty as cruelty, since cruelty is a privation opposed to his goodness. His justice includes measured recompense, patience, and the pursuit of shalom. The ban is not cruelty but judicial recompense at a typologically unique moment. Appeals to a higher standard collapse into positing an impersonal moral form or platonic Good that outranks God, which undercuts theism and leaves normativity grounded in abstractions that command no one. Within the Christian frame, goodness is personal, triune, and communicative. Commands are not arbitrary but wise enactments of that goodness.

Objection 3. Even if God might have authority, we cannot know with sufficient certainty that he commanded the conquest. Ancient texts and prophetic claims fall far short of what would be needed to justify killing.

Reply. That concern is appropriate for present-day actions, and the covenantal approach agrees. The canon itself closes the door on fresh private or national claims to holy war. The historical case for Joshua’s unique commission includes public miracles, corporate covenant ratification, and intergenerational testimony within Israel, culminating in Scripture as a divine product. The church does not seek to replicate such authorization. Today, any claim to violence in God’s name should be rejected as contrary to the new covenant pattern. The skeptic’s epistemic challenge therefore warns against misuse but does not impugn the original command, which stands within an authenticated revelatory epoch.

Objection 4. The transcendental move fails. A secular moral realist can affirm that genocidal violence is wrong without God by positing robust moral facts, such as facts about well-being, rights, or flourishing. These facts can be known by rational reflection and empathy.

Reply. Secular moral realism can state moral truths, but it labors to explain their ontological location, their authority over persons, their motivational force, and our knowledge of them, especially given evolutionary accounts of conscience that aim at survival rather than truth. Positing non-natural moral facts that supervene on natural facts gives us properties, not a lawgiver who speaks bindingly. The covenantal claim is not that unbelievers lack moral knowledge. Romans 2 affirms conscience. The claim is that the deep coherence of moral objectivity presupposes a personal absolute. Duties are owed to persons. The universality and inescapability of moral claim sit most naturally under a law that issues from the Creator whose image we bear, whose world we inhabit, and whose revelation clarifies hard cases.

Objection 5. The conquest deforms Israel, habituating them to violence that later erupts in atrocities. The moral pedagogy fails.

Reply. The Torah embeds tight constraints that oppose exactly this drift. Deuteronomy 20 differentiates siege protocols for distant cities, allows trees to be spared, and embeds humanitarian protections. The prophets repeatedly condemn violent oppression, including Israel’s mistreatment of neighbors. Israel itself is judged when it imitates Canaanite abominations. The conquest is a circumscribed episode that is as much a warning to Israel as it is a judgment on Canaan. The pedagogy aims at holiness and compassion, not militarism. Post-exilic literature shows the turn away from conquest toward waiting for God.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Consider a campus forum in 2025. A student group invites a Christian philosopher and a secular ethicist to discuss God and violence. A student named Mira speaks during Q and A. She is the child of refugees from a war zone and is haunted by images of razed cities. She has started to read the Bible and became stuck at Joshua 6. She says with a trembling voice, How can I trust a God who commands this.

A covenantal response begins by honoring the conscience, not by numbing it. You say, Your horror at cruelty is good. It is a witness that you bear God’s image. Then you reframe the story biblically as a covenant lawsuit. You explain Genesis 15:16, that God waited centuries in patience. You add Deuteronomy 9, that Israel was not chosen because they were better. You emphasize the theocratic uniqueness, the ark, the miracles, and the non-repeatability of holy war in the new covenant. The church follows a crucified king who forbids us to advance his kingdom by force. You talk about Rahab, an outsider whose family was spared by faith. You show that the text itself highlights the destruction of idolatrous shrines as the focal point, and that Joshua is not a license for later crusades or for any private zealotry. You draw a clear line from Joshua’s ban to Christ’s cross. In the ban, the curse falls on a wicked culture as a sign of the last day. At the cross, the curse falls on the sinless one so that enemies can become friends. That is how judgment and mercy kiss.

Mira asks about the children. You say, This is the hardest point. God does not delight in death. The Lord takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, Ezekiel says. Yet there is a holy severity in history that signals a reality we all must face. The God who gives life may recall it. He is not cruel. He preserved families in the flood and in Nineveh’s repentance. He folded Rahab into the Messiah’s line. You point to Jesus gathering children in his arms. You do not pretend to solve the emotional pain. You invite her to see the cross as the decisive revelation of God’s goodness, where the judge bears our judgment. You assure her that modern claims of divine violence have no warrant and must be rejected. The pattern for the church is patient witness, generous service, and love of enemies.

The forum then turns to policy. Someone asks whether this reading fuels violence today. You answer that the very texts rein in the danger. Deuteronomy 20's protocols are tied to a specific covenant land grant, and the New Testament redirects the mission. Christians must be the first to denounce religious violence and to protect neighbors of all faiths. Just war thought remains, but it belongs to civil ethics, not to mission. The church must disciple consciences so that the zeal stirred by Joshua is a zeal against idolatry in the self, not against flesh and blood. Pastors should teach the story as part of the Bible’s whole plot. The fall shows the depth of evil. The flood and Babel show judgment and scattering. The Exodus shows redemption from bondage. The conquest shows God planting a holy people in a land as a beachhead for blessing the nations, Gen 12. The exile shows judgment on Israel for covenant breach. The cross and resurrection reveal the true Joshua who conquers sin and death, Heb 3 to 4. The final judgment will be public and just, not tribal or rash.

In the hallway after the forum, you invite Mira to read the Sermon on the Mount together and then to return to Joshua with the whole story in view. You suggest starting with Deuteronomy 7 and 9, noting the emphasis on destroying idolatrous artifacts. You encourage her to name specific horrors she has seen, not to wall them off, and to bring them before the God who hates evil more than we do. You remind her that moral revulsion alone cannot heal the world. Only a final judgment and a final act of mercy can. The conquest hints at one, the cross enacts the other, and the resurrection guarantees both.

Practically, this approach reframes responsibilities. Scholars must handle ancient rhetoric carefully, not using hyperbole to erase hard truth nor using hard truth to erase textual nuance. Teachers must insist on canonical control, so Joshua is read in light of Deuteronomy and Hebrews, and in light of Christ. Pastors must train people to hold two things together without cynicism. First, God is good and his judgments are true and righteous. Second, the path of the church is the path of the Lamb who was slain. In counseling rooms, this means helping trauma survivors set boundaries between divine justice and human cruelty, and between non-repeatable holy war and modern atrocity. The justice you long for, you tell them, will come in a way that does not make you into the thing you hate. The hope you need is secured by one who bore wrath so that mercy could triumph.

In a classroom, the transcendental note can be sounded gently. When students say genocide is wrong, do not crush their conviction. Help them ask why their judgment feels universal, obligatory, and not up for bargaining. Ask what sort of reality must exist for moral law to be more than cultural taste. Then ask them to consider the God who reveals himself in history, who speaks law and gospel, who refines a people through judgment and mercy, and who vindicates his Word by raising Jesus from the dead. Invite them to a vision where the hard edges of Joshua are neither flattened nor imitated, but are folded into a story that culminates at the cross and in the new creation. In that story, the goodness of God is not an abstraction but a person, and the justice of God is not a slogan but a revolution that begins in the heart.
