### PREVIEW NOTES
- Locus and sub-issues: nature of miracle, violation versus sign, probability and testimony, demythologizing and historical criticism, science and uniformity, miracles as covenant authentication.
- Rival approaches: Humean improbability thesis, rationalist impossibility, demythologizing hermeneutic, Bayesian evidentialism without theological framing.
- Principal figures: David Hume skeptic of testimony and uniformity, B. B. Warfield sign-focused cessationist, John Earman analytic critic of Hume, William Lane Craig evidentialist for the resurrection.

### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
The issue is sharp. Are miracles possible, credible, and theologically central, and how do they relate to revelation. Three pressure points appear. First, ontology and laws of nature, what a miracle is and whether the universe admits exceptions. Second, epistemology, how testimony and probability interact, whether we ever have enough warrant to believe that a miracle occurred. Third, hermeneutics, how miracle reports function in Scripture and whether they intend historical claims or existential symbols. Allied issues include scientific method, religious pluralism, and the role of signs in covenant history.

On definitions, a long tradition has spoken of miracles as violations of laws of nature. That wording appears in Hume 1748 and in later analytic discussions. Others, including Augustine earlier and many Reformed theologians after Calvin 1559, prefer to speak of miracles as unusual works of providence where God who ordains the regularities also performs a special act to a revealed end. Warfield 1918 described New Testament miracles as signs and wonders that authenticate a revelatory commission, concentrated in redemptive epochs. Contemporary philosophers distinguish between interventionist models and non-violation models that treat laws as ceteris paribus generalizations.

Historically, the arc runs from ancient pagan skepticism to early modern rationalism to analytic reconstructions. In the seventeenth century, Spinoza 1670 argued that miracles are impossible because the order of nature is identical with the decree of God, so any apparent exception is a misinterpretation of nature. Hume in 1748 offered the most influential modern critique, contending that no testimony can establish a miracle because our uniform experience of nature fixes a maxim that miracles are maximally improbable, and the wise man proportions belief to evidence. In the nineteenth century, Strauss 1835 construed the Gospel miracle stories as mythic expressions of community faith rather than historical reports. Reimarus in the late eighteenth century, published posthumously in 1778, had already pressed rationalist alternatives to the resurrection. Bultmann in 1941 urged demythologizing, translating miracle narratives into existential self-understanding without requiring their factual occurrence.

Against these currents, defenders rose. Paley 1794 formed a cumulative case from testimony and undesigned coincidences. In the twentieth century, C. S. Lewis 1947 argued that nature is open to its Creator, so miracles are not absurd if theism is true. Warfield 1918 defended miracles as revelational signs while delimiting their frequency. Analytic philosophers treated the Humean argument with probability theory. Swinburne 1970 and later 2003 used Bayesian reasoning to defend the rationality of believing the resurrection given prior theism and specific evidence. Craig since 1989 and 2008 developed historical arguments that claim high likelihood for the resurrection given minimal facts. Earman 2000 judged Hume's critique an abject failure, noting that Hume smuggles in a claim about uniform experience that cannot be supported if testimony is part of the data. McGrew 2009 refined Bayesian accounts of multiple independent witnesses. In biblical studies, Keener 2011 catalogued contemporary reports to challenge the claim that uniform experience excludes miracles. Within Reformed theology, Van Til in works from the 1940s and 1950s reframed the debate by anchoring possibility and intelligibility in the Creator creature distinction and the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.

To steelman the rivals, consider three strong forms. One, the Humean probabilistic challenge. Premise one, laws of nature summarize vast uniform experience. Premise two, a miracle as a law-violating event is maximally improbable relative to this background. Premise three, testimony is always less reliable than the lawlike course of nature. Conclusion, it is always more rational to believe that the testimony is mistaken than that a miracle occurred. This argument gains strength by invoking base rates, human credulity, and cross cultural tales that conflict. Even if a miracle occurred, we would not be justified in believing it, because the likelihood that we are misled is higher than the event itself.

Two, the demythologizing hermeneutic. Modern people who use electric lights cannot believe in spirits and miracles in the same way as ancient people. The Gospels communicate the claim that God saves in Christ through mythic language. The point is existential decision in faith, not events in space time. Moreover, historical criticism shows the shaping of tradition and the symbolic function of miracle stories, which undermines straightforward factual claims. The resurrection signifies the victory of Jesus, not necessarily a bodily event.

Three, a methodological naturalism constraint. The productive success of modern science since 1600 rests on the search for natural causes. Historical method, patterned on this success, should exclude non natural explanations. Even if the supernatural exists, allowing miracle explanations would undercut the norms of testability, repeatability, and public adjudication. The proper method is to prefer the most plausible natural hypothesis. If none is available, suspend judgment.

These arguments are not straw. They draw strength from a wise concern with human fallibility, from the simplicity and fruitfulness of natural explanation, and from attention to genre and language in texts. Any response must acknowledge those strengths while tracing their limits.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
We start with first principles. The Creator creature distinction means God is absolute and we are dependent, the world is contingent and personal, not a closed box. Revelation is self attesting, God speaks and his voice carries its own divine clarity and authority, which the Spirit confirms. The noetic effects of sin distort our reasoning and desires, especially in relation to acknowledging God and his acts, Rom 1:18 to 23. All human knowledge is analogical and covenantal, we think God's thoughts after him as finite image bearers situated in a moral relation to the Lord.

With these in view, five theses follow.

1. Miracles are rare, purposive acts of the triune Lord that function as covenant signs interpreted by the Word. Scripture sets the pattern. God gives Moses signs so that Israel may know that I have sent you, Exod 4. Elijah calls down fire so that this people may know that you, O Lord, are God, 1 Kgs 18. Jesus performs signs recorded so that you may believe and have life in his name, John 20:30 to 31. Hebrews teaches that God bore witness by signs and various gifts, Heb 2:3 to 4. The pattern is not bare anomaly but Word plus work, deed plus discourse. That covenant frame is essential. Miracles accompany revelatory epochs, they confirm offices and inaugurate redemptive milestones. Hence, their meaning is not neutral, and their identification is tied to their role in God's communicative action.

2. Laws of nature are descriptions of God's ordinary providence, not independent realities that bind God. Because God is faithful, the world exhibits regularity, seedtime and harvest, day and night. Miracles are not violations of laws if laws are summaries of God's usual manner of governing creatures. They are unusual divine actions that fit within a personal order. Warfield saw this clearly, and Van Til grounds it in Creator lordship. This reframes the Humean setup. The background against which probabilities are assessed is not bare uniformity but a world created and governed by a purposive Lord who sometimes signals new covenant phases by extraordinary acts. The transcendental necessity claim is this. For induction, probability, and testimony to be meaningful and coherent, a faithful God must exist and govern a stable creation.

3. Testimony is an ordinary, God given means of knowledge, and can rationally establish even rare events when embedded in the right background. We live by testimony from childhood upward. Scripture treats truthful testimony as weighty, and calls for discernment against false witnesses. Modern epistemology agrees that testimony is basic. Earman notes that Hume undervalues the evidential force of independent witnesses. Bayesian frameworks show that multiple independent testimonies can overcome low base rates, especially when the hypothesis has explanatory power for the data and fits antecedent background. Under theism, the prior probability of God acting in salvation history is not infinitesimal. When the testimony is public, early, and costly, and when natural alternatives are weak, the posterior can be high rationally. This underwrites the apostolic claim that these things were not done in a corner, Acts 26:26.

4. Scripture's self attestation guides method, not by foreclosing inquiry but by rightly situating it. The Word interprets the works. The resurrection is presented as bodily and public, Luke 24, John 20, 1 Cor 15. Demythologizing misreads the genre and the covenant intent. The apostolic preaching asserts that God has acted in history, and that our faith is vain if Christ has not been raised, 1 Cor 15:14. The church receives this testimony and tests spirits, 1 John 4:1, holding fast to what is good, 1 Thess 5:21. Van Til insists there is no neutral ground. This does not negate evidence. It clarifies that evidence is never brute. It is always already located within a worldview. The right method acknowledges the Lord whose fingerprints structure the very possibility of evidence.

5. The church's practice should be sober, expectant, and discerning. Because miracles are signs, they are not entertainment or private props. The ordinary means of grace, Word and sacrament and prayer, remain central. Claims of healing or extraordinary guidance should be tested for doctrinal coherence, moral fruit, and public accountability. Warfield's caution about concentrating signs during canonical revelation helps resist credulity, yet Scripture leaves room for divine gifts given at the Lord's pleasure. Either way, the aim is the same. Exalt Christ, serve the neighbor, tell the truth. Science is not threatened by this. It studies God's ordinary providence. Law likewise can weigh testimony and consider agent causation when appropriate. The church models truthful speech and careful investigation as forms of love.

This covenantal account does not finesse difficulty. It faces the fact that miracles are rare and that false reports abound. Yet it insists that rarity does not entail impossibility, and that credibility is possible when God speaks and acts and when he gathers a people who bear faithful witness.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection one. The prior probability of a miracle is vanishingly small. All past experience counts against it, and testimony is notoriously unreliable. Religious diversity compounds the problem, since conflicting miracle claims cancel each other out.

Reply. First, priors are not set in a vacuum. If the background includes theism grounded by independent arguments and by the self authenticating Word, the prior for God acting in salvation history is not negligible. Second, testimony has structure. Early, multiple, independent, and hostile source attestation raises the likelihood of truth. Earman shows that Hume's use of uniform experience unjustly excludes testimony from the dataset that fixes the likelihood of the event. When testimony is brought in properly, and when natural alternatives have lower likelihood relative to the data, the posterior for a miracle can exceed the defeat threshold rationally. Third, diversity does not entail a stalemate. Claims differ in content, context, attestation, and theological coherence. Conflicting reports invite adjudication, not dismissal. Scripture itself warns of false signs, Deut 13 and 2 Thess 2, so the existence of counterfeit does not reduce the authentic to zero.

Objection two. Methodological naturalism is a rule of scientific and historical inquiry. Allowing miracle explanations erodes the method that has given us modern knowledge. One should always prefer a natural account, or else suspend judgment.

Reply. A pragmatic rule is not a metaphysical necessity. Methodological naturalism can be a useful policy in many contexts, but the policy must answer to truth. History and law already allow for personal agency explanations, which are not reducible to physics. A miracle claim is a claim about a personal agent acting with a revealed purpose. If all available natural explanations are vastly less plausible than the agent based explanation within the covenantal background, then blocking the latter by fiat is not method but prejudice. Moreover, the stability that science presupposes is itself underwritten by divine faithfulness. To recognize an extraordinary divine act when warranted no more undermines ordinary scientific practice than recognizing a signature on a contract undermines the chemistry of ink.

Objection three. The transcendental move is question begging. You assume God to prove God. The claim that probability and testimony require theism is a table pounding assertion, not an argument.

Reply. Every ultimate starting point is self referencing. The question is not whether one reasons from commitments but which commitments supply the preconditions of intelligibility we all use. Hume himself left induction unexplained. On secular accounts, future like past, stable natures, and the binding force of norms of reasoning hover without anchor. The Christian theism affirmed in Scripture says God is faithful, upholding all things by the word of his power. That supplies reasons to expect a stable order and to trust our minds as created to function in that order. The transcendental claim is conditional and challengeable. If you deny God, show how the norms and structures you use to mount your denial retain their authority and coherence. Until then, the charge of begging the question rebounds.

Objection four. Demythologizing respects the kerygma while avoiding pre scientific claims. The Gospel intends existential encounter, not photographic history. Insisting on bodily miracles mistakes genre and creates stumbling blocks to modern people.

Reply. The texts are stubbornly public. They date names, places, and officials. They invite verification and appeal to eyewitnesses. Luke claims orderly history. John says these signs are written that you may believe, John 20:30 to 31. Paul ties forgiveness to the bodily resurrection, 1 Cor 15. Remove the acts and the message collapses, as Paul says, your faith is futile. Genre analysis should serve the text, not rewrite it. The pastoral response to modern sensibilities is not to subtract the claims but to show their coherence within theism and their evidential grounding. The stumbling block is not accidents of genre but the scandal of lordship.

Objection five. Concentrating miracles in biblical epochs and calling later claims rare amounts to ad hoc insulation. If God acts then, why not now. Your view either slides into cessation or opens the door to credulity.

Reply. The covenantal pattern explains both. The density of signs clusters at redemptive hinges, exodus and kingdom and incarnation. That is not ad hoc but teleological. Once the foundation is laid and the canon closed, the church lives by the inscripturated Word and ordinary means. God remains free to act extraordinarily. The church tests claims by doctrine, fruit, and public truthfulness. This guards against gullibility without denying divine freedom. Expectancy and discernment together honor the Lord.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Consider a hospital ward in 2025. A middle aged woman, Mara, has aggressive lymphoma. The oncologist proposes a rigorous course of chemo and immunotherapy with a guarded prognosis. Her church prays for healing. A visiting aunt urges her to refuse treatment and trust God alone. A skeptical cousin says miracles do not happen. After months, scans show complete remission. The medical team calls it an exceptional response. Some friends call it a miracle. The cousin says spontaneous remission happens. The aunt wants a testimony tour.

The covenantal response reframes the questions, responsibilities, and hope.

First, naming. We insist that the Lord heals, ordinarily through means and sometimes beyond means. Scripture commends prayer and physicians. Luke is called the beloved physician, Col 4:14. The Word interprets the work. Healing, if granted, is a sign of the kingdom, a pointer to the resurrection life in Christ, not an entitlement or a metric of faith. We avoid pressure soaked rhetoric, because miracles are not a stage for our tribe but a sign of Christ's compassion and authority.

Second, method. We communicate with the medical team in truth. We ask questions, seek second opinions as needed, and consent to treatment in informed faith. If remission occurs, we do not force a dichotomy between God and medicine. We say thank you to the doctors and to God, since God uses both providence and special acts. If there are features that suggest an extraordinary element, such as suddenness against all prognostic markers and co occurring signs that lack plausible natural causation, we say so cautiously. We resist the temptation to exaggerate. The ninth commandment applies to testimonies. The church can collect documentation. If a testimony is shared publicly, it should be precise and accountable.

Third, criteria. Because we hold that miracles are covenant signs, we ask about purpose. Is Christ exalted. Does the story serve the communion of the church rather than an individual's platform. Does it cohere with Scripture and the gospel. Are we open to remain silent publicly if the evidence is mixed. Do we acknowledge that unanswered prayers are also within God's wise providence, and that they too witness to Christ by steadfast hope in suffering. A sign points, but the thing it points to is greater. That thing is resurrection hope grounded in the once for all miracle of Easter.

Fourth, hope under tension. Mara's remission may last, or the cancer may return. The covenantal frame gives stability. The central miracle is not the remission but Christ risen, the firstfruits. That sign and seal grounds both gratitude and endurance. The same frame allows comfort if healing is not granted. We confess that God is able, that he is wise, and that he is good. The church surrounds families with practical care, not only miracle rhetoric.

Fifth, witness. At a follow up appointment, the oncologist asks, Do you think this was a miracle. The church trained in this approach can answer without defensiveness. We believe God governs nature faithfully, which makes science possible. We also believe that he sometimes acts in unusual ways to answer prayer and to point to Christ. This outcome is medically remarkable. Whether you call it a miracle, we thank God and we thank you. This answer neither retreats into private feeling nor forces a conclusion. It invites further conversation and demonstrates that faith and careful reasoning walk together.

In a campus forum, a student cites Hume and says testimony is too weak. We can respond from the same frame. Testimony is a basic source of knowledge. The resurrection claim has multiple lines of public attestation. Under theism, its prior is not astronomical. The point of that sign is covenantal, the confirmation of Jesus as Lord and the opening of the age to come. You can investigate. You will also find that your trust in induction and rational norms leans on a faithful order that Christian theism explains uniquely well.

In a courtroom, suppose someone introduces a miracle claim to sway a jury. The covenantal approach teaches restraint. Ask what the claim purports to establish, whether it is evidentially relevant, and whether it meets standards of public verifiability. Appeals to miracles in legal settings should be rare, because the church does not enlist the sign to short circuit ordinary processes. A disciplined practice protects both the integrity of the courts and the witness of the church.

Across these contexts, the pastoral core is consistent. We confess that God is Lord of nature. We honor ordinary means as his gifts. We expect that God can and sometimes does give signs that confirm the Word and bless his people. We test claims fairly, neither cynical nor gullible. We understand that the central sign is Christ's resurrection, John 20:30 to 31, which anchors all other hopes. We train congregations to tell the truth, to give thanks, to lament, and to endure.

The Humean critique presses us to be precise about probability and testimony. The demythologizing program presses us to be clear about canon and genre. Methodological naturalism presses us to honor scientific practices. The covenantal response meets each pressure without collapse. It affirms that the same Lord who gives the ordinary order gives the extraordinary sign, that the same Word that creates the world interprets the miracle, and that the same Spirit who empowered apostolic witness illumines the church today to discern wisely, love truthfully, and hope steadfastly. In this way, miracle and revelation are not in tension but in covenantal harmony, each illuminating the other, and together pointing to the living God who speaks and saves.
