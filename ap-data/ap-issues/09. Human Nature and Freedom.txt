### TITLE
Human Nature and Freedom - Dignity, Depravity, Responsibility

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Locus is human nature and freedom, with sub-issues of dignity and depravity, moral responsibility, libertarian sourcehood and alternative possibilities, compatibilist reasons-responsiveness, and covenant headship across Adam and Christ.
- Rival approaches presented fairly include libertarianism event-causal and agent-causal, semicompatibilism, classical compatibilism, and hard incompatibilism that denies responsibility.
- Principal figures engaged include Augustine, architect of desire-level freedom and original sin, Jonathan Edwards 1703-1758, defender of moral inability, Robert Kane, libertarian with self-forming actions, and John Martin Fischer, semicompatibilist on guidance control.
- Method tension noted as this, no view is neutral, the evidence about choice and character is interpreted either under autonomous reason or under self-attesting revelation that frames creation, fall, and redemption.
- Thesis argued, only a covenantal theism with Creator-creature distinction, secondary causation under providence, and Adamic headship can secure both human dignity and real responsibility amid pervasive depravity.
- Pastoral angle addressed, counseling and courtroom judgments about addiction and coercion, restoring hope and responsibility through gospel, community, and wise use of secondary means.

### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
The doctrine of human nature and freedom stands where dignity, depravity, and responsibility meet. The issue can be defined sharply. What is the structure of agency that secures moral responsibility, given the realities of desire, character, causation, and lawlike nature Those who affirm libertarian freedom claim that responsibility requires a robust ability to do otherwise or at least a self-originating sourcehood that is not determined by prior states of the world. Compatibilists claim that responsibility is compatible with determinism, so long as the agent acts from her own reasons and character without external compulsion. A third family, hard incompatibilists, deny that we have the sort of freedom required for responsibility, either because determinism is true or because indeterminism is no help.

Within libertarianism we can distinguish event-causal libertarianism and agent-causal libertarianism. Event-causal accounts, represented by Robert Kane, understand free choices as involving indeterministic events within the brain during periods of inner conflict, yielding self-forming actions that shape character. Agent-causal views trace back to Thomas Reid 1710-1796 and have contemporary representatives who posit that an agent as substance can initiate new causal chains. Compatibilism ranges from classical versions that emphasize the absence of constraint or compulsion, as in Hobbes 1588-1679, to sophisticated accounts of reasons-responsiveness and guidance control, as in John Martin Fischer born 1952, who defends responsibility even if determinism rules, and denies that alternative possibilities are necessary. Some recent models are semicompatibilist, claiming that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism even if free will defined as alternative possibility is not.

Historically, Augustine 354-430 marks an early high point. Against Pelagius circa 360-418, Augustine argued that fallen humans are not free in the highest sense, since they are bound to sin, though they choose voluntarily. Yet humans retain dignity as images of God, and grace restores freedom to love God. In The City of God between 413 and 426, he integrated creation, fall, and grace with a strong doctrine of providence and secondary causes. In the early medieval period, the Council of Orange in 529 rejected Pelagianism and affirmed the necessity of grace. Thomas Aquinas 1225-1274 developed accounts of intellect and will under divine concurrence, emphasizing secondary causation.

The Reformation sharpened the debate. Martin Luther in The Bondage of the Will 1525 insisted that unregenerate will is bound to sin. John Calvin 1509-1564 stressed providence and the distinction between necessity and compulsion, arguing that God ordains all things, yet humans act voluntarily as secondary causes. The Westminster Confession in 1647 set a classic Reformed statement, God ordains whatsoever comes to pass, yet neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures. Jonathan Edwards in Freedom of the Will 1754 developed a precise account, the will follows the strongest motive, moral inability concerns the lack of disposition to choose the good, which does not negate responsibility.

Modern philosophy turned the issue. Hobbes and Spinoza 1632-1677 defended necessity. Hume 1711-1776 framed the debate in terms of constant conjunction and the compatibility of liberty with necessity given absence of constraint. Kant 1724-1804 posited a noumenal freedom to ground moral law, though empirical actions follow causality. In the twentieth century, Peter Strawson 1919-2006 shifted attention to reactive attitudes such as resentment and gratitude, arguing that our interpersonal practices presuppose responsibility. Roderick Chisholm 1916-1999 argued for agent causation. Peter van Inwagen born 1942 formulated the consequence argument in 1983, if determinism is true, our acts are the consequences of laws and past facts not up to us, so we lack the power to do otherwise. Harry Frankfurt 1929-2015 in 1969 provided counterexamples to the principle of alternative possibilities, suggesting responsibility can persist without alternatives. Robert Kane born 1938 in 1996 defended indeterminist self-forming actions. John Martin Fischer in 1994 and later argued for guidance control and semicompatibilism. Derk Pereboom born 1957 defended hard incompatibilism in 2001 and a manipulation argument. Galen Strawson born 1952 presented the basic argument that ultimate responsibility is impossible because one cannot be responsible for the way one is.

The strongest rival arguments deserve to be steelmanned. First, the libertarian consequence argument claims that if determinism is true, then our actions are entailed by prior states and laws that we do not control, and the principle of the transfer of non-control yields that we do not control our actions. The argument is crisp and motivates the need for alternate possibilities or sourcehood. Second, the manipulation argument, in the hands of Pereboom, presses a worry for compatibilism. Imagine a super-neuroscientist who designs an agent on day one to desire and deliberate in such a way that she will perform a crime on day two. The agent acts from her own desires and reasons, yet we judge she is not responsible because of upstream manipulation. If determinism is true, our actual history is relevantly similar, so compatibilism seems to collapse. Third, the libertarian claims that agent-causation is needed to secure origination. If every event is caused by prior events, then the agent is a passive conduit. Only a substance that can cause without being causally necessitated by prior states secures sourcehood. Fourth, the semicompatibilist argument from reactive attitudes states that our practices of moral address and holding responsible presuppose only that the action issues from the agent's valuational system without coercion, not the availability of alternatives. Hence moral responsibility can cohere with determinism.

Finally, the hard incompatibilist cautions that neither side works. If determinism, then the consequence argument rules out control. If indeterminism, then the occurrence of undetermined events injects luck rather than agency. Even self-forming actions seem hostage to luck regarding which of the competing efforts wins out. Therefore, responsibility is an illusion we maintain for social utility, and we should revise our punishment practices and our sense of guilt.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
We begin with first principles. God is the self-sufficient Creator, we are dependent creatures. Revelation is self-attesting, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Sin distorts our reasoning, the noetic effects are real and deep. All our reasoning is analogical, we think God's thoughts after him in a finite mode. Divine providence is exhaustive, yet it establishes, not erases, creaturely causes. Scripture frames human nature as created in the image of God, Gen 1, fallen in Adam under condemnation, Rom 5, and redeemed in Christ, John 8, Rom 8.

From these principles, I advance five theses.

1. Human dignity and responsibility are grounded in the image of God and covenant headship, not in autonomy. Humans have rational, moral, and relational capacities as images, which grant a natural aptitude for dominion and accountability, Gen 1. Adam stands as covenant head, Rom 5, so that our history is corporate and federal. Responsibility is covenantal before it is metaphysical, it is a matter of being answerable to the personal Lawgiver. This anchoring resists the thinness of purely procedural accounts of responsibility. The law is not an impersonal ledger, it is the speech of the Lord. Hence, dignity does not rise or fall with the presence of alternative possibilities at a given moment. It rises from vocation before God.

2. Freedom is voluntary action arising from desire and character within God's providence, such that moral inability does not cancel obligation. Augustine and Edwards reasoned that people always act according to what they most want, given their character and strongest reasons. Scripture agrees that sin enslaves at the level of heart, John 8, yet still holds sinners responsible, Rom 1, Rom 3. The crucial distinction is between natural inability and moral inability. If an agent is chained or coerced, natural inability excuses. If an agent cannot love God because he prefers darkness, moral inability condemns. This reads the biblical anthropology in which the heart is the wellspring of life and the seat of corruption, Gen 6, Jer 17. Desire-level analysis clarifies that the compatibilist notion of acting from one's own reasons, absent coercion, maps onto the biblical notion of voluntary sin. God judges the secrets of the heart, and the will is not a bare faculty that floats free of character.

3. Divine sovereignty secures, rather than erases, secondary causation and meaningful agency. Providence is meticulous, yet God works through means. Scripture shows God using the intentions of human agents for his purposes, as in Joseph's brothers in Gen 50, and the crucifixion in Acts 2. The Reformed tradition developed this into a robust doctrine of primary and secondary causation. God as primary cause orders all that comes to pass. Creatures as secondary causes act according to their natures and purposes. The upshot is twofold. First, causal determination by God does not impose violence on the will, since God determines via ordering the whole nexus in which agents form and execute intentions. Second, this undercuts the manipulation worry, because God is not a finite craftsman tweaking a machine. He is the transcendent Creator whose conferral of being and ordering of histories establishes the very field in which responsibility lives. There is a Creator-creature difference that forbids assimilation to creaturely manipulation.

4. The cross and the new covenant establish a redemptive freedom that exceeds moral choice schemas. If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed, John 8. Under Adam, the will is inclined away from God, a real inability to delight in the good. Under Christ, the Spirit renews the heart, Ezk 36, so that we are free to love God. This is liberty of excellency, to use an Edwardsean phrase but with a Pauline core. This has implications for responsibility. Accountability persists across the transition, since past sins are real and punished in Christ for the believer, and sanctification involves real choices empowered by grace. In the church, exhortations, warnings, and promises are genuine means. Law and gospel are fitted to renewed hearts, and the sacraments and preaching are secondary causes God uses to shape affections.

5. Transcendental necessity claim. The intelligibility of moral responsibility and rational agency presupposes a personal Creator whose image we bear, whose law gives normativity, and whose providence unifies causal order with purposive reasons. If we deny God, we cut off the source of normativity and the unity of causation and meaning, and we are left with either luck or mechanism, neither of which can ground blame and praise. Only under covenant headship and divine law can our practices of obligation, guilt, and hope be more than pragmatic habits.

These theses address the rival arguments. The consequence argument trades on ownership of the past and laws. On a biblical frame, no creature owns the past or the laws. We are not metaphysical proprietors who must bootstrap control from autonomy. We are covenantal agents whose control is personal and teleological. Control sufficient for responsibility is guidance by one's reasons and character under the law of God. Frankfurt-style insights are helpful here. Scripture already denies that mere alternative possibilities are necessary, since it often grounds guilt in the heart's aim, not in branching opportunities.

Agent-causation, taken as a way to secure origination, can be reinterpreted within providence. The agent is a true cause, not a mere conduit. But the agent is not an uncaused cause. Only God is that. To say the agent causes is to say God has endowed a creaturely power that functions according to its nature. This is what secondary causation means. The libertarian worry is answered by noting that divine concursus and decree are not competitive with creaturely agency, since God causes the being and order of the cause, not as a rival, but as its ground.

The manipulation argument is defused by Creator-creature distinction and covenant teleology. The super-neuroscientist is a finite agent who imposes alien aims. The Creator is the one in whom we live and move. Our very dignity is to live under his law. Moreover, responsibility tracks voluntariness within the story God tells, not metaphysical independence. Joseph's brothers meant evil and are blameworthy, even though God meant it for good. This is the template. It is precisely because God governs the story that blame and praise have their fit objects and consequences.

As to practice, these theses bear fruit. Law and civil order depend on holding agents responsible where action flows from their reasons and desires without coercion, not on speculative metaphysics about possible alternatives. Science depends on regularities that are God's providential order, which makes secondary causation sturdy. Conscience is restored in the gospel, where the diagnosis of moral inability and the promise of new birth unite responsibility and hope. Art and culture flourish when human action is seen as meaningful under a transcendent narrative, resisting both moralism and despair.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection 1. The consequence argument shows that if determinism is true, then your action is the unavoidable consequence of past facts and laws which are not up to you, so you lack control. A compatibilist reply that you act from your reasons equivocates between control and mere guidance.

Reply. The argument presupposes a model of control as ownership of the causal chain from the ground up. Scripture frames control covenantally. The question is whether the act is your own, issuing from your heart and reasons without coercion, ordered toward ends you recognize. That is guidance control, and it is sufficient for answering to God and neighbor. Moreover, the transfer of non-control principle rests on creaturely proprietorship of history and law. On the Creator-creature distinction, we live as responsible agents within God's order, where responsibility does not require authorship of the laws or past. You need not be the first cause to be a true cause answerable to the Lawgiver.

Objection 2. The manipulation argument shows that if your character and reasons are fixed by factors beyond your control, your responsibility is undermined, even if you act voluntarily. Determinism collapses into covert manipulation.

Reply. The analogy fails at the crucial point. Manipulation by a finite agent is alien imposition within the same order of being. Divine providence is the transcendent ground of being and order. God does not manipulate creatures as a puppeteer. He creates and concurs such that secondary causes act according to their natures. Covenant teleology matters. The end for which God orders human life is communion and justice under his law. Responsibility supervenes on voluntariness within that teleology. The biblical narrative consistently holds agents responsible under providence. Joseph's brothers, Pharaoh, and those who crucified Christ acted freely and were blameworthy, even though their deeds were decreed.

Objection 3. Libertarian self-forming actions explain how agents become the sorts of persons they are by undetermined efforts in moments of conflict. Without such ultimate control, you cannot be responsible for your character, and so cannot be responsible for actions that flow from it.

Reply. The demand for ultimate control is misplaced. Responsibility is not built on ultimate self-creation, which is impossible for creatures. It is built on answerability for what one wills in light of reasons and the moral law. Scripture treats formative choices as real, but it never makes responsibility depend on escaping God's ordering of history. The luck problem that haunts libertarian self-forming actions shows the fragility of indeterminism as a foundation. On the covenantal view, character formation occurs through means, habits, and communities that God ordains, and responsibility scales with the clarity of light and absence of coercion in particular acts.

Objection 4. The transcendental claim begs the question. It assumes that only a theistic, covenantal framework can ground normativity and agency. A secular naturalist can say normativity is a social practice and agency is an emergent pattern. There is no need to posit God.

Reply. The transcendental move tests what must be true for our practices to be intelligible, not what we can say at a surface level. If normativity is a social practice, then its authority reduces to convention and power, yet our moral judgments aim at more than coordination. They claim authority that binds even when social consensus shifts. If agency is an emergent pattern on mechanism, then reasons are epiphenomenal gloss on physics or biological drives, yet our deliberation purports to track truth and good. The covenantal account unifies causal order and purposive reasons under a personal lawgiver. The naturalist must either inflate norms beyond the resources of blind processes or deflate blame and praise to useful fictions. Our shared life, from courts to promises to repentance, treats them as more than fictions.

Objection 5. Scripture itself seems to presuppose libertarian alternatives in its calls to choose and warnings against sin. If people could not have done otherwise under determinism, the exhortations ring hollow.

Reply. Biblical exhortations aim at the heart, not at metaphysical branching structures. Choose life presses the hearer to act from renewed reasons and desires. The same Scripture affirms God's sovereign ordination of history and human responsibility, often in the same passages, as in Acts 2. The Reformed distinction between natural and moral inability explains the force of exhortations. God commands what we ought to do. Our inability is culpable when it is rooted in evil loves. The Spirit uses the command as a means to open the heart. Exhortations are not theater. They are instruments in God's providence to bring about what they command.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Consider a counseling room where a young man, Marcus, sits with his pastor and a trusted mentor. Marcus has been arrested for theft to pay for opioids after a shoulder injury. In tears, he describes months of spiraling dependence, frayed relationships, and a sense that he could not do otherwise when the cravings surged. The court date is in two weeks. He asks, Am I responsible if my brain and body were demanding relief He also asks, If God is in control, why am I to blame and what hope do I have to change

The covenantal response reframes the situation at three levels. First, it affirms Marcus's dignity. He is an image bearer with worth and a calling to love God and neighbor. The conversation begins with that. Second, it names depravity honestly. Marcus's choices were voluntary, aimed at relief and escape, and they harmed others. His inability was moral at key points. He preferred immediate comfort over truth and love. He was not tied to a chair or under a gun. The language of Scripture, enslaved to sin, John 8, mirrors his experience of craving, but it preserves responsibility because his heart endorsed the act in the moment.

Third, it invokes secondary causation and means. The pastor resists two errors. He refuses to reduce Marcus to neurons and neurotransmitters, which would evacuate agency. He also refuses a hyper spiritualism that scoffs at medical help. God governs through means. Opioid dependence has bodily dimensions. Good medicine, supervised detox, and perhaps medication assisted treatment may be part of the path. The church can partner with clinicians without ceding moral discernment. This is secondary causation at work under providence.

The counsel unfolds with four steps.

1. Confession and covenantal realism. Marcus is led to confess not only the theft but the disordered loves. He names the persons he wronged and the lies he told. This aligns his speech with the moral law of God and relocates his story within the larger story of sin and grace.

2. Responsibility scaled to voluntariness. The mentor helps Marcus analyze episodes. Where was there coercion Where was he deceived Where did he plan, hide, and manipulate The goal is not shame but clarity. Courts will weigh such factors too. The biblical distinctions can sharpen legal and pastoral judgments. A judge considers diminished capacity without erasing responsibility. The church and family can pursue both restitution and support.

3. Gospel hope and new heart freedom. The pastor speaks of Christ who frees the captive, John 8, and of the Spirit who renews the heart. This is not vague uplift. It is a claim about new desires. Marcus is told, God can make you want what is good. If you are in Christ, you will battle, but with new power and community.

4. Practices as secondary means. They set a plan, daily liturgies of prayer and Scripture, weekly worship and communion, a sponsor for accountability calls, a doctor for medical oversight, a budget with guardrails, an employer willing to provide structured work. The plan treats Marcus as an agent whose reasons and loves must be reshaped, and it treats the medical and social structures as tools God uses to reshape him.

How does this reframe responsibility The pastor can say in court, Marcus acted voluntarily and harmed others, and he is taking ownership. He can also urge leniency that pairs restitution with treatment, because mercy and justice can kiss. In the church, discipline and restoration can proceed together. Marcus may be restricted from certain ministries for a season, yet embraced as a brother. The counsel to his parents is clear. Do not enable. Speak truth in love. Provide structured support, not blank checks. The framing also meets a common fear. Marcus worries that if God is sovereign, he is a puppet. He is told, No, God works through your willing. You are responsible because you will and act from your reasons. That is why your repentance matters and why your new practices matter. Providence does not bypass your choices. It dignifies them within God's story.

Contrary cases arise. What of a relapse during detox when the body screams Marcus is reminded that natural inability can excuse in part when the body truly overpowers reason, as in seizures or delirium. Pastoral care discerns such moments. Yet even then, the trajectory is toward renewed agency. The church aims to see Marcus become the kind of person who, when cravings surge, has reasons and loves in place to say no. That is the most practical sense of freedom. It is liberty of excellency enacted in habit.

Finally, this setting illustrates the transcendental point. The moral dialogue assumes objective guilt, obligation to make amends, and hope that binds. These are not mere social utilities. They presume a law that is more than custom and a telos that is more than survival. The covenantal frame supplies both. The judge pronounces, the church disciplines, the family prays, the doctor prescribes, and Marcus decides. Each act is a secondary cause within God's providence. The story is intelligible because there is a Creator whose law and grace hold it together.
