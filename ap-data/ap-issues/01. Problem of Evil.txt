### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
The problem of evil names the tension between the affirmation that God is all powerful and all good, and the reality of evil and suffering in the world. Philosophers distinguish moral evil, such as murder and betrayal, from natural evil, such as earthquakes and disease. The issue takes three dominant forms. First, the logical problem claims inconsistency, that it is impossible for the God of classical theism and evil to coexist. Second, the evidential problem claims improbability, that the quantity, kinds, and apparently gratuitous instances of evil make God unlikely. Third, the existential problem addresses the lived weight of suffering, the cry of protest or despair.

The logical problem was classically attributed to Epicurus, 341 to 270 BC, and later framed by Lactantius, and in modern design by J. L. Mackie in 1955. Mackie argued that theistic claims form an inconsistent set, God is omnipotent, God is wholly good, evil exists. He tightened the tension with auxiliary claims, such as that a good being eliminates all evil it can, and an omnipotent being can eliminate any evil. On this reading, the existence of evil entails that the God of classical theism does not exist.

The evidential problem was sharpened in late twentieth century analytic philosophy. William Rowe in 1979 proposed a canonical formulation. He described a fawn caught in a forest fire, dying after days of agony, with no human observers to learn compassion or be morally tested. He argued that there is no apparent greater good served by such suffering, and thus, probably, no actual God-justifying reason. Paul Draper in 1989 argued that the distribution of pleasure and pain fits better with an indifference hypothesis than with theism. Marilyn McCord Adams in 1999 analyzed horrendous evils, those that seem to defeat the possibility of a life being a great good to the participant, and asked how any theodicy could repair the value of such lives.

The existential problem goes back to Job, whose protests and questions frame the canonical text Job 38 to 42, and recurs in modern literature. Fyodor Dostoevsky in 1880 voiced, through Ivan Karamazov, a moral rebellion against a world where children suffer. The complaint is not only about probability or logic, but about trust and worship. It asks whether it is even admirable to worship a God who permits atrocity.

Rival responses vary. The Augustinian line, rooted in Augustine 354 to 430, holds that evil is a privation of the good, not a created substance, and that moral evil springs from disordered love and pride. Creation is good, evil parasitic. Augustine also connects natural evil to the fall of Adam, the curse upon creation, and the just judgment of God. Leibniz in 1710 develops a rationalist theodicy in Theodicy, arguing that God created the best of all possible worlds, where optimal balance of goods and evils secures maximal overall value. The Irenaean or soul-making tradition, retrieved by John Hick in 1966, interprets suffering as an arena for the development of virtue, trust, and likeness to God. Suffering and resistance are instruments of maturation rather than solely punishment. The free will defense, reconstructed by Alvin Plantinga in God, Freedom, and Evil in 1974, meets the logical problem by showing that it is possible that God could not create a world with significantly free creatures who always do right. Plantinga also sketches a story that some natural evils could be due to nonhuman free agents, though that extension is contested. In parallel, skeptical theism, associated with Stephen Wykstra in 1984 and Michael Bergmann in the 2000s, does not supply a theodicy. Rather, it challenges the inference from no apparent reason to no actual reason. Given our limited cognitive position relative to an infinite God and a sprawling cosmos, we should not expect to see God-justifying reasons, so Rowe-type inferences are unreliable.

To steelman the strongest rival arguments, consider three. First, the Mackie-style logical argument gains traction when framed with strengthened premises about divine goodness and power. If goodness entails the elimination of all evil within one’s power, and omnipotence entails the power to eliminate any evil, then the existence of evil undermines classical theism. The strength of this version is its clarity and the fact that eliminating inconsistency is a minimal demand for rational belief.

Second, Rowe’s evidential argument is strongest in cases of seemingly pointless suffering. The burned fawn example is intentionally designed to block standard greater goods, such as soul-making for observers or deterrence of future crime. Likewise, pediatric cancers, random amputations, and catastrophic earthquakes that bury villages in seconds seem non-instrumental to any morally sufficient purpose. The aggregate increases the pressure. The world appears more like one shaped by blind process than one governed by a personal God attentive to each sparrow. The argument does not need certainty. It requires that on a reasonable Bayesian read, such data tip the scales against theism.

Third, the existential protest gains compelling force when voiced by victims. It forces a moral evaluation of any theory that uses other people’s pain to balance cosmic accounts. It presses the theist on divine character. If God permits genocides or abuse, is he worthy of worship. The argument moves from the head to the heart, not thereby losing rational content, but adding the human gravity that logical formulae erase.

Contemporary debate has incorporated further responses. Some Christians defend a defense rather than a theodicy, granting that while we do not know God’s reasons, we can show that theism remains rational. Others offer abductive arguments, that theism explains moral obligation and the resilience of hope under suffering better than atheism. Meanwhile, secular positions divide between hard naturalists who deny objective evil and moral realists who retain objective moral facts without God. Both positions face internal tensions. The first must explain why we should resist evil beyond preference. The second must reconcile brute normativity with a purposeless cosmos.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
The covenantal stance begins with the Creator and creature distinction. God is self existent and needs nothing. The world is dependent, contingent, and personal because it was made by a personal God. Scripture is self attesting and authoritative, not because we infer its truth from neutral facts, but because in hearing God’s voice we receive the only foundation that makes facts intelligible. The noetic effects of sin mean human reasoning is not neutral. We are both knowers of God through the world and suppressors of that knowledge, Rom 1:20. Our reasoning is analogical, never univocal with God’s, always under his self revelation.

From those first principles, five theses follow.

1. The triune God is sovereign, wise, and good, and he governs all events without moral stain. Scripture holds both providence and responsibility. Joseph says, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, Gen 50:20. Peter declares that Jesus was delivered up by the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, yet the lawless crucifiers are morally responsible, Acts 2:23. This double agency is not a trick of grammar. It asserts that God can ordain an event, including a terrible injustice, for a holy purpose, while creatures intend and perform the evil with blame. The Creator and creature distinction secures this. God is the primary cause whose holy will uses secondary causes freely acting within their natures. The cross is the center where this concurrence takes flesh. There, the worst evil becomes the hinge of redemption, without softening the guilt of betrayal and murder. That pattern is not an exception to divine ways, but a prism that illuminates them.

2. Evil is privation and rebellion, not a substance in its own right. The biblical narrative begins with creation declared very good. The Augustinian insight is that evil is a lack of due order, a twisting of powers to wrong ends. That claim does not trivialize suffering. It locates its nature. A broken bone hurts because bones are for wholeness and movement. A lie wounds because speech is for truth. Privation clarifies why evil cannot be coeternal with God. It remains parasitic, and so ultimately defeatable. It also explains why God can eradicate evil without annihilating his creation. Redemption heals lack rather than destroying substance. Human sin introduces moral evil, and through Adam’s headship the created order is subjected to futility, Rom 8. The doctrine of the fall is not a mythic hyperlink. It is the architecture that makes sense of why natural processes now harm. It affirms that God’s judgment is righteous, while refusing to identify every particular pain with a particular sin.

3. God’s redemptive counsel uses evil without endorsing it, aiming at a greater good that is personal communion and the display of divine glory. Here the covenantal response touches the aims of soul-making and surpasses them. Virtue formation in trials is real. Yet the highest good is not autonomous character, but union with Christ and the beatific vision. The eschatological promise is that God will wipe away tears and make all things new, Rev 21. In that light, evils are not merely compensated, they are woven into a story whose end reframes the beginning. Adams is right to press the depth of horrendous evils. The covenantal reply is that God can engulf even those evils within a good so surpassing that participants can rationally say, my life is a great good to me, because I have been united to Christ who has borne my horror and transfigured it. The cross objectifies this claim. God does not stay above the fray. He enters, suffers, and conquers.

4. Epistemic humility is covenantal, not global. Skeptical theism identifies a real limit. We are small. We should not expect to know all divine reasons. Job learns this, not by an abstract quiz, but by hearing God’s address, Job 38 to 42. Yet covenantal humility is not a free pass to silence. God reveals enough to trust and obey. He names evil as evil. He commands justice, mercy, and lament. He grants means, such as prayer, medicine, and courts, to confront evils. He grounds moral reasoning so that skeptical theism does not collapse into paralysis. The church is authorized to call sin sin, to protect the vulnerable, to resist tyranny, and to grieve with hope. That is, the partiality of our knowledge functions under a clear commission. We refuse the demand for neutrality. We also refuse an appeal to mystery that disables duty.

5. Transcendental necessity. For the domain of evil to be intelligible, certain conditions must hold. We must have an objective standard of good, a teleological order, responsible agents, and a world where causes and reasons can connect. The Christian God supplies exactly these. Moral realism without God lacks ontological ground and motivational authority. Naturalism reduces moral protest to evolved aversion and so cannot vindicate the oughtness of outrage. Platonism offers abstract norms, but no providence that can bring history to a righteous end. Only if the triune God exists can we say both that Auschwitz was evil, and that justice is not a dream. The reality of evil, thus, presupposes the reality of God who defines the good and will judge the world in righteousness.

This doctrinal frame connects to practice. In worship, lament is not faithlessness but covenantal speech, as the psalms of complaint teach. In conscience, guilt that recognizes wrong echoes the divine law written on hearts. In science, the expectation of an ordered world, even a wounded one, reflects the stability of divine governance. In law, the sense of desert and proportionality mirrors retributive justice grounded in God’s character. In art, tragic form witnesses to the meaningfulness of suffering within a larger horizon.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection 1. The evidential case remains. Even if the logical problem is answered by the free will defense, rows of seemingly pointless natural evils increase the probability that no God-justifying reasons exist. If God exists, he could prevent the fawn’s agony without loss. Since such evils persist in vast number, theism is probably false.

Reply. The probability assignment presumes that our background knowledge equips us to judge the relation between any given suffering and the total set of goods and evils in the world. That assumption is unwarranted. We routinely acknowledge underdetermination in science when causal webs are deep. The Creator and creature distinction, together with the scale and complexity of history, should heighten that caution. Yet this is not an appeal to blank mystery. The covenant gives specific reasons to trust. We have a central case that teaches how God uses intended evil for good, Gen 50:20, Acts 2:23. We have a thick doctrine of providence and eschatology that promises a just end. Given this, the failure to spot God’s reasons in a local case does not license a global improbability claim. At the same time, we do not need to identify a reason to justify resisting the evil. Naming it pointless at the creaturely level is consistent with affirming God’s hidden wisdom.

Objection 2. Your appeal to sovereignty makes God the author of evil. If God ordains all that happens, then he intends that people sin, which seems to impugn his goodness and to erase human responsibility.

Reply. Christian theology has long distinguished God’s primary causation from creaturely secondary causation. God can will that an event occur as part of a wise and holy plan, while creatures will the same event for wicked ends. Scripture teaches this double intention plainly. Joseph’s brothers intend harm. God intends good. The agents differ in role and in moral quality, though the event is one. The cross is the clearest case. This is not wordplay, it is metaphysical ordering. Responsibility tracks the will of the actor in relation to the law. God’s will is holy, ordering all things to the good. Creaturely wills can be disordered, incurring blame. Compatibilist freedom, the power to act according to one’s character without external coercion, is sufficient for responsibility. The covenantal frame thus affirms both exhaustive providence and real accountability.

Objection 3. The privation account softens the reality of suffering. Telling a bereaved parent that evil is a lack of due order sounds like a conceptual evasion.

Reply. Privation identifies the metaphysical status of evil, not its experiential intensity. Saying that blindness is a lack of sight does not deny its tragedy. In fact, privation strengthens the moral protest, because it declares that the harm is a violation of created goodness. The language of lament in Scripture assumes a standard of shalom and names its absence. Moreover, privation explains how redemption can heal without destroying. God restores form and function. Christ’s resurrection is the definitive repair. This gives pastoral traction. We weep, and we hope for concrete restoration, not mere compensation.

Objection 4. The transcendental move is question begging. You assume that moral facts require God. A moral realist can say that goodness is a brute feature of the universe, or that evolved beings can track objective values, without invoking theism.

Reply. The issue is not only whether objective values exist, but whether they fit a world with rational agents, normativity with authority, final ends, and a story that can vindicate justice. Brute moral facts float. They supply no reason why persons are bound, no teleology for history, no promise that the abyss of horrendous evils will be healed. Naturalistic moral realism faces the debunking worry. If our moral beliefs are shaped by survival, what explains their reliability about stance independent norms. Theism grounds moral value in the character of God, binds duty to a lawgiver who is also lover, and ties history to a just judgment. The transcendental claim is not a deductive proof from evil to God. It is a best explanation of the preconditions for our lived moral practices of blame, praise, and hope.

Objection 5. Skeptical theism threatens moral paralysis. If you say we cannot see God’s reasons, then we can never know whether we should prevent a suffering, since preventing it might block a greater good.

Reply. That is a real worry if one makes ignorance the main premise. The covenantal response avoids this by placing humility under command. God has told us what is good. We are to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly. That includes stopping harms, protecting the weak, and punishing evil. Secondary goods that might arise from an evil do not license us to refrain from intervention. The norms are clear at the creaturely level. God governs the outcomes. We act in faith, not in paralysis. Job does not conclude in stasis. He intercedes for his friends and receives a commission to live within renewed responsibilities. So too the church.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Consider a hospital ward after a sudden earthquake. The date is January 13, 2010, in Port au Prince. Aftershocks continue. A father sits beside his injured daughter. A clinician, a chaplain, and a visiting philosophy student stand nearby. The air is thick with questions. Why this, why now, why her. No whiteboard will be rolled in. The setting demands wisdom, not only arguments.

The covenantal response reframes the scene in three moves. First, it clarifies the question. The father is not asking about modal consistency. He is asking whom to trust when the ground betrays. The chaplain acknowledges the evil. This is wrong. Bones were made to bear joy, not rubble. Naming the wrong does not undercut faith. It expresses it. Lament is faith talking, because it addresses God as the one who hears. The chaplain prays from the psalms. How long, O Lord. He reminds the father that Jesus knows pain and that God is near to the brokenhearted. He does not rush to reasons. He offers presence, truth, and prayer.

Second, the team discerns responsibilities. The clinician acts to relieve pain. The ethic is clear. Prevent what harm we can. The student offers to help coordinate supply lines. The pastor helps call extended family. Each person lives under revealed norms that do not wait upon a solved theodicy. God forbids harm and commands love of neighbor. We do not fear that stopping a bleeding wound might rob the world of a greater good. The covenant assures us that God’s providence includes our obedience. He weaves good through means, not despite them.

Third, when a quieter hour comes, the father asks again. Where was God. The chaplain speaks of Christ crucified and risen. He recalls Joseph’s line, they meant evil, God meant it for good, Gen 50:20. He points to the cross, Acts 2:23. The worst day became the hinge of salvation. That pattern does not make earthquakes good. It proclaims that no evil is ultimate, and that God has pledged to make all things new. He names the hope of resurrection and the promise of final judgment. The father asks, will justice be done for the corrupt builders and officials. The chaplain says, yes, God will judge the world in righteousness, and calls the church to seek earthly justice through transparent processes now. The father asks how to pray. The chaplain invites him to bring his anger as well as his ache to God, to ask for healing, to ask for strength to forgive, and to ask for courage to pursue justice without bitterness.

In a later campus forum, the student who stood in the ward recounts the encounter. Skeptical classmates press the Rowe argument. The student grants the force of the challenge. He admits that in the ward he did not argue Bayesian probabilities. He bore witness. Yet he reports that the impulse to call the collapse evil was unanimous and fierce. He asks his peers what grounds that judgment. One says, empathy. Another says, social contract. The student listens, then asks how empathy binds, and how a contract covers the dead who never signed. He speaks of the God who made bones for dance, then bent down in the dust when the bones broke. He claims that this God alone can underwrite the protest and the hope.

In the weeks that follow, the church lives the doctrine. They raise funds for reconstruction. They lament in worship. They catechize their children in a realism that does not flinch. They teach that God is sovereign and good and that this is not a contradiction. They remind each other that God’s governance is not an excuse for passivity. They form a partnership with a Haitian congregation that will last decades. They learn to pray Job’s questions without cynicism. The pastor preaches on Job 38 to 42, where God answers Job with God. He does not explain seismic plates. He displays his wisdom. The sermon is not a lecture on geology. It is an invitation to trust and to act. The people leave with tears and with a plan to staff a clinic.

The covenantal response does not try to peer around the corner of every evil to see a blueprint. It declares that the corner has already been turned in the death and resurrection of Jesus. It declares that the world remains broken, but not abandoned. It declares that every instance of care, every surgery, every meal shared in a shelter, is not a rebellion against providence but an enactment of God’s gracious rule through human hands. And it binds protest to hope. The cry Why, O Lord is not cancelled. It is paired with How long, O Lord, and with the promise that the one who holds the keys of death and Hades will not fail.

In the end, the covenantal answer is both argument and way. As argument, it shows that the logical problem is solved, that evidential inferences are weak, and that moral protest belongs to theists more than to materialists. As way, it teaches the church to pray, to build, to judge fairly, and to hope. The doctrine of providence and the cross cure sentimentality and nihilism at once. They tell us to measure the worst day by the third day, and to do the next right thing by the light we have. We do not possess the reader’s guide to every sorrow. We do possess promises, and we belong to the one who keeps them.
