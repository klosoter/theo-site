### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP (BREADTH)
The issue is sharp. People across cultures report encounters with the sacred, the numinous, the ultimate. They tell of awe, peace, moral transformation, and sometimes ineffable union. Yet their doctrines conflict. One says God is triune, another says God is non-dual beyond all predicates, another says the gods are many, another says there is only a cosmic emptiness. So the question arises, what do religious experiences amount to, and how should Christians respond to the plural forest they inhabit

Principal formulations appear in four clusters. First, a Jamesian and phenomenological line, which catalogs features of experience and asks about pragmatic fruits. William James in 1902 called attention to ineffability, noetic quality, transiency, and passivity, then asked whether these experiences produce saintly lives. Second, a pluralist line whose chief architect is John Hick. Hick in 1989 proposed that diverse traditions are culturally shaped responses to the Real, which is ultimately beyond our concepts, and that salvation is transformation from self-centeredness to Reality-centeredness. Third, a perennialist line, popularized by Aldous Huxley in 1945 and Huston Smith in 1958, which claims there is a common mystical core under many forms, a perennial philosophy that shines through doctrines like stained glass. Fourth, a constructivist and relativist line, associated with Steven T. Katz in 1978 and Jonathan Z. Smith in 1982, which argues there is no pure experience, all experience is theory laden, tradition specific, and therefore not evidence of a single common core nor of a single true tradition. Alongside these, contemporary analytic philosophers debate whether reports of religious experience can produce prima facie justification. Richard Swinburne stated a principle of credulity and testimony in 1979 and 1991, namely, that things are as they seem unless we have special reason to doubt, and that we should trust others in the absence of defeaters. Alvin Plantinga, in 1983 and 2000, argued that belief in God may be properly basic, grounded in a sensus divinitatis that functions properly in the right environment.

A brief historical arc clarifies the scene. Ancient texts record lives shaped by encounter. Exodus 3 presents Moses before the burning bush where God names himself I AM. Israel experienced theophanies that bound them to law, worship, and mission. Early Christians confessed the risen Christ who appeared to witnesses in the first century and poured out the Spirit. In the early modern period, two notable streams emerged. Pietists emphasized inward experience and assurance. Enlightenment critics demanded public reasons and universal principles, which pushed some theologians to retreat to feeling and dependence, as in Schleiermacher in 1799. The 19th and early 20th centuries bring James and Otto. Rudolf Otto in 1917 named the mysterium tremendum et fascinans, the fearful and attractive mystery. Meanwhile, the comparative study of religions took shape with Max Muller in the 1870s, then with Mircea Eliade in 1957 and with Wilfred Cantwell Smith in 1962, and later with Jonathan Z. Smith who insisted that comparison is a scholarly act that constructs its objects. In the late 20th century, Hick sharpened pluralism and offered a soteriological metric, while perennialists like Huston Smith defended an ancient wisdom behind the traditions. Analytic philosophers turned to the epistemology of religion, arguing about the defeasible force of religious seemings. At the same time, scientists explored correlates of mystical states, from Walter Stace and W. T. Stace on phenomenology to contemporary neuroimaging of meditation and prayer.

To steelman rival arguments, begin with the strongest pluralist case. Hick notes that there are saintly lives in many traditions. He points to figures like Gandhi in Hinduism and Theravada monks who exhibit compassion and detachment. He argues that if the fruits are essentially similar, then divergent doctrines are culturally conditioned maps of one transcendent territory. To maintain epistemic humility, Hick claims that the Real is ineffable in itself, only humanly described through myth and symbol. He invokes a Copernican revolution, moving from a Ptolemaic center where one religion is the axis to a model where the Real is central and traditions orbit as responses. This proposal aims to honor the full global range of religious life while avoiding the arrogance of exclusivism.

Next, the perennialist argument stands on empirical overlap. William James found common traits across reports. Aldous Huxley in 1945 collated texts to support a perennial core, where mystics taste a unitary reality, see an identity of Atman and Brahman, or speak of union with God, and emphasize moral transformation marked by charity and detachment. Huston Smith argued that the world religions are great wisdom traditions evolved through centuries of spiritual experimentation, and that their highest insights converge on a metaphysical unity and a moral way. If mature mystics from diverse communities agree about what is found when the self becomes quiet, the perennialist says this is strong abductive evidence for a single underlying reality.

Third, the constructivist objection pushes back. Steven Katz contends that experience comes to us already interpreted. A Christian on retreat may see the Light of Christ, a Hindu may perceive Krishna, a Buddhist reports no-self, each drawing on learned categories and ritual forms. Jonathan Z. Smith argues that the scholar constructs the object of study, that comparison is never neutral. If there is no pure, unmediated experience, the idea of a common core evaporates. Moreover, comparative projects often flatten differences and ignore the grip of doctrine on perception. The conclusion is not necessarily relativism, but it undermines appeals to an experiential common denominator.

Fourth, analytic concerns about peer disagreement question whether it is rational to remain confident in a particular religion in view of equally informed and sincere dissenters. If epistemic peers across cultures report incompatible ultimates, should not symmetry of reason pull each toward suspension or toward a conciliatory reduction of confidence

There are also naturalist critiques. Neurological studies show that meditative or prayerful states correlate with brain events. Stimulating certain regions can induce awe or sensed presence. If such states can be generated through drugs or devices, the naturalist argues, then the experiences are not veridical glimpses of the divine but misfirings of a social mammal brain. The best we can say is that they have pragmatic benefits.

Finally, inclusivism offers a middle path. Figures like Karl Rahner in the 1960s introduced the idea of the anonymous Christian, where people who have never heard of Jesus may nevertheless be saved through Christ if they respond positively to grace in their context. Evangelical inclusivists like Clark Pinnock in 1992 argued for a wideness in God s mercy while keeping Christ as the only Savior. This approach seeks to honor biblical claims about the uniqueness of Christ and to account for the apparent piety and transformation found beyond the church.

COVENANTAL/VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE (APPLICATION)
First principles orient the response. The Creator creature distinction means God is self existent and we are dependent. Revelation is self attesting, God speaks in acts and words that carry their own authority because of who he is. The noetic effects of sin mean our minds and hearts are bent, suppressing truth and making idols. Reason is analogical, finite creatures know truly because God accommodates himself to our capacity and language. This frame treats Scripture not as one hypothesis among many, but as the covenant charter by which God interprets human experience. Exodus 3 is paradigmatic, God names himself and calls Moses, and Moses understanding, fear, and mission are determined by that encounter. Jesus says he is the way, the truth, and the life, John 14:6, and Peter declares that salvation is in no one else, Acts 4:12. Romans speaks of general revelation, that God s power and deity are clearly seen, Rom 1:20, while also diagnosing suppression and exchange.

From these first principles, five theses address the issue.

1. Revelation precedes and norms experience. We do not climb to God by comparative phenomenology, God descends and speaks, then our experiences are located and tested. The burning bush did not present Moses with a formless sacred haze, it introduced the I AM who commissions and covenantally binds a people. The earliest Christians did not meet a general numinous reality, they met the risen Jesus who bore wounds and opened the Scriptures. The canon functions as the divine interpretation of divine acts, so it is the rule by which to assess all spirits and all experiences.

2. General revelation explains both the breadth and the beauty of the religious impulse, while sin explains its fragmentation. All people know God, not exhaustively but truly, because the world and conscience are saturated with his glory, Rom 1 and Ps 19 implied. This knowledge elicits awe, gratitude, and moral seriousness in many cultures. Yet because humans suppress and exchange the truth for images, they refashion the known God into metaphysical systems that displace or domesticate him. Pluralism is not surprising on this account. It is the predictable result of widespread knowledge met by universal suppression. That is why many traditions display moral insights and real transformation, common grace is at work, while also directing worship toward creaturely ultimates.

3. Christ is the covenantal criterion for testing religious claims. The eternal Son incarnate, crucified and raised in history, is the key that opens the Scriptures and judges the nations. If a religious experience leads away from the confession Jesus is Lord, it contradicts the Spirit of truth. If a practice fosters virtues that align with Christ s kingdom, it bears the marks of common grace. But final allegiance belongs to Christ, who alone reconciles sinners to the Father and gifts the Spirit to indwell. The apostolic witness insists there is no other name under heaven by which we must be saved, Acts 4:12. Dialogue and comparison are welcomed as neighbor love and as occasions for witness, yet the metric is not survival or serenity, it is conformity to Christ.

4. Warrant for belief in God is anchored in the Spirit s self attesting work, which properly basic forms of knowing can express, and which defeaters can challenge but not automatically overturn. Here Plantinga s insights help. God has designed human cognitive powers to produce belief in him in the appropriate environment, for example when contemplating creation, feeling guilt followed by the offer of forgiveness, or hearing the gospel. Such beliefs can be rational and warranted even in the face of peer disagreement. They are not blind leaps, they are responses to God s address. Traditional evidences and comparative studies have a ministerial role, they can remove obstacles and clarify misunderstandings, but the authority of revelation is not derivative from those studies.

5. The church as a worshiping and witnessing community is the embodied locus where experiences are interpreted and tried. Liturgical life, catechesis, discipline, and mission are not optional add-ons but the social form of truth. The Spirit binds us into one body where discernment occurs, where ecstatic claims are tested, where suffering is borne, and where testimonies are ordered to the gospel. This offers an alternative to private mysticism and to abstract comparison, rooting knowledge of God in the covenant practices God has appointed.

A one line transcendental necessity claim follows. For religious experience to be intelligible as truth apt, morally directive, and publicly meaningful, the triune Creator must exist and must have covenanted to reveal himself in creation and in Christ.

Doctrine links to practice in evident ways. In science, mechanisms that correlate with prayer or meditation are understood as the creaturely means by which God acts, so they do not negate divine agency. In law, religious liberty is affirmed because conscience is addressed by God, yet the church does not surrender the claim that Christ alone saves. In art and literature, the recurring themes of longing for home and transcendent beauty are read as echoes of general revelation. In pastoral care, we honor the real weight of a neighbor s spiritual experience while clarifying that only Christ reconciles and renews.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection one, The symmetry of peer disagreement should induce humility that defeats exclusivist confidence. When a reflective Muslim, a Hindu Advaitin, and a Christian all report profound encounters and hold incompatible beliefs, it seems arbitrary to stand firm on one s own tradition.

Reply, Covenantal epistemology owns humility yet refuses a symmetry premise that ignores revelation. The parity claim assumes that all parties stand as equal judges over opaque data. In Scripture, God addresses humans, not as optionally interested spectators, but as obligated hearers. General revelation supplies common ground, which explains recognition across divides. But special revelation in Christ calls for repentance and faith, which is not a posture that can be evaluated from a safe neutral distance. Moreover, the claim that symmetry mandates suspension defeats itself, since many domains require steadfastness under disagreement, for example moral knowledge or memory. The Christian sustains confidence not through tribal loyalty but through the self authenticating Word and the Spirit s witness, supplemented by public reasons and historical anchors.

Objection two, The transcendental move begs the question. You assert that only the triune God can make religious experience intelligible, but a secular account can explain normativity and meaning through evolutionary psychology, social construction, and pragmatic success.

Reply, The secular triangulation explains how beliefs arise, not how they can be truth apt and binding. Evolution can shape cognitive dispositions, but it does not generate truth tracking norms. Social construction can describe how communities fix meanings, but it cannot imbue them with obligation that binds across communities. Pragmatics can mark what works, but it cannot account for the authority of what is right. The covenantal claim is not a gap filler. It is a claim about the necessary condition for the unity of experience, reason, and obligation. Only if ultimate reality is personal, truthful, and good, can our finite, fallible practices be ordered toward truth rather than merely towards survival or cohesion. God s self attesting revelation supplies that order. This is not a neutral proof that compels assent, it is a transcendental pointer that situates the debate and exposes the borrowed capital in reductionist accounts.

Objection three, Constructivism undercuts your reliance on revelation. If all experience is theory laden, the Christian reading of experiences is simply one more traditional imposition. Your appeal to self attestation looks like a closed hermeneutical circle.

Reply, There is circle and there is spiral. Everyone brings a frame. The question is whether the frame can account for the data, sustain internal coherence, and deliver lived wisdom. The Christian circle is virtuous rather than vicious because it is underwritten by a God who speaks and acts in history, whose words interpret his deeds, and whose Spirit bears witness in the heart and in the church. The circle does not foreclose testing. Scripture itself commands testing the spirits and discerning fruits. The constructivist insight is welcome as a chastening of naive appeals to raw experience. It pushes us back to Christ and to ecclesial practices rather than to private impressions. But constructivism does not eliminate revelation. It sharpens our dependence on it.

Objection four, Neuroscience debunks. If a magnet on the temporal lobe or a dose of psilocybin can generate mystical unity or a sensed presence, then the experiences are suspect as disclosures of reality.

Reply, Correlation is not identity and mechanism does not equal meaninglessness. God made embodied creatures whose minds function through brains. We expect experiences of God to have neural correlates. The fact that such states can be induced by artifice proves only that our faculties can be manipulated, not that their ordinary deliverances are false. We do not conclude that love is false because hormones can be tweaked, nor that perception is false because illusions exist. The right response is to seek defeaters, ask whether an experience coheres with Scripture, whether it issues in Christlike fruit, and whether it occurred under conditions likely to produce error. Swinburne s defeasible stance is serviceable here, subordinated to biblical testing.

Objection five, Inclusivism honors God s love and global diversity better than your crisp exclusivism. Why not affirm that God saves through Christ while allowing that many are saved without explicit faith

Reply, The wideness of mercy is real, and Scripture hints that God s saving work reaches further than we can map. Yet the apostolic pattern joins the uniqueness of Christ with the command to preach and the urgency of faith. Appeals to anonymous faith easily harden into a principle that dulls mission and weakens the offense of the cross. A covenantal posture refuses to map the borders of grace while refusing to mute the name of Jesus. It emphasizes that any salvation anywhere is through Christ alone, and that the ordinary means appointed are proclamation and sacrament in the life of the church, which binds conscience to the revealed name.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Scenario, A campus forum hosts a night on Mysticism across traditions. A Buddhist monk, a Sufi poet, a secular neuroscientist, and a Christian pastor each share. Students ask whether these experiences all point to the same reality. A Christian student, Leah, confides afterward that a silent retreat led by a Zen center gave her a dissolving of self and deep peace. She wonders if this means all religions are basically true, and whether her church is too narrow.

How does the covenantal response reframe the questions, responsibilities, and hope here

First, reframe the question. Rather than asking whether all experiences point to the same reality in the abstract, ask who is speaking in and through the experience. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob names himself in Exodus 3 and calls his people into a history of promise fulfilled in Christ. Jesus is not an instance of a universal pattern, he is the Lord who fulfills Israel s story and gathers the nations. The relevant test is therefore not sameness of phenomenology, but conformity to the gospel. Did the experience lead Leah toward gratitude to the Father, confession of Jesus as Lord, and deeper love of neighbor, or toward generic acquiescence to an impersonal absolute

Second, respect what is true and good. In common grace, practices of silence can expose our restless hearts, calm anxious rumination, and prepare us to listen. You can affirm the gift of quiet and the moral fruit of patience. You can note that Christians have disciplines of silence, from the Psalms to the desert fathers, ordered to prayer to the living God. This meets Leah where she is without endorsing the metaphysics that denies a Creator creature relation.

Third, name the role of interpretive frameworks. Explain that experiences are always interpreted within some story. The Zen center told one story about no-self and emptiness. The gospel tells a different story about the triune God and the believer hidden with Christ in God. Leah s task is not to deny her experience but to receive it under the Word, asking what the Lord might be teaching. Perhaps the experience was a mercy that quieted her anxious striving and made space for repentance and trust. Perhaps it exposed a hunger for communion that no technique can satisfy. Help her bring the experience into prayer and into the counsel of elders.

Fourth, invite her into the church s communal discernment. Encourage Leah to share her experience with mature saints who will listen without panic, ask good questions, and guide her toward Scripture and wise practice. The church can teach her how to test experiences, to avoid pride or despair, and to order disciplines toward Christ. The Lord s Supper anchors her in the visible Word, re-centering her on the crucified and risen Lord. The singing of Psalms and the preaching of Christ will gradually retexture her inner life.

Fifth, in the public forum, witness with clarity and charity. When asked whether all mystics meet the same God, the pastor can say, We recognize that many neighbors are touched by realities that seem bigger than themselves and that often lead to moral change. We give thanks for such gifts. Yet God has not left himself unnamed. He has spoken in creation and above all in his Son. Jesus does not offer a technique but himself. He calls us to repent and believe, and he pours out his Spirit. So we invite you to consider him, to test the spirits by his words and his cross, and to bring your experiences under his light. Such a word honors common grace, avoids needless offense, and still confesses Christ.

Finally, give Leah a horizon of hope. Tell her that the diversity of religious experience does not leave her in a maze. The Lord is not hidden forever. The day is coming when the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. The pluralism of now is a time of patience and mission. The promise is not the flattening of all differences into a common core, but the gathering of nations into one new song around the Lamb. In that light, Leah can walk with neighbors, learn, love, and witness, without surrendering the name that saves.
