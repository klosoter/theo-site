### TITLE
Science, Creation, and Providence

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Locus, the relation of scientific explanation, laws of nature, and divine action across creation, providence, and miracle, with sub-issues of methodological naturalism, contingency versus necessity of laws, evolution and design, and the coordination of Scripture and science.
- Rival approaches, metaphysical naturalism that denies God and closes causal explanation within nature, deism that posits an originating Creator who no longer acts specially, theistic evolution that sees God creating through evolutionary processes, and Intelligent Design that argues for detectable marks of agency in nature.
- Representative figures, Robert Boyle, chemist and theist of the seventeenth century, David Hume, critic of miracles in the eighteenth century, John Polkinghorne, physicist-theologian in the late twentieth century, and Alvin Plantinga, analytic philosopher of religion in the early twenty-first century.
- Method tension, whether evidence can be assessed from a neutral standpoint or whether all inquiry proceeds by presupposed revelation and covenant commitments.
- Thesis, only the Creator-creature distinction and covenantal providence of the Triune God make the intelligibility of science, the contingency and stability of laws, and the rational evaluation of miracles possible, and these truths free Christians to practice rigorous science without absolutizing methodological naturalism.
- Pastoral angle, guidance for Christians in the lab or classroom to unite prayerful trust in providence with disciplined methods, to speak truthfully about design and evolution, and to carry hope into settings of illness and research setbacks.

### ESSAY
LANDSCAPE MAP - BREADTH
The issue is simple to pose yet deep in its implications. How do science, creation, and providence interrelate. At stake are the meaning of laws of nature, the place of God in the ongoing course of the world, the possibility and evidential status of miracles, and the evaluation of origins theories, especially evolution and design. Principal formulations include metaphysical naturalism, which says reality is exhausted by nature understood in physical terms, methodological naturalism, which codifies how science is to be done by appeal only to natural causes, deism, which allows for a Creator who no longer acts within the world, and various theistic proposals, among them theistic evolution and Intelligent Design. The classical Christian doctrine of creation and providence affirms creation from nothing, the Creator-creature distinction, secondary causes, and God s continuous governance and concurrence with all events. The central intellectual pressures are these, to give an account of the contingency and reliability of the world s order, to secure norms for inference and explanation, to weigh empirical data about origins, and to determine whether and how divine action can be said to occur within an ordered world.

A brief historical arc sets the stage. Ancient philosophical traditions vacillated between chance, fate, and purpose. Aristotle in the fourth century BC explained change through four causes and teleology, while the Stoics stressed a providential Logos that ordered all. The biblical witness cut across both, declaring that God freely created all things by his word, Gen 1-2, that he feeds creatures and moves winds and waters, Ps 104, and that all things hold together in Christ, Col 1:15-17. Early Christian and medieval thinkers drew this together. Augustine around 400 affirmed creation ex nihilo and saw created natures equipped with potencies that unfold under God s providence. Thomas Aquinas in the 1260s defended secondary causes and God s universal causality, so that the order of nature has integrity while never escaping divine governance.

The early modern period reframed discussions with the rise of experimental science and the language of laws. Robert Boyle published The Sceptical Chymist in 1661, promoting corpuscular philosophy and experimental rigor. He insisted that nature s laws express God s will and that reverent study of secondary causes glorifies the Creator. Isaac Newton s Principia of 1687 revealed mathematical regularities in motion and gravitation, yet Newton also wrote extensively on God s dominion and, controversially, suggested that God s periodic action might be needed to stabilize the solar system. The concept of laws took center stage. Theologically, many theists saw laws as divine ordinances, while some Enlightenment figures leaned toward deism, imagining a world-machine that once wound no longer needed the watchmaker. In 1748 David Hume published An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, pressing two arguments with enduring force. First, his critique of induction questioned how we can rationally expect the future to resemble the past. Second, his section On Miracles framed miracles as violations of laws of nature and argued that the weight of uniform experience and the fallibility of testimony make belief in miracles irrational. These moves recast debates about providence and special divine action.

In 1859 Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. His mechanism of natural selection operating over long periods of variation introduced a powerful unifying story for biology. Some read Darwin through naturalist lenses, interpreting life s complexity and apparent design as the result of unguided processes. Others proposed a deistic reading, God set the stage and stepped back. Others still pursued theistic evolution, holding that God created through evolutionary means. The twentieth century elevated methodological naturalism as a default rule for scientific practice, reinforced by the triumphs of physics, chemistry, and biology. Logical positivism in the 1920s attempted to restrict meaningful claims to what could be empirically verified, a program later toned down but still influential in spirit.

Two late twentieth century streams widened the debate. First, the Intelligent Design movement argued that certain biological and cosmological features exhibit hallmarks of design that cannot be explained by unguided processes. Key figures include Michael Behe, Darwin s Black Box in 1996, with the concept of irreducible complexity, and William Dembski, The Design Inference in 1998, with specified complexity. Second, physicist turned priest John Polkinghorne, beginning with One World in 1986 and continuing in works through the 1990s, advanced an account of divine action consonant with modern science. He emphasized God s providential governance acting subtly within the openness of chaotic and quantum systems, not as violation but as top-down causation that is non-coercive. In philosophy, Alvin Plantinga argued in 2011 that there is deep concord between theism and science and superficial conflict, while there is superficial concord between naturalism and science and deep conflict. The literature on laws of nature likewise diversified, with Humeans treating laws as descriptive regularities in the best systematization and non-Humeans positing real necessitation or powers.

To steelman rival views, consider three. First, the methodological naturalist case. Science progresses by seeking natural causes and testable mechanisms. When we attribute an event to divine action, we risk halting inquiry, substituting mystery for method. The record since 1600 shows that phenomena once mysterious often yielded to natural explanation, from lightning to disease to biological diversity. To retain explanatory traction, science must be demarcated by methodological naturalism. The rule is not metaphysical but pragmatic and has earned its keep. Second, the Humean evidential case against miracles. A law of nature is an exceptionally well confirmed regularity. The probability that such a regularity is violated is extraordinarily low. Testimony and reports are subject to bias, error, and deceit. Hence, when weighing whether a miracle has occurred, rational agents should prefer a hidden natural explanation over a violation of the law, since that hypothesis will virtually always be more probable on the evidence. Third, the theistic evolution case against design inference. Standard population genetics and the extended synthesis show how complexity can arise without foresight. Appeals to irreducible complexity underestimate the scaffolding effects of co-option and redundancy and fail to engage the full literature. Appeals to specified complexity smuggle in dubious probability assignments. Better to say that God sovereignly ordains creation through law-like processes, and that Scripture s creation affirmations do not settle the mechanism. In addition, divine action should be modeled as non-interventionist, operating through the causal openness of nature so as not to conflict with scientific description.

COVENANTAL VAN TILLIAN RESPONSE - APPLICATION
Begin with first principles. God the Creator is distinct from the world. He is self-sufficient and speaks authoritatively in Scripture and in the created order. His revelation is self-attesting, not subject to a higher tribunal. Human knowing is analogical, we think God s thoughts after him at a creaturely level, never as peers who survey reality from nowhere. The fall has noetic effects, so that human reasoning is bent away from God, suppressing the clarity of divine power and deity in the things that have been made, Rom 1:20. These principles shape how we address science.

Four theses follow.

1. Laws of nature are covenantal regularities of the triune God who creates and sustains. Scripture speaks of God commanding the morning and setting bounds to the sea, Job texts and Ps 104, and of all things holding together in Christ, Col 1:15-17. This language does not turn every event into miracle, nor does it degrade laws into brute patterns. Rather, it frames the order of the world as a faithfulness of God to his own wisdom and word. Because God is free, the order is contingent, not necessary. Because God is faithful, the order is stable, discoverable, and rational. This biblical grammar underwrites the scientific enterprise better than rival metaphysics. Boyle s piety was not romantic decoration but conceptual support. He took law language to mean God s ordinary way with his world. Christian theology thus refuses the dichotomy of deism and occasionalism. Secondary causes are real and robust, since God wills his world to be creaturely. Providence is comprehensive and intimate, since God works all things in and through those causes.

2. Methodological naturalism is a limited tool, not a totalizing creed. A Christian gladly studies secondary causes as such, and in the lab abstains from invoking immediate divine action as a mechanistic placeholder. That is methodological discipline. Yet the same Christian must not absolutize this tool as the definition of rationality. The domain of scientific investigation is not coextensive with the domain of reality. The resurrection of Jesus, an event attested by history and worship, is not a mechanistic process to be reproduced in a lab. The acceptance or rejection of such an event is not a failure of scientific resolve but a recognition of domains. When the issue is origins and singularities, repeated experiment gives way to retrodiction and consilience. Within that space, metaphysical and theological commitments inevitably guide model choice and inference. The right covenantal posture is to keep the tool sharp in its place and to refuse its usurpation in questions of worldview and history of salvation.

3. Science presupposes the providential harmony of mind and world. Induction, lawlikeness, and the normativity of reason are not free-floating. If the world were not the expression of a rational Logos, if human minds were not fashioned in the image of God, if the course of nature were not governed by faithful providence, then the expectation that the future will resemble the past, the trust that elegant mathematics maps onto physical reality, and the obligation to follow evidence wherever it leads would be groundless. Here is the transcendental claim in one line, for the domain of empirical science to be intelligible, the world must be created and providentially governed by a personal, rational God whose image-bearers are fitted to know it. Hume identified the problem of induction, but his framework cannot solve it. A best system description explains why we choose certain summaries, not why the world continues in a lawlike way. Evolutionary stories might explain how beliefs that promote survival arise, but they do not deliver the normative force of logic or the modal texture of natural necessity. Plantinga sharpened this point in 2011, arguing that naturalism undercuts its own epistemic trust. The Christian does not prove God from science but shows that science rings true within the theater of creation and covenant.

4. The doctrine of providence secures both regularity and miracle without conflict. Miracles are not violations that pit God against his own laws. They are extraordinary acts by which God brings about events by his will without employing the usual created means. The distinction between ordinary providence and special providence preserves the reliability of science while honoring the freedom of the Lord of nature. The Red Sea, the virgin conception, and the resurrection are historically located works with theological meaning, not gaps plugged in to cover ignorance. Because God upholds the ordinary, a miracle is recognizable as extraordinary. Because God is free, an extraordinary work does not undermine the rationality of the ordinary. Polkinghorne was right to stress that God is not a competitive cause among others. Where he erred, and where deism errs more gravely, is in treating special acts as unseemly impositions. Scripture celebrates both God s feeding of lions through nature and his raising of the dead. The metaphysic of concursus, affirmed by Augustine and Aquinas and renewed by Reformed scholastics, remains a powerful grammar for value-laden science.

Practice follows doctrine. The church should catechize believers in the whole counsel of God so that young scientists enter the lab with confidence and humility. Scientists can be trained to distinguish method from metaphysics and to discern where worldview pressure points occur. Christian scholars in law or policy can urge institutions to allow philosophy of science to be taught alongside science, clarifying the status of methodological naturalism. Pastors can preach Ps 104 to foster wonder and sober labor. Parents can help children see vocation as service within providence. In the scientific guild, Christians should be known as exacting researchers who resist sensationalism and acknowledge uncertainty, who do not invoke design where proximate causes are adequate, and who also resist reduction of mind and meaning to mechanism.

OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES
Objection one. The transcendental move is a disguised circularity. You claim that science presupposes God. A naturalist can claim that science presupposes nature and logic, full stop. Why grant your circle rather than mine.

Reply. All ultimate commitments exhibit a kind of circularity because they answer to what is taken as the final authority. The question is not whether there is circularity but whether the circle is wide enough to include and explain the preconditions of inquiry. The Christian circle unifies ontology and normativity. It grounds the being of a contingent lawful world, the fit between mathematics and reality, the trustworthiness yet fallibility of human cognition as image-bearing, and the moral obligation to love truth. The naturalist circle can posit logic as brute and nature as just what happens, but this leaves the normativity of reason unaccounted for and the persistence of law unexplained. This is not a proof that compels assent so much as a demonstration of explanatory necessity.

Objection two. Methodological naturalism is the vital engine of science. Dilute it with talk of providence or miracles and you invite intellectual laziness and anti-scientific tendencies.

Reply. The covenantal view affirms the methodological rule within its right domain. In the lab and field, one seeks secondary causes. Invoking providence is not a mechanistic move. Rather, it is a theological posture that frames the practice. The complaint confuses two levels. Scientific method is a technical discipline aimed at models and mechanisms. Philosophy and theology interpret what such success means. The Christian calls for strict methods in work and for principled limits to method in worldview. Historically, many founders of modern science operated precisely with this combination. Boyle championed experiment while insisting that the stability of nature reflects divine wisdom. Only an absolutized methodological naturalism would forbid even historical miracles or the integration of theology and science at the level of interpretation.

Objection three. Miracles contradict laws. A law entails that such and such cannot happen. If a miracle happens, the law is falsified, which undermines science. If the law is not universal, it is not a law.

Reply. The premise is mistaken. Laws, on the Christian view, describe the ordinary course of God s governance of creatures. A miracle is not a contradiction to a law but an act by the lawgiver beyond the scope of ordinary description. A law that models pendulum motion is not contradicted when a person grabs the bob and stops it. That was a different cause acting. Similarly, a miracle introduces the direct act of God for a particular purpose. This does not undermine the law s utility for all the cases it was meant to cover. Indeed, the very recognition of miracle presupposes a stable backdrop of lawlike order.

Objection four. Theistic evolution optionality and design talk create confusion. Either evolution suffices and design is scientifically idle, or design is needed and evolution falters. You cannot have both method and miracle.

Reply. The dichotomy is false. Evolution names a family of processes at multiple scales, some of which are well supported and others more speculative. Design names an inference to agency when certain patterns or informational structures appear. In many contexts, proximate mechanisms do much of the explanatory work and design is a higher level interpretation about ultimate origins and meaning. When design arguments are made in a scientific register, as in information theoretic critiques, they should be evaluated on their technical merits. Christians should avoid overstating claims and should be happy to credit natural selection with robust powers where data support it. At the same time, they can maintain that the very possibility of lawlike evolutionary processes, the origin of life s information-rich structures, and the alignment of the universe s fine-tuning with life-friendly constants, point beyond mere mechanism to the wisdom of the Creator.

Objection five. Evolutionary naturalism can underwrite rational trust. Cognitive capacities were selected because they correlate with successful action. That gives a pragmatic credential to induction and logic strong enough for science.

Reply. Pragmatic success is not the same as truth tracking or normativity. One can imagine creatures whose beliefs are systematically false but whose behavior is adaptive. The mapping from fitness to truth is not transparent. In any case, the claim that logic is binding because it is adaptive confuses the reason for the origin of a belief with the reason to hold a belief. The imperative to follow argument where it leads is not a byproduct of evolutionary advantage. Plantinga s challenge is forceful here. If our cognitive faculties are aimed at survival rather than truth, high levels of skepticism about any complex metaphysical thesis, including naturalism itself, follow. A covenantal account, by contrast, sees cognitive powers as designed for truth, damaged by sin, and gradually repaired through regeneration and disciplined study.

CASE STUDY AND PASTORAL ANGLE
Consider a molecular biology lab in 2025 working on CRISPR-based therapies for a pediatric genetic disease. A Christian postdoctoral fellow, Maria, is responsible for designing experiments to correct a lethal mutation in a mouse model. Her project relies on stochastic processes at multiple levels, from the distribution of editing outcomes to variable expression in tissues. She works under protocols that demand rigorous control experiments and statistical analysis. In her weekly lab meeting, a colleague jokes that miracles will be needed for the therapy to work in vivo. Outside the lab, Maria teaches a volunteer class at her church, where a teenager asks whether evolution disproves Genesis and whether praying for a cure is pointless if everything follows laws.

The covenantal response reframes Maria s world. First, it gives her intellectual confidence to practice methodological discipline without metaphysical anxiety. She seeks secondary causes as a scientist because she believes God graciously endowed creation with ordered powers. Ps 104 becomes a working doxology, God causes the grass to grow, yet agriculture is learned skill and climate science. Maria prays each morning for clarity, patience, and integrity. She does not pray for a laboratory miracle that would substitute for careful design and controls. She prays that God would bless the ordinary through ordinary means, acknowledging that God is the giver of every good gift that comes through those means. Her ordinary failures are not omens of divine disfavor but part of the thorny condition of a fallen world that requires perseverance.

Second, the covenantal frame helps her interpret randomness. The probability distributions in her edit outcomes are models of creaturely processes, not signs of ontic chaos. God s providence includes both deterministic patterns and indeterministic features at the quantum and biological levels. Either way, his counsel stands. That frees Maria from superstition and from the temptation to read divine messages in every fluctuation. It also frees her to be attentive to anomalies as possible clues, rather than embarrassment. She reads Boyle for encouragement, knowing that piety and experiment have been friends since the seventeenth century.

Third, the pastoral angle shapes her speech. In the classroom, she teaches students that Gen 1-2 speaks truth about God s creative authorship, the goodness of the world, and the image-bearing vocation of humanity. She distinguishes those theological claims from technical questions about mechanisms. She explains that some Christians hold a theistic evolution view and others critique parts of evolutionary theory, that the church has space for charitable debate about mechanism while united on creation and providence. She tells the teenager that prayer is meaningful because God governs the world and uses means. Doctors and therapies are among those means. Praying that God would heal does not compete with research but accompanies it. She cites Col 1:15-17 to anchor the conversation in Christ, in whom and for whom all things were created and in whom all things hold together.

Fourth, she addresses the lab s joke about miracles. At coffee she says, with good humor, that the project requires more than miracles. It requires grant funding, good pipetting, honest reporting, and patient troubleshooting. She adds that her faith does not forbid the idea that God might do something extraordinary. But in this context, she expects the ordinary means to be the channel of any good outcome. The joke turns into a conversation about what counts as an explanation. Maria is not defensive. She recognizes method s domain and testifies to meaning beyond the method. Her colleagues see that a covenantal theist does not stop inquiry but deepens its purpose.

Finally, she confronts suffering. The pediatric disease means that children will die while therapies are being developed. The weight of this reality can crush researchers. Providence does not offer bromides. It gives a cross and a resurrection. In pastoral conversation, Maria tells a grieving parent that the lab is working under God s gaze to push back a fragment of the curse. She neither guarantees success nor despair. She invites prayer and involvement, explains risks truthfully, and commits to publish results fully whether they favor the hypothesis or not. The ethics review board finds in her a trustworthy voice who can articulate why human life is not raw material and why scientific excellence includes moral excellence.

The scenario generalizes. In a courtroom where intelligent design is debated, the covenantal stance counsels careful distinctions between science as practice and philosophy of science as interpretation. In a campus forum, it recommends modeling charitable debate between a theistic evolutionist and an ID proponent, clarifying shared commitments about creation and the image of God and honest disagreement about inference and mechanism. In a hospital ward, it supplies a grammar for prayer that neither denies medicine nor idolizes it. Across these spaces, the core is the same, the world is God s world, lawfulness is a gift, science is a vocation, miracles are the free acts of the Lord, and hope is grounded not in technique but in the faithfulness of the Creator Redeemer.
