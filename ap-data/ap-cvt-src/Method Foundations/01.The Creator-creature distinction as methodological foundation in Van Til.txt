### ESSAY
The driving tension for Reformed method in the twentieth century was simple to state yet hard to resolve. How can finite creatures know the infinite Creator without reducing him to a manageable object or dissipating knowledge into mystery. Cornelius Van Til, born in 1895 and teaching at Westminster Seminary from 1929, made the Creator-creature distinction the architectonic answer. God is self existent and self interpreting. The world exists by his decree and is revelatory of him. Knowledge, therefore, is not a neutral traffic between abstract minds and bare facts, but covenantal fellowship in which creatures, as image bearers, think analogically after God.

The lineage of that stance reaches back before Van Til. John Calvin, 1509 to 1564, spoke of accommodation and the sensus divinitatis. God stoops to our capacity and plants a natural awareness of himself. Knowledge of God is duplex, as Creator and as Redeemer, and both are by revelation. The Westminster Confession of 1646 gathered this into principial form. God is the principium essendi of theology and Scripture is the principium cognoscendi. Francis Turretin, 1623 to 1687, refined the archetypal and ectypal distinction. Only God comprehends God. Created theology is a true but finite ectype of the divine archetype, grounded in revelation. Herman Bavinck, 1854 to 1921, rearticulated this in his Reformed Dogmatics published 1895 to 1901. He insisted that all knowledge is organic and that grace restores nature rather than abolishing it. Abraham Kuyper, 1837 to 1920, added a cultural and epistemic antithesis in the Stone Lectures of 1898. Regenerate and unregenerate minds stand opposed as principled communities, yet common grace preserves a shared world.

Van Til drew these lines together under the pressure of modernity. Having studied at Princeton in the 1920s and joining the Orthodox Presbyterian Church founded in 1936, he faced the confidence of Enlightenment rationalism and the incremental compromises of liberal Protestantism. His proposal has three strokes. First, the Creator-creature distinction entails that all human predication about God and about the world is analogical. We neither speak univocally with God, since only God thinks as God, nor merely equivocally, since God has condescended to make himself known. Our knowledge is true, yet it is never self sufficient. Second, because the triune God interprets every fact by his decree and providence, there are no brute facts. There are no items in the world that are uninterpreted and available to autonomous minds. Third, since the human mind is covenantal and ethically oriented, there is no neutral reason. Reason is ministerial under revelation or it is idolatrous in its posture, even when it uses correct inferences.

These strokes are not innovations ex nihilo. Turretin had already marked off archetypal and ectypal knowledge to block univocity. Calvin had treated accommodation to defend the truthfulness of human words about God without claiming adequacy. Bavinck had warned that all facts are God created and God related, so there is no pure nature sealed from grace. Kuyper had fixed the antithesis, yet also spoke of common grace as shared ground in practice, though not neutral ground in principle. Van Til radicalized the implications, especially against the temptation to start methodology from a supposed common platform with the unbeliever.

The analogical point can be sharpened. Thomas Aquinas, 1225 to 1274, taught analogical predication of divine names and a robust natural theology in the Summa Theologiae written from 1265 to 1274. Van Til saw in Thomism a two tier scheme in which an autonomous natural reason could generate knowledge of God from being as such, and where analogy rode on the back of a supposed continuity of being. He countered with revelational ontology. Being is not a continuum. Creator and creature are categorically distinct, yet coordinated by covenantal revelation. So while he preserved the Thomist insight that predication is neither univocal nor equivocal, he denied that analogia entis as a ladder could raise a fallen knower to God. The ladder is replaced by the ark of revelation.

The denial of brute facts follows. If God interprets reality, then facts and laws are correlative within the plan of God. The world is not a heap on which we place our conceptual nets. Rather, it is a structured creation that declares the glory of God. Van Til liked to say, we must think God's thoughts after him. Theologically, this rests on providence and covenant. Historically, it answers the empiricist myth of the naked given popular from 1900 to 1950 in various forms of logical positivism. A datum is always already situated. The only question is whether its divinely given meaning is acknowledged.

No neutral reason is the ethical corollary. Kuyper had drawn lines of antithesis in 1898. Van Til deployed them. The natural man suppresses the truth. This is not a denial of logic, which belongs to the image of God and is used by all. It is a denial that logical operations float free of heart commitments. In The Defense of the Faith, first published in 1955, Van Til argued that Christian method must presuppose the triune God and his Word. One can argue ad hominem, showing the internal collapse of unbelieving systems, and then present the Christian frame as the only context in which rationality, science, and morality cohere. The apologist does not abandon common ground, but insists that common ground is itself God's ground.

The most serious objection is the charge of skepticism. If we never know anything univocally, do we know anything at all, and if our method denies neutral starting points, how can we persuade. Gordon Clark, 1902 to 1985, pressed this in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1944 to 1948. He maintained that man can know the same propositions God knows, though not exhaustively. Van Til sometimes wrote as if no item of human knowledge is identical in content with God's. The controversy exposed ambiguity. If every statement about God is analogical, is there a shared proposition, or are we forever circling an unreachable center.

The Reformed scholastic resources answer the worry if handled carefully. Turretin's archetypal and ectypal distinction protects objectivity without claiming parity. God knows by simple intuition and self identity. We know by receptive concepts mediated through revelation. There can be identity of propositional content, such as God is light, while there is non identity of the mode and ground of knowing. Bavinck's organic model adds that truth is a coherent whole. Our knowledge grows within the covenant community under Scripture, by the Spirit, and through disciplined inquiry. Calvin's accommodation assures that God speaks in human language truly, so that when Scripture asserts historical and doctrinal claims, we are not left with symbols empty of referents. In other words, analogy is not equivocation, because revelation fixes reference and content, though not comprehension.

Aquinas deserves a more measured assessment in this light. His analogical predication was an anti univocal strategy. His account of natural knowledge of God, however, rests on a metaphysic of being more continuous than Van Til allows. If one adopts his five ways as independent proofs validated by autonomous reason, the method conflicts with Van Til. If one receives them as reasoned articulations of what general revelation already displays under divine providence, the distance narrows. The difference is principial starting point. Van Til insists that even general revelation is God's speech, so rational arguments are ministerial reflections, not foundations.

Methodologically, then, the Creator-creature distinction offers coherence. It defines analogical knowledge as covenantal contact with the true God. It denies brute facts by rooting every datum in divine interpretation. It refuses neutral reason by insisting on the heart's posture before God. The charge of skepticism is answered by the principia of theology, the self authenticating Word attended by the Spirit, and by the scholastic distinction of modes of knowing. The risk remains if one slips into rhetoric that erases propositional identity. Later Reformed thinkers have clarified this point, arguing that Van Til's best insights require affirming shared propositions under asymmetric knowing.

Reception has been vigorous. Within the OPC the Clark debate forced careful definitions. In the broader Reformed world, Van Til influenced apologetics through Westminster textbooks across the 1950s to the 1970s. His stress on no brute facts anticipated critiques of the given in analytic philosophy after 1960. His rejection of neutrality resonated with post critical epistemology. Yet his polemics against Thomism have been contested by those who read Aquinas as more christologically integrated. The legacy across the late twentieth century is a disciplined Reformed epistemology that is confessional, historically rooted, and alert to the moral dimension of knowing.

To sum up, Van Til made the Creator-creature distinction into a method that protects divine transcendence and secures human knowledge as analogical fellowship under revelation.
