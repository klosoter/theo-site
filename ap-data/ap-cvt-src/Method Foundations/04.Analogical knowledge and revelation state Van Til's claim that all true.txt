### ESSAY
Cornelius Van Til built his method on a bold thesis that all true predication about God is analogical. That line draws a boundary. It signals allegiance to the Creator creature distinction, and it guards against two errors. On one side is univocity, the idea that human and divine predication share the same content without remainder. On the other side is equivocity, where our words about God do not touch the truth at all. Van Til's claim resists both, insisting that our knowledge is genuine, but it is also dependent, ectypal, and covenantally situated under revelation.

Aquinas supplies the classic grammar of analogy. Writing in the Summa Theologiae between 1265 and 1274, Thomas treats the names of God in Prima Pars question 13. He argues that terms like good, wise, and being apply to God and creatures neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically. The metaphysical backdrop is participation. Creatures have a derived act of being, while God is ipsum esse subsistens, subsistent being itself. Thus creaturely goodness is a likeness of the divine goodness, really related to God as its cause. Aquinas further distinguishes analogy of attribution and analogy of proportionality. Milk is healthy by attribution because it causes health in an animal. A creature is good by attribution because it receives its perfection from God. Proportionality names the ordered likeness between modes of perfection in God and creatures. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 reinforces the pattern, stating that any similarity between Creator and creature is always exceeded by a greater dissimilarity. Within this scheme, natural theology has a principled place. The Five Ways argue from effects to cause, and theological language follows suit, preserving both truth and transcendence.

Karl Barth detonated the debate by rejecting the analogia entis. In 1931 he wrote that the analogy of being is the invention of Antichrist. He had in view the neo Thomist project exemplified by Erich Przywara's Analogia Entis of 1932, which sought to cable together creaturely being and divine being through a formal similarity. For Barth, revelation interrupts rather than confirms a continuum. In Church Dogmatics volume 1 part 1 of 1932, he construes knowledge of God as grace given through the Word and Spirit, with Christ as the sole point of contact. Hence his counter is the analogia fidei, an analogy grounded in the correspondence faith has to revelation, not in a metaphysical ladder. The Barmen Declaration of 1934 gave ecclesial stakes to this conviction, rejecting natural points of contact in the face of ideological captivity.

Van Til stands between these giants. He shares with Aquinas the conviction that theological language must be analogical, not univocal. He shares with Barth the insistence that revelation, not human autonomy, is the standard of knowledge. Yet he differs from both. Unlike Aquinas, he will not underwrite a natural theology reached by neutral reason. Unlike Barth, he will not suspend natural revelation, for he reads Romans 1 as binding. His synthesis is covenantal and trinitarian. God's self contained triune being is the principium essendi of all predication, and God's revelation, both general and special, is the principium cognoscendi. In The Defense of the Faith of 1955 and A Christian Theory of Knowledge of 1969, he repeats a refrain. Man must think God's thoughts after him. Our propositions are true when they submit to the authoritative interpretation of God, the one who knows all facts exhaustively and in their systematic coherence. Human knowledge, then, is analogical, conditioned by the Creator creature distinction and by the covenant relation in which God addresses us.

The Clark Van Til debate in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church put this claim under pressure. The controversy ran from 1943 to 1948 and centered on Gordon Clark's licensure and ordination. Clark, an analytic and Aristotelian minded philosopher, affirmed divine incomprehensibility with respect to extent. We do not know all that God knows. Yet he contended that at least some propositions are identical in meaning for God and for man. Two plus two is four, or God is holy, would have the same content though known differently. For Clark, without some univocal core, knowledge collapses into skepticism. Van Til and a group of complainants in 1944 charged that this position compromised the Creator creature distinction. If the content is identical, the divine mind and the human mind share a zone of common meaning apart from revelational authority, and the sovereignty of God over meaning is reduced.

The Assembly appointed committees and received reports. By 1946 a compromise was reached that did not explicitly condemn either party. Clark later withdrew to the United Presbyterian Church of North America in 1948. The outcome did not resolve the issue on paper. Yet the debate clarified the stakes. For Van Til, incomprehensibility is both quantitative and qualitative. God's thoughts are not only more, they are categorically archetypal. Our knowledge is ectypal and dependent. Hence all predication is analogical, not only with respect to God's attributes, but also with respect to logic and facts. Critics accused Van Til of equivocation. He replied that analogical knowledge is genuine and objective because it is anchored in divine revelation and the covenantal relation. The accusation and reply mark a turning point in Reformed epistemology in America.

John Frame, a student and later colleague, developed a mediating exposition. In The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God in 1987 and subsequent works, he frames knowledge in terms of Lordship and perspectivalism. Every act of knowing involves the normative perspective of God's authoritative standards, the situational perspective of the world God made, and the existential perspective of the self made in God's image. Frame retains Van Til's analogical control belief. All knowledge is covenantal and therefore analogical to God's knowledge. Yet he is ready to say that propositions can be the same in content when considered under God's norm, while still being creaturely in mode and context. Frame thereby endorses a constrained univocity at the level of sentence content under the canopy of covenantal analogy. He attempts to resolve the Clark critique without abandoning Van Til's core.

K Scott Oliphint carries these themes into a contemporary doctrine of God. In God with Us of 2012 and Covenantal Apologetics of 2013, he argues that God, in condescension, freely takes on covenantal properties without change in essence. This proposal supplies a metaphysical account of revelation and accommodation. When Scripture predicates temporal and relational terms of God, those predicates are true because God has freely related himself to the covenant order in a way that is analogically real. Oliphint uses this to defend classical attributes while explaining how covenantal revelation yields proper predication. The result is a sharpened version of Van Til's thesis. Predication is analogical, because it occurs within God's voluntary relation to creation, yet it is not a mere figure of speech. It is anchored in real divine condescension that secures meaningful truth.

What is the theological payoff. First, the method ties epistemology to theology proper. The ontological Trinity grounds the unity and diversity of facts and meanings. Second, it disciplines apologetics. There is no neutral zone for the exchange of reasons. Rather, all reasoning unfolds under allegiance, and the task is to expose suppressed knowledge of God and to commend the self authenticating Word. Third, it reframes old debates. Aquinas remains a rich resource for the logic of analogy, rightly prized for safeguarding both truth and transcendence. Barth reminds us that revelation is sovereign and Christocentric. Van Til weights both reminders with a covenantal ontology that keeps nature and grace together under God's Lordship.

Reception has been mixed. Neo Thomists charge that Van Til misconstrues Aquinas and abandons common ground. Barthians complain that he softens the offense of revelation by retaining natural revelation. Analytic Reformed philosophers often side with Clark on propositional identity. Within the Van Tilian circle, Frame's perspectivalism has been widely received, while Oliphint's covenantal properties proposal has sparked debate on divine simplicity and immutability. Yet the core has held. In seminary classrooms and in the pulpit, the line that all true predication is analogical has oriented generations to speak of God with reverent boldness.

We end where we began. If God is Lord, then our words about God are true as they echo his, and they are analogical as we, his creatures, think his thoughts after him.
