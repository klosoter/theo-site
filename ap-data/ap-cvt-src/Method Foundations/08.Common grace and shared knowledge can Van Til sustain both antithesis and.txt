### ESSAY
Set the tension crisply. Van Til insists on antithesis, a radical clash of presuppositions between belief and unbelief, yet he also affirms that unbelievers can know many truths and build complex cultures. Can both claims stand together without collapsing into compromise or into fideism. The answer lies in a layered account of creation and covenant, already sketched by Kuyper, sharpened by Van Til's 1947 to 1948 work on common grace, tested in disputes with Schilder and with Dooyeweerd, and stabilized by later proposals from Frame and Plantinga.

Begin with Kuyper's context. In the Stone Lectures of 1898 and the three volume De Gemeene Gratie written from 1902 to 1905, Kuyper defended a twofold divine action. Saving grace reorients the heart to Christ, while common grace preserves and advances creaturely life among all peoples. Common grace explains civic righteousness, scientific discovery, and artistic excellence outside the church. The Christian Reformed Church at the Synod of Kalamazoo in 1924 codified this in the Three Points, God's favorable attitude to humanity in general, restraint of sin, and the ability for civic good. Kuyper's project aimed at cultural labor under Christ's kingship and rejected both separatism and secular autonomy.

Van Til, trained in Old Princeton and teaching at Westminster from 1929, received Kuyper's basic insight but retooled it with an apologetic edge. In his pamphlet Common Grace in 1947, with related essays circulating in 1948 and later collected in Common Grace and the Gospel in 1972, he argued for both antithesis and overlap. The antithesis is ethical and religious, not metaphysical. Humans remain image bearers, living in God's world and dependent on God's revelation at every point. Yet their heart direction is covenantally against God until renewed by grace. Hence Van Til speaks of analogical thinking, the creature's thoughts must everywhere be obedient to the Creator's self revelation. Where the unbeliever knows truth, that knowledge is both a gift of common grace and an instance of suppressed yet inescapable dependence on God, echoing Romans 1 and 2.

These theses were hammered out in real debate. With Klaas Schilder, a Dutch theologian deposed in 1944 and leading the Liberated Reformed Churches, Van Til sparred through the 1940s. Schilder feared that the American Three Points had incubated a relaxed cultural synthesis. He pressed a covenantal construal, God's gifts are judicially ordered through Christ and are never neutral. Van Til agreed that nothing is neutral, but he warned that Schilder's formulations risked throttling back the clear reality of shared cultural life. Van Til's path was to affirm that common grace is not a truce but a theater. God restrains sin, maintains order, and grants skills and insights to the unjust and the just alike. This does not blunt antithesis, since the heart continues its direction either toward God or toward idols. Still, it renders genuine overlap in proximate judgments, shared inferences, and cooperative labors.

Engagement with Herman Dooyeweerd added another layer. Dooyeweerd's philosophy of the law idea, developed in the mid 1930s and revised in A New Critique of Theoretical Thought from 1953 to 1958, offered a transcendental critique of theoretical thought. He traced Western philosophy's deep drivers through ground motives, Greek form matter, medieval nature grace, and modern nature freedom, and called for a biblical ground motive of creation, fall, and redemption. He emphasized law and subject, modal aspects of reality, and the religious root of all theory. Van Til welcomed the antithetical posture and the critique of synthesis. Yet he worried that Dooyeweerd's talk of theoretical self sufficiency and of a religious a priori could be read as granting too much autonomy. Still, both shared the claim that non Christians can achieve real theoretical results because they inhabit the same creational law order, even as their ground motive misdirects interpretation.

The hinge is Van Til's 1947 to 1948 emphasis that common grace provides a point of contact that is not neutral ground but a divine gift. Point of contact, for him, meant the unavoidable knowledge of God and the image nature of man, never a bracketed zone of autonomous reason. The apologist should never concede independence of thought, but should exploit shared facts and shared rational practices as homes for redemptive confrontation. Antithesis, then, governs the direction of the heart and the ultimate interpretation of the whole, while overlap arises from the structural goodness of creation under providence and the restraining and gifting operations of common grace.

Two late twentieth century developments help stabilize this. John Frame, in The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God in 1987 and in later works, reformulates Van Til's insights in a tri perspectival key. Normative, situational, and existential perspectives interpenetrate. Antithesis is ethical and covenantal, not ontological. Common ground is covenantal ground, for both parties know God, live in God's world, and use God given norms of logic and morality. Frame is explicit that Christians and non Christians often agree on many proximate matters, since they face the same situation and share many norms, even while their heart responses diverge. This clarifies that overlap is not exception but expectation, and that antithesis deepens as we move from proximate judgments to ultimate reasons.

Alvin Plantinga, working in analytic epistemology, supplied a complementary account of shared knowledge. In Reason and Belief in God in 1983 and in Warranted Christian Belief in 2000, he argues that belief in God can be properly basic through a functioning sensus divinitatis. He describes the noetic effects of sin, which can induce cognitive malfunction in certain environments, yet he also insists that the image of God remains and that cognitive faculties often function well across the board. On this model, unbelievers achieve genuine knowledge in science, mathematics, and common life because God preserves their faculties and orders the world. Disagreement at religious depth is traced to suppression and malfunction, yet this does not eliminate wide ranges of overlap in warranted belief. Plantinga's account thus grounds the Van Tillian point of contact in a precise epistemic model, one that avoids neutrality while explaining pervasive agreement.

Put the pieces together. A stable account has three planks. First, the structural directional distinction, creation is structurally good and upheld by providence, while human direction is either obedient or rebellious. Overlap belongs to structure, antithesis to direction. Second, the doctrine of common grace, God restrains evil, distributes gifts, and sustains cultural development among all peoples. This provides shared practices, languages, institutions, and many true beliefs. Third, the doctrine of the image and the sensus divinitatis, all people know God and use his norms, though suppression distorts interpretation. The apologist, then, does not search for neutral territory, but engages the unbeliever in the shared world, exposing how their successful knowing implicitly relies on God, and calling for a redirection of the heart.

Examples sharpen the claim. In mathematics the unbeliever can prove theorems and trust logical laws, because the created order is coherent and the mind is geared to that order. In jurisprudence the unbeliever can craft just statutes and condemn oppression, because moral norms are embedded in creation and are inwardly known. In medicine the unbeliever can discover therapies that heal, because bodies are fearfully ordered and regularities are stable. In each case, overlap in proximate truth is real and often rich, yet the ultimate interpretation of these achievements remains divided. The believer says, these are gifts from the triune God and should be used doxologically. The unbeliever, unless converted, must credit an idol or claim autonomy.

This synthesis answers the opening question. Van Til can sustain both antithesis and overlap when common grace is understood as covenantal preservation and gifting, when creation's structure is distinguished from the heart's direction, and when epistemic function is seen as both enabled and at times impaired by sin. Frame provides a perspectival grammar for this, and Plantinga supplies an epistemic engine. The result is not a truce but a confident posture of cooperation in many proximate tasks and of challenge at the level of ultimate commitment, under the universal reign of Christ.

The Christian can share knowledge widely without surrendering the confession that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
