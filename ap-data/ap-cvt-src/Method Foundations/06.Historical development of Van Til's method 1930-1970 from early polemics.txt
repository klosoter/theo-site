### ESSAY
The story of Van Til's method between 1930 and 1970 begins with a tension. A new seminary and a new denomination sought to preserve Old Princeton confessionalism while absorbing Dutch Neo-Calvinist insights, all under the pressure of neo-orthodoxy and the growing prestige of secular philosophy in American universities. In that crucible Cornelius Van Til crafted a polemically sharp and programmatically constructive approach he would call a Reformed, covenantal apologetic. The arc runs from early assaults on Barth to a mature statement in The Defense of the Faith in 1955, shaped by disputes over common grace and knowledge in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, and culminating in a legacy that would reach Frame, Bahnsen, Oliphint, and intersect with Plantinga.

The institutional context is decisive. Westminster Theological Seminary opened in 1929 under J. Gresham Machen after the reorganization of Princeton Seminary. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church followed in 1936 after the Presbyterian conflict over modernism and missions. Van Til, born in 1895 and trained at Calvin College and Princeton, joined Westminster at the outset. He stood at a crossroads of traditions. From B. B. Warfield he inherited a high view of Scripture, but from Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck he received the principial structure that would govern his program. God is principium essendi, the ontological foundation of all reality. Scripture, by the internal testimony of the Spirit, is principium cognoscendi, the epistemic ground of theology. On this foundation he engaged a new foe. By the early 1930s Karl Barth had come to American attention, and many who rejected liberalism were tempted by Barth's dialectical theology.

Van Til judged that temptation ruinous. In the 1930s he lectured and wrote essays that would later swell into book length critiques. His charge never wavered. Barth was not the champion of orthodoxy but the new modernism. Dialectical method, he argued, kept God and man in a correlative tension that denied the Creator creature distinction and dissolved the antithesis between belief and unbelief. That thesis received extended treatment in The New Modernism in 1946, and again in Christianity and Barthianism in 1962. The constant theme was principial. If theology begins anywhere but with the self attesting triune God who speaks in Scripture, it begins in autonomy and ends in contradiction.

This principial concern surfaced in the OPC almost at once. Two debates marked the 1940s. The first was the Clark controversy between 1944 and 1948. When the OPC ordained Gordon Clark in 1944, Van Til and others protested, charging that Clark's account of human knowledge flattened the distinction between Creator and creature. For Van Til, knowledge is analogical. Because God is infinite and we are finite, our knowledge is true but ectypal, dependent on revelation and never univocal. The controversy was messy, but the upshot shaped his method. It drove him to restate the incomprehensibility of God and the character of analogical predication, not as an academic aside, but as the ground of every apologetic claim.

The second debate concerned common grace and the free offer of the gospel. After the Liberation in the Netherlands in 1944, American Reformed circles revisited the relation of special grace and shared culture. Van Til wrote Common Grace in 1947 and a series of essays through 1951, arguing that common grace is real but non salvific, that it restrains sin and yields shared insights, yet that antithesis remains. The OPC General Assembly adopted the Free Offer report by Murray and Stonehouse in 1948, affirming both sincere gospel offer and divine particularism. These two debates gave Van Til a platform to balance antithesis and point of contact. Point of contact is not neutral data or autonomous reason. Rather it is the sense of deity and the ineradicable witness of general revelation, suppressed by sin yet addressed effectually by special revelation.

Out of these pressures emerged The Defense of the Faith in 1955. In that book, revised in 1963, Van Til set his method down with clarity. He denied that facts are brute and that reason can operate from a position of neutrality. He affirmed that all reasoning is covenantal, either obedient or disobedient. He framed apologetics as transcendental. The Christian needs to show that the very possibility of rationality, science, morality, and personal identity presupposes the triune God of Scripture. He did not discard arguments. He redefined them. The Christian theistic proofs, he wrote, are sound only when offered as one argument, a transcendental demonstration from the impossibility of the contrary. Historical evidences are not freestanding. They are what they are only within the world God made and interprets. The second edition in 1963 sharpened the point that the Trinity is not an add on, but the necessary ontological backdrop to unity and diversity in knowledge.

The resolution reached is not the end of dispute but a mature synthesis. Van Til set his polemic against Barth within a constructive epistemology. He explained common grace without collapsing antithesis and showed how analogical knowledge guards orthodoxy against rationalism and irrationalism. He placed the method within institutional life, teaching generations of students at Westminster through the 1960s and into the 1970s, while the OPC settled into a coherent theological identity after Machen's death in 1937.

Theologically the significance is twofold. First, Van Til stands in substantial continuity with Reformed scholastic principia. He preserves the principium essendi and principium cognoscendi distinction, affirms the internal testimony of the Spirit, and appeals to the archetypal and ectypal knowledge distinction to explain how our words can be true of God without univocity. Second, he radicalizes the implications of these principia for method. Where Old Princeton sometimes treated evidences as proximate and common rational ground, Van Til insists that even evidences are covenantally interpreted. There is real contact with unbelievers, but it exists within a shared world authored by God and within the sinner's suppression of general revelation. In this way he retains the possibility of science and philosophy while denying the myth of neutrality.

Reception since 1970 confirms both durability and adaptability. John Frame, who joined the Westminster faculty in 1968, reframed Van Tilian insights with tri perspectivalism, and in The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God in 1987 he blended biblical, situational, and existential perspectives to soften some of the sharper antithetical edges while keeping the covenantal center. Greg Bahnsen, a student of Van Til, advanced the transcendental argument in public debate, and his 1998 volume Van Til's Apologetic, Readings and Analysis, gathered primary texts and offered a tight defense of the method as the only internally coherent Christian philosophy. K. Scott Oliphint edited later editions of The Defense of the Faith and rearticulated the program as covenantal apologetics, culminating in 2013, stressing that Westminster Confession 1 provides the theological ground for method and engaging analytic philosophy with scholastic clarity. Alvin Plantinga, beginning with God and Other Minds in 1967 and later in Reason and Belief in God in 1983 and the Warrant volumes in 1993 to 2000, developed Reformed epistemology. He affirms that belief in God can be properly basic and that no neutral proofs are required for rationality. While Plantinga accepts classical theistic arguments more freely and works within analytic norms, he shares Van Til's rejection of autonomy and his appeal to the noetic effects of sin.

In short, between 1930 and 1970, Van Til moved from targeted polemics against Barth, through OPC intramurals on common grace, to a codified covenantal apologetic grounded in Reformed principia, and his students and neighbors in philosophy have carried and contested that legacy to the present.
