### ESSAY
The modern crisis of knowledge framed Christian theology within a drama of autonomy and authority. Cornelius Van Til, teaching at Westminster Seminary from 1929 into the 1970s, made his mark by inverting key moves of Kant and Hegel. He drew on their tools while reversing their commitments. The result was a Reformed transcendental method that defended Christian theism as the necessary precondition for any knowledge at all, yet it refused every pretension of autonomous reason.

The background matters. The nineteenth century had seen Kant set limits to reason, then Hegel claim a speculative overcoming of those limits, while historic Protestant orthodoxy reeled before the combined power of critical philosophy and romantic idealism. In America, Old Princeton had attempted a calibrated evidentialism through Charles Hodge and B. B. Warfield, grounded in common sense realism. In the Netherlands, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck had articulated an antithesis between belief and unbelief, along with a theology of common grace. Van Til was formed by both lines. Born in 1895, educated in Amsterdam and at Princeton, he sided with J. Gresham Machen in the 1929 break that created Westminster Seminary. There he forged an approach that would be called presuppositionalism, most programmatically stated in The New Modernism in 1946 and The Defense of the Faith in 1955.

Kant described the noumenon as a limiting concept. Such concepts indicate the outer boundary of possible experience, marking what reason must think without claiming to know it as an object. Kant also catalogued the antinomies of pure reason, showing reason running into contradictions when it tries to totalize the world. Van Til seizes these very tools. He calls the Creator-creature distinction a limiting concept, not in the Kantian sense of unknowability, but as a regulative marker of finitude that disciplines all human knowing. Every predication about the world for Van Til is analogical, never univocal or purely equivocal, because it reflects the relation of the finite to the self contained triune God. The limit is not a fog that blocks access to reality. It is a covenantal boundary that makes knowledge possible, since all facts are what they are by divine plan and interpretation.

Hegel sought to overcome Kant by uniting thought and being in the process of Spirit, where contradictions are aufgehoben through dialectic. Van Til reverses this move. He keeps the idealist insight that coherence requires a whole and that particulars only make sense within a system, but he refuses any identity of human thought with being. The system is the counsel of the triune God who alone is the concrete universal. The one and the many, a problem that haunted Greek metaphysics and modern philosophy alike, find equal ultimacy in the Trinity. Thus Van Til appropriates idealist talk of coherence and system as tools, while insisting on an absolute personal source who speaks first and grounds both the laws and the facts. Where Hegel makes immanence final, Van Til makes revelation fundamental. Where Kant forbids metaphysical knowledge beyond phenomena, Van Til says that God reveals himself in nature and Scripture with clarity, yet always in a manner suited to creatures, and that this revealed frame is the transcendental condition of knowledge.

This inversion of modern philosophy issues in a distinctive apologetic. Van Til argues that there are no brute facts and no neutral reason. All interpretation is covenantal faithfulness or unfaithfulness. Hence his standard line, that Christian theism is the presupposition of intelligibility and that the contrary is impossible. He urges the use of a transcendental argument that asks what must be true for science, logic, morality, and history to be what they are. He contends that only the doctrine of the triune God secures the unity of universal laws and the diversity of changing particulars. He often illustrated this point with the interplay of induction and deduction, arguing that the two can be harmonized only where the world is both ordered by divine plan and genuinely unfolding in time under that plan.

Herman Dooyeweerd, writing A New Critique of Theoretical Thought between 1953 and 1958, advanced a different but related transcendental critique. He diagnosed theoretical thought as a splitting of subject and object and traced philosophy back to its religious ground motives. His modal theory of aspects sought to map the lawful diversity of reality under a creation fall redemption motive. With Van Til he rejected autonomy and insisted that theoretical work rests on pretheoretical commitments. Yet differences emerged. Dooyeweerd posited a supratemporal heart as the religious center of the person, and he envisioned a systematic taxonomy of aspects irreducible to one another. Van Til admired the antithetical stance but worried that some Dooyeweerdian formulations blurred the uniqueness of the ontological Trinity and that the talk of a supratemporal self risked metaphysical dualism. Their exchange during the late 1940s and early 1950s showed two lines of Reformed transcendental reasoning, one more theological and polemical, the other more philosophical and architectonic. Both sought to de absolutize theoretical reason and to locate science within a higher obedience.

Neo Thomism posed another foil. Vatican I in 1870 had affirmed the possibility of natural knowledge of God, and Aeterni Patris in 1879 launched a revival of Thomas. Jacques Maritain, in Degrees of Knowledge 1932 and The Range of Reason 1952, mounted a realist metaphysics with the analogy of being and a tiered account of knowledge. He argued for demonstrative and connatural approaches to God, while safeguarding the gratuity of faith. Van Til replied that such projects presume a common rational territory ungoverned by the revealed God of Scripture. If God and being are linked by analogy apart from triune revelation, then reason silently becomes arbiter. He accused the analogia entis of softening the Creator creature boundary and of reintroducing autonomy under the flag of nature. Van Til did not deny that unbelievers know many truths. He insisted rather that such knowledge depends, unbeknown to them, on the very God whom Thomism claims to reach by a neutral climb.

Analytic Reformed epistemology brought a different challenge and a partial convergence. Alvin Plantinga, in God and Other Minds 1967, Reason and Belief in God 1983, and Warrant and Proper Function 1993, contended that belief in God can be properly basic and warranted apart from evidence, through a divinely designed sensus divinitatis operating in the right environment. He also argued in the 1990s that naturalism undermines rational trust in cognitive faculties. Van Til would welcome the rejection of evidentialism and the appeal to creation order. Yet Plantinga did not grind a full transcendental claim that Christian theism is the condition of knowledge. He offered rational permissibility and warrant under conditions, not the impossibility of the contrary as such. He also worked within modal logic and externalist theory of justification rather than a covenantal ontology of facts. The overlap is real, yet the aims differ. Plantinga defends rationality of theistic belief, while Van Til defends the metaphysical indispensability of the triune God for every rational enterprise.

Turning points in the reception came early. The founding of Westminster in 1929 set the institutional stage. The New Modernism in 1946 defined Barthian theology as a new idealism, and The Defense of the Faith in 1955 set methodological stakes against evidentialism and Roman natural theology. In the 1950s and 1960s, debates with Gordon Clark over paradox and logic sharpened Van Til's insistence on analogical knowledge, while exchanges with Dooyeweerd tested intramural coherence. Meanwhile, neo Thomism matured through Maritain and Gilson, and then ceded ground after 1965 as analytic philosophy rose in Catholic circles. Plantinga's work in the 1980s and 1990s reframed the North American conversation, with many Reformed thinkers combining his insights with Van Tilian sensibilities.

Theologically, Van Til's inversion of Kant and Hegel crystallized a constraint and a freedom. Constraint, in that all method is bound to revelation and to the triune life as the ultimate environment of thought. Freedom, in that no field of inquiry need fear total critique, since Christian theism can ground the stability of laws and the flux of history without collapsing one into the other. His use of limiting concepts and idealist coherence was tactical, a ministerial use of philosophy subordinated to dogmatics. The antithesis signals ultimate allegiance, yet common grace explains why shared labors in science and art are possible. In this way the Reformed transcendental method answers modern philosophy not by retreat into fideism, nor by accepting neutral reason, but by a covenantal account of knowledge whose center is the self attesting triune God.

The legacy is mixed but enduring. Van Til gave Reformed theology a robust account of method under late modern pressure, popularized through students like Greg Bahnsen after 1970 and adapted by contemporary apologists. Dooyeweerd's school flourished in institutions in Toronto and Potchefstroom and continues to influence Christian scholarship across disciplines. Neo Thomism has experienced a revival in analytic dress, with renewed natural theology, while Plantinga reshaped epistemology far beyond ecclesial borders. The map shows convergence on the critique of autonomy yet divergence over the route from reason to God. Van Til's distinctive note remains his inversion of Kant and Hegel through the Trinity, a method-bound confession that claims to explain why there is science, logic, and meaning at all.

In sum, Van Til stands as a Reformed interpreter who borrowed tools from modern philosophy, refused their autonomy, and recast them within a trinitarian transcendental frame.
