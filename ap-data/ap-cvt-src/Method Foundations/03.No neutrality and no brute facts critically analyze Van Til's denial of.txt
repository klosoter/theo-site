### ESSAY
Van Til is known for two sharp claims. There is no neutrality in human knowing, and there are no brute facts. Both claims draw energy from Romans 1, which says that all people know God yet suppress that knowledge in unrighteousness. Read together with the Reformed doctrine of antithesis, Van Til concludes that believers and unbelievers never share a neutral court of appeal. Yet he also urges Christians to persuade. How can argument and dialogue proceed when neutrality is denied and facts are never bare.

The cultural and theological currents behind Van Til run through Amsterdam. Abraham Kuyper, in the Stone Lectures of 1898, declared Calvinism a life-system. Against the myth of universal reason, he set antithesis, a deep spiritual divide that structures scholarship and politics. Yet he balanced antithesis with common grace, a doctrine that explains social order and mutual cooperation. Herman Bavinck, in Reformed Dogmatics published 1895 to 1901 with a later revised edition in 1906, pushed the same line with greater dogmatic depth. He insisted on the creator creature distinction, analogical knowledge, and the organic unity of revelation. With Bavinck the very possibility of science rests on a world ordered by God and a mind created to know it.

In 1929 Princeton Seminary split, and Westminster Theological Seminary opened with Van Til on its first faculty. Across the Atlantic Karl Barth had launched the Church Dogmatics in 1932 and then sided with the Barmen Declaration in 1934. Barth rejected natural theology, grounding knowledge of God in the self revealing Word. Emil Brunner pushed back in 1934 with Nature and Grace, arguing for a limited point of contact in the imago and in orders of creation. Barth responded with his famous Nein, warning that any appeal to nature will be invaded by idolatry. Van Til welcomed the rejection of natural theology, yet accused Barth of burying revelation under a modern dialectic, calling it a higher form of modernism. So from the start, Van Til stood within a Kuyperian antithesis trajectory, sharpened by the Barth Brunner clash, and formed by a commitment to Romans 1 as an epistemic claim.

The denial of neutrality follows. For Van Til, all reasoning is covenantal. The image bearer either reasons in faith, acknowledging God as the self attesting Lord, or reasons in rebellion, suppressing the God he knows. The idea of a neutral starting point is not only illusory, it is itself a claim of autonomy. Van Til argues that to grant neutrality is to grant the principle of unbelief. Consequently, apologetics must be presuppositional. The apologist does not move from allegedly common facts to God by probability. Rather, he challenges the unbelieving system by transcendental argument, asking what makes knowledge, logic, morality, and science possible at all. The answer, he contends in The Defense of the Faith in 1955 and across numerous essays on common grace and antithesis, is that Christian theism alone provides the preconditions of intelligibility. From this point of view, there are no brute facts. All facts are God created, God governed, and God interpreted. A so called bare fact, standing outside the plan and word of God, would be meaningless.

Herman Dooyeweerd provided a parallel philosophical backbone. In A New Critique of Theoretical Thought, issued 1953 to 1958, he mounted a transcendental critique of theoretical thought, arguing that all theory rests on religious ground motives. For him, the supposed autonomy of theoretical reason collapses under analysis. Reality displays modal aspects under divine law, and theoretical synthesis depends on a supratheoretical commitment. Van Til welcomed this support. Dooyeweerd gave technical tools for the claim that thought is never neutral and that facts never come uninterpreted.

The consequence for persuasion is delicate. Van Til refuses a neutral court, but he does not refuse contact. Romans 1 again is decisive. The unbeliever knows God yet suppresses the truth. That means there is always a point of contact, but it is ethical and covenantal rather than neutral and autonomous. The apologist reasons ad hominem in the classical sense, taking the opponent to the end of his own principles and showing the collapse, then setting forth the Christian position as the only alternative that can account for logic, induction, moral obligation, and meaning. Evidence can be used, but never as independent probability. It is presented as covenantal fact, shining within a Christian framework and exposing the borrowed capital within the unbelieving stance. The Spirit alone changes hearts, so argument is ministerial and morally charged rather than mechanistic.

Critics have pressed several lines. First, is the denial of neutrality itself neutral. If one argues that all argument is presuppositional, does one not beg the question. Van Til accepts a form of ultimate circularity, but claims that all worldviews share it at the level of their final authority. The issue is which circle secures rationality rather than undermines it. Second, does antithesis so dominate that dialogue becomes impossible. Here Bavinck and Kuyper help. Common grace orders shared practices, languages, and institutions. The antithesis is ethical and spiritual, not metaphysical dualism. Hence dialogue is possible, but it is never finally neutral.

Brunner and Barth function as foils. Brunner wanted a creational point of contact and a cautious natural theology. Van Til replies that Romans 1 condemns natural theology as an act of suppression, not as a road to God. Barth refused natural theology, but Van Til judged his dialectical method corrosive of the gospel as a finished historical work. That judgment remains contested. Many have argued that Van Til misread Barth, especially on the history of Jesus and on the clarity of revelation. Nonetheless the Barth Brunner exchange in 1934 crystallized the zone in which Van Til operated. He sided with the rejection of autonomy, while anchoring revelation in the canon and the triune God whose counsel orders all facts.

In the late twentieth century two allies refined the program. John Frame, in The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God in 1987 and Apologetics to the Glory of God in 1994, reorganized Van Til language into triperspectival terms. Normative, situational, and existential perspectives interpenetrate. Frame defended transcendental critique, but encouraged the use of any legitimate arguments, including probabilistic lines, so long as the lordship of God frames them. That softens the rhetoric about method while honoring the core claim that no fact is brute. Alvin Plantinga, in his 1983 Aquinas Calvin model and in Warranted Christian Belief in 2000, offered a different route. Belief in God can be properly basic, warranted by the sensus divinitatis under the right conditions. Plantinga does not trade in transcendental necessity as Van Til does, and he is content with parity rather than impossibility of the contrary. Yet he agrees that there is no duty to argue from neutral premises and that classical foundationalism was a philosophical mistake. Thus his externalist epistemology gave Reformed thinkers currency in analytic philosophy while leaving Van Til room to insist on antithesis.

The significance reaches beyond method. The denial of brute facts guards the creator creature distinction and the lordship of divine interpretation. The denial of neutrality humbles the apologist before God and before the heart of the other person. Persuasion becomes covenantal address, not technical manipulation. Dialogue becomes candid confessional exchange, not masking of ultimate loyalties. There is danger here. If the tone hardens, conversation can collapse into accusation. If the doctrine of common grace is minimized, culture work becomes sectarian. The best Van Tillian practice keeps Kuyper and Bavinck close, leans on Dooyeweerd for analysis, learns rhetorical patience from Frame, and borrows analytic clarity from Plantinga.

Reception has been mixed and fruitful. Within Westminster circles, students like Greg Bahnsen in the 1970s and 1980s pressed the transcendental argument as a debate strategy and sharpened the claim that the contrary is impossible. Classical apologists have objected that presuppositionalism refuses the catholic tradition of natural theology and ignores Pauls appeal to creation in the Areopagus speech. Van Tillians reply that Paul exposed idols and proclaimed the God who made and governs all, which is a transcendental move framed by Scripture. In philosophy, Plantinga and his colleagues opened doors for Christian claims without neutrality, and Dooyeweerd inspired schools of reformational thought in North America and beyond. The conversation now touches public theology, science and faith dialogue, and interreligious exchange. In each case, the Van Tillian reminder stands. There is no view from nowhere, and there is no uninterpreted datum. Talk honestly about presuppositions, and then reason hard.

Van Til wanted an apologetics that refuses autonomy yet still speaks with courage and hope, and that is the enduring task his method sets for us.
