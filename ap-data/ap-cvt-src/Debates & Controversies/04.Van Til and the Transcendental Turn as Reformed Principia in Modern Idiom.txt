### ESSAY
The puzzle is sharp and simple. Did Cornelius Van Til inaugurate a revolution by importing a Kantian style transcendentalism into Reformed thought, or did he retrieve the old scholastic architecture of principia and render it audibly modern for a critical age. The answer requires tracing a line from the seventeenth century scholastic doctrine of the principia, through the neo Calvinist account of theological science in Kuyper and Bavinck around 1890 to 1900, into the world of Kantian and post Kantian critique, and finally into Van Til's Westminster laboratory after 1929.

Reformed scholastic prolegomena supplied a precise grammar. Franciscus Junius, in De theologia vera, 1594, distinguished archetypal theology in God from ectypal theology in creatures, safeguarding the Creator creature distinction at the level of knowledge itself. The discipline had its principles. The principium essendi of theology is God himself, the one who is. The principium cognoscendi of theology is the revelation of God, externally in Scripture and internally by the Spirit. Turretin's Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 1679 to 1685, repartitioned these claims with concrete argumentative clarity. God is the ontic foundation for theology, Scripture is the cognitive foundation for theology, and human knowing is analogical to divine knowing, truly corresponding yet never univocal. Later figures such as Mastricht and Voetius kept this apparatus intact, and the Synod of Dordt, 1618 to 1619, fixed the confessional boundaries within which any science of God must proceed.

Fast forward to the long nineteenth century. Old Princeton, with Charles Hodge, Systematic Theology, 1871 to 1873, and B B Warfield, The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible, 1881 to 1915 articles gathered posthumously, affirmed principia but also embraced a measured evidentialism and a modest natural theology. They used Scottish Common Sense and Baconian induction as handmaids. Across the Atlantic, Abraham Kuyper, in Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology, 1894, and the Stone Lectures, 1898, pressed a different line. All science, he argued, rests on religious presuppositions. There are two sciences at root, the regenerate and the unregenerate, because of antithesis. Yet common grace preserves a shared field of cultural labor and the possibility of proximate agreement. Herman Bavinck, in Reformed Dogmatics, 1895 to 1901, deepened the prolegomena. He retrieved the archetypal ectypal distinction, affirmed the principium essendi in the triune God, and stated with repeated force that Scripture is the principium cognoscendi of theology, with the Spirit as the internal principle. He also insisted on analogical knowledge as the only mode suitable to the finite knower before the infinite One.

Meanwhile modern critical philosophy had redrawn the map of knowing. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, 1781, asked what conditions make knowledge possible. The answer lay in a transcendental turn to the a priori forms and categories that structure experience. German idealisms, British idealism, neo Kantian schools, and American pragmatism pressed this critical project in divergent lines across 1800 to 1910. The cumulative effect was a deep suspicion of naive metaphysics and of unexamined foundations. Kuyper and Bavinck knew this terrain. Kuyper argued that worldview presuppositions shape even the direction of inquiry. Bavinck noted that modern thought had relocated certainty from being to consciousness, and he re anchored Christian certainty in the self revealing God speaking in Scripture by the Spirit.

Cornelius Van Til, born 1895 and trained in Amsterdam and at Princeton, absorbed both streams. He studied under Geerhardus Vos and J Gresham Machen and watched the dissolution of Old Princeton in 1929, then joined Machen at Westminster Seminary. The crisis was not merely institutional. For Van Til, the clash exposed the fault lines between an evidential method that tried to play on neutral ground and a principial method that confessed the triune God and Scripture as first principles. In early work like The New Modernism, 1946, and Common Grace and the Gospel, 1947, Van Til builds the diagnosis. In The Defense of the Faith, 1955, and A Survey of Christian Epistemology, 1969, he sets the program. All reasoning is covenantal. There is no brute fact and no autonomous reason. The principium essendi of all thought and being is the triune God, self contained and self sufficient. The principium cognoscendi of theology is Scripture, and by extension, all knowledge operates rightly only within submission to divine revelation, whether in nature or in Scripture. The Spirit is the internal principle who opens eyes. Knowledge is analogical because the Creator creature distinction forbids univocity and rescues from equivocity.

This is old language, but Van Til gives it a new argumentative posture. He explicitly appropriates the transcendental question. What must be the case for predication, science, morality, or logic to be possible. His answer is not the Kantian subject, but the self attesting triune God who alone renders unity and diversity co ordinate without collapse. He often says that Christian theism alone makes human experience intelligible and that the contrary is impossible. This is the antithetical edge of Kuyper, sharpened by the transcendental blade of critical philosophy, and grounded in the scholastic principia. Where Kant conditions objects by the mind, Van Til conditions the mind and world alike by the triune God who speaks.

There were points of friction with older Reformed strategies. Warfield welcomed cosmological and teleological arguments as probable supports for theism. Van Til calls such proofs valid only when they are carried out within a Christian frame, that is, when they are part of one transcendental proof for the existence of the Christian God. He criticizes Roman Catholic nature grace schemas for allowing a zone of autonomy and worries that Thomistic analogia entis compromises the Creator creature divide. He presses that even logic and causality presuppose the God who is one and three. Yet he aligns with scholastic precedent when he insists on principium essendi and cognoscendi, on the external and internal principles, and on the analogical mode of human knowledge.

A turning cluster marks the 1930s to the 1950s. The founding of Westminster Seminary in 1929 created a setting for principial reform. The clash with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church over the Clark Van Til controversy in 1943 to 1945 forced public clarification of analogical knowledge and the incomprehensibility of God. Dialogues and tensions with Dutch philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd, whose New Critique appeared in 1935 to 1953, situated Van Til within a broader transcendental critique of theoretical thought, though Van Til kept theology as architectonic over philosophy. By mid century his transcendental apologetic had hardened its contours and its vocabulary of antithesis, common grace, and no neutral ground.

The theological and intellectual significance lies in a re centering of Reformed prolegomena under modern pressure. Van Til refuses to negotiate on the principium essendi and cognoscendi, yet he adjusts the angle of attack. Rather than laying out principles as static axioms, he argues from the impossibility of the contrary to the necessity of those principles for any science whatsoever. In other words, he shows that God and Scripture are not only internal to theology but are the condition of possibility for meaning, logic, and morality in general. The result recasts apologetics as a species of prolegomena. It also reads the scholastic maxim all truth is from God and for God through a post Kantian lens that asks about preconditions rather than merely causal chains.

Reception has been mixed and fruitful. Students and heirs such as Greg Bahnsen, who debated Gordon Stein in 1985, John Frame, and K Scott Oliphint, popularized and nuanced the method. Alvin Plantinga, from the 1960s to the 1990s, pursued a different renewal, Reformed epistemology, which shares the rejection of classical evidentialism and the insistence on properly basic belief in God, yet diverges by eschewing the strong antithesis and transcendental rhetoric. Critics from analytic and Thomist circles argue that Van Til misreads classical proofs and collapses natural theology into dogmatics. Others judge that he reintroduces the scholastic principia with needed vigor and protects theology from the corrosive acids of neutrality while still making room for common grace and co operative labor.

So is Van Til revolutionary, or is he a renewal. Measured against the long line from Junius and Turretin to Kuyper and Bavinck, Van Til is a renewal of scholastic method, translated into a modern idiom and equipped with a transcendental strategy. He rejects neutral foundations in favor of confessed principia, as the old masters did, but he speaks the language of conditions of intelligibility to a Kant soaked culture. The novelty is tactical, not architectonic. The house is scholastic and Reformed. The front door and the lighting are modern.
