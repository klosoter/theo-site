### ESSAY
The old question comes to us as a tension with a memory. From the earliest centuries Christians asked whether Athens serves Jerusalem or subverts it. The metaphor of the handmaid, the ancilla theologiae, promised service. The fear of the antagonist warned of betrayal. Across fifteen centuries the relation of philosophy to theology tilted now toward alliance, now toward suspicion. The decisive modern recast, in the work of Cornelius Van Til, does not merely tilt. It redraws the order of knowing under revelation, and asks philosophy to come to heel.

Augustine, born 354 and dying 430, gives the classic early pattern. His Confessions and City of God frame a drama of intellect as conversion. He tells us to believe in order to understand, credo ut intelligam, and then to understand in order to believe more deeply. Philosophy appears as a storehouse of instruments. He speaks of plundering Egypt, by which he means appropriating pagan arts for sacred ends. Yet the direction is clear. Scripture and the rule of faith set the terms. Reason serves, never rules. Augustine lands an often forgotten point. The fall has noetic consequences. Pride distorts reason. Thus, grace heals intellect for its service. That is a handmaid, but one whose hands must be washed.

Aquinas, 1225 to 1274, stabilizes the metaphor within a grand synthesis. The Summa Theologiae, written 1265 to 1274, articulates two principia. God is the principium essendi of theology, the living source of its being. Revelation is the principium cognoscendi, the principle of knowing. Yet Aquinas grants reason a noble office. Some preambles of faith, the existence of God and certain attributes, can be known by natural reason. His Five Ways are emblematic. Truth is one, so no double truth can divide philosophy and theology. Within the university, the arts faculty prepares, and sacred doctrine consummates. The condemnation of 1277 warns against Aristotelian imperialism, but Aquinas retains confidence that Aristotle provides a grammar of nature that can serve grace. The handmaid stands ready, trained, and honored.

The Reformation disturbs that settlement. Luther in 1518 at the Heidelberg Disputation opposes a theology of glory that trusts human ascent. Reason, he says, when it speaks of God apart from the cross, becomes a tyrant. In 1525 in The Bondage of the Will he drives home the impotence of fallen reason before grace. Yet Luther uses reason instrumentally for grammar, history, and dialectic. Calvin, 1509 to 1564, in the Institutes, especially the 1559 edition, frames a duplex knowledge of God, Creator and Redeemer. He insists on a sensus divinitatis implanted in human nature, and on the noetic ravages of sin. Scripture is spectacles by which the blurred sensus can see aright. Trent, 1545 to 1563, on the Catholic side, sets its own nature and grace boundaries. Protestant scholasticism after 1580 reenters disputation and draws on Aristotle with renewed care. Still, the Reformation answer shifts the ground. Scripture alone as the external principium and the internal witness of the Spirit as the internal principium displace any neutral natural theology.

Old Princeton in the nineteenth century worked out a different negotiation. Archibald Alexander, 1772 to 1851, Charles Hodge, 1797 to 1878, and later B B Warfield, 1851 to 1921, turned to Scottish Common Sense Realism for an epistemic medicine chest. Hodge in his Systematic Theology, 1871 to 1873, says theology is an inductive science. Collect the facts of Scripture and systematize. Warfield defends inspiration and also natural theology. The resurrection is a fact available to historical investigation. Reason receives facts, and grace adds their saving meaning. The handmaid looks almost like a co worker. This evidential posture accepts a common ground between believer and unbeliever, at least regarding the laws of thought and the reliability of sense.

Enter Van Til, 1895 to 1987, at Westminster Theological Seminary from 1929. He reads Augustine and Calvin through Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck. He writes The Defense of the Faith in 1955 and A Christian Theory of Knowledge in 1969. He affirms the principia of Reformed orthodoxy. God is the self sufficient principium essendi. God speaking in Scripture is the principium cognoscendi. He then overturns the inherited habit of leaning on neutral reason. There is no brute fact. Every fact is already revelational, covenantally interpreted by God, and therefore to be interpreted analogically by the creature. Analogy here means not a blurred similarity but a created replica relation. The Creator creature distinction is absolute. We never know as God knows. We know truly because God interprets reality first and speaks.

The method follows. Reason cannot be an autonomous court of appeal. That would make philosophy an antagonist masked as a friend. Yet Van Til does not make theology irrational. He says all reasoning is circular at the level of ultimate commitment. The question is whether the circle is virtuous. Christian reasoning is anchored in the self attesting Christ of Scripture. It is a transcendental argument. Only if the triune God is who he is can there be meaning, logic, science, and morality. He speaks of the antithesis between belief and unbelief, and of common grace that restrains sin so that believers and unbelievers can cooperate on many tasks. The point of contact is not neutral ground. It is the image of God in all humans, suppressed in unrighteousness yet inescapable.

Under this recast, theological science changes. Prolegomena do not search for autonomous foundations. They confess the principia explicitly and then unfold a system under covenant. The doctrine of the Trinity is not an appendix. It is the architectonic key. Unity and diversity in God ground the possibility of unity and diversity in created knowledge. The philosophy of religion changes as well. It is no longer a survey of competing options from a supposedly neutral standpoint. It becomes the theoretical ministry that clarifies creaturely thinking in the light of revelation, and that exposes suppressive strategies in rival worldviews. Philosophy is not discarded. It is converted.

This is tested against Barth and Dooyeweerd. Karl Barth, 1886 to 1968, rejects natural theology decisively. In 1934 he says Nein to Emil Brunner on the question of a point of contact. Church Dogmatics, written 1932 to 1967, makes revelation an act of God in Christ that encounters us. Scripture is a witness used by God. Barth thereby also refuses the handmaid metaphor. Philosophy may assist in clarification, but it cannot ground or norm theology. Van Til applauds the rejection of natural theology, but he charges that Barth, shaped by Kant and dialectic, locks revelation into an event theology that dissolves the identity of the biblical text as Word of God. In Christianity and Barthianism in 1962, Van Til warns that such dialectic cannot sustain analogical truth claims. The test shows both affinity and fracture. Both oppose autonomous philosophy, but they order revelation and Scripture differently, and so their accounts of knowledge diverge.

Herman Dooyeweerd, 1894 to 1977, offers a different test. His New Critique of Theoretical Thought, 1953 to 1958, inaugurates a Christian philosophy with a transcendental critique. He diagnoses ground motives, such as the Greek form matter motive and the modern nature freedom motive. He insists that theoretical thought is religiously directed. He distinguishes modal aspects of reality and insists on sphere sovereignty. Here Van Til finds a close ally against autonomy, and both appeal to Kuyper, 1837 to 1920, and to Bavinck, 1854 to 1921. Yet Dooyeweerd assigns philosophy its own inner task, irreducible to dogmatics, though normed by the Word of God. Van Til worries that this grants philosophy too much independent space. Dooyeweerd worries that Van Til collapses philosophy into theology and loses the inner structure of theoretical synthesis. The debate forces clarity. Is philosophy a servant with its own craft under the Word, or must it be absorbed into doctrinal construction

The legacy is layered. Augustine and Aquinas gave us a handmaid with dignity but also with chains. The Reformers shortened the leash for the sake of sola Scriptura. Old Princeton lengthened it again to make common cause with modern science. Van Til replaced the leash with a covenant. He rewrote the map. He asks us to begin and end with revelation, to see all knowing as analogical, and to argue transcendently. The handmaid is welcome, but only when she kneels with the household before the speaking Lord. That is how philosophy ceases to be an antagonist and becomes a converted craft.
