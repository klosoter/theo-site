### ESSAY
Begin with the tension. In the years around 1929, Cornelius Van Til, born 1895 and died 1987, left Princeton with J. Gresham Machen to found Westminster Theological Seminary. The immediate conflict was institutional and doctrinal, a struggle over modernist theology and denominational control. The deeper conflict was methodological. How can Christian theology and apologetics speak truth in a world shaped by Kantian critique, Hegelian history, and the new liberal theologies of Europe. Van Til answered by forging a synthesis of older Reformed convictions and fresh philosophical analysis, and by pressing that synthesis into a sharp polemic against the pretensions of neutral reason.

The roots are in Geneva and in the Dutch Republic. John Calvin, 1509 to 1564, set the tone with an insistence on the creator creature distinction and on knowledge of God that is true, analogical, and grounded in revelation. The 1559 Institutes binds piety and doctrine, insisting that knowledge of God is always covenantal and never autonomous. Francis Turretin, 1623 to 1687, gave that inheritance scholastic clarity in the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, published 1679 to 1685, where the architectonic of theology rests on principia, the principles of knowing and being, which are revelation and God himself. Gisbertus Voetius, 1589 to 1676, linked doctrine to polemics and pastoral practice at Utrecht, insisting that philosophy serves theology and that method is ministry. Van Til drank from these wells, not as a mere archivist, but as a constructor who retrieved principia doctrine and the creator creature distinction as the rules of thought.

Dutch neo Calvinism added an organic vision. Abraham Kuyper, 1837 to 1920, in the Stone Lectures of 1898, posed the antithesis between belief and unbelief and advanced the sphere sovereignty of God over all callings. Herman Bavinck, 1854 to 1921, in Reformed Dogmatics, 1895 to 1901 in Dutch, developed an organic motif in revelation and ethics, uniting organism and authority. From Kuyper and Bavinck, Van Til learned to refuse a two storey model of nature and grace and to see culture and science as covenantal fields marked by common grace and by the antithesis. His later work on common grace wrestled with Kuyper and with Kuyper's critics, seeking to name the common field without surrendering the antithesis.

Old Princeton set the American scene. Charles Hodge, 1797 to 1878, championed a realist view of knowledge and a scientific ideal of theology in his Systematic Theology of 1871 to 1873. B. B. Warfield, 1851 to 1921, defended inspiration and the authenticity of miracle, publishing essays from 1881 onward that were later collected as The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible. Machen, 1881 to 1937, linked doctrine and ecclesial integrity in Christianity and Liberalism, 1923. Van Til revered their resolve and clarity, and he adopted their insistence on realism and on the unity of truth. Yet he judged that classical evidential strategies, in their public rhetoric at least, leaned too hard on a supposed neutral rationality. He aimed to keep Old Princeton's confidence while retooling its method.

Enter modern philosophy. Immanuel Kant, 1724 to 1804, in the 1781 Critique of Pure Reason, denied direct speculative access to the noumenal and argued that the categories of the mind structure experience. G. W. F. Hegel, 1770 to 1831, in the Phenomenology of Spirit, 1807, proposed a historical dialectic in which reason unfolds through negation and sublation. Van Til read Kant as the architect of autonomy and of a split between fact and value, and he read Hegel as the sponsor of a monistic absolute that dilutes the creator creature distinction. He responded with a transcendental push of his own. The Christian worldview, he argued, is the necessary condition for the possibility of rational thought, moral obligation, and scientific inquiry. This is the heart of his Defense of the Faith, first published 1955, and his Christian Theory of Knowledge, 1954.

Dutch contemporaries sharpened the tools. Herman Dooyeweerd, 1894 to 1977, and D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, 1892 to 1978, launched Reformational philosophy in the 1930s, with Dooyeweerd's New Critique of Theoretical Thought appearing in 1953 to 1957. They argued that all theoretical thought rests on religious ground motives, and they criticized the scholastic nature grace synthesis. Van Til welcomed their exposure of autonomy and their critique of immanence. He also pressed them with his own insistence on the self contained triune God as the ultimate reference point, wary of any functionalism that would thin transcendence. Klaas Schilder, 1890 to 1952, battled in the Netherlands over covenant and common grace, especially in the 1940s, and Van Til engaged him in Common Grace, published in the late 1940s and 1954. There Van Til tried to articulate how commonness in culture coexists with antithesis in principle.

The main modern rivals spoke from Basel, Zurich, New York, and Innsbruck. Karl Barth, 1886 to 1968, in the Church Dogmatics from 1932 to 1967, rejected natural theology and rebuilt systematics around the event of revelation in Christ. Emil Brunner, 1889 to 1966, affirmed a point of contact in human existence, which Barth rejected in 1934, and Van Til criticized in The New Modernism, 1946, as a failure to escape Kantian dualisms. Paul Tillich, 1886 to 1965, in his Systematic Theology of 1951 to 1963, offered a method of correlation, aligning existential questions with symbols of faith, which Van Til judged to be a theology of autonomy draped in Christian language. Karl Rahner, 1904 to 1984, in Foundations of Christian Faith, 1976, pressed transcendental Thomism, arguing that the subject is always already oriented to God. Van Til read Rahner as baptizing Kant, noble in intent yet still captive to the premise of autonomous critique.

How then does the synthesis take shape. First, principia. Following Turretin, Van Til grounds theological science in principium essendi and principium cognoscendi, translated as God himself and divine revelation. Second, analogical knowledge. Following Calvin and Voetius, he insists that human knowledge is true yet never univocal with God's knowledge. This is his famous claim that human knowledge is analogical and that there is no neutral territory. Third, antithesis and common grace. Following Kuyper and Bavinck, he holds that belief and unbelief are opposed at the level of heart commitment, yet God restrains sin so that there is real cultural commonality and shared language. Fourth, transcendental argument. Facing Kant and Hegel, he argues that the very possibility of science, logic, and morality presupposes the triune God and covenantal revelation. This is not a deductive proof from neutral premises, but an argument about preconditions of intelligibility.

Turning points are visible in the 1929 break with Princeton, in the publication of Christianity and Liberalism in 1923 that framed the stakes, and in Van Til's Defense of the Faith in 1955 that systematized his method. His teaching at Westminster from 1929 into the 1970s formed generations of pastors and thinkers who practiced biblical theology and covenantal apologetics together. His polemics against Barthian theology marked the 1940s and 1950s, and his exchanges with Dutch philosophers in the 1950s clarified his commitments.

The intellectual significance lies in a reframed relationship between dogmatics and apologetics. Van Til refused to let apologetics become a pre theological clearing of debris. Instead, the same doctrines that define the gospel define our account of knowledge. The creator creature distinction blocks monism. The covenantal relation orders epistemology. The doctrine of sin names the suppression described in Romans 1. Common grace explains cultural achievement. Scripture is not simply a source of propositions, it is the principled lens by which all facts are seen. In this way Old Princeton's confidence in truth is retained, Dutch organicism guards the wholeness of life, and modern philosophy is answered with its own best weapon, the transcendental critique.

Reception has been mixed and fruitful. John Frame, born 1939, deepened the vision with a tri perspectival method in The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God, 1987, showing how normative, situational, and existential perspectives answer to Van Til's covenantal unity. Vern Poythress, born 1946, integrated science and linguistics in Redeeming Science, 2006, extending the critique of neutrality into the natural sciences. Alvin Plantinga, born 1932, and Nicholas Wolterstorff, born 1932, built Reformed epistemology from the 1960s onward, arguing in works such as Plantinga's Warrant trilogy from 1993 to 2000 that belief in God can be properly basic. They overlap with Van Til in rejecting evidentialism as a universal norm, yet they describe warrant in the idiom of contemporary analytic epistemology rather than in the direct language of principia and antithesis. Broadly, the heirs have broadened the circle of conversation, showing that Van Til's instincts can inhabit analytic, pastoral, and cultural discourses.

In the end, Van Til's method is a woven cord. Calvin and the scholastics provide the doctrinal fibers of principia and analogy. Kuyper and Bavinck supply the organic pattern of culture under covenant. Old Princeton ties American grit and clarity. Kant and Hegel force precision in the face of autonomy and dialectic. Dutch contemporaries test the edges of reformational insight. Modern theologians provoke sharp distinctions. And the heirs show that transcendental, covenantal apologetics is not a museum piece but a living practice. One sentence sums the project, to think God's thoughts after him, in Christ, by Scripture, for the whole of life.
