### ESSAY
The question is stark and practical. Can a covenantal, presuppositional method first forged in Reformed debates of the 1920s carry weight in conversations with Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism that now shape the shared streets of London, Lagos, and Los Angeles. The answer turns on whether Van Til's antithesis and his account of common grace can sustain honest dialogue without surrendering the scandal of the gospel.

The modern push into interreligious engagement was not born in a study. It grew from missions, migration, and war. Edinburgh 1910 signaled a Protestant missionary ambition shaped by confidence in the Bible and providence. The catastrophes of 1914 to 1945, the decolonizing winds after 1945, and the rise of comparative religion as an academic discipline reframed the issue. Nostra Aetate in 1965 widened Catholic attitudes toward other faiths. The Lausanne Covenant in 1974 renewed an evangelical commitment to world evangelization with cultural sensitivity. In these decades Van Til taught at Westminster, sharpening a covenantal apologetic that refused neutral starting points yet insisted on a point of contact grounded in the image of God and restrained by common grace.

Van Til's core claims are well known. All reasoning is covenantal, never religiously neutral. The natural man suppresses the knowledge of God, yet cannot escape his image-bearing status. Apologetics must proceed by transcendental argument, showing that the intelligibility of logic, morality, and science presupposes the triune God. Human knowledge is analogical, not univocal, because the Creator-creature distinction is absolute. The antithesis is real, yet common grace grants genuine if provisional contact for persuasion and cooperation. The classic statement of this architecture appeared in The Defense of the Faith in 1955, along with his earlier critique of Barth in 1946 and his constant emphasis on the one and many problem that only the Trinity solves.

How does this method fare with Islam. Islam affirms a strong Creator-creature distinction, insists on revelation, law, and final judgment. This supplies a weighty contact point. Yet Van Til would press that a unitarian monad cannot ground the coherence of the absolute and the personal. The doctrine of tawhid secures unity, but the life of God as sheer oneness strains to account for the eternality of divine speech and love. When Asharite theology treats the Qurans speech as uncreated, a duality is introduced within the single essence, later managed by distinctions of attributes and acts. When al Ghazali in the late eleventh century defended occasionalism, the causal order became radically dependent on immediate will, raising questions for induction and science that Averroes protested in the twelfth century. A Van Tilian line argues that Islamic thought borrows capital from a trinitarian resolution of the one and the many, as well as from a covenantal idea of personal lawgiver. The adequacy here is considerable in exposing tensions between an absolute will and stable rational order, and in challenging the epistemic pretensions of purely human reason or of an uncreated book detached from a personal mediator. The weakness, however, is the risk of caricature. Islamic kalam has resources in Maturidi accounts of reason, and in Sufi traditions of divine love, that complicate any simple charge of impersonalism. A careful Van Tilian must therefore argue case by case, text by text, while maintaining the Christological center.

With Hindu traditions, the spectrum is wider. Advaita Vedanta under Shankara in the late eighth and early ninth centuries identifies the ultimate as nondual Brahman, rendering the world of change and distinction as a qualified appearance. Ramanuja in the eleventh and twelfth centuries defended a qualified nondualism, while Madhva in the thirteenth century argued for a real dualism of God and souls. Bhakti movements cultivated personal devotion, while Nyaya and Mimamsa developed rigorous logics of inference and hermeneutics. Van Tils antithesis bares its teeth against Advaita. If the ultimate truth dissolves distinction, then logic, moral responsibility, and covenantal speech fall into maya. The transcendental critique is sharp. It demonstrates that even Advaitins rely on stable distinctions while arguing against difference. Yet the method must adapt across the theistic wings of Hinduism. In Vaishnava bhakti the personal God, covenantal devotion, and moral law create stronger points of contact. A blanket dismissal underplays these theistic resources. Van Til's own framework allows for that nuance. Common grace and the image of God mean that real truths and beauties will be present, though misdirected, and so the task is redirection through Christ rather than mere negation.

Buddhism presents another angle. The earliest tradition teaches the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, frames reality by dependent origination, and denies a permanent self. In the second and third centuries Nagarjuna pressed the doctrine of emptiness to its limit, denying inherent existence to any dharma, while preserving the conventional order for practice. Later scholastics in Theravada developed Abhidharma taxonomies of momentary events and sophisticated logics of inference. A Van Tilian critique charges that the denial of a personal ultimate leaves reason, morality, and compassion without an anchor. Suffering as a problem becomes a cyclical given, not a drama of fall and redemption. Yet here too the method misfires if it assumes that Buddhist discourse aims at the same metaphysical telos. Much of Buddhism functions as soteriological therapy oriented to cessation of craving through disciplined attention. The better strategy is to press the transcendental question at the level of practice. Is compassion intelligible, or even credible, without an ultimate good who commands and saves. Is the vow to alleviate suffering justified if the self is only conventional. Van Til's move from antithesis to abductive transcendental argument can be made pastorally acute at this point.

Set against other approaches, Van Til holds his own while inviting correction. Barth's exclusivism is stringent and luminous. His Nein to natural theology in 1934, and his construction in Church Dogmatics I-1 in 1932, center all revelation in Christ, and call religion as such a human attempt at self justification. That yields a bold witness to the nations, but leaves little grammar for dialogical learning. Rahners inclusivism in the 1960s proposed the anonymous Christian. His Foundations of Christian Faith in 1976 developed the supernatural existential, a universal orientation to grace that underwrites positive meaning in non Christian religions. This framework dignifies human seeking, yet risks diluting the antithesis and flattening conversion into a hidden yes. Hick offered a Copernican revolution in the 1970s, God and the Universe of Faiths in 1973, and later spoke of the Real beyond our concepts. This pluralism relativizes all traditions, including Christianity, in favor of moral transformation. Van Til would judge this a sophisticated form of suppression that forfeits the triune ground of intelligibility and the particular scandal of the cross.

The turning points in evangelical missiology after 1974 pushed Van Tils heirs to adapt. John Frame reworked presuppositional method through a multiperspectival triad of normative, situational, and existential perspectives, beginning in the 1980s and in Systematic Theology in 2013. He kept the transcendental core while building a more supple rhetoric and pastoral patience. K Scott Oliphint, in God With Us in 2012, articulated covenantal properties to show how the immutable Lord freely condescends to relate. That proposal aids engagement with Islam by clarifying divine speech and with Hindu or Buddhist concerns about change in God. Timothy Keller, drawing on Van Til as well as Lewis, used the language of defeater beliefs in The Reason for God in 2008 and Center Church in 2012. He framed urban apologetics through common grace, cultural narratives, and plausibility structures, enabling conversations with Muslims about justice and mercy, with Hindus about beauty and joy, with Buddhists about suffering and hope.

What then of analogical dialogue under common grace. The prospects are good when the grammar is kept clear. Christians speak analogically of God, acknowledging both similarity and greater dissimilarity with creaturely terms. That frees us to receive insights about law, beauty, and compassion without granting sovereignty to any created voice. Common grace gives grounds for shared work in civic tasks, for hearing real insights in rival traditions, and for patient argument that aims at repentance and faith. The antithesis guards the gospel from domestication, while the image of God keeps the conversation human and hopeful.

In reception, Van Til inspired a school of Reformed apologetics used across the global South and in diaspora ministries since the 1990s. Critics have charged that the method turns debate into a binary of borrowed capital and suppression. Defenders answer that only a stable theological architecture can sustain sustained listening without collapse into relativism. The comparative line is this. Barth secures Christ but is dialogically thin, Rahner welcomes the world but risks domestication, Hick centers ethics but dissolves truth, while Van Til offers a principled invitation to argue and befriend under the light of the triune God.

The best future here is frank, cheerful, and doctrinally thick, antithetical about lordship, generous about contact points, and quick to show how the cross and the resurrection answer the deepest ache of rival ways.
