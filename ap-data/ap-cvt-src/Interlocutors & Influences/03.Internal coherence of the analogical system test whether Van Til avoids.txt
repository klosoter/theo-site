### ESSAY
The core tension in Van Til's method is as old as Christian confession itself. If we speak of God with the same meanings we use of creatures, have we not collapsed the Creator creature distinction. If we speak with utterly different meanings, have we not fallen into silence. Van Til, teaching at Westminster from 1929 to 1972, insisted that covenant revelation gives a third way. We know God truly, yet by analogy, since only God knows exhaustively. The task is to test the internal coherence of this analogical claim using the best semantic tools of the twentieth century, and to ask whether it avoids the old horns of univocity and equivocity while keeping two convictions intact, that God is incomprehensible, and that we possess real, rational knowledge.

The context sharpened the issue. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church, formed in 1936 out of the Machen controversy, faced the Clark case in 1944 to 1948. Gordon Clark argued that believers know some of the very same propositions God knows, univocally understood, and accused Van Tilians of mysticism. Van Til, whose major expositions appeared in The Defense of the Faith in 1955 and Christian Theory of Knowledge in 1969, replied that a univocal account mistakes the mode and content of divine knowledge and dissolves the Creator creature boundary. Later, John Frame, in The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God in 1987 and in his study of Van Til in 1995, reframed and softened the rhetoric, proposing a triperspectival reading that aims to preserve Van Til's insights while clarifying the logic.

To test coherency we draw on three analytic lines. First, Frege in 1892 distinguished sense and reference and explained predication against a background of logical types. The sentence God is good predicates a concept of a subject, yet the sense of good as applied to God may differ from the sense of good applied to creatures while still managing identical or related reference. Second, Wittgenstein in 1953 turned attention to rule governed use in forms of life. The meaning of predications lives in their use within a community's practices. Third, William Alston developed, from the 1960s through 2000, speech act models of language and a direct realist account of doxastic practices. Divine discourse in Scripture is not only informative but performative, fixing reference and authorizing terms by acts.

These tools yield a precise proposal. Let there be a divine attribute structure D, closed under entailments proper to the self contained triune life. Let there be a creaturely concept structure C, ordered by the inferential roles that govern our use in worship and obedience. Revelation establishes a mapping h from D to C that is covenantal, rule governed, and intentionally one way. For each divine perfection g in D, h assigns a creaturely concept c in C, with preserved partial inferential roles that are suited to our finite station. The mapping is not identity and not reversible. It is a homomorphism of structures rather than an isomorphism, preserving select entailments but not the total architecture of divine knowledge.

On this account predication is analogical in a formal and testable sense. When we assert God is good, the term good in the God sentence bears a sense shaped by h of the divine perfection of goodness. It is not equivocal because the use is rule governed and revelation anchored, with stable cross sentence inferences such as God is good, therefore God is worthy of trust, and God does not lie. It is not univocal because the sense is not the same as creaturely goodness, and the inferential role does not project wholesale from creaturely cases to the Creator. The mapping preserves reference across the analogy because divine speech and providential acts fix the referent, to use Alston's realist line, and the form of life of the church keeps the rules of use, in Wittgenstein's sense, alive and public.

Frege helps adjudicate the Clark complaint. Clark maintained that if biblical propositions are identical in content with divine knowledge, they must be univocal. A Fregean reply notes that identity of reference and even identity of truth value does not entail identity of sense. The sentence God is wise and the sentence Socrates is wise can be equally true, yet the sense of wise shifts with subject terms because the network of implications shifts. The divine token of wisdom carries entailments proper to aseity and simplicity, as taught in classical theology, while the creaturely token carries entailments fitting dependency and composition. So the proposition number, in Clark's rationalist framing, is too coarse a measure of meaning to settle the case. What matters for Van Til is the covenantal sense shaped by h, not bare type identical strings.

Wittgenstein sharpens this. The doctrine of analogical predication is not a set of private meanings in the head. It is a rule governed practice, sustained by liturgy, preaching, confession, and discipleship in real communities across time. Consider 1551 to 1563 for the framing of the Reformed confessions, or 1646 for the Westminster Confession. These texts codify how the church uses words like wise and good of God and creatures. Rules of reverent negation, like not composite, and of eminent attribution, like archetypally perfect, are learned as one learns chess, by living in a form of life. Such rule following keeps talk from dissolving into equivocity while restraining it from presumptive univocity.

Alston completes the picture by focusing on divine speech. The Lord secures reference by speaking and acting in history, from Sinai to the ministry of Christ, and the inscripturated word retains this illocutionary force. When God declares I am holy, the speech act not only asserts a content but also constitutes the normative standard for the use of holy in worship and ethics. Scripture thereby fixes h at crucial points and licenses inferences within C that mirror divinely intended connections. Real knowledge is thus achieved because our words hook onto the divine reality through properly basic, socially sustained doxastic practices that are formed by God himself.

Does this preserve incomprehensibility. Yes, and the formalism explains why. The mapping h is intentionally non invertible. For any c in C, we cannot reconstruct g in D in a full and exhaustive way. Moreover, the inferential closure of D outstrips our grasp not simply in cardinality but in mode, since divine knowledge is archetypal, immediate, and self interpreting, whereas our knowledge is ectypal, mediate, and dependent. This gives a principled limit, not a skeptical fog.

Does it avoid equivocity and univocity. Equivocity would obtain if the mapping were ad hoc or if there were no cross sentence inferential stability. Yet the canonical history and the confessional grammar create stability, as does the Spirit's unifying work across the ages. Univocity would obtain if h collapsed into identity or a full isomorphism. Yet the classical attributes, confessed and argued from the second to the seventeenth centuries and received by Van Til, block any such collapse. Simplicity, immensity, and self sufficiency ensure that predicates applied to God retain a uniquely divine sense.

Revisiting Clark and Frame clarifies the gains. Clark's drive for univocity stemmed from a fear of skepticism. The formal account grants what he rightly desired, real truth apt predication, while denying the step that would erase the Creator creature line. Frame's triadic perspective, normative, situational, existential, can be read as a layered account of h. The normative perspective supplies the rules and the canon that fix meaning. The situational supplies the world and its providential signs that shape application. The existential supplies the covenant agent who actually uses the words in faith and obedience. Frame thus renders Van Til's analogy operational without surrendering clarity.

The significance is threefold. First, the account gives a semantics for the old doctrine of accommodation, already latent in Calvin in the 1550s and refined by Reformed scholastics. Second, it aligns Van Til with analytic clarity, borrowing from Frege and Wittgenstein without conceding theological substance. Third, it places Scripture's authority at the center, since the success of the mapping hinges on divine speech acts that constitute a language game the church is called to inhabit.

Reception and legacy point forward. From the 1980s onward, analytic theology rediscovered speech act theory in accounts of revelation and inspiration, while Reformed epistemology carried forward a proper basicality of theistic belief. Van Til's analogical insistence can be rendered compatible with those lines, provided we retain the asymmetry in knowledge modes and the covenantal fixity of meaning. In an age tempted either by flattening metaphysics or by ineffable mysticism, this analogical system remains a live option.

A coherent analogical predication requires a covenantal mapping that preserves reference and some inferential roles while refusing identity of sense, and on those terms Van Til's claim stands.
