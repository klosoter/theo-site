### ESSAY
The question of whether empirical science presupposes the Christian worldview confronts us with a double tension. On one side, the sciences arose within cultures shaped by Christian doctrines of creation and providence. On the other, modern science often proceeds as if metaphysics were unnecessary. Cornelius Van Til pressed the claim that the very intelligibility of empirical inquiry requires Christian theism. To evaluate this claim we must listen to earlier Reformed accounts of natural revelation, attend to Old Princeton and Warfield, and consider Plantinga's Reformed epistemology alongside critical realism. Then we must ask how this framework meets evolution and cosmology without collapsing into fideism.

Calvin set the first stakes. In the 1559 edition of the Institutes he spoke of a sensus divinitatis implanted in all people, a natural awareness of God that the impiety of the heart suppresses. The created order is a theater of the divine glory. Yet fallen reason needs the spectacles of Scripture, so that general revelation, though clear in itself, is not salvific and is frequently misread. The Reformed scholastics specified the distinction. Francis Turretin in the Geneva lectures of 1679 to 1685 treated duplex revelatio, natural and supernatural, and argued that the existence of God and some moral norms are known by nature, though the gospel is known by special revelation. The Westminster Confession of Faith 1646 opens by acknowledging the light of nature and the works of creation and providence, which manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, yet declares that it pleased God to reveal himself more fully by his Word. Already the structure is clear. Reason has a real field under God, yet reason is not its own master.

The modern scientific project tests that claim. Hume in 1748 pressed the problem of induction. Kant in 1781 placed the categories in the mind and guarded lawfulness at the price of thing in itself agnosticism. Within the Reformed world, Old Princeton answered through a realist and evidential apologetic. Charles Hodge and then Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield, writing from the 1860s to the 1910s, defended a harmony between sound science and the Christian faith. Warfield upheld biblical inerrancy while allowing that evolution, under the providence of God, could be the mode of creation. He insisted that God governs by ordinary law and by extraordinary act, and that the Christian can welcome empirical evidence as the study of those laws. Natural theology in Warfield's hands was not a rival to revelation, but a subordinate witness that could marshal evidences for theism and for the truth of Scripture.

Van Til, born in 1895 and teaching at Westminster from 1929, recast the issue. He charged both Enlightenment rationalism and empiricism with autonomy. On his account, all knowledge is covenantal and analogical, since only God knows exhaustively. He argued that the unity and diversity of facts require the ontological Trinity, that the uniformity of nature and the applicability of logic presuppose a God whose decree orders all things, and that the antithesis between belief and unbelief is ethical and epistemic, rooted in the noetic effects of sin. The apologetic consequence was transcendental. One must show that the possibility of science, logic, morals, and personal identity stands on Christian ground. Non Christian systems oscillate between abstract universals that crush particulars and bare particulars that dissolve universals, while only Trinitarian theism harmonizes the one and the many.

How strong is this claim. The Calvin to Warfield line affirms real natural knowledge and public evidences, though it warns that sin distorts. Van Til stresses dependence and antithesis, and offers a programmatic explanation for the success of science. Both appeal to the doctrine of creation and providence. If the world is created ex nihilo by a wise and faithful God, then laws are contingent rather than necessary, and discovery has a real task. If the same God upholds all things by his Word, then stable patterns sustain induction. This is not a deductive proof, but an explanatory matrix that underwrites scientific norms.

Two twentieth century developments help translate this into a contemporary register. The first is Alvin Plantinga's Reformed epistemology. In essays from 1983 and in Warrant and Proper Function 1993, Plantinga argues that belief in God can be properly basic, rational without inferential proof, because of design plan faculties aimed at truth. He also presses an argument that naturalism undercuts trust in human cognition. If our cognitive faculties are shaped only by unguided processes aimed at survival, the probability that they are reliably truth apt is low or inscrutable. That does not prove Christian theism, but it gives a defeater for naturalism. At the same time, his proper function model explains how the sciences can be rational enterprises within a theistic frame. Our cognitive powers were fashioned to know the world, and the virtues of inquiry are part of the design plan. The second is critical realism in philosophy of science. Think of Michael Polanyi in 1958 and Roy Bhaskar in 1975. Critical realism holds that there is a mind independent world, that our knowledge of it is theory laden and fallible, and that we know by grasping real structures through models and inference to the best explanation. This stance rejects naive positivism and radical constructivism alike. It fits Reformed themes. Creaturely knowledge is analogical and corrigible, yet answers to reality created and upheld by God.

Applied to evolution, these strands allow a non fideist path. Darwin in 1859 proposed descent with modification by natural selection. The modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s joined genetics to natural selection. Warfield had already allowed for evolution as a mode, provided God is acknowledged as author. A Van Tillian caution alerts us to metaphysical smuggling, the move from methodological naturalism to ontological naturalism. A Plantingan defense affirms that scientists can investigate homology, common ancestry, and population genetics with full seriousness, while holding that human rationality and moral awareness reflect the image of God and are not exhausted by reductive accounts. A critical realist sensibility makes room for gaps and revisions in phylogenies and for layered causality, where divine providence orders processes through lawlike regularities and where teleology is not forbidden but reframed as final causality within a theistic metaphysics.

Cosmology shows a similar pattern. Georges Lemaitre in 1927 proposed a primeval atom and in 1931 described a cosmic beginning. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 confirmed a hot big bang. Standard cosmology describes an expanding universe with elegant laws and finely tuned constants. On a Christian reading, the contingency and intelligibility of those laws reflect the Logos. Van Til would say that the unity and diversity of the cosmos are not brute. Plantinga would add that belief in God matches the deep expectation that the universe is knowable. Critical realism reminds us that models like Lambda CDM are heuristic constructs that succeed because they latch onto real structures, yet remain open to correction. Fideism is avoided by taking the public evidence seriously, distinguishing method from metaphysics, and resisting the urge to baptize every anomaly as miracle or every success as proof of naturalism.

What then of Van Til's strong claim. Empirical science does not require explicit Christian belief to function. Many excellent scientists operate within other frameworks. Yet the enduring norms of science, the expectation of uniformity, the trust in the reliability of cognitive faculties, the fit between mathematics and the world, and the moral culture of truth seeking, fit naturally within Christian theism and sit uneasily within strict naturalism. The Calvin to Warfield tradition supplies a doctrine of natural revelation robust enough to welcome empirical inquiry, while Van Til guards the metaphysical ground and exposes the pretensions of autonomy. Plantinga and critical realism articulate a permissive epistemic space where the sciences can flourish without hubris.

The reception is mixed. Old Princeton generated confidence in evidences, while Westminster pressed antithesis and transcendental critique. Dutch neo Calvinism, through Kuyper in 1898 and Dooyeweerd in the mid twentieth century, extended the theme that all thought is religiously rooted. Contemporary evangelical discussions about evolution and creation often replay the Princeton and Westminster instincts in new dress. Yet across these disputes, the core lesson persists. Natural revelation is real, sin distorts, special revelation heals and completes, and science as a fallible but fruitful enterprise can be both affirmed and chastened.

So the best judgment is this. Science does not compel Christian theism, but its deep grammar is most coherent on Christian grounds, and that is enough to make Van Til's claim provocative, corrigible, and fruitful for theology and for the laboratory alike.
