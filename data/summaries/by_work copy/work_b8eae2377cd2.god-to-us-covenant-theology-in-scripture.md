### TITLE
God to Us: Covenant Theology in Scripture - Stephen J. Myers

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century Reformed revival of biblical-theological and covenantal studies. Written within contemporary debates over continuity/discontinuity between Testaments, the nature of the covenant of grace, and responses to dispensationalism and "progressive covenantalism."
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Covenant theology is the central, biblical framework for understanding how God communicates salvation to his people; the unity of Scripture is grounded in covenantal promise fulfilled in Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Presents covenant as the overarching theological motif that orders Scripture and redemptive history.
 - Distinguishes major covenant forms (creation, works, redemption, grace) while insisting on Christ as the covenantal center and fulfillment.
 - Develops a biblical-theological trajectory: promise → typology/mediators → fulfillment in Christ → ecclesial and sacramental outworking.
 - Applies covenantal reading to doctrinal loci: Christology (mediatorial offices), soteriology (federal headship), sacraments (signs and seals), and eschatology (consummation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Classical Reformed authorities: Calvin, the Reformed orthodox, Vos, John Murray.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: advocates of progressive covenantalism and dispensationalism; recent biblical-theologians stressing narrative and typology.
 - Uses wide scriptural exegesis (OT and NT), patristic and Reformed confessional materials.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant (primary), revelation, Christology (mediatorial offices), soteriology (justification, federal headship), ecclesiology (church as covenant community), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), law and gospel, typology, eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Myers frames covenant theology not as a static schema but as the Bible's own story of God reaching out to humans in promise and fulfillment-culminating in Christ as the covenantal "God to us."

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that covenant language is both the biblical descriptor and hermeneutical key for redemptive history, not merely a systematic construction.
 - Vinculum between promise and sign: sacraments are read as covenantal seals rooted in promise and fulfilled in Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on dispensational fragmentation of redemptive history and on readings that dilute covenant continuity (e.g., versions of progressive covenantalism that minimize federal structures).
 - Reorients some classical formulations by emphasizing biblical-theological narrative and typological development over purely juridical or schematic presentations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines how "covenant of redemption" functions as intra-Trinitarian pact and as the grounding for Christ's mediatorial agency in Scripture's storyline.
 - Welds typology and promise-fulfillment language tightly to the covenantal categories, aiding canonical reading strategies.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Positively received in conservative Reformed circles as a clear, accessible biblical-theological defense of covenantal orthodoxy.
 - Used by pastors and seminary instructors for teaching covenantal hermeneutics and sacramental theology.
 - Engages wider evangelical readers seeking a unified reading of Scripture.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, scripturally grounded framework useful for exegetical orientation, pastoral catechesis, and systematic reflection.
 - Functions as a bridge between classical federalism and contemporary biblical-theological methods.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith):** The organizing pattern of God's self-disclosure and saving actions across Scripture.
- **Covenant of Creation:** God's order and covenantal responsibilities grounded in creation and human vocation.
- **Covenant of Works:** Pre-fall probation involving promised life for obedience; explanatory of human culpability and need for redemption.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Intra-Trinitarian agreement for the Son's mediatorial work; grounds the covenant of grace historically and the doctrines of atonement and election.
- **Covenant of Grace:** God's promise to save a people by faith in Christ across both Testaments; manifests continuity with typological development.
- **Typology / Promise-fulfillment:** Biblical figures/events as promises and pledges that receive their true fulfillment in Christ; not merely moral examples.
- **Federal headship:** The notion that Adam and Christ operate as representative heads-Adam's failure and Christ's obedience have covenantal consequences for their respective federal families.
- **Mediatorial offices (prophet, priest, king):** Christ as covenant mediator who fulfills and advances covenant promises through these offices.
- **Covenant signs (sacraments):** Baptism and the Lord's Supper as seals and signs that confirm covenant promises to the people of God.
- **Continuity and discontinuity:** Balance between the unity of the covenant of grace and legitimate discontinuities in covenant administration and typological function.
- **Law and Gospel:** Law as covenantal boundary and gospel as promise-fulfillment offered in Christ.
- **Scriptural-theological hermeneutic:** Reading individual texts within the covenantal storyline of promise and fulfillment.
- **Ecclesial identity:** Church as covenant community inheriting the promises; implications for membership and sacramental practice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definitional source for classical covenant categories in teaching and catechesis.
- As a polemical resource against dispensational and reductionist covenant proposals.
- As an exegetical model for reading OT typology and NT fulfillment Christology, and as a conceptual pivot for sacramental and ecclesiological reflection.
