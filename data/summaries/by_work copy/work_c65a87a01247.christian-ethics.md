### TITLE
Christian Ethics (Die christliche Sitte) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 19th century Berlin (post-Kantian, Romantic, Prussian reform era). Ethics delivered in lecture cycles c. 1812-1831, published posthumously from student-edited manuscripts. Milieu: Pietist piety meets Romantic hermeneutics and idealist philosophy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian ethics is the descriptive-teleological account of Christian conduct as the historical realization of redemption in the communion of the Spirit, aiming at the kingdom of God; distinct from philosophical ethics and from legalistic casuistry.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Prolegomena:** Relation of ethics to dogmatics; ethics treats actions and forms of life flowing from the Christian self-consciousness; dogmatics treats states of consciousness.
 - **Founding concepts:** Feeling of absolute dependence; God-consciousness perfected in Christ and communicated by the Spirit to the church.
 - **Teleology of the good:** The ethical telos is the unification of nature and spirit in the kingdom of God; sanctification is progressive, communal, and historical.
 - **Forms of Christian life:** Personal piety and virtues; household and vocation; society and state; the church as the primary sphere of ethical formation.
 - **Ecclesial practices:** Word, sacraments, discipline, and mutual edification as formative acts; mission as outward expansion of God-consciousness.
 - **Eschatological horizon:** No chiliastic scheme; the kingdom is historically advancing toward consummation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Kant and post-Kantian ethics (duty, autonomy), Fichte and Hegel on Sittlichkeit, Spinoza on immanence, Aristotle on teleology; receives Augustine, Luther, Calvin critically; indebted to Moravian-Pietist piety; biblically oriented especially to Paul and the Gospels.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation as mediated in the community; Trinity functionally (Father as source, Son as Redeemer, Spirit as communal agent); Christology centered on the Redeemer; Pneumatology shaping communal life; Soteriology as regeneration and sanctification; Ecclesiology and sacraments as ethical means; Covenant reframed as living relation rather than federal scheme; Eschatology as progressive realization.
- **Closing line:** The work centers on the Spirit-formed life of the church as the historical embodiment of Christ s redemption advancing toward the kingdom of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Ethics as descriptive science of Christian conduct (Sitte), not a code of rules.
 - Church as the primary arena of moral formation; sacraments as communal acts shaping ethos.
 - Teleological-eschatological framing of the good as the kingdom s emergence in history.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against Kantian deontology s abstract duty; for concrete communal formation.
 - Against Protestant scholastic casuistry and natural-law universals; for Christ- and Spirit-centered particularity.
 - Distinct from Hegel s state-centered Sittlichkeit; privileges the church over the state.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - God-consciousness and feeling of absolute dependence as ethical ground.
 - Action-formation categories: states vs actions; individual vs communal forms.
 - Recasting covenant as lived communion rather than juridical contract.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for liberal Protestant ethics (Ritschl, Herrmann) and for communitarian ecclesial ethics.
 - A chief foil for Barth and neo-orthodoxy; also mined by Bonhoeffer and Niebuhr with critique.
 - In Reformed theology, appropriated cautiously for ecclesiology and sanctification while rejecting his reduction of dogmatic metaphysics.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Integrates soteriology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology in a robust account of moral formation.
 - Offers textured accounts of vocation, household, society, and church practices under an eschatological telos.
