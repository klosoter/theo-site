### TITLE
Redemptive History and the New Testament Scriptures - Herman Ridderbos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed Dutch scholarship; published in English in the 1960s/1970s context when form criticism, existentialist theology (e.g., Rudolf Bultmann), and historical-critical approaches dominated NT studies.
 - Ridderbos writes from a Reformed, redemptive-historical (heilsgeschichte) perspective shaped by Dutch Neo-Calvinist and Vosian influences, seeking to recover a biblical-theological reading of the NT as coherent historical revelation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament must be read as the theological testimony to a single unfolding redemptive history centering in Christ; this hermeneutic preserves historical continuity and theological unity against approaches that either reduce the NT to disjointed traditions or abstract existential meanings from historical events.
 - Specific concern: understanding **Christ's messianic consciousness and kingdom** as historically rooted, divinely anticipated, and eschatologically inaugurated rather than purely later ecclesial constructions.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Presents the NT as the self-attestation of the redemptive act of God in Christ, not merely a collection of traditions or existential motifs.
 - Traces the OT promise -> messianic fulfillment pattern across Gospels and Paul:
 - The OT promise provides the horizon; Jesus embodies and realizes the messianic expectation historically.
 - The NT writers interpret Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and ascension as the decisive fulfilment and inauguration of the kingdom.
 - Rejects existentialist de-historicizing (meaning detached from historical events) and also rejects a purely chronological or positivistic historiography that severs theological meaning.
 - Emphasizes **kingdom** as both present reality (inaugurated eschatology) and future consummation; Jesus' messianic consciousness is self-aware of fulfilling Israel's vocation and inaugurating eschatological rule.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages critically with Bultmannian existentialism and form-criticism currents; dialogues implicitly with Geerhardus Vos and proponents of covenant/historical theology.
 - Uses NT canonical texts as primary sources, with attention to their theological interpretation rather than only historical-critical reconstruction.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (history as revelation), Christology (Messiahship and consciousness), Kingdom of God (inaugurated eschatology), Covenant theology (promise-fulfillment continuity), biblical theology method.

- **Closing line**
 - Ridderbos centers the NT as the theological-historical testimony to Christ: the Messiah who consciously fulfills Israel's hope and inaugurates the kingdom, thereby making redemptive history the frame for biblical theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insists on reading the NT as a coherent **redemptive-historical testimony**: history is normative revelation, not merely background to theological reflection.
 - Stresses Jesus' own **messianic consciousness** - not an imposed retrojection - as integral to kingdom theology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects existentialist readings that dehistoricize the event of Christ (e.g., Bultmann): theological meaning is bound to historical occurrence.
 - Challenges form-critical fragmentation that detaches sayings from their redemptive-historical axis.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines the **promise-fulfillment** idiom into a sustained hermeneutical principle for NT interpretation.
 - Articulates a clear link between Christ's self-conscious messiahship and the inaugurated-but-not-yet aspect of the kingdom.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and evangelical biblical-theological circles; shaped preaching, catechesis, and NT theology programs.
 - Provided a sustained corrective to liberal and existentialist trends, informing later work in inaugurated eschatology and Christ-centered exegesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Perseveres as a disciplined model for integrating historical-critical sensitivity with theological conviction; indispensable for teaching Christology, kingdom theology, and biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive history (heilsgeschichte)**: History itself is God's self-revelation; the NT interprets events as salvific acts.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic**: The NT must be read with Christ as the focal interpretiation of scripture and history.
- **Messianic consciousness**: Jesus' self-awareness and vocation as Messiah; Ridderbos argues this is historical and decisive for kingdom claims.
- **Kingdom of God**: Inaugurated eschatology - present reality in Christ and future consummation.
- **Promise-fulfillment pattern**: Covenantal promises of Israel find their fulfillment in Christ and the NT's portrayal of him.
- **Fulfillment (pleroma/teleology)**: NT language showing completion and telos in Christ; not merely typological but eschatologically decisive.
- **Typology vs. allegory**: Typology rooted in historical continuity and divine intention; rejects arbitrary allegorization.
- **New Testament as testimony/witness**: NT documents function as theological testimony to the historical saving acts of God in Christ.
- **Historical-theological method**: Method that preserves both historical inquiry and theological interpretation without collapsing one into the other.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: The kingdom is both "already" in Christ and "not yet" in consummation.
- **Covenant continuity**: The unity of God's saving purpose across OT and NT covenants.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for redemptive-historical method in biblical theology curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against existentialist and form-critical reductions of the NT.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching and sermon structure that centers OT promise and NT fulfillment.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Christology and kingdom studies, especially for articulating messianic consciousness as historically embedded.
