### TITLE
**Christ-Centered Biblical Theology (2012)** - Graeme Goldsworthy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within contemporary evangelical and Reformed resurgence of biblical-theology pedagogy; aimed at pastors, students, and teachers wanting a succinct hermeneutical and homiletical guide. Builds on mid-20th-21st century redemptive-historical movement.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible is a unified, progressive revelation whose controlling center and theological telos is Jesus Christ; correct interpretation and preaching require reading both Testaments Christocentrically (promise → fulfillment → application).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes a hermeneutic that reads Scripture as one unfolding drama:
 - **Promise**: God's covenantal promises given in the OT (seed, land, kingship, blessing).
 - **Fulfillment**: These promises find their decisive fulfillment in Christ (incarnation, atonement, resurrection, inaugurated eschatology).
 - **Application**: The church's life and mission participate in the outworking of that fulfillment now and anticipate consummation.
 - Emphasizes typology and promise-fulfillment as canonical reading principles; argues against isolating texts as merely moral or topical.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with Geerhardus Vos (redemptive-historical reading), Brevard Childs (canonical shape), and recent evangelical biblical theologians (e.g., G. K. Beale); interacts with typical pulpit practice and academic hermeneutics.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture (unity and authority), Covenant theology (promise-fulfillment axis), Christology (center/telos), Kingdom of God (God's rule inaugurated in Christ), Typology, Eschatology (inaugurated-consummated), Hermeneutics and preaching theory.
- **Closing line**
 - The Bible must be read as one drama of God's covenantal promise fulfilled in Christ; every text is best understood and proclaimed in relation to him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Economy of argument: a compact, pastor-friendly hermeneutic stressing **Christ as the interpretive center** rather than merely one doctrine among others.
 - Practical orientation: targeted to preaching and teaching - not just academic description but a usable method for homiletics.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Purely moralistic or exemplar readings that detach texts from redemptive history.
 - Fragmented biblical-theology that fails to show canonical unity.
 - Offers an alternative to both systematic-first and proof-text methods: Scripture interpreted from within its historical-canonical storyline.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the succinct triplet **"promise → fulfillment → application"** as a guiding hermeneutical algorithm.
 - Reframes typology as normative exegetical practice rather than a quaint auxiliary.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical and Reformed seminaries and churches as an introductory manual for Christ-centered preaching and study.
 - Influential in shaping contemporary homiletical training and textbook treatments of biblical theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, teachable model that bridges academy and pulpit; durable as a primer for preaching, sermon structure, and canonical reading pedagogy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ-centered / Christocentric**
 - Reading and interpretation that locates Christ as the Bible's controlling focus and telos.
- **Promise**
 - Covenantal promises given primarily in the OT (seed, land, king, blessing) that shape redemptive history.
- **Fulfillment**
 - The decisive realization of OT promises in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
- **Application**
 - The contemporary and pastoral outworking of fulfilled promises in church life and mission.
- **Typology**
 - Old Testament persons/events as divinely ordained patterns fulfilled in Christ; normative for canonical interpretation.
- **Redemptive-historical reading**
 - Interpreting texts within the unfolding drama of creation, fall, redemption, consummation with Christ as pivot.
- **Covenant**
 - The structural frame for biblical unity; God's covenantal dealings drive the narrative and theological continuity.
- **Kingdom of God**
 - God's rule inaugurated in Christ; both present reality and future consummation in eschatology.
- **Canon / canonical shape**
 - The Bible's final form as the context that determines meaning; reading within canonical contours emphasizes unity.
- **Hermeneutic of promise → fulfillment → application**
 - A three-step exegetical model for connecting OT promises to their NT realization and to contemporary preaching.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The already/not-yet nature of Christ's kingdom as central to understanding promise and fulfillment.
- **Biblical-theology vs systematic-theology**
 - Goldsworthy privileges the narrative/centered reading of Scripture as a foundation upon which systematic work should proceed.
- **Law/Grace relationship**
 - Read through covenant and fulfillment in Christ rather than antithetical categories.
- **Unity of Scripture**
 - Emphasizes theological coherence across testaments through covenantal promise and typological fulfillment.

- **Typical uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for what it means to read Scripture "Christ-centered" in courses and sermon prep.
 - As an **exegetical and homiletical model**: practical algorithm for sermon structure and canonical exegesis.
 - As a **polemic** against moralizing, proof-texting, and disjointed biblical-theological approaches; a conceptual pivot linking OT promises to NT fulfillment.
