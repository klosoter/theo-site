### TITLE
The Word of God for the People of God - J. Todd Billings

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed and evangelical conversation about Scripture, preaching, and worship; engages pastoral theology and ecclesiology in light of renewed interest in liturgy and the church as a hearing community.
 - Responds to trends of privatized Bible reading and consumerist congregational practice by recovering a corporate, sacramental, and pastoral account of the Word.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The primary thesis: **the Word of God should be understood not merely as text or private object of belief but as an enacted, ecclesial reality - written, proclaimed, and received within the covenant community**. The problem addressed is how Scripture functions as authoritative and formative for the church in a way that avoids both individualistic subjectivism and dead formalism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses contemporary deficits: atomized Bible use, thin preaching, and insufficient integration of Word and sacrament.
 - Reconstructs a Reformed/evangelical ecclesiology of the Word that:
 - Distinguishes but unites the Word as written (Scripture), spoken (preaching), and enacted (liturgy/sacrament).
 - Emphasizes the **performative** character of proclamation - the Word does things in and through the community by the Spirit.
 - Argues for the centrality of public, communal hearing and embodied reception as formative of Christian identity and practice.
 - Offers theological resources (Scripture, Calvin, Augustine, modern pastoral theology) to ground pastoral and liturgical practice that honors both Scripture's propositional truth and its efficacious, incarnational action in the church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed figures (especially Calvin), patristic themes (Augustine), contemporary pastoral theologians, and liturgical renewal movements.
 - Positioned against privateistic Protestant readings and certain liberal historicist approaches that reduce Scripture to human artifacts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (nature and function of the Word)
 - Ecclesiology (church as hearing, covenant people)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit's role in making the Word efficacious)
 - Sacramentology (Word and sacrament as intertwined means of grace)
 - Preaching and pastoral theology (authority and practice of proclamation)

- **Closing line**
 - Billings centers theology on the conviction that **the Word of God is a corporate, Spirit-wrought reality for the people of God - proclaimed, heard, and enacted in the life of the church**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the *ecclesial reception* of the Word: authority derives from the Word's efficacy in the covenant community rather than merely from isolated propositional assent.
 - Balances propositional truth with **performative effectiveness**: Scripture tells and does; preaching is an event that forms identity and obedience.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects individualistic or privatized Scripture use common in modern evangelicalism.
 - Pushes back on purely textualist or bibliocentric accounts that neglect the role of preaching, liturgy, and sacraments in mediating the Word.
 - Distinguishes his view from sacramental excesses by retaining Protestant concerns for Scripture while recuperating sacramental and communal dimensions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses language of "Word as event" and "ecclesial reception" to shift attention from text alone to the Word's communal enactment.
 - Integrates pastoral formation language with systematic categories (revelation, covenant, pneumatology).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles seeking corrective to individualism and for resources in worship and preaching renewal.
 - Employed in pastoral theology courses and by pastors committed to integrating preaching, liturgy, and pastoral formation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, theologically coherent bridge between doctrine of Scripture and practical ministry - especially useful for training preachers and shaping congregational worship that is both faithful to Scripture and formative of Christian identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God**
 - Encompasses written Scripture, preached proclamation, and enacted presence in worship/sacrament.
- **Scripture as written Word**
 - Propositional, normative text; foundation for preaching and teaching.
- **Proclamation / preaching**
 - The spoken Word as a performative, formative event in the assembly.
- **Ecclesial reception**
 - The church's communal hearing, appropriation, and obedience to the Word; locus of Scripture's authority.
- **Performative Word / Word as event**
 - Emphasizes what the Word does (forms, convicts, calls) rather than only what it states.
- **Covenant people**
 - The social-communicative shape of the church; formation occurs within covenantal relations.
- **Sacrament / Word-sacrament relation**
 - Sacraments are not opposed to the Word but participate in the Word's efficacy.
- **Pneumatology of reception**
 - The Spirit enables the Word's power and the church's hearing.
- **Public reading / hearing**
 - Liturgical practice that grounds Scripture's communal authority.
- **Pastoral formation**
 - The practical end of the Word's work: shaping Christian life and ministry.
- **Authority (ecclesial vs. private)**
 - Authority is mediated in the community rather than merely asserted by individual interpretation.
- **Hermeneutic of worship**
 - Reading Scripture in and through liturgical practice rather than solely academic exegesis.
- **Communal memory**
 - The church's tradition and preaching shape how Scripture is remembered and applied.
- **Reformational roots**
 - Retains Reformation concerns for Scripture while deepening its ecclesial and sacramental reception.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for ecclesial models of the Word that unite proclamation and sacrament.
 - As a **pastoral/ministerial model** for preaching and worship formation in seminaries and congregational training.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over private vs. public authority of Scripture and the role of the Spirit in reception.
