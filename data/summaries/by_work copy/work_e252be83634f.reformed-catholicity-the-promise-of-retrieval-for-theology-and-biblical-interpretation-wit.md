### TITLE
**Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation** (Michael Allen & Scott R. Swain, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2015 amid a renewed Reformed interest in historical theology, ecumenical retrieval, and confessional identity.
 - Responds to both Protestant sectarianism and postliberal/modernist dismissals of tradition; seeks a middle way of confessional retrieval.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformed tradition benefits when it consciously retrieves the catholic (i.e., ecumenical, doctrinally formative) resources of the church to strengthen theology and biblical interpretation while remaining confessionally Reformed.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define what "catholicity" means for Reformed theology: doctrinal continuity grounded in Scripture and normative creeds/confessions.
 - Diagnose failures: (1) Reformed parochialism that ignores the wider church's doctrinal wisdom; (2) liberal reductionism that secularizes tradition.
 - Propose retrieval as a method: disciplined appropriation of patristic, medieval, and later consensual doctrines, judged by Scripture and confessional standards.
 - Apply to biblical interpretation and loci (e.g., Trinity, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology) demonstrating improved exegesis and doctrinal coherence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic authors, medieval theologians, Calvin, Bavinck, Kuyper; modern interlocutors include Karl Barth (notably his reformulation of catholic retrieval), contemporary Reformed scholars, and critics influenced by Rahnerian moves.
 - Engages methodological claims about theological science and principia (theoretical foundations).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority (Scripture + creeds), Trinity, Christology, union with Christ, soteriology (including sanctification), ecclesiology, sacramentology, hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - Reformed catholicity proposes that a disciplined recovery of the church's doctrinal tradition, submitted to Scripture and confessional norms, renews both systematic theology and biblical interpretation in ways uniquely Reformed and genuinely catholic.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Explicitly frames retrieval as both confessional and catholic-not a capitulation to Roman claims nor a mere antiquarianism.
 - Prioritizes *doctrinal continuity* (consensus on core doctrines) over procedural or institutional uniformity.
- **Corrections and contrasts**
 - Corrects modern Protestant isolationism by showing the theological gains of catholic dialogue.
 - Contrasts with liberal historicism by insisting on Scripture as normative criterion for retrieval.
 - Offers a middle path between Barthian novelty and pietistic novelty: affirms historical doctrine while allowing reformulation under scriptural primacy.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - "Reformed catholicity" as a programmatic term: recovery plus confessional critique.
 - Methodological insistence on principia - theology as disciplined, principled science grounded in revelation and ecclesial rule.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among confessional Reformed scholars, seminarians, and biblical interpreters seeking ecclesial continuity.
 - Cited in debates over patristic use, confessional identity, and ecumenical conversation from a Protestant standpoint.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a teachable framework for integrating historical theology into systematic work and exegesis.
 - Serves as a corrective to both parochialism and uncritical traditionalism, useful in pastoral formation and academic instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reformed catholicity**
 - The programmatic synthesis: catholic doctrinal resources appropriated within a Reformed confessional framework.
- **Retrieval**
 - Disciplined appropriation of earlier doctrinal consensus, subject to Scripture and confessional judgment.
- **Confessionalism**
 - Use of historic Reformed confessions as hermeneutical and doctrinal filters for retrieval.
- **Principia / Theology as science**
 - Theology conceived as a principled, rational, and doxological discipline grounded in revelatory truths (see Theological Method: Principia Theology As Science).
- **Scripture + Creeds**
 - Normative pair: Scripture ultimate judge; creeds serve as summational aids and hermeneutical guides.
- **Rahner's Rule and Barth's Reformulation**
 - Treated as methodological touchstones: Rahnerian heuristic about patristic theology and Barth's corrective reformulation that preserves classical resources while reorienting them to Christ and revelation (see Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation).
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological locus for both justification and sanctification; grounds the claim of *definitive* forgiveness and *progressive* ethical transformation.
- **Sanctification: Definitive and Progressive**
 - Distinguishes definitive union-based status (positional holiness) from progressive experiential growth in holiness (see Sanctification Definitive And Progressive).
- **Analogia fidei / regula fidei**
 - Principles for reading Scripture with doctrinal coherence informed by the church's faith.
- **Patristic retrieval**
 - Selective use of Fathers for doctrinal continuity, not wholesale adoption of historical accretions.
- **Ecclesial normativity**
 - The church's consensual teaching as a significant, though subordinate, norming influence.
- **Doxological epistemology**
 - Knowledge of God framed as worshipful assent formed by Scripture and creedal confession.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "catholicity" in Reformed theology and ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic** against sectarian novelty and secularizing historicism.
 - As an **exegetical model** promoting creedal-laden biblical interpretation and a conceptual pivot for systematic theology and pastoral formation.
