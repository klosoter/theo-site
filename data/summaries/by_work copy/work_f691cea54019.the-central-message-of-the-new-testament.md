### TITLE
The Central Message of the New Testament - Joachim Jeremias

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century German New Testament scholarship; Jeremias (1900-1979) is rooted in Lutheran exegetical tradition and historical-critical method with strong interest in Jewish backgrounds of Jesus and the NT.
 - Reaction to form-criticism, Schweitzerian eschatology, and existential readings (e.g., Bultmann); aims to recover the NT's original proclamation for theology and church life.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament's central message is the in-breaking, imminence and realized eschatology of the Kingdom of God in Jesus Christ, with concrete implications for Christology, sacraments, and ecclesial order.
 - The NT portrays Christian rites (notably the Lord's Supper) as **eschatological signs** in which the presence of Christ is mediated - and the church must regulate access (fencing and admission) to preserve covenant integrity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical reconstruction of Jesus' proclamation of the Kingdom in its Jewish eschatological horizon.
 - Survey of NT writings showing how early Christian preaching interprets Jesus as the inaugurator of the Kingdom (Gospel, Paul, Johannine literature).
 - Practical corollaries: sacraments (especially Eucharist) are foretaste and sign-realization of the Kingdom; Pauline discipline (1 Cor 11, pastoral letters) reflects a canonical practice of regulating communion.
 - Theological synthesis linking Christology, eschatology, and sacramental theology: presence is real (though not necessarily defined metaphysically), and church order guards the sign's integrity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Schweitzer and Bultmann on eschatology and method; dialogues with Reformation debates on the Eucharist (implicitly addressing both Luther and Zwingli); uses Jewish apocalyptic and Second Temple background material.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (imminence, inaugurated Kingdom), Christology (Jesus as eschatological Lord), Sacramental theology (Eucharist as presence/foretaste), Ecclesiology (discipline, admission), Revelation (kingdom as revelation-event).

- **Closing line**
 - Jeremias presses that the NT centers on God's present and coming kingship in Christ, and that sacramental practice and church discipline function as faithful, boundary-marking responses to that eschatological reality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong recovery of the Jewish eschatological matrix of Jesus' message as normative for interpreting the NT as a whole.
 - Treats the Lord's Supper primarily as an **eschatological sign** - a foretaste of the kingdom in which the **presence of Christ** is genuinely mediated to believers.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on existentialist demythologizing (Bultmann) by insisting on historical eventhood and objective eschatological claims.
 - Distinguishes itself from purely symbolic or purely metaphysical models of the Eucharist by locating "presence" in the intersection of proclamation, sign, and communal participation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the language of "inaugurated eschatology" as operative in sacramental theology: rites are both sign and early realization of consummation.
 - Uses communal-administrative categories (fencing, admission) as theological categories: ecclesial boundaries are theological responses to the sacrament's eschatological force.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected across confessional lines for his philological and contextual work; influenced pastoral and liturgical conversations by reframing sacraments in eschatological terms.
 - Quoted in debates on real presence and on communion discipline; used by scholars seeking a middle path between Lutheran and symbolic views.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models integration of historical-critical exegesis with ecclesial praxis.
 - Clarifies how NT theology grounds sacramental presence and church discipline as coherent responses to the Kingdom theme.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Central NT motif; Jeremias argues it is both present and future (inaugurated) in Jesus.
- **Eschatological imminence**
 - The expectation that God's decisive act is near; shapes proclamation and ethics.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The thesis that the eschaton has begun in Christ and is being consummated.
- **Presence of Christ**
 - Not merely symbolic; a real, sacramental presence mediated in proclamation and supper.
- **Lord's Supper / Eucharist**
 - An eschatological meal, a foretaste of the kingdom that communicates Christ to the community.
- **Sign and reality**
 - Sacraments are signs that truly signify and participate in the reality they promise.
- **Fencing the table**
 - Ecclesial practice of delimiting who may partake; a protective, covenantal discipline grounded in NT texts.
- **Admission / discipline**
 - Church regulation of access to the sacrament; linked to pastoral care and communal holiness (e.g., 1 Cor 11).
- **Foretaste**
 - The Eucharist as a partial, anticipatory experience of the consummated kingdom.
- **Historical Jesus method**
 - Jeremias' use of Jewish background and historical reconstruction to ground theological claims.
- **Parousia**
 - The coming of the Lord; frames urgency and meaning of sacramental practice.
- **Covenant meal**
 - The supper as covenantal sign - communal, binding, and regulative.
- **Sacramental mediation**
 - How grace/presence is conveyed through signs, words, and community.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an exegetical model for reading the NT around the kingdom motif and connecting text to practice.
 - As a polemical resource against purely symbolic Eucharistic interpretations and against demythologizing approaches.
 - As a definitional source for arguing that the Lord's Supper is an eschatological, real presence event that warrants ecclesial fencing and pastoral admission policies.
