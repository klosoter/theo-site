### TITLE
Evil and the Cross: An Analytical Look at the Problem of Pain (Henri Blocher, 1994)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1994 by a French Reformed evangelical theologian working at the intersection of systematic theology, biblical exegesis, and apologetics.
 - Emerges amid late 20th-century debates over theodicy, post-Holocaust theology, and renewed interest in narrative and Christus Victor motifs.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The cross is the decisive interpretive and soteriological answer to the problem of pain: not a purely philosophical justification of God, but God's participatory, redemptive engagement with evil.
 - Theodicy must be anchored in revelation (especially the cross) rather than purely in speculative metaphysics.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: clarifies forms of evil (moral vs. natural) and the limits of purely intellectual theodicies.
 - Biblical correction: shows how Scripture reframes the problem by revealing God's suffering love in Christ.
 - Theodicy reoriented: proposes a Christ-centered theodicy that combines
 - God's permissive governance and creaturely freedom (account for origin of sin),
 - God's hiddenness and revelation (limits of general revelation),
 - and the decisive reversal enacted in the cross and eschaton.
 - Practical and pastoral implications: theology of lament, hope, and vindication rather than abstract proof.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical theodicies (Augustinian privation, Irenaean soul-making), analytic philosophers (e.g., Plantinga-type free-will defenses), and modern critics (Hick, philosophical theism).
 - Dialogues with contemporary theologians on suffering (e.g., Moltmann, though Blocher keeps stronger Reformed commitments).
 - Heavy use of Scripture and Reformed doctrinal categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general vs. special), **sin** (nature and origin), **Christology** (cross as theodical center), **soteriology**, **eschatology** (vindication), providence, and the language of divine impassibility versus divine suffering.

- **Closing line**
 - Blocher insists that the cross transforms the theodical enterprise: the ultimate "answer" to pain is God's self-revelation in Christ who suffers with and for the world, promising final vindication.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers the cross as theologically prior to any speculative justification: theodicy becomes testimony to what God has done, not a rational defense of what God might be.
 - Strong integration of exegetical attention (biblical narrative, lament Psalms, passion narratives) with philosophical clarity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques purely Augustinian "soul-making" or abstract metaphysical defenses that neglect Christ's redemptive suffering.
 - Distinguishes his view from both defeatist "process" theologies and cold rationalist theodicies that exculpate God without pastoral sensitivity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Articulates a "Christocentric theodicy" framework that treats divine suffering and solidarity as doctrinal pivots.
 - Emphasizes the methodological priority of revelation over natural theology in addressing evil.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed evangelical circles for marrying orthodoxy with pastoral concern; used in seminary courses on theodicy and pastoral theology.
 - Appreciated by wider evangelical and pastoral audiences for its accessible yet rigorous treatment; less traction among purely analytic philosophers who prefer formal formulations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how biblical Christology can reshape doctrinal responses to evil.
 - Serves as a bridge between exegetical, pastoral, and philosophical treatments of suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodicy**: Blocher reframes it as a Christ-shaped testimony, not merely logical vindication.
- **Problem of Pain**: Clarified into moral vs. natural categories; insistence that answers must account for both.
- **Cross / Crucifixion**: Central interpretive key; God's redemptive suffering and solidarity with victims.
- **Divine Suffering / Impassibility**: Reassesses classical impassibility to allow for relational, redemptive participation in suffering.
- **Freedom and Responsibility**: Creaturely freedom as ground for the origin of moral evil (see: Nature And Origin Of Sin).
- **General Revelation**: Reveals God's power and goodness but is insufficient to solve theodicy alone (see: General And Special Revelation).
- **Special Revelation**: Christ and the Scriptures supply the decisive interpretive framework for suffering.
- **The Fall**: Historical/primal rupture that explains structural disorder and introduced moral corruption (see: The Fall And Its Consequences).
- **Natural Evil**: Treated as part of creation's groaning, linked to cosmic consequences of the Fall and creaturely finitude.
- **Eschatological Vindication**: Future reversal that completes the cross's partial victory; hope is theological antidote to present pain.
- **Lament**: Proper theological posture; theodicy must include lament as canonical practice.
- **Christocentric Theodicy**: Term for Blocher's approach prioritizing the cross as explanatory center.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: supplies a concise, Christ-centered definition of theodicy for systematic theology courses.
 - Exegetical model and pastoral resource: used to demonstrate how biblical narrative (lament, passion) informs pastoral responses to suffering.
 - Polemic and conceptual pivot: cited to criticize abstract philosophical theodicies that neglect revelation and the incarnational answer.
