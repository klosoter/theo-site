### TITLE
**Imagining the Kingdom: How Worship Works (2013) - James K. A. Smith**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2013 amid renewed interest in liturgical theology, philosophical anthropology, and cultural critique; second volume in Smith's "Cultural Liturgies" project following Desiring the Kingdom (2009).
 - Situated in broadly Reformed, evangelical, and liturgical renewal conversations; dialogues with Anglo-American moral philosophy (MacIntyre, Taylor) and classic Christian resources (Augustine, Calvin).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Worship is not primarily propositional information transfer but formative practice: liturgies (sacred and secular) shape our imaginations and desires, so Christian worship must rehearse the eschatological story of the kingdom to re-orient embodied worshipers.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of the "cognitive/informational" model of worship that treats belief as intellectual assent.
 - Philosophical-anthropological premise: humans are primarily desiring animals whose loves are formed by practices and habits.
 - The role of imagination and narrative: worship teaches us to see the world (to imagine the kingdom) through enacted stories, symbols, and embodied rhythms.
 - Liturgical proposal: Christian worship should be seen as eschatological rehearsal - practices that form ecclesial citizens for the inaugurated-but-not-yet kingdom.
 - Practical implications for liturgy, preaching, sacraments, and cultural engagement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine and Calvin (formation, memory, sacramentality), Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor (narrative and imagination), and social-theoretical resources on habit and practice.
 - Engages the tradition of Christ-and-culture debate by framing worship eschatologically (see "Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective").
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (desire, formation), ecclesiology (worship, sacraments), eschatology (kingdom imagination), worship theology, implicit pneumatology and Christology (as enacted through worship), and a practical ethics of formation.
 - Also addresses sin and human brokenness as formative forces (see "The Fall And Its Consequences").
- **Closing line**
 - Worship is formative liturgy: the church must enact kingdom-imagination through embodied practices that re-form loves and prepare citizens for the eschatological reign of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Moves the argument from "what we know" to "what we love": centralizing desire and imagination over propositional belief in accounts of worship.
 - Broadens "liturgy" to include secular embodied practices ("secular liturgies") that form citizens, thus collapsing neat sacred/secular partitions.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects the modern Protestant tendency to reduce worship to information transfer or sermon-centered cognition; contrasts with models exemplified by certain revivalist or information-heavy traditions.
 - Contrasts with purely cultural accommodation models in the Christ-and-culture debate by insisting worship enacts eschatological identity rather than merely reflecting culture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes "liturgies" as a lens for cultural critique and ecclesial formation.
 - Emphasizes "imagination" as theological locus: liturgical imagination, kingdom-imagination.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and evangelical academic and pastoral circles; taken up by worship leaders, pastors, and seminaries for liturgical renewal and catechesis.
 - Also adopted in broader theology and philosophy of religion as a bridge between philosophical anthropology and practical theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a durable framework for thinking of worship as formation - useful in homiletics, liturgics, catechesis, and cultural theology.
 - Provokes fruitful critique of worship practices and cultural engagement strategies; remains a common textbook in courses on worship and Christian formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liturgies**
 - Practices that form desires and habits; includes both church rites and secular rituals.
- **Imagination / Kingdom-imagination**
 - The habitual way of seeing reality shaped by stories and practices; worship re-imagines the world in light of the kingdom.
- **Formation**
 - The process by which liturgical practices shape hearts, habits, and identities.
- **Desire / Loves**
 - Core anthropological category: humans are led by loves that worship instills or redirects.
- **Eschatological rehearsal**
 - Worship as enactment of the inaugurated kingdom; present practices anticipate future consummation.
- **Secular liturgies**
 - Non-ecclesial practices (consumerism, nationalism, media) that function liturgically to form citizens.
- **Narrative / Story**
 - Scripture and liturgy tell a formative story that orients imagination and moral perception.
- **Habitus / Habits**
 - Bodily routines and dispositions cultivated by repeated liturgical practices.
- **Sacramentality**
 - Material and embodied character of worship as means of forming faith and desire.
- **Imagination vs. Information**
 - Key contrast: formation through embodied practice versus cognitive transmission of doctrine.
- **Anthropology of worship**
 - Treats human beings as embodied, narrative creatures shaped by worship.
- **Rehearsal ethics**
 - Moral formation through ritualized practice rather than only propositional teaching.
- **Cultural critique**
 - Using liturgical lens to diagnose how secular liturgies shape public imagination.
- **Conversion of worship**
 - Reorienting communal practices to enact gospel-shaped desires.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "liturgies" and "formation" in worship studies and philosophical theology.
 - As a **polemic** against cognitive-only models of preaching and catechesis; practical resource for redesigning liturgy and Christian education.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Christ-and-culture discussions, reframing cultural engagement in eschatological formative terms and addressing consequences of the Fall by diagnosing rival formative regimes.
