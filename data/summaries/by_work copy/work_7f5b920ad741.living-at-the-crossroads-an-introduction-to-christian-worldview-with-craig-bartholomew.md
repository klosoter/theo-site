### TITLE
**Living at the Crossroads: An Introduction to Christian Worldview** - Michael W. Goheen & Craig Bartholomew

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed context (first edition 2002; revised editions later). Arises amid concerns about privatized faith, secularization, and the need for holistic Christian formation for mission in postmodern, pluralist societies.
 - Theological milieu: Reformed, missional, and narrative-theological impulses (dialogue with Kuyperian emphases, Newbigin, and contemporary evangelical worldview apologetics).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christians must cultivate a comprehensive, incarnational Christian worldview shaped by the Bible's narrative (creation, fall, redemption, consummation) that orients vocation and cultural engagement-living faithfully at the intersection of God's kingdom inaugurated by Christ and the present cultural orders.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - The book proceeds as a pedagogical introduction to worldview formation rooted in Scripture and oriented to mission:
 - Foundation: what a worldview is and why narrative matters.
 - Biblical metanarrative: Creation - Fall - Redemption - Consummation (CFRC).
 - Key loci: God (Trinity), revelation, covenant, Christ, Spirit, church, mission, culture, ethics.
 - Practical outworking: vocation, cultural mandate/dominion, discipleship, public life, congregational formation.
 - Case studies and applications for personal, ecclesial, and public spheres.
 - Emphasizes **worldview as enacted story**: theology is not merely propositional but shapes habits, practices, and institutions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed and evangelical predecessors: Abraham Kuyper, Lesslie Newbigin, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Francis Schaeffer (critique of secularism), N. T. Wright (eschatology), and various worldview/apologetic writers.
 - Biblical exegesis is primary; secondary theological and cultural theory is used diagnostically.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as narrative/authority), covenant theology (biblical covenantal framework), Trinity (God as communal agent of mission), Christology (Christ as center of redemption and cultural restoration), eschatology (inaugurated and consummated kingdom), vocation and common grace, creation and cultural mandate, ecclesiology (church as missionary community).

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically center: **a narrative, covenantal Reformed worldview that makes vocation and cultural mandate the locus of discipleship and mission within the inaugurated-but-not-yet kingdom.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Worldview formation presented as communal, narrative, and vocational rather than merely intellectual assent.
 - Strong integration of **vocation** and the **cultural mandate/dominion**: every sphere of life is an arena for faithful stewardship and witness.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against dualistic sacred/secular separations common in pietistic traditions.
 - More ecclesially grounded and missionally oriented than abstract apologetic treatments of worldview; less individualistic than many Protestant self-help approaches.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Living at the crossroads" as a metaphor for Christian situatedness between inauguration and consummation.
 - Treating worldview primarily as an **enacted biblical story**, not only a set of propositions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries and undergraduate curricula for worldview, mission, and cultural engagement classes.
 - Influential among those seeking to renew vocation-centered discipleship and public theology within conservative Protestantism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a pedagogically accessible, theologically coherent framework linking doctrine to daily life and public engagement.
 - Durable resource for pastors, teachers, and mission strategists wanting a biblically grounded, missional vision of culture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Worldview as story** - The Bible provides a grand narrative (CFRC) that forms Christian identity and practice.
- **Creation-Fall-Redemption-Consummation (CFRC)** - The central exegetical scaffold for interpreting all life and history.
- **Vocation** - Broadly defined as God-given calling to serve creation and neighbor in every sphere; primary locus for ethical formation.
- **Cultural mandate / dominion** - The command to steward and cultivate creation; grounds Christian engagement in arts, politics, economy, science.
 - Tied to vocation: calling to transform culture by faithful stewardship, not domination.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - Kingdom has been initiated in Christ but awaits consummation; shapes a patient, hopeful cultural engagement.
- **Church as missionary community** - Ecclesiology that prioritizes formation, practices, and communal witness over privatized piety.
- **Narrative theology** - Emphasis on Scripture's story-shape as normative for worldview and ethics.
- **Covenant framework** - Scripture read through covenant relations: God's promises, peoplehood, and mission.
- **Trinitarian mission** - God's communal life as the basis for relational, missional church practice.
- **Discipleship as formation** - Practices and habits enacted in community to embody worldview.

 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture as metanarrative that grounds mission and cultural engagement.
