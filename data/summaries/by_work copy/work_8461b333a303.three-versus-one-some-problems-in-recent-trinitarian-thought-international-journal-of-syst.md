### TITLE
Three Versus One? Some Problems in Recent Trinitarian Thought - Stephen R. Holmes (International Journal of Systematic Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Trinitarian renewal: reaction to modern theology, resurgence of patristic retrieval, rise of "social" Trinitarian models (Zizioulas, LaCugna, Moltmann, Jenson) and analytic theology engagement.
 - Holmes writes within a broadly conservative/creedal scholarly milieu concerned to protect classical formulations while taking recent proposals seriously.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Recent Trinitarian proposals that emphasize the threefold personal life of God have generated conceptual and theological difficulties: they risk undermining divine unity, divine simplicity, or orthodox Christology. Holmes seeks to identify these problems and to defend a guardedly classical balance: three persons within one God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis:
 - Contemporary emphases on "three-ness" (personhood, relationality, social ontology) often proceed at the expense of the traditional stress on God's unity and simplicity.
 - Certain rhetorical moves (e.g., treating persons as separable centers of consciousness or as analogous to human persons) import categories inappropriate to divine ontology.
 - Critical engagement:
 - Exposes tensions in influential proposals (social Trinitarianism, some patristic rereadings, and responses to modern pluralism) and examines their exegetical and metaphysical costs.
 - Interrogates "one-person" formulations (reference to Van Til's language and its critiques) and how corrective reactions can overshoot toward problematic threefold emphases.
 - Constructive move:
 - Advocates recovering classical distinctions (ousia/hypostasis, immanent/economic Trinity, perichoresis) with analytic clarity and theological restraint.
 - Urges that any renewed Trinitarian account must preserve monotheism, proper Christology, and the doxological orientation of doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages with major contemporary voices: social Trinitarians (e.g., Zizioulas, LaCugna, Moltmann), analytic and systematic critics, and historical sources (Nicene-Constantinopolitan creeds, patristic categories).
 - Specific attention to "Van Til's one-person language and its critique" as a locus for examining terminological and theological risks.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (implications for unity of person in Christ), revelation (economic/immanent distinction), divine simplicity, perichoresis, and theological method.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Holmes insists that a robust Trinitarian theology must affirm both the **threefold personal life** and the **undivided oneness** of God, avoiding anthropomorphic or social analogies that dissolve creedal commitments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological caution: blends patristic fidelity with analytic precision to show where popular modern formulations err.
 - Doxological concern: doctrine judged not merely by abstract coherence but by implications for worship and Christology.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters social-Trinitarian tendencies that depict God as a community of autonomous centers; contrasts with those who unduly flatten the unity of God.
 - Responds to corrective moves (e.g., Van Til's "one-person" idiom) by showing both their intended safeguards and their limitations; argues that overreaction in either direction is the problem.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not primarily innovative in terminology; rather, Holmes sharpens conventional terms (hypostasis, ousia, perichoresis) and re-applies them critically to contemporary debates.
 - Emphasizes careful semantic containment of "person" language to avoid anthropological equivocation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and broader evangelical circles as a clear corrective to oversimplified social models.
 - Cited in subsequent debates as a tempering voice-helpful to those seeking to preserve creedal precision while engaging modern thought.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful pedagogically for teaching the balance between unity and distinction in Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Stands as a compact guide to recognizing conceptual pitfalls in modern Trinitarian proposals.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (three versus one)** - central tension between affirming three persons and one God.
- **Hypostasis / Prosopon** - technical term for "personhood" in classical theology; reserved to avoid anthropic conflation.
- **Ousia / Essence** - God's unified being; Holmes emphasizes this to guard monotheism.
- **Economic vs Immanent Trinity** - distinction between God's actions in history and God's inner life; used to check speculative excesses.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling; highlighted as a non-competitive mode of relation among persons that preserves unity.
- **Divine simplicity** - metaphysical principle constraining talk of separable centers in God.
- **Social Trinitarianism** - contemporary model that Holmes critiques for potential fragmenting of divine unity.
- **One-person language (Van Til)** - idiom that attempts to emphasize divine unity by stressing a singular reference point; Holmes treats this as a corrective with limits and possible misunderstandings.
- **Modalism** - error to be avoided; Holmes shows how overemphasis on unity risks modalistic readings if not carefully nuanced.
- **Subordinationism** - another historical error; Holmes warns that some modern formulations unintentionally suggest ontological subordination among persons.
- **Christological implications** - how Trinitarian models impact the doctrine of the person of Christ (unity of natures and person).
- **Doxology / Worship** - criterion for evaluating Trinitarian speech: does it foster proper worship of the one God?

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **diagnostic/polemic**: to critique social Trinitarian and overly anthropomorphic accounts.
 - As a **didactic resource**: concise exposition to teach the classical balance of unity and distinction in Trinity and to clarify technical vocabulary for students and pastors.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: used in systematic theology courses to re-center debates on creedal categories (ousia/hypostasis) and to show methodological caution when importing metaphysical models.
