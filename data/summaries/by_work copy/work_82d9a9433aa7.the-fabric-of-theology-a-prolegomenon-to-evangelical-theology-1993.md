### TITLE
The Fabric of Theology: A Prolegomenon to Evangelical Theology (1993) - Richard Lints

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical academy responding to fragmentation of evangelicalism, rise of postmodern critiques, and ongoing debates about theological method and identity. Written from a broadly Reformed-evangelical perspective conscious of both confessional tradition and contemporary methodological concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be practiced as an integrated, coherent "fabric" that holds together biblical fidelity, doctrinal ordering, historical consciousness, and ecclesial doxology. Without a disciplined prolegomenon, evangelical theology risks atomization, privatism, or capitulation to modernist/lapsarian reductionisms.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prefatory diagnosis: contemporary evangelicalism suffers methodologically from fragmentation (biblicism without doctrine, pietism without doctrine, or system without Scripture).
 - Methodological proposal: a prolegomenon that locates theology within Scripture's own self-understanding, the church's interpretive tradition, and disciplined theological reflection.
 - Theological ordering: theology's loci must be integrated so that doctrine (God, Christ, Spirit, Scripture, creation, sin, redemption, eschatology) forms a coherent whole oriented to worship and mission.
 - Anthropological case study (Image of God): shows how a properly ordered theology reframes anthropology - imago Dei understood relationally/covenantally and fulfilled in Christ.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: theological method shapes preaching, worship, and Christian formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed resources, evangelical interlocutors, and contemporary methodological critiques (liberalism, certain strains of pietism, reductionist natural theology, and aspects of postmodern skepticism). Dialogues implicitly with Barthian emphases on God's primacy and with proponents of historical theology and biblical theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (normativity and hermeneutics), Doctrine of God, Christology (as center for doctrinal coherence), Pneumatology, Anthropology (Imago Dei), Covenant/readings of salvation history, Ecclesiology and Worship, Theological method.
- **Closing line**
 - Theology is a disciplined, God-centered fabric: coherent, historically rooted, biblically governed, and ordered to the church's doxology and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The enduring metaphor of "fabric" conveys integration: threads (loci) retain distinctiveness but are interwoven into a whole; method is ecclesial and formative, not merely academic abstraction.
 - Strong insistence that theology be ordered toward worship and the church's life (theological knowledge is not neutral).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters reductive biblical literalism that divorces doctrine from theological ordering, pietistic privatism that severs doctrine from liturgy and polity, and modernist/systematic arrogance that displaces Scripture's normativity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The "fabric" metaphor used as a methodological corrective: prioritizes relationality among doctrines and between doctrine and ecclesial practice.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in many evangelical and Reformed seminary contexts as a clear, accessible introduction to theological method. Influential in conversations about evangelical identity and the recovery of theological coherence in pastoral training.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a practical prolegomenon useful for integrating biblical studies, historical theology, and systematic theology; durable resource for teaching theological method and for rethinking anthropology (imago Dei) in a Christ-centered way.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fabric** - central metaphor: theology as interwoven loci forming a coherent whole.
- **Prolegomenon** - foundational methodological reflection that governs subsequent doctrinal work.
- **Normativity of Scripture** - Scripture as the regulative norm for theological ordering and ecclesial life.
- **Theological method** - integrated practice combining exegesis, historical consciousness, doctrinal synthesis, and pastoral ends.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - treated as relational and covenantal; grounded in creation and fulfilled in Christ (Christ as the true image).
 - Emphasizes vocation and ecclesial/personal relationship to God over merely functional or substantive accounts.
- **Christocentric fulfillment** - Christ as the nexus that orders anthropology, eschatology, and the church's identity.
- **Doxology** - theology's telos; knowledge oriented to worship and praise, not mere information.
- **Historical consciousness** - importance of the church's interpretive tradition and continuity with confessional heritage.
- **Anti-reductionism** - refusal to reduce theology to ethics, experience, or social theory.
- **Ecclesial formation** - theology's role in shaping worship, preaching, and Christian practices.
- **Integration** - sustained emphasis on maintaining distinctiveness of loci while ensuring mutual coherence.
- **Evangelical identity** - theology as a guardrail for distinctive evangelical commitments: Gospel-centered, Scripture-rooted, and church-shaped.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological definition source**: used to introduce and justify an integrated approach to doctrinal work.
 - As a **polemic**: employed against privatizing or reductionist tendencies in contemporary evangelical theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for anthropology (Imago Dei) and Christ-centered ordering in systematic and pastoral theology.
