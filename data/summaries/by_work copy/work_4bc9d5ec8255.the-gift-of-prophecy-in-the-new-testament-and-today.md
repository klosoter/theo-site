### TITLE
**The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today** (Wayne Grudem)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical milieu; first ed. during the Third Wave (Vineyard) rise; revised later for pastoral use.
 - A Reformed-leaning, scholarly defense of continuationism against classical cessationism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - NT congregational prophecy continues and is distinct from Scripture-level revelation; it is genuinely from the Spirit yet fallible in human expression, therefore must be tested and weighed.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Exegetical foundation**: 1 Cor 12-14 (definition, purpose, regulation), 1 Thess 5:19-22 (test, hold fast), Eph 2:20 (foundational apostles/prophets distinguished from ongoing congregational prophets), Acts 21 (Agabus as partial inaccuracy without compromising the gift).
 - **Historical-theological engagement**: challenges Warfield-style cessationism; aligns with cautious evangelical scholarship (e.g., Carson on 1 Cor 12-14).
 - **Doctrinal synthesis**: preserves sola Scriptura by differentiating canonical revelation from non-canonical impressions; Spirit baptism as conversion-initiation with subsequent fillings.
 - **Pastoral praxis**: criteria for discerning prophecy, elder oversight, edification as telos, prioritizing intelligibility and order in gathered worship.
 - **Responses to objections**: tackles the authority problem, canon-closure, sufficiency of Scripture, and the meaning of "the perfect" in 1 Cor 13 (eschatological completion, not first-century).
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Interacts with cessationists (Warfield, Gaffin, O. P. Robertson), sympathetic exegetes (Carson, Fee), and Pentecostal/charismatic claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and authority**, **canon and sufficiency**, **pneumatology** (gifts, baptism, filling), **ecclesiology** (order, oversight, roles), **sanctification** (edification, encouragement), **mission** (evangelistic guidance).
- **Center of gravity**
 - A Word-governed, church-tested charismatic practice: pursue prophecy earnestly for edification while maintaining Scripture's final authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The definitional move: NT prophecy as a Spirit-prompted human report that can include error in delivery while originating in true revelation.
 - Clear difference between apostolic/Scripture-level revelation and congregational prophecy.
 - Strong pastoral guardrails: testing, weighing, submission to elders, and primacy of intelligibility and love.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against cessationism: gifts continue; 1 Cor 13's "perfect" is the eschaton; Eph 2:20 does not end all prophecy, only the foundational, canonical kind.
 - Against some Pentecostal claims: rejects "second-blessing" Spirit baptism; insists prophecy is not inerrant or automatically directive.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Foundational vs ongoing prophecy**; **fallible prophecy** without undermining divine origin; **impressions** language to capture the mode of reception.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became the standard Reformed-charismatic account; widely cited in evangelical discussions and seminary curricula.
 - Critiqued by cessationists for allegedly lowering prophetic authority and by some charismatics for restraining practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an exegetically careful, pastorally realistic framework that safeguards sola Scriptura while welcoming gifts for sanctification and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prophecy (NT congregational)**: a Spirit-prompted report in human words aiming at edification, encouragement, consolation (1 Cor 14:3).
- **Fallible delivery**: prophetic content is truly from God; articulation and application may include error; thus, weigh and test.
- **Weighing/testing**: congregational and elder discernment (1 Thess 5:19-22; 1 Cor 14:29) to sift what is good.
- **Apostolic authority vs congregational prophecy**:
 - Apostles/prophets of Eph 2:20 are foundational and tied to canonical authority.
 - Congregational prophets are non-foundational and non-canonical.
- **Revelation vs illumination**:
 - Revelation: Spirit-originated disclosure for edification, yet non-canonical.
 - Illumination: Spirit's help to understand Scripture; distinct from prophecy.
- **Spirit baptism**: initiation into Christ at conversion; not a post-conversion second blessing; subsequent fillings/empowerments are expected.
- **Edification (oikodome)**: the controlling criterion for public use; prophecy prioritized over uninterpreted tongues for church upbuilding.
- **The perfect (1 Cor 13:10)**: eschatological consummation, not the completion of the canon or apostolic age.
- **Foundational vs ongoing gifts**: once-for-all foundation (apostles/prophets) vs continuing manifestation gifts (prophecy, tongues, healing) under Scripture.
- **Order in worship**: intelligibility, two or three speak, others weigh; submission to eldership and love as governing ethic.
- **Women prophesying**: affirmed in gathered settings under the broader framework of ordered leadership.
- **Pentecostal claims**: welcomed for zeal and practice of gifts; corrected on authority of prophecy and Spirit baptism doctrine.
- **Abuse safeguards**: humility, accountability, specificity without presumption, willingness to retract or revise impressions.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Continuationism vs Cessationism**: primary exegetical brief for ongoing gifts with canonical safeguards.
 - **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**: resource arguing conversion-initiation plus subsequent fillings, not a second-blessing schema.
 - **Spiritual Gifts and Sanctification**: model for regulated, edifying practice in congregational discipleship.
 - **Pentecostalism and Reformed Response**: mediating framework affirming gifts while preserving Reformed doctrine of Scripture and order.
