### TITLE
**Memoir and Remains of Robert Murray M'Cheyne (1844)** - Andrew A. Bonar. Biography, selections of sermons, letters and diary material presenting the life, piety and doctrine of the young Scottish evangelical minister; published by Bonar shortly after M'Cheyne's death and widely read in 19th‑century Reformed evangelical circles.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1844 in Scotland amid the Evangelical Revival and the lead‑up to the 1843 Disruption; M'Cheyne (1813-1843) belonged to the Scottish Reformed evangelical tradition (Ayrshire/New Reformed church life).
 - Work functions as both biography and posthumous collected writings serving revivalist, pastoral and devotional uses.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Bonar aims to present M'Cheyne as a model pastor whose preaching and pastoral care embodied orthodox Reformed Christology: the believer's justification and sanctification rest upon Christ's obedience and atoning sufferings.
 - Implicit polemic against nominal Christianity: authentic faith is union with Christ manifest in dependence on both Christ's active obedience and passive suffering.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Part I: Biographical narrative emphasizing inner life, conversions, pastoral labors and spiritual disciplines (prayer, preaching, pastoral visitation).
 - Part II: Selected sermons, meditations and letters that display M'Cheyne's doctrinal emphases - justification, sanctification, the work of Christ, assurance, prayer.
 - Major theological moves:
 - Repeated appeal to the finished work of Christ as ground of believer's acceptance.
 - Pastoral application of Christ's obedience (both active and passive) to consolation and motivation for holiness.
 - Emphasis on experiential assurance arising from union with Christ rather than from moral achievement.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicitly draws from Reformed forebears (Calvin, the Scottish divines) and contemporaries in the Evangelical party.
 - Bonar frames M'Cheyne against wider religious indifference and more liberal/Arminian strains by stressing substitutionary atonement and imputed righteousness.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central): Christ's person and mediatorial work; emphasis on both active and passive obedience.
 - **Soteriology**: justification by faith, imputation, substitutionary atonement, union with Christ, sanctification as fruit.
 - **Pastoral theology**: prayer, pastoral duty, evangelism and pastoral holiness.
 - Secondary attention to covenantal language, assurance, and ecclesial fidelity.

- **Closing line**
 - The book presents M'Cheyne as an incarnated witness to the Reformed conviction that the believer's standing and growth flow from union with Christ - the full obedience (active and passive) of the Mediator is both the ground of justification and the spring of holy living.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong pastoral integration of doctrinal orthodoxy and devotional immediacy: doctrines like imputation and active/passive obedience are repeatedly applied to prayer, pastoral courage and personal assurance.
 - M'Cheyne portrayed as a model of holiness formed by continual dependence on Christ's work rather than moralism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Implicit corrective to moral‑influence or purely ethical readings of Christ: Bonar (through M'Cheyne) insists on penal substitution and imputed righteousness as necessary foundations.
 - Moves against complacent nominalism: the obedience of Christ is offered as objective ground and practical motive.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No novel technical theology; rather, a devotional‑pastoral phrasing of traditional Reformed terms - making doctrines like "active obedience" accessible and existentially urgent for parish ministry.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in 19th‑century evangelical and Reformed circles; influenced pastoral formation, missionary zeal and devotional life across Britain and North America.
 - Helped popularize the pastoral ideal of experiential Calvinism and the centrality of Christ's whole obedience in preaching.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a pastoral and devotional theological model: exemplary for preaching Christ's obedience, training pastors, and teaching how doctrine informs spiritual formation.
 - Useful as historical evidence for mid‑19th century Scottish evangelical theology and practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience** - Christ's perfect law‑keeping; presented as the positive righteousness imputed to believers so they stand accepted before God.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's sufferings and death; presented as penal, substitutionary atonement securing forgiveness.
- **Imputation** - The transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers; central to Bonar's exposition of justification.
- **Substitutionary atonement** - Penal substitution emphasized as the necessary content of Christ's passive obedience.
- **Justification by faith** - Forensic declaration grounded in Christ's obedience (both active and passive), not in believer's merit.
- **Union with Christ** - The existential and covenantal bond through which imputation, sanctification and assurance operate.
- **Sanctification** - Fruit and evidence of union with Christ; moral growth flows from reliance on Christ's finished work.
- **Assurance** - Pastorally treated as an outcome of faith resting on Christ's obedience rather than introspective moral grounds.
- **Pastoral piety** - Holiness formed through spiritual disciplines, modeled by M'Cheyne as dependent on Christ's work.
- **Covenant language** - Background framework: Christ fulfills covenant obligations (active obedience) and bears covenant penalty (passive obedience).
- **Preaching Christ** - Expository and experiential preaching that centers the whole obedient life of Christ for both comfort and challenge.
- **Devotional application** - Practical hermeneutic linking doctrine to prayer, evangelism and pastoral care.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for pastoral appropriation of classical Reformed categories (active/passive obedience) in devotional contexts.
 - As a **polemic** against moralistic or non‑substitutionary accounts of atonement within popular piety.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching that moves from forensic truths about Christ to immediate pastoral application.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in studies of 19th‑century evangelical formation, showing how doctrine and devotion were integrated in pastoral ministry.
