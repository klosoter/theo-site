### TITLE
**Christian and Reformed Today** (1984) - John Bolt

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 1984 amid renewed North American interest in neo-Calvinism and the legacy of Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck.
 - Situated in Reformed circles wrestling with cultural engagement, secularization, and the doctrinal boundaries of grace (notably the Common Grace debates inherited from Dutch Reformed disputes).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformed church must recover and apply a robust doctrine of **common grace** (including a careful account of **preparatory grace**) so that Christian faith effectively informs cultural, social, and intellectual life without compromising the particularity of saving grace.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical retrieval: revisits Kuyperian and post-Kuyperian formulations to recover resources for contemporary application.
 - Theological clarification: distinguishes types and functions of grace (saving vs non-saving; common vs special) and defends the normative place of common/preparatory grace for public life.
 - Practical implication: shows how this theological framework grounds Christian cultural engagement, education, and social responsibility while maintaining gospel distinctiveness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck (recovery of neo-Calvinist heritage).
 - Secondary interlocutors: various strands of pietism and antithesis theology in Reformed history; contemporary critics who either downplay common grace or conflate it with salvific effects.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Common grace** and **preparatory grace** (central).
 - Covenant theology and its implications for culture.
 - Creation-order and cultural mandate themes (implications for vocation, education, the arts, and public life).
 - Antithesis between kingdom and world as mediated by nuance rather than absolutized separation.
- **Closing line**
 - Bolt argues that a rightly ordered Reformed theology of common and preparatory grace both preserves the uniqueness of saving grace and equips Christians to transform culture faithfully.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stress on the *functional* role of preparatory grace: it is non-saving yet genuinely preparatory for gospel reception and social good.
 - Integration of doctrinal precision with concrete cultural application - not merely historical theology but practical ecclesial strategy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters pietistic tendencies that retreat from cultural engagement by arguing that withdrawal neglects God-given common grace responsibilities.
 - Rejects any dilution that collapses common grace into universal salvific efficacy; maintains strict distinction between common and special (saving) grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear taxonomy distinguishing *common*, *preparatory*, and *special* grace for use in ecclesial and public theology.
 - Emphasizes "preparatory" as a technical term to avoid confusion over secular goods and God's prevenient action short of salvation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well regarded in neo-Calvinist and Reformed academic circles as a concise corrective and application of Kuyperian resources.
 - Used pedagogically in Reformed seminaries and by pastors seeking a theological rationale for cultural engagement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact bridge between historical neo-Calvinist theory and late 20th-century pastoral-administrative concerns; durable as an entry point for students on common/preparatory grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace**
 - God's benevolent restraint and provision for the whole world that sustains creation and makes cultural goods possible without effecting salvation.
- **Preparatory grace**
 - A subset/function of common grace: non-saving divine work that disposes persons or societies toward receptivity to the gospel.
 - Emphasized to prevent conflation with prevenient or saving grace.
- **Special (saving) grace**
 - Grace that effects regeneration, faith, and justification; ontologically and functionally distinct from common/preparatory grace.
- **Cultural mandate**
 - The creational call to steward and cultivate creation; Bolt uses it to justify Christian cultural engagement grounded in common grace.
- **Antithesis**
 - The doctrine of opposition between kingdom and world; Bolt reframes it so antithesis does not preclude faithful presence in culture.
- **Creation-order theology**
 - Appeal to created structures and norms as normative for public life and vocation; undergirds Bolt's cultural arguments.
- **Sphere sovereignty**
 - Kuyperian notion of distinct social spheres; invoked to structure Christian responsibility without ecclesiastical or state totalization.
- **Covenantal framework**
 - Covenant theology supplies Bolt's metaphysical and pastoral contours for how grace structures communal life.
- **Pietism (critique)**
 - Bolt critiques pietistic withdrawal that underestimates common grace's cultural mandate.
- **Secularization (diagnosis)**
 - Seen as both challenge and occasion for application of common/preparatory grace to witness in public square.
- **Taxonomy of graces**
 - Bolt's working classification (common/preparatory/special) used to prevent theological slippage.
- **Public theology**
 - Bolt's practical locus: theology aimed at shaping education, arts, law, and civic engagement under Reformed convictions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the disciplined distinction between common and preparatory grace.
- As a **polemic** against pietistic withdrawal and against any theology that collapses common into saving grace.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula on neo-Calvinism, public theology, and Reformed cultural engagement.
