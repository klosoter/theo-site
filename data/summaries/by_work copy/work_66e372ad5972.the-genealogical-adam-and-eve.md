### TITLE
The Genealogical Adam and Eve - S. Joshua Swamidass

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2019 within contemporary evangelical conversations about origins. Author is both a scientist (PhD, computational biology) and Christian lay theologian; work enters debates between Young-Earth Creationism (YEC), Old-Earth Creationism, and Theistic Evolution/Evolutionary Creation.
 - Moves at the intersection of population genetics, ancestry modeling, and biblical theology; aims to provide a scientifically informed theological alternative that affirms a historical Adam while accepting deep time and common descent.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: Adam and Eve can be both historical persons and the genealogical ancestors of all humans within a recent timeframe (a "genealogical Adam and Eve"), without requiring them to be the sole biological progenitors of the entire human population or to violate genetic evidence for large ancestral populations.
 - Doctrinal problem addressed: How to retain a historically situated Adam (relevant for original sin, representation, and biblical reading) while accepting genetic science that rejects a strict two-person bottleneck.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scientific foundation: population genetic models, pedigree mathematics, and the phenomenon of pedigree collapse show that a single couple can be the genealogical ancestor of all extant humans in a relatively short number of generations.
 - Theological import: genealogical ancestry suffices for theological claims about representation, federal headship, imago Dei transmission, and the factuality of the Fall.
 - Interpretive move: distinguish between "genetic firsts" (a most recent common genetic ancestor) and "genealogical firsts" (ancestors in family trees who are common ancestors of all people).
 - Reconciliation strategy: reject strict genetic monogenesis as necessary for theological monogenesis while preserving biblical historicity of key persons/events.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages scientific literature on coalescence, MRCA (most recent common ancestor), and population structure; interlocutors include YEC proponents (who insist on genetic bottleneck), evolutionary creationists, and biblical scholars debating historicity of Adam.
 - Interacts with theological categories drawn from Augustine, Reformed understandings of federal headship, and contemporary evangelical scholars.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Original sin** (representation, imputation, universality)
 - **Imago Dei** (ontological vs representational models)
 - **Christology/Soteriology** implications (need for a historical Adam for the analogy of Christ as Second Adam)
 - **Revelation and exegesis** (Genesis 1-3 historicity and genre)
 - Secondary attention to covenantal and ecclesial implications of human origins.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically conservative in aim but scientifically literate in method: the genealogical Adam reframes "first human" so that biblical commitments to a historical, representative Adam can stand alongside mainstream genetics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Moves from "genetic Adam" to "genealogical Adam" as the key category for theological claim-making.
 - Emphasizes networked ancestry and rapid genealogical commonality as normative outcomes of human demography.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges YEC insistence that a strict two-person genetic bottleneck is required for theological orthodoxy.
 - Offers a corrective to some theistic evolutionists who claim historicity of Adam is irreconcilable with genetic science; instead shows a conceptual middle path.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the explicit distinction: genetic MRCA vs genealogical MRCA vs identitarian/familial ancestor.
 - Reframes "first parents" language to accommodate overlapping genealogical and biological ancestries.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked significant discussion in evangelical academic and pastoral contexts; used by some conservative scholars to defend a historical Adam without rejecting evolutionary science.
 - Criticized by YEC proponents as insufficient for certain readings of Genesis and by some theologians who argue genealogical ancestry inadequately secures universality of original sin.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for interdisciplinary dialogue; valuable in classrooms and church contexts seeking to hold scripture and science together without capitulating to either extreme.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Genealogical Adam and Eve**
 - Adam/Eve as recent common genealogical ancestors of all humans, not necessarily sole genetic progenitors.

- **Genetic Adam / Mitochondrial Eve**
 - Scientific terms referring to most recent common genetic ancestors in specific loci; contrasted with genealogical ancestor.

- **Pedigree collapse**
 - The mathematical convergence of ancestors in a finite population that accelerates common ancestry.

- **Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) - genealogical vs genetic**
 - Distinguishes lineage coalescence at genes (genetic MRCA) from person-to-person ancestry networks (genealogical MRCA).

- **Population bottleneck**
 - Genetic reduction in effective population size; Swamidass argues theology does not require a strict two-person bottleneck.

- **Representation / Federal headship**
 - Theological mechanisms by which Adam's actions are imputed to descendants; genealogical account preserves these categories.

- **Imago Dei (transmission models)**
 - Debates over literal ontological transmission vs selection/representation; genealogical model supports relational/representational readings.

- **Common descent**
 - Acceptance of biological common ancestry as compatible with a genealogical Adam.

- **Concordism vs non-concordism**
 - Methodological posture toward fitting Genesis to scientific accounts; Swamidass advocates a non-concordist redefinition of key categories.

- **Historical Adam hypothesis**
 - The position that Adam was a specific historical individual(s) significant for theology; Swamidass reframes how this can be true.

- **Deep time**
 - Geological/biological timescales accepted and integrated with genealogical account.

- **Theological universalism (of sin)**
 - Concern whether genealogical ancestry secures full universality of sin; treated but debated in reception.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "genealogical Adam" in theological-technical literature.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis in communities that affirm historical Adam yet accept evolutionary science.
- As a **polemic tool** against YEC genetic claims and also against simplistic dismissals of Adam in some evolutionary accounts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in doctrinal conversations about original sin, representation, and the imago Dei in light of genetics.
