### TITLE
**Dispensationalism (1995) - Charles C. Ryrie**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelicalism (1995), aimed at a broad evangelical audience and seminary students. Ryrie writes from a conservative, classical/moderate dispensationalist milieu shaped by Darby, Chafer, and mid-20th-century Fundamentalism/Evangelicalism.
 - Context includes renewed debate with covenant theology and the rising proposal of Progressive Covenantalism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible must be read by a consistent literal-grammatical-historical hermeneutic that yields a clear distinction between dispensations (stewardships) and between Israel and the Church; biblical promises to Israel are future and earthly, not fully fulfilled in the church.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and criteria: a dispensation is a period in which God administers His will to humans by stewarded responsibilities; each dispensation is bound by a governing revelation and test of obedience.
 - Hermeneutic: insistence on the literal, grammatical-historical method; rejection of spiritualizing prophetic and covenantal promises.
 - Covenant relations: covenants (e.g., Abrahamic, Davidic, Mosaic, New Covenant) have distinct, often literal future fulfillments-especially for national Israel.
 - Eschatology: futurist reading of prophecy, premillennial expectation of Christ's earthly kingdom, and support for a pretribulational rapture (Ryrie favors rapture distinctions tied to dispensational chronology).
 - Practical/systematic outworkings: soteriology, ecclesiology, and ethics follow from dispensational distinctions (different programmatic responsibilities for Israel and the Church).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Darby, Chafer, and classic dispensational literature; engages in polemic with covenant theologians and with newer voices like Progressive Covenantalists who emphasize covenant continuity.
 - Uses Old and New Testament exegesis (esp. Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Revelation) to defend futurist-literal readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics, covenant(s), law vs. grace, Christology (especially kingship and second advent), eschatology (tribulation, millennium, final judgment), ecclesiology (nature/role of the church), soteriology (assurance and distinctions in administration).

- **Closing line**
 - Ryrie's work centers on a literal hermeneutic that preserves a dual program for Israel and the Church and culminates in a future, earthly millennial kingdom for national Israel under Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear operational definition of a "dispensation" as stewardship; insistence that dispensational distinctions have real theological and pastoral consequences.
 - Strong defense of a literal-futurist reading of prophecy and covenants.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against covenant theology and Progressive Covenantalism: rejects spiritualized fulfillment of Israel's promises in the church; disputes covenantal continuity that collapses national Israel into the church.
 - Compared to earlier dispensationalists, Ryrie is often seen as more systematizing and pedagogically focused rather than speculative.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularization and systematization of dispensational terminology for seminary use (e.g., clear mapping of dispensations, programatic outworkings).
 - Emphasis on the hermeneutical principle as the primary theological pivot.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative evangelical and dispensational circles; used widely in seminary curricula and popular-level defenses.
 - Criticized by covenant theologians and proponents of Progressive Covenantalism as failing to account for canonical and theological unity in Scripture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, teachable presentation of classical dispensational hermeneutics and eschatology; valuable as a representative statement for debate and for understanding late 20th-century evangelical eschatological commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dispensation** - a divinely ordered stewardship period in which God tests human responsibility; central organizational category.
- **Literal (grammatical-historical) hermeneutic** - the interpretive rule Ryrie insists on to avoid spiritualizing prophecy or covenantal promises.
- **Israel/Church distinction** - doctrinal line that treats national Israel and the Church as distinct peoples with different promises and roles.
- **Covenants (Abrahamic, Davidic, Mosaic, New Covenant)** - viewed as specific, sometimes future, literal promises, especially the Abrahamic/Davidic promises to Israel.
- **Premillennialism** - expectation of Christ's bodily return to inaugurate a literal thousand-year reign on earth.
- **Pretribulational rapture** - Ryrie's favored rapture-timing in dispensational chronology separating the church from Israel's future tribulation.
- **Futurism (prophetic fulfillment)** - belief that many Old Testament prophecies await future, literal fulfillment, not present spiritual realization.
- **Progressive revelation** - God's self-disclosure unfolds historically across dispensations; does not erase earlier promises.
- **Law vs. grace distinction** - legal obligations vary by dispensation; the Mosaic law functions within its own stewardship.
- **Typology vs. literal fulfillment** - typological readings are secondary to literal future fulfillments; types point to but do not exhaust promises.
- **Kingdom of God (earthly program)** - a literal political-physical kingdom to be established for Israel under Christ.
- **Hermeneutical axiom** - the interpretive rule is the decisive theological determinant.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical dispensational terms and categories in systematic theology and hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic** against covenant theology and Progressive Covenantalism, especially on Israel-church continuity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for prophetic books (Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation) applying literal-futurist readings.
 - As a **pedagogical tool** for teaching late-20th-century evangelical eschatology and ecclesial identity.
