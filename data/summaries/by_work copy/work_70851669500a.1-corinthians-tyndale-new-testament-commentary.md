### TITLE
**1 Corinthians: Tyndale New Testament Commentary** - Wayne Grudem

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Evangelical exegesis in the Tyndale series, shaped by late-20th-century dialogue between Reformed theology and the global charismatic renewal. Pastoral-ecclesial focus with attention to Greco-Roman social setting and Second Temple Jewish background.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul re-centers a gifted yet factional church on the cross, love, and resurrection, insisting that all spiritual gifts and congregational practices serve intelligible edification under apostolic authority.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - 1:1-4:21 Divisions and the theology of the cross versus Corinthian triumphalism.
 - 5:1-6:20 Discipline, holiness, and the body as temple of the Spirit.
 - 7:1-40 Marriage, singleness, vocation, and eschatological realism.
 - 8:1-11:1 Idol food, conscience, and imitating Christ in freedom constrained by love.
 - 11:2-34 Gender, head coverings, and Eucharistic abuses; headship and discerning the body.
 - 12:1-14:40 Charismata, unity-in-diversity, the primacy of love, prophecy and tongues regulated for corporate upbuilding.
 - 15:1-58 Bodily resurrection as non-negotiable gospel core; Christ the firstfruits.
 - 16:1-24 Collection for the saints, travel plans, and final exhortations in love.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Pauline rhetorical strategy; Greco-Roman banquet culture; synagogue practices; dialogue with evangelical and Pentecostal-exegetical streams (e.g., Morris, Carson, Fee, Thiselton) on gifts, resurrection, and worship order.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and authority (Scripture vs congregational prophecy), pneumatology and gifts, ecclesiology and worship, sacraments, sanctification and church discipline, Christian liberty, gender and order, resurrection and eschatology, Christology centered in cross and Easter.
- **Closing line:** The Spirit empowers many gifts, but the crucified-and-risen Christ governs their use through love for the intelligible edification of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Continuationist reading** of 1 Cor 12-14: prophecy and tongues persist; love governs their exercise.
 - **NT congregational prophecy** as non-canonical, mixed with human fallibility; must be weighed.
 - **Edification principle** as a hermeneutical key for corporate worship: intelligible speech over private display.
 - **Already-not-yet eschatology** as antidote to Corinthian over-realization.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Pushes back on **strict cessationism** by distinguishing canon-level revelation from ordinary congregational prophecy.
 - Corrects **unregulated Pentecostalism** by insisting on testing, order, and intelligibility in assemblies.
 - Clarifies difference between **prophecy and teaching**; affirms complementarian constraints on authoritative teaching while recognizing women prophesy in the assembly.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Two-tier authority: **inerrant Scripture** vs **fallible prophetic impressions** delivered in human words.
 - Systematizes **weighing of prophecy** as institutional practice; separates gift-identities from church offices.
 - Sharp distinction between **gift of tongues** and **interpretation**, with corporate use dependent on interpretation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical-Reformed contexts engaging charismatic practice; aligns with scholarly streams represented by Carson and Fee while offering clearer definitions on prophecy.
 - Serves as a bridge in dialogues on worship order, gifts, and sacramental discipline.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A concise, pastorally tuned guide to 1 Corinthians that integrates rigorous exegesis with practical norms for worship, discipline, and unity amid diversity of gifts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prophecy (NT congregational):** Human report of something God brings to mind; non-canonical; must be tested.
 - Contrasts with **OT/inscripturated revelation** which carries intrinsic, inerrant authority.
- **Weighing prophecy:** Corporate discernment by leaders and congregation to test content and application.
- **Tongues:** Spirit-given speech; uninterpreted tongues for private prayer, interpreted tongues for corporate edification.
- **Interpretation of tongues:** Spirit-enabled rendering that makes tongues intelligible to the body.
- **Word of knowledge/word of wisdom:** Particular insight for edification; not equivalent to teaching office.
- **Cessationism vs continuationism:** Competing accounts of whether gifts like tongues and prophecy continue post-apostles; this work argues continuation with regulation.
- **Edification (oikodome):** Governing criterion for all speech-acts in worship; intelligibility prioritized.
- **Love (agape):** The more excellent way; moral shape of all gift-use, preventing rivalry and display.
- **Order and peace:** Liturgical regulation so that all may learn and be encouraged; God is not of confusion.
- **Over-realized eschatology:** Corinthian error claiming present triumph that sidelines cross-shaped weakness.
- **Conscience of the weak/strong:** Liberty constrained by love to avoid idolatry and stumbling.
- **Headship and head coverings:** Symbolic order in worship that honors creational differentiation.
- **Lord's Supper discipline:** Self-examination, discerning the body, and communal justice at the table.
- **Body of Christ:** Unity-in-diversity metaphor grounding mutual dependence of gifts.
- **Firstfruits and resurrection body:** Christ as pledge; continuity-discontinuity of the raised body.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Definition source in debates on gifts and revelation; see topic: Continuationism vs Cessationism.
 - Bridge and cautionary guide in evaluating charismatic practice; see topic: Pentecostalism And Reformed Response.
 - Exegetical model for worship order and sacramental practice in 1 Cor 11-14.
 - Conceptual pivot for distinguishing Scripture-level authority from congregational revelation.
