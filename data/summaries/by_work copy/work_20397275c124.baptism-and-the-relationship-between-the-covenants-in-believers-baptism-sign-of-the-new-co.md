### TITLE
Baptism and the Relationship Between the Covenants (chapter in Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ) - Stephen Wellum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed debate over baptism (early 21st cent.); volume aimed to defend credobaptism in a broadly covenantal frame.
 - Interaction across traditions: Baptist, Reformed/paedobaptist, dispensational, and progressive covenantal voices.
- **Central thesis**
 - Baptism is the sign (and seal in a qualified sense) of the New Covenant instituted in Christ and, properly understood, points to a covenant community defined by **regenerate profession**; therefore baptism should ordinarily be administered to professing believers rather than to infants.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of New Testament texts (especially covenantal texts in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Luke-Acts, Pauline letters, and Hebrews) that locate the New Covenant in Christ and associate its marks with inward renewal by the Spirit.
 - Theological move: distinguishes covenantal continuity (one covenantal plan from Adam to consummation) from practical discontinuity (the eschatological realization of the New Covenant is inaugurated but not yet consummated).
 - Sacramental-historical comparison: analyzes the relation of circumcision to baptism - continuity of sign-function but discontinuity of sign-substance (external ethnic marker vs. sign tied to Spirit-wrought regeneration and profession).
 - Polemic and constructive proposals: argues against paedobaptist inferences from continuity and against dispensational compartmentalization that severs covenantal identity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Paedobaptist Reformed tradition (representative arguments about circumcision-baptism continuity).
 - Dispensationalists and Progressive Covenantalists (contrasting how each treats covenant continuity and ecclesial identity).
 - Meredith G. Kline and Klinean covenant theology (intrusion of covenant structure into cultic/ethical life) - dialogue over sacramental function and covenant administration.
 - Biblical covenants literature (Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36; NT covenantal fulfillment texts).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (old/new covenant relations), sacramentology (sign, seal, efficacy), ecclesiology (covenant community, membership), soteriology (regeneration as mark of covenant), Christology (Christ as mediator of the New Covenant), revelation (progressive/inaugurated eschatology).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Baptism is best understood as the New Covenant sign that publicly marks membership in Christ's inaugurated covenant community and thus coheres with a credobaptist reading of Scripture while preserving covenantal continuity without collapsing the distinctives of the New Covenant.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Emphasizes **inaugurated eschatology**: New Covenant is present in Christ but its full saving realities (universal regeneration of covenant people) await consummation - this shapes the proper recipients of the sign.
 - Reframes continuity: affirms theological continuity between covenants but insists on **functional discontinuity** regarding sign-actors (who properly receives the covenant sign).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against paedobaptists: challenges the inferential leap from circumcision-as-sign to universal infant baptism, arguing the New Covenant sign is tied to Spirit-wrought promises and public profession.
 - Against rigid dispensational partitioning: resists a view that makes Israel and the church wholly distinct covenantal entities with unrelated sacramental practice.
 - Dialogues with Kline: accepts covenant-as-legal-suzerainty framework but resists read-throughs that make sacramental administration determinative of covenant regeneration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear distinction between "sign-function" (what the rite communicates) and "sign-substance" (what the rite presupposes in the recipient).
 - Use of "inaugurated-continuity" language to navigate between absolute continuity and wholesale discontinuity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative evangelical and Baptist scholars seeking a robust covenantal defense of credobaptism.
 - Used as a bridge text for Reformed Baptists and some progressive covenantalists who accept an inaugurated New Covenant model but reject infant baptism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a tightly argued, exegetically driven template for reconciling covenant theology with believer's baptism - useful for classroom debate, pastoral formation, and ongoing ecumenical discussions on sacrament and covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Covenant** - Covenant inaugurated by Christ; promise of internal renewal and forgiveness (Jer. 31/Ezek. 36; fulfilled in Christ).
- **Old Covenant** - Mosaic administration within redemptive-historical continuity; distinct in ceremonial and national functions.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The New Covenant realities are present now (inaugurated) but not yet consummated.
- **Sign vs. Seal** - Baptism as the sign of the New Covenant; "seal" language is used cautiously and qualified by inward reality (Spirit) and profession.
- **Circumcision-Baptism relation** - Continuity in sign-function (both mark covenant membership) but discontinuity in sign-substance and recipient qualification.
- **Credobaptism** - Baptism administered to professing believers; defended as consistent with New Covenant promises and marks.
- **Paedobaptism** - Infant baptism; critically examined and challenged where it presumes a direct transfer of circumcision logic to the New Covenant.
- **Covenant continuity / discontinuity** - Continuity in God's one redemptive plan; discontinuity in the outward administration and timing of covenant fullness.
- **Suzerainty covenant framework (Klinean influence)** - Viewing covenant as divine sovereign command/administration; engaged selectively, especially over sacramental function.
- **Intrusion ethics** - (Klinean topic) idea that covenant structure intrudes into cultic and ethical life; Wellum dialogues with this about the normative function of signs without letting them substitute for inward covenant reality.
- **Covenant community / ecclesiology** - The church as the covenant people marked by baptism, rightly administered to regenerate/professing members.
- **Regeneration and profession** - Regeneration by the Spirit is the New Covenant mark; public profession ordinarily precedes baptism.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - For Wellum, efficacy is tied to Christ and Spirit, not to mere ritual or external administration.
- **Inaugurated-continuity** - Term signaling agreement that the covenants are one plan but the New Covenant introduces decisive changes in sign administration.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: concise account of New Covenant baptismal logic for systematic theology (sacramentology and covenant).
 - Polemic: source-text in contemporary debates opposing paedobaptism within a covenantal framework.
 - Exegetical model: template for reading Jeremiah/Ezekiel and NT covenant texts together to derive ecclesial practice.
