### TITLE
**Culture Making: Recovering Our Creative Calling (2008)** - Andy Crouch

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published amid early 21st-century evangelical debates about culture, politics, and art (post-9/11, rise of culture-war framing).
 - Addresses pastors, artists, businesspeople, and lay Christians navigating vocation in pluralistic societies.
 - Resonant with Kuyperian concerns about Christian engagement across spheres, but aimed at a broad evangelical readership.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christians are called not chiefly to withdraw from or merely critique culture, nor to seize power; rather they are called to *make culture* - exercising creative, limited dominion as image-bearers to cultivate, create, repair and steward the ordered goods of creation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern options for Christians toward culture are typically threefold - withdrawal/flight, consumption/complicity, or takeover/political triumphalism - each inadequate.
 - Theological baseline: creation is good; humans as imago Dei are given a mandate to steward (Genesis 1-2) that is creative and limited.
 - Moral and practical prescription: cultivate creative disciplines (craftsmanship, art, institutions, business, technology) that produce durable cultural artifacts and practices.
 - Practical theology: offers paradigms and examples for how Christians in varied vocations can exercise *vocationary stewardship* - through making, shaping limits, and attending to neighbor and place.
 - Concluding imperative: adopt an ethic and practice of culture-making that honors God, others, and creation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on biblical texts (Genesis, themes of vocation), classical Christian resources (Trinitarian Creator-creature distinction), and modern cultural critics.
 - Engages historically Kuyperian themes (sphere sovereignty, common grace) and converses implicitly with both pietistic retreatist and politicized evangelical models.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (goodness of the created order, calling to stewardship)
 - **Imago Dei** (ground for human creativity and authority)
 - **Vocation** (calling of every believer in specific cultural roles)
 - **Providence and limits of human authority** (creative authority is derivative and bounded)
 - Secondary engagement with ecclesiology and public theology insofar as they shape cultural work.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically: faithful Christian life is a vocation of creative stewardship - making and mending culture under God's sovereign rule by exercising limited, responsible dominion as image-bearers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Puts *creative making* (arts, craft, institutions, work) at the center of Christian public theology rather than primarily politics or critique.
 - Frames dominion as *tilling and keeping* (careful cultivation), not domination or mere utility.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects both pietistic withdrawal (denying cultural responsibility) and triumphalist politics (seeking coercive cultural control).
 - Challenges models that treat culture as mere arena for battle; instead insists on formation through artifacts, practices, and institutions.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized "culture-making" as a normative theological category - a verb-centric emphasis on ongoing creative practice.
 - Emphasizes *limits* as a central moral-theological category: responsible authority requires setting and honoring limits.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical circles - shaped conversations in Christian arts, business ethics, and vocational discipleship.
 - Taken up by Reformed and Kuyperian-minded pastors and thinkers for its practical translation of dominion theology; criticized by some for underplaying systemic political analysis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a tractable, theologically-grounded vocabulary for training Christians in everyday vocation and cultural engagement.
 - Useful pedagogically for integrating doctrine (creation, imago Dei, vocation) with concrete practices of making and stewardship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Culture-making**
 - Active practice of producing, shaping, and stewarding artifacts and practices that order human life.
- **Vocation**
 - All-encompassing call of believers to specific creative roles (artist, farmer, engineer, parent) as service to God and neighbor.
- **Dominion (limited dominion)**
 - Authority given to humans in Genesis understood as stewardship; power is derivative, bounded, and responsible.
- **Creation mandate / Culture mandate**
 - Biblical command to subdue and steward creation; read as commissioning to cultivate culture, not exploit it.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Ground for human creativity and relational responsibility; explains why culture-making is theological work.
- **Stewardship**
 - Careful management and cultivation of created goods; opposes both neglect and domination.
- **Limits**
 - Ethical principle: all creative authority is constrained-by neighbor, creation, and divine sovereignty.
- **Artifacts**
 - Durable products of culture-making (works of art, institutions, technologies) that shape community life.
- **Craftsmanship**
 - Attentive, disciplined making; moral and aesthetic formation that trains character and community.
- **Neighbor-oriented creativity**
 - Culture-making aimed toward flourishing of others, not merely self-expression or market success.
- **Small-c culture**
 - Everyday practices and institutions (schools, businesses, families) where culture is actually made.
- **Institutional formation**
 - Building and sustaining mediating structures that shape habits and practices across generations.
- **Creative authority**
 - The God-given capacity to initiate and shape new forms, always derivative and accountable.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary evangelical accounts of vocation and the culture mandate.
 - As a **polemic** against withdrawalist pietism and triumphalist politics, promoting a middling, creative engagement.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching integrated Christian life, especially in arts, business, and public theology curricula.
