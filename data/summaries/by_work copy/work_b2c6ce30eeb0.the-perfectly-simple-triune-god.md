### TITLE
The Perfectly Simple Triune God - D. Stephen Long

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary constructive theology engaging late 20th-early 21st century debates. Situated at the intersection of classical theism, systematic/trinitarian theology, and responses to social trinitarianism and analytic critiques of divine simplicity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Can the traditional doctrine of **Divine Simplicity** be reconciled with a robust **Trinitarian personalism**? Long argues that God can be both perfectly simple and truly tri-personal without reducing persons to modal distinctions or rendering relations ontologically parasitic.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarifies the metaphysical commitments of **classical theism** (simplicity, aseity, immutability) and the doctrinal commitments of orthodox Trinitarianism (one ousia, three hypostases).
 - Critiques common failures on both flanks:
 - Classical theism that enforces simplicity at the cost of denying genuine personal distinctions.
 - Social trinitarianism that treats persons as ontological constituents or as a "committee" of divine centers.
 - Proposes an account of **divine relations** that preserves simplicity by treating relations as **eternal relational distinctions** intrinsic to the single divine life rather than as added parts or contingent ties.
 - Emphasizes the incarnational and doxological implications: God's simplicity is not abstract metaphysics but shapes how God is known in revelation and how divine love is understood.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages Augustine and Aquinas as representatives of classical/traditional trajectories; interacts with contemporary proponents of social trinitarianism and critics of divine simplicity (broadly speaking analytic and continental interlocutors). Uses patristic and scholastic categories (ousia/hypostasis, relations of origin) critically.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (central), Divine Simplicity, attributes of God (immutability, aseity), relations within God, revelation and the economy of salvation, Christology and incarnation as test cases for the balance of unity and distinction.
- **Closing line:** Long centers the book on the claim that orthodox Trinitarian faith requires preserving both the perfect simplicity of God and the reality of real persons in the Godhead by rethinking relations as non-compositive, eternal features of the one divine life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reframes divine relations so they do not increase divine complexity; relations are intrinsic modes of divine existence rather than additional beings or properties.
 - Stresses theological (revealed) priority: metaphysical accounts must be responsive to biblical and creedal articulations of God rather than vice versa.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects classical theists who risk explaining away personal distinctions by over-interpreting simplicity as elimination of relational difference.
 - Challenges variants of social trinitarianism that make the persons metaphysically prior or compositional, thereby compromising aseity and unity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Moves the debate from a composition/non-composition binary to a nuanced account of **relational distinction without ontological addition**, emphasizing eternal relations of origin and mutual indwelling.
 - Uses a refined notion of personhood that resists both modalism and atomistic sociality.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in circles seeking reconciliation between classical theism and contemporary trinitarianism; cited by theologians wrestling with simplicity in constructive or pastoral contexts.
 - Provoked dialogue among both analytic theologians (on metaphysical coherence) and systematic theologians (on doctrinal fidelity).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides an accessible yet philosophically serious template for teaching how to hold unity and threeness together.
 - Serves as a corrective to over-simplified polemics on either side; useful in seminars on classical theism, trinitarian doctrine, and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity (DS):** The doctrine that God is not composed of parts; God's attributes are identical to divine essence. Long defends a version that allows for real internal distinctions without ontological composition.
- **Trinity / Tri-personality:** One God in three hypostases; emphasis on maintaining genuine personal distinctions within unity.
- **Ousia / Hypostasis:** Classical categories for substance and personhood; used to map how oneness and threeness relate without reduction.
- **Relations of Origin:** Eternal relations (Father begetting Son, Spirit proceeding) understood as intrinsic distinctions that do not add parts.
- **Perichoresis:** Mutual indwelling used to illustrate how persons relate without compromising unity; a relational, not compositional, unity.
- **Social Trinitarianism:** The view that emphasizes personhood and interpersonal relations; Long critiques its tendency toward compositional ontology.
- **Classical Theism:** Tradition emphasizing God's aseity, immutability, simplicity; Long seeks a version compatible with Trinitarian personalism.
- **Analogical Predication:** How human language relates to talk of God; supports that predicates point to real divine attributes while avoiding literal composition.
- **Modalism (and Anti-modalism):** Modalist denial of real personal distinctions; Long defends anti-modalist realism about persons.
- **Metaphysical Grounding:** Concerns about what grounds the distinctions among persons; Long posits intrinsic relationality rather than external grounds.
- **Economic / Immanent Trinity distinction:** Used to test coherence: revelation (economy) must correspond to immanent reality without collapsing one into the other.
- **Aseity / Immutability:** God's self-existence and constancy reasserted as non-negotiable constraints in any trinitarian account.
- **Personhood (divine):** Defined to avoid both reduction to properties and atomistic individualism; persons as relationally constituted within one divine life.
- **Kenotic considerations (implicit):** Incarnation as the locus where unity and distinction are shown, shaping the account of simplicity and relationality.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a mediating account of divine simplicity compatible with Trinitarianism.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both modalist reductions and social-trinitarian compositionalism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses/seminars reconciling classical metaphysics with doctrinal orthodoxy.
