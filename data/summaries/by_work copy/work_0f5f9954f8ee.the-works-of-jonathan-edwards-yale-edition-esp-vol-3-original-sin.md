### TITLE
**Jonathan Edwards, Original Sin (Yale Works, vol. 3)** 
Posthumous treatise first published 1758; Yale critical edition ed. Clyde A. Holbrook (1970).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late colonial New England, post-Great Awakening; apologetic polemic against Enlightenment moralism and Pelagianizing trends.
 - Principal opponent: John Taylor of Norwich, whose denial of inherited guilt/defilement prompted Edwards's extended reply.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Humanity is one moral body under a divine constitution; Adam acted as a public head so that his first sin is justly imputed to his posterity, who thereby inherit both guilt and a depraved disposition, necessitating redemption in the second Adam, Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture: Exegesis of Romans 5:12-21; 1 Cor. 15; Ps. 51; Eph. 2 to ground imputation and universal corruption.
 - Empirical universality: All societies, ages, and infants exhibit mortality and sin-propensity beyond mere imitation; thus a native depravity exists.
 - Metaphysical-constitutional account: The race is one by God's wise constitution; Adam is a public person whose act is legally and really ours; guilt and corruption stand in ordered relation (guilt by imputation; corruption by consequent loss of original righteousness).
 - Justice and freedom: Distinguishes moral vs natural inability; defends accountability for a depraved will without making God the author of sin.
 - Replies to objections: Pelagian/Arminian claims, alleged injustice of imputation, and the charge that divine sovereignty entails determinism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine and Reformed orthodox tradition (federal headship), interacts with Locke-era discussions of identity and agency, and refutes John Taylor, Daniel Whitby, and Socinianizing trends.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Hamartiology and anthropology; covenant of works and federal theology; union with Christ (second Adam); soteriology (need for regeneration); providence and theodicy; Scripture's authority in doctrinal loci.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center: God's wise, just constitution of the human race in Adam and of the redeemed in Christ orders condemnation and grace in parallel, magnifying Christ's superabounding righteousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Divine constitution** grounds both legal solidarity and real moral consequences; not sheer nominalism.
 - **Moral vs natural inability** clarifies culpability: inability rooted in disposition does not excuse.
 - **Disposition/propensity** language: sin as a fixed, active bent of the heart, not merely scattered acts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Taylor: denies that sin arises only from imitation or environment; insists on inherited guilt and corruption.
 - Nuances the imputation debate: resists bare immediate-imputation caricature while rejecting mediate-only accounts that deny guilt antecedent to acts.
 - Recasts libertarian freedom claims: shows they are unnecessary for moral responsibility and incoherent with Scripture.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Public person as a moral-ontological reality, not a legal fiction.
 - Use of identity and constitution to explicate corporate agency without collapsing persons.
 - Systematic appeal to Scripture plus empirical universals as convergent evidence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Seedbed for New England Theology (Hopkins, Emmons) and debated at Old Princeton (Hodge) and in transatlantic Reformed forums.
 - Critiqued by Wesleyans and later liberal Protestants; appropriated by contemporary analytic theology on agency and responsibility.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of integrating exegesis, moral psychology, and metaphysics.
 - Pedagogically clarifies guilt, corruption, and freedom in relation to federal representation and Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin**: Inherited guilt and corruption from Adam; necessity of grace.
- **Imputation**: Forensic reckoning of Adam's first sin to his posterity; parallel to Christ's righteousness.
- **Federal headship / public person**: Adam as covenant representative whose act is constitutive for the race.
- **Divine constitution**: God's wise appointment making humanity one moral body in Adam (and in Christ).
- **Moral vs natural inability**: Dispositional incapacity to love God vs lack of faculties; the former is culpable.
- **Depraved disposition / propensity**: Innate bent of the will away from God, preceding and producing sinful acts.
- **Loss of original righteousness**: Withdrawal of the Spirit's rectitude; corruption follows guilt.
- **Universality of sin**: Empirical and scriptural evidence that all persons sin and die.
- **Second Adam**: Christ as new head whose obedience and life overflow to many.
- **Justice of God in imputation**: Representation is fitting and beneficent within God's wise governance.
- **Permission of sin**: God ordains the order within which sin occurs without causing its evil.
- **Immediate vs mediate imputation**: Edwards binds legal imputation to union, with corruption as consequent effect.
- **Consent of the heart**: True moral agency lies in the will's dispositions and choices, not abstract indifference.
- **Covenant of works**: Adam's probationary role; converse benefits illumine federal structure.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a definition-and-argument source for guilt reckoning in Adam [Original Sin And Imputation].
 - As a doctrinal account of inherited corruption and its causal order [Nature And Origin Of Sin].
 - As a federal-theology touchstone for the counterfactual benefits of Adam's perseverance [What If Adam Had Not Sinned].
 - As a conceptual bridge to Edwards's account of responsibility and inability [Sin And Free Will].
