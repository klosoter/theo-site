### TITLE
Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond - contribution by Craig A. Blaising (progressive dispensational perspective)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate over millennial options; part of a multi-view volume presenting competing eschatological frameworks.
 - Blaising writes from the context of the emerging **progressive dispensationalism** movement (reacting to both classical dispensationalism and Reformed covenant theology), engaging renewed interest in inaugurated eschatology and covenantal continuity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The millennium must be understood as a **progressively realized messianic reign**: certain OT promises are already inaugurated in Christ and the church, but a future consummation (including a millennial manifestation of kingdom promises) remains.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Hermeneutical foundation: advocates a grammatical-historical reading within a canonical, redemptive-historical frame that allows typological fulfillment and progressive realization of promises.
 - Biblical-theological case: traces key kingdom and covenant promises through OT expectations, intertestamental developments, and NT fulfillment, arguing for both continuity (promise-fulfillment trajectory) and legitimate future fulfillment (eschatological consummation).
 - Ecclesial and Israel relation: defends continuity of God's people while maintaining **distinctions** between covenants that justify a future concrete manifestation of certain promises to Israel within the eschaton.
 - Eschatological morphology: reframes millennial questions in terms of **already/not-yet** inaugurated eschatology rather than strict literalism/spiritualization poles.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical dispensationalists (on separation of Israel and church), covenant theologians (on full spiritual fulfillment), and scholars emphasizing inaugurated eschatology; uses canonical and historical-critical resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (promise/fulfillment schema), kingdom and eschatology, biblical hermeneutics, Christology (messianic reign), ecclesiology (relation of church and Israel), and soteriology insofar as it intersects inaugurated kingdom.
- **Closing line**
 - The piece is a constructive middle path: affirming a future, concrete millennial consummation while emphasizing progressive covenantal fulfillment and canonical-historical interpretation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Stresses **progressive fulfillment** as a methodological principle: promises can be partially realized now and fully realized later without resorting to spiritualizing or rigid literalism.
 - Moves dispensationalism toward a canonical, redemptive-historical hermeneutic while retaining certain covenantal distinctions.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects classical dispensationalism's strict discontinuity (sharp Israel/church segregation) by arguing for continuity in promise and peoplehood.
 - Pushes back on covenant theology's tendency to spiritualize all national/land promises by insisting on some future, corporeal fulfillment.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes use of terms like **"progressive dispensationalism"**, "inaugurated eschatology" in a framework that keeps future national dimensions intact.
 - Uses a **canonical fulfillment** vocabulary that links typology, promise, and future consummation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among evangelicals seeking a mediating eschatology; influential in shaping later discussions that bridge dispensational and covenantal camps.
 - Served as a reference point for both advocates and critics of progressive dispensationalism; used in seminaries that teach multiple eschatological options.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a hermeneutic-sensitive, theologically conservative alternative to polar positions; valuable for teachers who want a balanced exegesis-informed case for a tempered premillennialism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Progressive fulfillment** - promises are realized in stages (type -> antitype -> consummation).
- **Inaugurated eschatology / already-not-yet** - kingdom has begun in Christ but awaits final consummation.
- **Progressive dispensationalism** - Blaising's framework: retains dispensational distinctions but softens sharp discontinuities with canonical and covenantal nuance.
- **Canonical, redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - reading individual texts within the unfolding covenantal story of Scripture.
- **Kingdom (messianic reign)** - both present (spiritual/mediatorial) and future (manifest, possibly national/earthly) aspects affirmed.
- **Covenant distinction without severance** - covenants remain distinct in administration and promises, yet form a continuous promise-history.
- **Israel/Church relation** - continuity in identity and promise, distinction in role and eschatological vocation.
- **Typology** - OT persons/events as preparatory fulfillments pointing to fuller NT/eschatological realities.
- **Consummation / millennium** - seen as a future, concrete phase in the fulfillment of messianic promises, not mere allegory.
- **Hermeneutical middle ground** - rejects both strict literalism that ignores canonical shape and radical spiritualization.
- **Eschatological consummation** - final restoration including new heavens and new earth as terminus of progressive fulfillment.
- **Promise/fulfillment schema** - organizing grid for tracing covenants and kingdom promises through Scripture.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for progressive dispensationalism and tempered premillennial positions in eschatology syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against both classical dispensational and classical covenantal extremes.
 - As an **exegetical model** for handling kingdom texts (e.g., Daniel, Isaiah, Matthew 24-25, Revelation) within a canonical-fulfillment framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in comparative studies that map continuity and distinction between Israel and the church.
