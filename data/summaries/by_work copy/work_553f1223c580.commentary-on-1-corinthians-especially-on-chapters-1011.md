### TITLE
**Peter Martyr Vermigli - Commentary on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 10-11)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation; Vermigli (1499-1562) an Italian Protestant exile teaching in Strasbourg, Zurich, Oxford; commentary produced within Reformed humanist and scholastic milieu, responding to Roman Catholic and Radical Reformation readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Exegesis of 1 Corinthians 10-11 to resolve how Christian eating (meat offered to idols) and participation in the Lord's Supper relate to conscience, community purity, Christ's presence, and sacramental efficacy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close philological-patristic reading of Paul, structured around two pastoral crises:
 - Chapter 10: food offered to idols - Paul's logic that "an idol is nothing" must be moderated by neighbor-love; conscience and scandal govern moral action.
 - Chapter 11: Lord's Supper - Paul's correction of corrupt practice leads to doctrine and discipline: distinction between physical eating and spiritual participation; admonition to self-examination and communal order; sanctions for profaning the table.
 - Major moves:
 - Rejects both naive indifference and legalistic prohibition - applies Pauline principle of love ordering liberty.
 - Argues for a **real, spiritual** participation in Christ at the Supper mediated by Word and Spirit, not by local corporeal presence.
 - Grounds the need to fence the table in covenantal ecclesiology and pastoral protection of weaker consciences.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Chrysostom, Erasmus; converses with contemporaries Bucer and Calvin (affinity with Calvin on spiritual presence), and argues against Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Zwinglian memorialism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology (means of grace), Christology (how Christ is present), ecclesiology (discipline, communion), conscience and Christian liberty, Pauline ethics and covenantal membership.
- **Closing line**
 - Vermigli centers the text on a covenantal, pastoral Eucharistic theology: the Supper effectually unites believers to Christ by the Spirit through the Word and signs, governed by love and disciplined admission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong deployment of scholastic causal language (instrumental cause) to explain sacramental efficacy while preserving the spiritual (non-corporeal) character of Christ's presence.
 - Pastoral-political attention to "fencing the table" - sacramental admission conditioned by covenantal purity and charity toward weaker consciences.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Distinguishes himself from:
 - Roman Catholic transubstantiation: rejects corporal change and Aristotelian substance-language as explanatory of Christ's presence.
 - Zwinglian memorialism: refuses to reduce the Supper to mere remembrance; insists on objective spiritual participation.
 - Often aligns with Calvin but uses different terminologies and a more pronounced theory of sacraments as instrumental causes.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Integrates humanist philology and patristic exegesis with scholastic causal categories (e.g., "sacrament as instrument") to give a precise account of means-of-grace functioning.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among English and continental Reformed theologians; read by Cranmer-era English reformers and later Reformed scholastics as a bridge between Reformation exegesis and systematic sacramentology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical model linking Pauline ethics, ecclesial discipline, and sacramental theology; valuable for teaching on sacramental presence and pastoral fencing.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament as "instrumental cause"**
 - Vermigli: sacraments are instruments by which the Holy Spirit effects what they signify.
- **Spiritual (real) presence**
 - Christ is truly participated in by faith and Spirit, not corporeally localized in the elements.
- **Physical vs. spiritual eating**
 - Distinction underpinning Eucharistic participation: bodily reception of bread/wine vs. spiritual nourishment by Christ.
- **Conscience (weak/strong)**
 - Moral theology from 1 Cor 8: exercise of liberty must be governed by concern for weaker brothers.
- **Scandal / offense (skandalon)**
 - Pastoral principle limiting liberty when it causes another to sin.
- **Fencing the table**
 - Ecclesiastical discipline and admission criteria to protect the sacrament's sanctity and community order.
- **Examination of conscience**
 - Obligation to self-examine before partaking (1 Cor 11), basis for exclusion of the irreproachable impenitent.
- **Communion of the body and blood (participatio corporis Christi)**
 - Communal and mystical union effected by the Supper.
- **Covenant community**
 - The Supper functions within covenantal membership; admission expresses covenant standing.
- **Idolatry and offered food**
 - Theologically interprets Paul's treatment of food offered to idols as a test case for liberty-ordered-by-love.
- **Word + sign + Spirit triad**
 - How sacraments operate: promise (Word), visible sign (elements), and Spirit's internalising work.
- **Profaning the sacrament**
 - Category used to justify exclusion and sanction for disorderly participation.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed sacramentology (sacraments as means of grace).
 - As a polemic and exegetical model on Eucharistic presence, fencing, and admission (bridging pastoral practice and doctrine).
