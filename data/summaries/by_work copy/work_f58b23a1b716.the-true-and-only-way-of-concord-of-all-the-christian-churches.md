### TITLE
The True and Only Way of Concord of All the Christian Churches - Richard Baxter

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1679 in post-Restoration England. Baxter writes as a prominent Puritan/Nonconformist pastor amid Anglican-Presbyterian-Independent tensions and state attempts to enforce uniformity (Clarendon Code era). Part of Baxter's wider irenic project after the Civil War and Restoration.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians should be reunited on a minimal set of essentials so that the visible Church can be one "holy, catholic, and apostolic" body; divisions largely arise from insisting on adiaphora (non-essentials) as tests of communion.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose fragmentation: civil, ecclesiastical, and pastoral harms from rigid confessionalism and party spirit.
 - Define the true "way of concord": specify essentials (Scripture, Apostles Creed, fundamental gospel truths, public profession, right administration of sacraments and church discipline) and distinguish them from ecclesiastical forms (ceremonies, polity, non-essentials).
 - Propose practical terms for comprehension and mutual recognition: offer criteria for admitting ministers and members without requiring uniformity on secondary matters.
 - Argue for charity and forbearance coupled with fidelity - unity without doctrinal indifference.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages Anglican authorities (bishops, Book of Common Prayer defenders), Presbyterians and Independents, Roman Catholics, and sectaries; appeals to Scripture, patristic witnesses, and Reformation divines (implicit critique of both rigid Presbyterian and strict Anglican positions).
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (visible vs. invisible church, marks of the church), sacramentology (administration and reception), ministry and ordination, creeds and doctrinal subscription, charity and Christian ethics, authority of Scripture.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Baxter frames true ecclesial catholicity as practical, charity-grounded unity on gospel essentials - a visible Church defined by Scriptural faith, faithful ministry, right sacraments, and mutual forbearance rather than uniform ritual or polity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - An irenic, pastoral ecclesiology that privileges **practical concord** over institutional uniformity.
 - A clear **essentials/non-essentials** taxonomy proposed as the basis for visible unity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects both high-church Anglican insistence on episcopal orders as a test of communion and radical separatist insistence on strict purity; opposes Catholic claims of exclusive visible continuity.
 - Challenges confessional absolutism by arguing many controversies are circumstantial and not church-constituting.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized a pragmatic "terms of communion" approach later influential in comprehension and latitudinarian discussions.
 - Emphasizes **charity as ecclesial principle** - an operational criterion for communion and discipline.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Met resistance from both Anglicans (who would not accept Baxter's concessions) and some Dissenters (who regarded him too accommodating).
 - Long-term influence on Protestant irenicism, later latitudinarianism, and strands of evangelical ecumenism; cited in studies of Reformation ecclesiology and the development of marks-based ecclesial definitions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A compact model for analyzing the **one holy catholic apostolic church** in Reformation terms.
 - Useful case-study for tensions between doctrinal purity and pastoral unity; models an historically grounded attempt at ecumenical theology within a confessional era.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Essentials vs. Non-essentials:** Baxter's primary methodological distinction; essentials include Scripture, core gospel doctrines, sacraments, and church discipline.
- **Visible Church:** Defined by outward marks and practices - public profession, ministry, sacraments - distinguished from the invisible church of elects.
- **Marks of the Church:** Preaching of the Word, right administration of sacraments, and church discipline; used as criteria for recognizing true churches.
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church:** Baxter affirms a single visible catholicity achievable through concord on essentials rather than uniform polity.
- **Comprehension:** Proposal to admit varied forms of worship and governance within one communion if essentials are affirmed.
- **Terms of Communion:** Practical conditions Baxter prescribes for mutual recognition and ministerial admission.
- **Charity (forbearance):** Ethical and theological principle that moderates doctrinal enforcement and enables unity.
- **Ordination and Orders:** Treats episcopacy as desirable but not an absolute test of ministerial validity; emphasizes ministerial function over form.
- **Sacraments:** Right administration and reception as a mark of the church; discipline for irregularity but not grounds for separation over minor differences.
- **Creeds and Subscription:** Accepts Apostles' Creed and key confessions as tests of essentials while resisting expansive subscription to non-essentials.
- **Polemic against sectarianism:** Targets both Romanizing tendencies and separatist puritan rigor.
- **Practical Ecclesiology:** Theology is pastoral and remedial - aimed at reconciling divided bodies.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Ultimate standard for defining essentials and resolving disputes.
- **Public Profession:** Requirement for visible membership and participation in sacraments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the Reformation-era understanding of the "marks of the church" and visible catholicity.
- As a **polemic** against confessional and liturgical exclusivism in both Anglican and separatist directions.
- As a **model for pastoral/ecumenical ecclesiology** in discussions of how to achieve unity without doctrinal compromise.
