### TITLE
Christian Dogmatics: Reformed Theology for the Church Catholic - Michael Allen & Scott R. Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary early-21st-century contribution within a **Reformed renewal** that seeks retrieval of classical orthodoxy and ecumenical catholicity. Oriented to Reformed seminaries, episcopal and congregational contexts, and ongoing conversations with Roman Catholic and broader Protestant theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Reformed theology is properly understood and practiced as a **Trinitarian, covenantal, and ecclesial dogmatics** that serves the universal (church catholic) life of worship, sacraments, and mission rather than an isolated intellectual system or private pietism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: dogmatics organized around **God (Trinity) first**, then creation, covenant, Christ and redemption, Spirit and sacrament, church and eschatology - theology shaped by Scripture, tradition (Reformed confessions), and pastoral worship life.
 - Major moves:
 - Reasserts **theocentric** and **Trinitarian** priority for doctrinal ordering.
 - Recovers covenant as metaphysical and soteriological framework (not merely legal or forensic).
 - Reclaims sacramental realism: sacraments as means of grace rooted in Christ and the work of the Spirit.
 - Connects doctrinal precision with liturgical and ecclesial practice (worship-producing theology).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with **Calvin and the Reformed confessions**, Westminster tradition; dialogues with contemporary Reformed constructive theology and ecumenical traditions (Roman Catholic and classical Protestant theologians). Interlocution with modern currents: pietism, evangelical individualism, theological liberalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, **Trinity**, theology proper, creation and providence, **covenant theology**, anthropology and sin, **Christology**, atonement, **justification**, sanctification (union with Christ), **sacramentology** (baptism and Lord's Supper), ecclesiology, eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - A systematic, confessional Reformed dogmatics that re-centers theology on the triune God and the church catholic, integrating doctrine, worship, and pastoral ministry.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Church catholicity**: Reformed theology presented as inherently ecclesial and catholic, not sectarian or purely confessionalist.
 - **Trinitarian ordering**: Doctrine is consistently read through the economy of the Trinity; God's acts and being structure dogmatic priorities.
 - **Covenant ontology**: Covenant is not a merely juridical instrument but the shaping reality of creation, redemption, and ecclesial life.
 - **Sacramental realism**: Emphasis on the objective, covenantal efficacy of baptism and the Lord's Supper as means of union with Christ.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against **individualistic pietism** and privatized soteriology by emphasizing corporate, covenantal participation.
 - Corrects tendencies in some Reformed circles that downplay sacramental and liturgical forms; resists reduction of the gospel to solo fide legal categories.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts classical Reformed categories in explicitly **ecumenical language** (e.g., "church catholic" as normative horizon).
 - Gives renewed weight to terms like **covenant of redemption**, **union with Christ**, and **sacramental mediation** within a Reformed framework.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in many Reformed seminaries and read widely as a textbook for constructive Reformed theology; seen as bridging confessional Reformed identity and wider catholic orthodoxy.
 - Received praise for clarity and pastoral orientation; critiqued by some strict confessionalists for ecumenical tones and by some evangelicals for perceived sacramental emphasis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for teaching systematic theology in Reformed settings; useful for ecclesial formation, preaching, and ecumenical dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Church Catholic**
 - The universal, visible church as the primary context and telos of dogmatics; Reformed theology served to nourish this catholicity.

- **Trinitarian dogmatics**
 - Ordering principle: God's triune life shapes all doctrine and practice.

- **Covenant (covenant theology)**
 - Structural principle for creation, fall, redemption, and ecclesiology; includes covenant of works and covenant of grace dynamics.

- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Intra-Trinitarian covenantal agreement for Christ's mediatorial work; grounds soteriology.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological category linking justification, sanctification, and sacraments.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration grounded in union with Christ, defended within Reformed confessional parameters while tied to ecclesial life.

- **Sacramental realism**
 - Baptism and Eucharist as real means by which the Spirit communicates Christ and grace within the covenant community.

- **Providence**
 - God's governance seen in covenantal terms, integrating creation care, human responsibility, and divine sovereignty.

- **Ecclesiology**
 - Church as covenant community, sacramental assembly, and corporate bearer of mission and worship.

- **Confessionalism**
 - Use of historic Reformed standards as authoritative interpretive lenses without reducing theology to mere citation.

- **Theocentrism**
 - God-centeredness as corrective to anthropocentric theology.

- **Scripture & Revelation**
 - Scripture as normative Word, both propositional and liturgical, read in community and tradition.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed formulations of doctrine (esp. covenant and sacrament).
 - As a **polemic resource** against theological individualism, liberal reductionism, and sacramental skepticism.
 - As an **exegetical and pedagogical model** for structuring courses around Trinitarian-covenantal priorities and integrating worship with dogmatics.
