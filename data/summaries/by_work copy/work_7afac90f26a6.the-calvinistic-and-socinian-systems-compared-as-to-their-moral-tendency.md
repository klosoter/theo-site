### TITLE
The Calvinistic and Socinian Systems Compared as to Their Moral Tendency - Andrew Fuller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 18th‑century English Particular Baptist / evangelical milieu; response to rising Unitarian/Socinian rationalism and to misconceptions about orthodox Calvinism.
 - Part of broader evangelical debates about missions, moral life, and the practical consequences of doctrine.

- **Central thesis**
 - Doctrinal systems should be judged by their practical moral effects; **Fuller argues that the Calvinistic system (properly understood) produces more genuine holiness, gratitude, and Christian benevolence than the Socinian system**, which he contends weakens motives to true obedience.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Comparative method: set out core tenants of each system and survey their likely moral outcomes.
 - Key moves:
 - Define each system's anthropology and soteriology (depravity, atonement, justification, perseverance).
 - Show how motives for obedience differ: gratitude and filial love under Calvinism versus moral duty grounded in human reason or moral example under Socinianism.
 - Trace effects on public and private morality, religious zeal (especially missions), and pastoral life.
 - Address common objections (e.g., that Calvinism breeds licentiousness or fatalism).
 - Conclude that Calvinistic doctrines, rightly held, foster active obedience and charity; Socinianism tends to legalism or moral complacency.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Polemic against Socinian/Unitarian tendencies (Faustus Socinus as origin; contemporary English Unitarians generically).
 - Implicit engagement with critics who charge Calvinism with producing moral indifference; interlocutors include rationalist moralists and hyper‑Calvinists.
 - Method draws on Scripture, pastoral observation, and appeals to experience.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (esp. **Covenant of Grace**), justification (imputed righteousness), sanctification (good works as fruit), human depravity, atonement, free will/agency, moral accountability.
 - Particular focus on **Good Works and Merit in the Covenant of Grace**: distinction between works as non‑meritorious evidence and works as rewarded within covenant promises.

- **Closing line**
 - Fuller's theological center: doctrine is not merely speculative; the truthfulness of a system is evidenced in its power to produce humble, grateful, active Christian morality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The practical, moral‑consequence test: theology evaluated by real ethical and ecclesial outcomes rather than only by syllogistic coherence.
 - Strong insistence that **Calvinism fosters missionary zeal and holiness**, countering both rationalist and licentious caricatures.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Socinian reliance on human reason and moral example as insufficient grounds for gospel obedience.
 - Also corrects hyper‑Calvinist tendencies by affirming responsibility and vigorous evangelism; Fuller is neither fatalistic nor quietist.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Elevates the phrase **"moral tendency"** as a standard for doctrinal appraisal.
 - Clarifies the covenantal language of **merit vs. reward**: good works are neither the ground of acceptance nor arbitrary, but the fruits that move the covenant promises.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among evangelical and Particular Baptist circles; influential in debates over missions and in countering Unitarian arguments in Britain.
 - Used by later evangelicals as a model for marrying robust doctrine with pastoral concern.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a template for ethical theology that connects doctrine to practice; useful in teaching on sanctification, covenant, and the motives of Christian obedience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Calvinistic system**
 - Emphasis on total depravity, sovereign grace, imputed righteousness; argued to promote humility and gratitude leading to moral fruit.

- **Socinian system**
 - Emphasis on moral example and reason, denial of substitutionary atonement and imputed righteousness; Fuller argues it weakens gospel motives.

- **Moral tendency**
 - The practical ethical consequences a doctrine is likely to produce in believers and society; Fuller's primary evaluative criterion.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Framework for salvation and the place of works: covenantal promise secures salvation; works are fruits not grounds.

- **Good works**
 - Described as the necessary **fruit** of regeneration and evidence of faith, not meritorious causes of justification.

- **Merit**
 - Distinction between **merit** (deserved claim on God) and **reward** (covenantal blessing he grants); Fuller rejects merit of works for justification.

- **Justification / Imputed righteousness**
 - Central to Fuller's defense: acceptance before God is by imputed righteousness, preserving right gospel motives.

- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive moral renewal flowing from grace; the locus where doctrines show their moral tendency.

- **Human depravity**
 - Shared acknowledgement that human will is corrupted and needs supernatural grace; shapes the motive analysis.

- **Gratitude / Filial love**
 - Core Christian motives for obedience in Fuller's account; contrasted with mere moral obligation in Socinianism.

- **Missionary zeal**
 - Fuller connects orthodox Calvinism with energetic evangelism and benevolence.

- **Moral influence test**
 - Using observable moral outcomes to test theological claims.

- **Free agency / responsibility**
 - Fuller upholds human responsibility within divine sovereignty; counters fatalism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against Unitarianism/Socinianism and secular moralism.
- As a **defense** of orthodox Calvinism that is both doctrinally robust and morally enlivening - frequently cited in discussions of covenant theology, sanctification, and the motive structure of Christian obedience.
