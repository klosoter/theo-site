### TITLE
**Friedrich Schleiermacher, The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube), 1821-1822; 2nd ed. 1830-1831**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting - publication context**
 - Post-Enlightenment Berlin, early Prussian Union; Romanticism and post-Kantian philosophy in view.
 - Aimed to reconstruct Protestant dogmatics after rationalism and confessional polemics.
- **Central thesis - doctrinal problem**
 - Dogmatics is a systematic account of the churchs piety, namely the Christian **self-consciousness** grounded in the **feeling of absolute dependence** on God as mediated by Jesus Christ.
- **Core argument - structure**
 - Introduction: nature of dogmatics - descriptive of the Christian consciousness of redemption, not speculative metaphysics or juridical system.
 - Doctrine of God: God as the Whence of our being; divine attributes derived correlatively from religious self-consciousness.
 - Creation - preservation - providence: one divine causality undergirds all finite causality; miracles relative to our knowledge of nature.
 - Sin: a universal state of God-oblivion and disruption of God-consciousness; original sin treated in social-communal terms.
 - Christology: the Redeemer as the one with **constant and perfect God-consciousness**, communicating it to the community; classical two-natures reinterpreted functionally.
 - Redemption - justification - sanctification: one redemptive event; reconciliation as transformation of the self-consciousness in union with Christ.
 - Spirit - Church: the community is the sphere where Christs redeeming influence is communicated; election is corporate in Christ.
 - Scripture - revelation: revelation is primarily the history of redemption culminating in Christ; Scripture is the normative witness of the churchs piety.
 - Sacraments: ecclesial acts expressing and nurturing the redeemed consciousness - Baptism initiatory, Supper sustaining communion.
 - Eschatology: the Kingdom as moral-communal telos; symbolic reserve regarding apocalyptic specifics; hopeful scope of redemption.
 - Trinity: placed at the end as a **church doctrine** summarizing the Christian God-relation rather than a speculative ontology.
- **Figures - sources - interlocutors**
 - Kant, Fichte, Schelling; Pietism; Reformed and Lutheran orthodox dogmatics; Spinoza in the background; responding to deism, rationalism, and confessional scholasticism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; God and attributes; creation-providence; sin; person and work of Christ; Spirit and church; election; sacraments; last things; Trinity.
- **Center of gravity**
 - The churchs lived participation in Christs God-consciousness under the feeling of absolute dependence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Dogma as descriptive of ecclesial piety; theology is correlative to religious experience.
 - **Feeling of absolute dependence** as the irreducible datum of piety.
 - Christ as uniquely perfect in God-consciousness, the mediator whose life generates the redeemed community.
- **Corrections - contrasts**
 - Against Protestant orthodoxy: rejects scholastic substance-metaphysics, forensic imputation, and decretal predestinarianism.
 - Against rationalism and Kantian moralism: affirms irreducible religiosity beyond ethics and speculative reason.
 - Recasts covenantal-legal frames into communal-personal participation; minimizes proof-text dogmatics.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - God-consciousness; immediate self-consciousness; corporate election; unity of justification and sanctification; Trinity as churchly rule of discourse.
 - Attributes via correlates of piety (e.g., omnipotence as correlate of absolute dependence).
- **Reception - influence**
 - Foundational for liberal Protestantism; formative for Ritschlian and culture-protestant trajectories; appropriated by Herrmann, Harnack, Tillich.
 - Strong critiques from confessional Lutheran and Reformed theologians (Hodge, Bavinck, Warfield); decisive opposition yet engagement by Barth and neo-orthodoxy.
 - Enduring impact on hermeneutics, practical theology, and the method of correlating doctrine to lived faith.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the ecclesial location and experiential grounding of dogmatics; rich Christological-ecclesial focus.
 - Serves as major foil prompting precision on Scripture, Trinity, atonement, and eschatology in contemporary teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence**: pre-conceptual piety; the foundational datum of all doctrine.
- **God-consciousness**: awareness of God as the Whence of our being; perfect in Christ, communicated to believers.
- **Immediate self-consciousness**: locus where piety is registered prior to reflection or ethics.
- **Redeemer - community of the redeemed**: Christs unique causality forming the church as the medium of salvation.
- **Corporate election**: the church elected in Christ; individuals participate by incorporation, not by decretal selection.
- **Unity of justification and sanctification**: one redemptive process; rejects strict forensic-moral sequencing.
- **Reconciliation**: transformation of the God-relation in consciousness and life rather than legal satisfaction.
- **Divine causality - providence**: one pervasive causality of God coordinating finite causes; miracles are relative phenomena.
- **Sin - sinfulness**: state of disrupted God-consciousness preceding acts; socially mediated universality.
- **Scripture as normative witness**: canon as the churchs classic expression of piety; inspiration as Spirit-shaped witness, not verbal inerrancy.
- **Sacraments as ecclesial acts**: Baptism and Supper signify and nurture communal participation in Christ.
- **Kingdom of God**: ethical-communal telos of history; eschatology treated with symbolic restraint and hopeful universality.
- **Trinity as church doctrine**: regulative summary of the Christian God-relation, placed at the terminus of dogmatics.
- **Christs perfect God-consciousness**: functional key to his person; displaces metaphysical two-natures as primary explanatory frame.
- **Regulative use of doctrine**: dogmas order and articulate piety rather than deliver speculative ontologies.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a methodological counterpoint for defining revelation, Scripture, and dogmatics.
 - As a Christological alternative emphasizing mediation of consciousness over metaphysical incarnation.
 - As a soteriological model unifying justification-sanctification and highlighting ecclesial mediation.
 - As an eschatological-ethical orientation to the Kingdom and communal hope, often contrasted with apocalyptic schemas.
