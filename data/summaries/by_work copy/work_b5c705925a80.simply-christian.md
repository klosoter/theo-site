### TITLE
**Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense** (N. T. Wright, 2006) - a popular-level, narrative-apologetic presenting Christianity as God's renewal of creation through Jesus, summoning humans into Spirit-empowered image-bearing.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 2000s, post-9/11, late-modern skepticism and spiritual hunger; Anglican episcopal ministry.
 - In conversation with C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity; shaped by Second Temple Judaism studies and inaugurated eschatology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Christianity makes rational, moral, and existential sense because the Creator is **putting the world to rights** in and through Israel's Messiah, Jesus, by the Spirit, toward **new creation** rather than escape to heaven.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Part I: **Echoes of a Voice** - persistent human longings (justice, spirituality, relationships, beauty) signal vocation and loss.
 - Part II: **Staring at the Sun** - God and the world known through Israel's story climaxing in **Jesus' kingdom mission, crucifixion, and bodily resurrection**.
 - Part III: **Reflecting the Image** - the **Spirit**, **church**, **scripture**, **worship**, **prayer**, and **mission** form a people who anticipate the **new heavens and new earth**.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - C. S. Lewis; biblical narrative (Law, Prophets, Psalms, Gospels, Paul); critique of **Platonism**, **Deism/Epicureanism**, and modern/postmodern dualisms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (story-shaped knowing); **Trinity** (implicitly through Father, Son, Spirit actions); **Christology** (Jesus as Israel's Messiah); **Soteriology** (forgiveness, new exodus, victory over powers); **Ecclesiology** (church as sign/instrument/foretaste); **Pneumatology** (Spirit as down payment); **Anthropology** (image-bearing vocation); **Doctrine of Sin** (idolatry, exile); **Eschatology** (resurrection, judgment, new creation).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **God will set the world right through the crucified and risen Jesus, forming a Spirit-filled people who embody and anticipate the renewed creation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **New creation** over disembodied heaven; **heaven-and-earth overlap** (temple motif).
 - **Echoes of a voice** as apologetic doorway: justice, spirituality, relationships, beauty.
 - **Bodily resurrection** and **inaugurated kingdom** (already/not yet) as the backbone of hope.
 - **Vocation**: restored image-bearing in public, relational, and aesthetic life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against **escapist eschatology**, privatized faith, and mere moralism.
 - Critique of **dualism** (Platonist soul-flight) and **Epicurean** banishment of God from the world.
 - Broadens atonement beyond penal-only frames to include victory, new exodus, covenant renewal.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Phrases: **echoes of a voice**, **putting the world to rights**, **new exodus**, **signposts to transcendence**, **staring at the sun**.
 - **Temple** as the category for God's presence where heaven and earth intersect.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in catechesis and college ministry; appreciated in evangelical, Anglican, and ecumenical settings.
 - Reformed readers often laud the **resurrection/new creation** focus; some register caution over de-emphasized imputation or penal narrowness.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies **resurrection hope**, integrates **individual and cosmic eschatology**, energizes **public theology** and **mission**, and supplies a readable narrative hermeneutic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Echoes of a voice**: Four universal longings (justice, spirituality, relationships, beauty) that witness to a lost vocation yet real summons.
- **New Heavens and New Earth**: Final telos is renewed creation, not heaven-escape; creation affirmed and transfigured.
- **Resurrection and New Creation**: Jesus' bodily resurrection inaugurates the new age; believers' resurrection completes it.
- **Kingdom of God (already/not yet)**: Present reign in Jesus and the Spirit, awaiting consummation at his return.
- **Heaven-and-earth overlap; Temple**: Sacred space motif for divine presence; church and sacraments as anticipatory sites.
- **Image of God; Eschatological Anthropology**: Humans renewed to wise stewardship and worship; destiny is embodied communion and vocation.
- **The Fall and its consequences**: Idolatry leads to dehumanization, systemic injustice, and exile; the gospel heals and reorients desire.
- **Final Judgment and eternal states**: God's just setting-to-rights of the world; vindication and exclusion correlate with allegiance to the King.
- **Individual and Cosmic Eschatology**: Personal destiny (resurrection life or loss) embedded within God's cosmic renewal.
- **Christ and Culture in Eschatological Perspective**: Public discipleship as anticipatory sign of the kingdom's justice and beauty.
- **Holy Spirit as firstfruits**: Indwelling presence guaranteeing future renewal and empowering mission.
- **Church as sign, instrument, foretaste**: A community embodying reconciliation, holiness, and hope.
- **Scripture as story-shaped revelation**: Canon read as the true story of the world, culminating in Jesus.
- **Mission and vocation**: Worship, justice, evangelism, and creation care as participation in new-creation work.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Definition source** for resurrection hope and new-creation eschatology.
 - **Polemic** against dualism and escapist views of heaven and salvation.
 - **Exegetical model** for reading Israel-to-Jesus as one covenantal story.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking anthropology, ecclesiology, and public theology under inaugurated eschatology.
