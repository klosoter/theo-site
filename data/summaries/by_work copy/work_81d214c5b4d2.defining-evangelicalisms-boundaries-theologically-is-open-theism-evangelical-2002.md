### TITLE
Defining Evangelicalism's Boundaries Theologically: Is Open Theism Evangelical? (Bruce Ware, 2002)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 2000s evangelical debates about identity and doctrinal boundaries following the rise of Open Theism in the 1980s-90s.
 - Ware writes from a conservative evangelical interlocutory position intent on delimiting what may count as within evangelical orthodoxy.
 - Conversation engages broader concerns over biblical authority, classical theism, and pastoral confidence in God's character.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Open Theism is theologically incompatible with essential evangelical commitments**; therefore it should be judged outside orthodox evangelical boundaries.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: Articulates a working definition of evangelicalism anchored in the authority of Scripture, the centrality of the gospel, and continuity with historic Christian doctrine.
 - Diagnosis: Summarizes Open Theism's key claims-genuine future openness, limited divine exhaustive foreknowledge, and a dynamic God who responds contingently to creaturely decisions.
 - Theological refutation:
 - Shows how Open Theism undermines **biblical testimony to God's exhaustive foreknowledge** and providential control.
 - Argues that Open Theism misconstrues anthropomorphic biblical language, collapsing **divine condescension (accommodation)** into actual limitation.
 - Demonstrates negative consequences for soteriology, prayer, assurance, and pastoral trust.
 - Boundary claim: If a position contradicts the core classical-theistic attributes integral to evangelicalism, it falls outside evangelical orthodoxy.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary Open Theist proponents: Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Gregory Boyd (as representative voices).
 - Implicit interlocutors: historic evangelical and Reformed theologians whose writings on omniscience, immutability, and providence supply counter-evidence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine foreknowledge**, omniscience
 - **Divine immutability** and classical attributes
 - **Providence** and sovereignty
 - **Divine condescension / accommodation** and hermeneutics of anthropomorphism
 - Secondary: revelation and pastoral implications (assurance, prayer, gospel proclamation)

- **Closing line**
 - Ware's theological center of gravity: preserving classical attributes of God (especially exhaustive foreknowledge and providence) is necessary to maintain evangelical identity and faithful pastoral witness; Open Theism fails that test.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the question as one of **boundary-definition** for evangelical identity, not merely propositional dispute.
 - Emphasizes pastoral and ecclesial consequences of doctrinal revision (assurance, preaching, prayer life) alongside abstract metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts Open Theism's reading of Scripture as literal relational contingency with the **historic evangelical move** to read anthropomorphism as accommodation.
 - Corrects what Ware sees as Open Theists' flattening of classical theism into a temporal, changing deity.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Frames evangelical identity in **theological-criteria terms** (biblical, creedal, gospel-centered), using these as boundary tests against alternative systematic moves.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative/Reformed and Southern Baptist circles as a succinct statement against Open Theism.
 - Frequently cited in pastoral and confessional discussions seeking to exclude Open Theism from denominational orthodoxy.
 - Generated responses from Open Theists but remains a go-to critique in evangelical polemics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful pedagogically for teaching how doctrinal change impacts pastoral theology and identity.
 - Valuable model for combining systematic theology, hermeneutics, and ecclesial boundary-setting.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evangelicalism** - defined by Ware as a theological identity grounded in Scripture, gospel centrality, and historic Christian orthodoxy.
- **Open Theism** - theological position asserting genuine openness of the future and that God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free acts.
- **Classical Theism** - the traditional view of God as timeless/atemporal or at least possessing exhaustive foreknowledge, immutability, and sovereignty.
- **Divine foreknowledge (exhaustive)** - the claim that God knows all future contingent events definitively; a central locus of dispute.
 - Contrast: Open Theism's limited/rolling foreknowledge.
- **Divine immutability** - God's unchanging nature; Ware defends a robust view against Open Theism's dynamic God.
- **Providence / Sovereignty** - undergirding of Ware's pastoral concerns; Open Theism's model weakens classical accounts of providential governance.
- **Divine condescension / accommodation** - Ware insists biblical anthropomorphisms show accommodation, not genuine divine self-limitation.
- **Anthropomorphism** - hermeneutical category Ware uses to argue biblical language about God's emotions/actions is analogical and accommodating.
- **Future contingents** - the metaphysical category at stake: whether future free acts are open or settled.
- **Hermeneutics of Scripture** - methodological commitment to reading Scripture in continuity with classical attributes.
- **Pastoral trust / assurance** - practical loci Ware uses to test doctrinal orthodoxy.
- **Boundary-definition** - the theological method and aim of the essay: criteria to include/exclude views from evangelicalism.
- **Soteriological consequences** - concerns that Open Theism will affect gospel assurance and confidence in God's promises.
- **Theological method** - integration of systematic, biblical, and pastoral criteria to make boundary claims.

How the work is used:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical identity markers in denominational or institutional deliberations.
- As a **polemic** against Open Theism in conferences, syllabi, and pastoral training.
- As a **pedagogical model** demonstrating interaction of doctrine, hermeneutics, and pastoral theology when assessing novel movements.
