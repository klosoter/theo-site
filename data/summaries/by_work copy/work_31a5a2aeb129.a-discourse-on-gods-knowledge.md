### TITLE
A Discourse on God's Knowledge - Stephen Charnock (from Discourses upon the Existence and Attributes of God, 17th century Puritan/Reformed theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th‑century English Puritan-Reformed milieu; discourses delivered in pastoral/lecturing context and published posthumously (Samuel Annesley edition, 1680s). Moves in the context of classical Reformed scholasticism reacting to Arminian and Molinaean challenges.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To vindicate and define the divine attribute of knowledge (omniscience) as infinite, simple, eternal, immediate, and the necessary foundation for providence, election, and moral government - showing how God's knowledge differs essentially from creaturely knowing and how it coheres with divine sovereignty.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Establishes the reality and perfection of God's knowledge from Scripture (Ps 139, Heb 4:13, Acts 15:18) and metaphysical principles.
 - Distinguishes divine knowledge from creaturely knowledge (no succession, no learning, not discursive).
 - Analyzes objects of divine knowledge: necessary truths, contingents, future events, secret thoughts, counterfactuals.
 - Relates knowledge to other attributes: simplicity, immutability, eternity, and will/decree - arguing that knowledge is neither passive nor caused by creatures.
 - Applies the doctrine to practical issues: providence, foreordination, assurance, and the moral accountability of men.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy use of Scripture and patristic/scholastic categories; dialogues implicit with Aristotelian epistemology, Reformed theologians (Calvinian tradition), and polemics against Arminian/Molinist accounts of foreknowledge and semi-Pelagian appeals.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, providence, predestination/election, divine immutability and simplicity, human accountability; touches on freedom and contingency only in relation to God's knowledge.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** God's knowledge is the infinite, simple, eternal light in which all things stand revealed - the sovereign, active foundation of providence and redemption, utterly unlike creaturely knowledge.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **immediacy** of divine knowledge: God knows particulars directly, not by inference or experience.
 - Emphasizes **ontological priority** of divine knowledge to created events (knowledge as the ground of certain divine acts while not being causally dependent on creatures).
 - Uses classical Reformed language of **archetypal (in God) vs. ectypal (in creatures)** knowledge to preserve divine uniqueness while accounting for creaturely knowing.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects Molinaean "middle knowledge" as implicitly subordinating God's sovereignty to creaturely contingencies.
 - Counters Arminian appeals that make human foreseen will the ground of election; locates certitude in God's eternal knowledge and decree.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Strong articulation of knowledge as an **active attribute** (not passive receptivity) tied to God's eternal will and decree.
 - Clear application of the absolute/relative attribute distinction: knowledge as absolute in God, and as relative when considered in creaturely cognition.
- **Reception and influence:** Long-standing influence in Reformed and Puritan theological education as a concise, pastoral scholastic treatment; used in later Reformed systematicians as a stock resource on omniscience and the knowledge‑sovereignty nexus.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Models how to combine biblical exegesis, metaphysical clarity, and polemical precision; valuable for courses on divine attributes, providence, and classical Reformed responses to Molinism/Arminianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Omniscience:** God's comprehensive knowledge of all things (past, present, future, possible, actual).
- **Archetypal knowledge:** Knowledge in God himself; the exemplar, perfect and original knowledge.
- **Ectypal knowledge:** Creaturely knowledge derived from the archetype; finite, mediated, derivative.
- **Immediacy (of divine knowledge):** God knows particulars without discursive reasoning or temporal succession.
- **Eternity/Immutability:** God's knowledge is eternal and unchanging; not successive or acquired.
- **Prescience/Foreknowledge:** God's certain knowledge of future contingents; distinct from being caused by created acts.
- **Divine simplicity:** God's knowledge is identical with his essence, not an attribute added to a complex subject.
- **Providence:** The governance of all events which Charnock roots in God's knowledge and will.
- **Decree:** The eternal counsel of God; related to knowledge insofar as knowledge grounds or comprehends the objects of decree without making knowledge passive.
- **Contingent and counterfactuals:** Charnock affirms God's knowledge of future contingents and counterfactuals while denying that such knowledge derives its necessity from creatures.
- **Absolute vs Relative attributes:** Knowledge as an absolute attribute in God (considered in Himself) and as relative when considered in relation to creatures (where it appears finite).
- **Active attribute:** Knowledge conceived as active, not merely receptive; expressive of divine sovereignty.
- **Assurance/accountability:** Practical bearings-knowledge secures divine promises and undergirds human responsibility.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed doctrine of divine omniscience and the archetypal/ectypal distinction.
- As a **polemic resource** against Molinist middle knowledge and Arminian uses of foreknowledge.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading texts on God's knowledge (Ps 139, Heb 4:13) within a metaphysical framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking divine knowledge to providence, decree, and moral assurance in pastoral theology.
