### TITLE
"The New Testament and Criticism" (article), Harold Lindsell, Christianity Today, 1966.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-1960s North American evangelical milieu: rising tensions between conservative evangelicals and mainline/liberal scholarship; aftermath of postwar historical-critical expansion and Bultmannian demythologizing.
 - Christianity Today as an evangelical forum aiming to shape lay and pastoral reception of scholarship.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Lindsell argues that modern critical methods-when unqualified-undermine the historic authority and trustworthiness of the New Testament; he defends the traditional evangelical claim of Scripture's reliability and practical inerrancy.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: describes trends in higher criticism, form and redaction criticism, and demythologizing that erode confidence in NT narratives.
 - Defense: marshals appeals to historical reliability, manuscript evidence, and the continuity of apostolic testimony to rebut skeptical conclusions.
 - Practical appeal: contends that doctrinal orthodoxy and Christian mission depend on treating the NT as authoritative and trustworthy.
 - Polemic coda: warns pastors and churches about the pastoral and theological cost of capitulating to a critical skepticism that relativizes revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with strands of continental and English-language critical scholarship (representatively: Bultmannian demythologizers, proponents of form/redaction criticism, and liberal historians).
 - Conversational alignment with emerging conservative apologetic voices that insist on the historicity of gospel claims; anticipatory of later inerrancy debates and institutional responses.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Inspiration and Inerrancy** (primary focus): constitutional status of NT truthfulness.
 - **Revelation and Authority**: correlation between divine revelation and the church's reliance on the NT for doctrine and ethics.
 - **Christology/Eschatology** (secondary): defense of gospel accounts of Jesus' life, miracles, and resurrection as historically grounded.
 - **Canon and Textual Reliability**: evidential remarks on manuscript tradition to support historical claims.
- **Closing line**
 - The piece centers on the conviction that the New Testament must be read as a reliable testimony rooted in divine revelation; to lose that confidence is to subvert Christian doctrine and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong pastoral-polemical posture: not merely an academic critique but a pastoral warning about the ecclesial consequences of critical accommodation.
 - Explicit linkage of textual/historical questions to the integrity of evangelical faith and practice.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against demythologizing and liberal historicism by insisting critics often presuppose naturalism and thus beg the question against supernatural claims.
 - Contrasts with moderate critical scholars who attempt a compromise between historic faith and methodological skepticism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No novel technical theory; notable for consolidating apologetic rhetoric that frames textual and historical scholarship as directly relevant to inerrancy debates.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Functioned as an influential evangelical corrective in the 1960s, anticipating Lindsell's later, more sustained interventions (notably The Battle for the Bible).
 - Helped rally conservative pastors and lay leaders to resist permissive critical trends; contributed indirectly to later formal statements on inerrancy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a historical snapshot of evangelical reactions to mid-20th-century criticism and as a concise popular defense of Scripture for pastors, students, and church leaders.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture free from error in its original autographs; Lindsell treats this as non-negotiable for doctrinal fidelity.
- **Inspiration** - Divine authorship grounding biblical authority and trustworthiness.
- **Higher Criticism** - Umbrella term for historical-critical methods that investigate origins and development of biblical texts; portrayed as the chief methodological adversary.
- **Form Criticism** - Critique of sources and oral tradition that, according to Lindsell, can diminish confidence in the gospels' historicity.
- **Redaction Criticism** - Analysis of evangelists' editorial activity; used by Lindsell to show potential overreach when employed to deny apostolic reliability.
- **Textual Criticism** - Study of manuscript witnesses; appealed to by Lindsell to demonstrate the substantial reliability of the NT text tradition.
- **Demythologizing** - Bultmannian program that reinterprets miracle-language as existential myth; identified as corrosive to supernatural claims.
- **Historical Reliability** - The claim that gospel narratives are trustworthy historical testimony; central apologetic locus.
- **Authority of Scripture** - The practical consequence of inspiration/inerrancy for doctrine and church life.
- **Canon** - Recognition of the NT corpus as normative; used implicitly as the repository of apostolic witness.
- **Resurrection** - Treated as a historical claim whose denial by critics undermines core Christian proclamation.
- **Apologetics** - Defensive posture combining historical evidence and theological commitments to rebut skepticism.
- **Evangelicalism (mid-20th c.)** - The sociotheological setting of Lindsell's argument; evangelical identity framed by commitment to biblical authority.
- **Confessionalism** - Implicit appeal to confessional standards that presuppose Scripture's trustworthiness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **polemic** and mobilizing tract defending inerrancy and warning pastors about critical accommodation.
- As a **definition-source** for evangelical commitments linking inspiration, inerrancy, and ecclesial authority.
- As a **historical snapshot** and teaching aid for classes on 20th-century evangelical responses to higher criticism (less often used as a technical exegetical model).
