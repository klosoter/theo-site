### TITLE
**Jürgen Moltmann, The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)** 
A systematic eschatology reframing Christian doctrine around the future of God who comes to dwell with creation.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century post-Cold War, ecumenical, post-Barthian landscape; culmination of Moltmanns systematic series (Trinity, creation, Christology, Spirit, eschatology).
 - Dialogues with Jewish thought and political-ecological theology; reaction against both privatized piety and secular progress myths.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Eschatology is not the worlds end but **Gods coming** to indwell, judge, and renew creation. The future of God shapes all loci: God, creation, salvation, church, and human destiny.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Messianic eschatology**: The raised and coming Christ is Lord of history; hope is grounded in promise and resurrection.
 - **Time and eternity**: Against timeless metaphysics; eternity as God-with-time; the **Sabbath** anticipates eschaton.
 - **Judgment as salvation**: God sets things right with restorative justice that remembers victims.
 - **Resurrection of the dead**: Bodily, communal, cosmic; rejection of immortal-soul dualism; the last things are for the whole creation.
 - **Kingdom and new creation**: Distinguishes messianic reign from consummation; Rev 21-22 as God-with-us, not escape.
 - **Israel and the nations**: Non-supersessionist reading of Rom 9-11; church as firstfruits, not replacement.
 - **Ethical-public implications**: Political, ecological, and liturgical practices as anticipatory signs of the future.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical apocalyptic and prophets; rabbinic and Shekinah traditions.
 - Patristic voices (Origen, Gregory of Nyssa) on apokatastasis; Augustine on the two cities and hell; Reformers (Luther, Calvin) on hope and sacraments.
 - Modern interlocutors: Barth (Christological eschatology), Pannenberg (prolepsis), Balthasar (hope for all), Bloch (principle of hope).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity, creation providence, anthropology of body-soul unity, atonement and justification, church and sacraments, Israel-church relation, last judgment, resurrection, heaven-hell, new creation.
- **Closing line**
 - The works center of gravity: **God is known as the One who comes**; hope in Gods arrival orders doctrine and energizes public discipleship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Name of God as the Coming One** (Rev 1:4): future-oriented theology proper.
 - **Restorative judgment** that rights wrongs and vindicates victims.
 - **Sabbath eschatology**: sabbatical time structures hope; the millennium read as messianic sabbath, not literal chronology.
 - **Shekinah theology**: Gods indwelling glory as goal of creation.
 - **Ecological eschatology**: new creation is cosmic, not merely human.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **immortal-soul** eschatology; for bodily resurrection.
 - Against **eternal conscious torment** as final theodicy; argues hopeful-universal horizon and annihilation of evil.
 - Against **supersessionism**; for Israels irrevocable election.
 - Against **disengaged apocalyptic** and **secular progress**; for messianic hope that confronts history.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Messianic vs metaphysical** eternity; eternity as the fullness of time-in-God.
 - **Prolepsis and foretaste** as structuring participation now in the coming kingdom.
 - **Eschatological panentheism** (God-in-all, all-in-God) at consummation without collapsing Creator-creature distinction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely engaged across Protestant and Roman Catholic theology; formative for political, liberation, and ecological theologies.
 - Reformed reception mixed: welcomed for creation-and-covenant emphasis, critiqued on universalism, divine passibility, and millennial speculations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Integrates exegesis, doctrinal synthesis, and ethics.
 - Useful as a corrective to individualistic or speculative eschatologies and as a resource for public theology and worship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The Coming of God**: Eschaton as Gods arriving presence, not mere temporal end.
- **Messianic eschatology**: Christ-centered future that renews history and creation.
- **Restorative judgment**: Judgment that sets things right, remembers victims, and heals.
- **Resurrection of the dead**: Bodily, communal resurrection over against soul-immortality schemes.
- **New creation**: Cosmic transformation where God dwells with creation (Rev 21-22).
- **Shekinah**: Gods indwelling glory; goal of covenantal communion between God and creation.
- **Sabbath theology of time**: Eschaton as sabbath fulfillment; shapes work, rest, worship, and ecology.
- **Millennial sabbath**: Non-literal sabbatical reading of Rev 20 as messianic rest prior to consummation.
- **Apokatastasis (hopeful universalism)**: Eschatological hope for all in Christ, without dogmatic universalism; evil finally nullified.
- **Prolepsis/foretaste**: Anticipatory participation now in what God will complete.
- **Psychosomatic unity**: Human person as embodied; rejects dualist anthropology.
- **Memory of suffering**: Eschatology must vindicate and remember victims; grounds judgment.
- **Israel-church relation**: Irrevocable election of Israel; church as firstfruits of the nations.
- **Eschatological panentheism**: All-in-God consummation language, retaining Creator-creature distinction.
- **God who comes (ho erchomenos)**: Divine name signaling future-oriented theology proper.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional source for eschatology across loci: God, creation, salvation, church, and ethics oriented to the future.
 - As a conceptual pivot for covenant-creation theology via Shekinah and sabbath motifs.
 - As a polemical resource against eternal torment, supersessionism, and soul-immortality.
 - As an exegetical-theological model for reading Rev 20-22, Rom 9-11, and resurrection texts within a restorative horizon.
