### TITLE
Unity and Continuity in Covenantal Thought
Andrew A. Woolsey

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Situated in the late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed resurgence of covenantal theology.
 - Written against a background of renewed debate with dispensationalism and ongoing refinement within Reformed biblical-theological circles (redemptive-historical method).
 - Aimed at pastors, seminarians, and scholars seeking a coherent hermeneutic for Old-New Testament continuity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible presents one unfolding covenant of grace from promise to consummation; continuity across redemptive history is real and theologically decisive even where administrations differ.
 - The work addresses how unity and continuity should shape doctrine (soteriology, ecclesiology, sacramentology) without collapsing typological distinctions or administrative plurality.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-theological survey: traces the development of covenantal thinking from the Reformers through modern Reformed theologians to contemporary debates.
 - Hermeneutical claim: covenant is the controlling category for biblical theology; typology and promise-fulfillment are primary interpretive keys.
 - Exegetical moves:
 - Reads covenant language in key OT texts as anticipating a single, messianic covenantal economy.
 - Argues for Christ as the center and mediator of the covenantal unity (federal head, second Adam).
 - Systematic-theological application:
 - Distinguishes essential unity (same saving promise) from administrative diversity (different signs, ceremonies, and temporal outworkings).
 - Applies continuity to sacramental practice (circumcision -> baptism), law's role, and corporate identity (Israel/Church relation).
 - Conclusion: Properly understood, covenant unity preserves typological richness while securing doctrinal coherence across loci.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical Reformed writers (implicitly or explicitly) and modern covenant theologians.
 - Primary interlocutors include dispensational critics who insist on a sharp Israel/Church divide and some internal Reformed strains that minimize typological distinctives.
 - Draws on redemptive-historical interpreters for method and on exegetical treatments of covenant texts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (unity and administrations), revelation, Christology (mediatorial, federal head), soteriology, sacraments (circumcision/baptism), ecclesiology (Israel/Church continuity), law and gospel, infant covenant inclusion, and aspects of eschatology (inaugurated vs. consummated salvation).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: the covenant of grace, anchored in Christ, is the integrative category that secures biblical unity, sacramental continuity, and coherent ecclesial identity without erasing typological and administrative distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stress on *organic* continuity: continuity is relational and promise-centered, not merely institutional or ritualistic.
 - Careful balance of unity and diversity-advocates a robust single-covenant framework while preserving legitimate administrative distinctions.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensational bifurcation of Israel and the Church by insisting on real promises carried forward in covenantal succession.
 - Contrasts with some earlier covenant theologians who either over-systematized (flattened typology) or underplayed administrative difference.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes continuity as "promise-fulfillment continuity" (promise as the axis) rather than only "institutional continuity."
 - Emphasizes the notion of covenantal administrations as legitimate expressions of one substantive covenant.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Moderately influential within contemporary Reformed and evangelical seminary circles as a clarifying statement on covenant unity.
 - Frequently cited in discussions of sacramental continuity and Israel-Church relations; used as a corrective in polemics with dispensationalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between redemptive-historical exegesis and systematic application.
 - Useful pedagogically for teaching how covenant theology informs preaching, sacraments, and church identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The one saving covenant progressively revealed and fulfilled in Christ; the central hermeneutical category.

- **Covenant of Works**
 - Prelapsarian covenant framework used to clarify human responsibility and the need for a mediatorial covenant.

- **Unity vs. Administrative Diversity**
 - Distinction between essential, substantive unity of promise and varied historical administrations (signs, rites, polity).

- **Promise-Fulfillment**
 - The interpretive axis: promises drive typology and show continuity toward Christ.

- **Typology**
 - Christ-centered patterns in the OT that are genuine foreshadowings fulfilled in the NT.

- **Federal Headship**
 - Christ as the representative head who establishes and secures covenantal relations for his people.

- **Sacramental Continuity**
 - Theological continuity between circumcision and baptism as signs of the same covenantal reality.

- **Israel-Church Relation**
 - Corporate and redemptive continuity; distinction maintained in role/administration, not in salvific promise.

- **Law within the Covenant**
 - Law retains normative, covenantal function-ethical guide and covenant boundary marker-mediated by Christ.

- **Inaugurated Eschatology**
 - Salvation as already/not yet within covenant history; continuity includes present participation and future consummation.

- **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
 - Method privileging covenantal progress and typology over isolated proof-texting.

- **Election and Covenant**
 - Election is worked out covenantally; corporate elect identity precedes and shapes individual application.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for teaching covenant unity and the promise-fulfillment principle.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational separations of Israel and Church.
 - As an **exegetical model** for sacramental continuity (circumcision/baptism) and typological reading.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of ecclesiology, sacraments, and covenantal soteriology.
