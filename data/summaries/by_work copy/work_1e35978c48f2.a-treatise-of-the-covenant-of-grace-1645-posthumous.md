### TITLE
A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace (1645, posthumous) - John Ball. 
A mid-17th-century Puritan exposition and defense of the Covenant of Grace within Reformed/federal theology; published posthumously during the English Revolutionary era.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - English Puritan milieu; published in 1645 amid civil/religious upheaval and intense debate about church order, law, and gospel.
 - Situated in the broader Reformed/federal tradition that systematized biblical covenants as the backbone of soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The principal aim is to define, justify, and apply the **Covenant of Grace** as God's sovereign, redemptive agreement with sinners in Christ, distinct from the Covenant of Works and operative across both Testaments.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define covenant language in Scripture and distinguish covenants (works vs. grace).
 - Establish Christ as the single Mediator and federal Head of the Covenant of Grace.
 - Trace the covenant's administrations: promises, sacraments as seals, typology in the Old Testament, and fulfillment in the New Testament.
 - Treat soteriological consequences: election, justification, sanctification, assurance, and perseverance under the covenantal framework.
 - Pastoral application: preaching, sacraments, and Christian obedience as covenantal duties and signs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Operates within the Calvinist/federal stream (implicit debt to Calvin, early Reformed federalists, and leading Puritan thinkers).
 - Polemical proximity to contemporary controversies: antinomian misunderstandings of grace, Arminian and Socinian denials of federal structures, and Roman Catholic sacramental claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scriptural covenantal revelation), covenant theology, Trinity (as related to covenantal economy), Christology (mediatorial role), soteriology (election, justification, sanctification), sacraments (signs and seals), law/gospel relation.
- **Closing line**
 - Ball's theological center of gravity: the Covenant of Grace is the canonical, covenantal matrix in which Christ mediates salvation, sacraments seal promises, and the believer lives under redeeming obligation and assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral thrust: the covenant is not only doctrinal schema but the ordinary means of grace by which believers receive assurance and grow in holiness.
 - Explicit linking of covenantal promise with sacramental sealing: sacraments are presented as inseparable practical confirmations of the covenant.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters antinomian tendencies by affirming law's role as rule of life for covenant people while rejecting any covenantal merit outside Christ.
 - Opposes reductionist views that collapse covenantal distinctions (e.g., equating all divine dealings as identical) and resists Socinianizing or Arminian flattening of federal categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Uses the classical federal vocabulary but presses for sharper pastoral application-treats covenant as both forensic grant and living relation.
 - Emphasizes continuity between Old and New administrations without dissolving the typological and mediatorial uniqueness of Christ.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Read within Puritan circles; functioned as a clear, concise manual of covenantal instruction for ministers and devout laity.
 - Did not spawn a distinct school but contributed to the Consolidation of covenantal categories in English Reformed theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a compact pastoral-theological presentation of covenantal Reformed soteriology and sacramentology; useful for tracing Puritan uses of federal language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace** - God's redemptive covenant with sinners fulfilled in Christ; central explanatory category.
- **Covenant of Works** - The prelapsarian covenant with Adam; contrasted to show need for grace.
- **Federal Headship / Mediator** - Christ as representative and surety who stands as head of the covenant people.
- **Promises (and conditions)** - Promises are the covenant's content; conditions are Christ's fulfillment rather than human merit.
- **Sacraments as Seals** - Baptism and the Lord's Supper confirm and visibly signify covenant promises.
- **Typology / Figures** - Old Testament persons/events are types that prefigure Christ and covenant fulfillment.
- **Election / Predestination** - Treated within covenantal terms: election is the divine choice realized in covenant promises.
- **Law and Gospel** - Law remains the covenant rule for the redeemed; gospel supplies the covenantal remedy and promise.
- **Justification by Faith** - Forensic declaration that is the covenantal gift received by faith in Christ.
- **Sanctification / Perseverance** - Covenant produces ongoing sanctifying effects and grounds for assurance of perseverance.
- **Administration (Old vs. New)** - Distinction between modes of covenant administration without severing substance.
- **Assurance** - Covenantal promises and the application of Christ's merits provide pastoral grounds for assurance.
- **Mediator's Suretyship** - Emphasis on Christ's substitutionary legal work as the basis for covenantal claims.
- **Sealing and Application of Redemption** - How benefits are applied to believers (promise + covenantal means).
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the Covenant of Grace in Puritan/Reformed studies.
 - As a **polemic** resource against antinomian and Socinian readings of covenant and sacrifice.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching covenant theology (sacramental practice, assurance, and holiness).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** illustrating mid-17th-century English applications of continental federal theology.
