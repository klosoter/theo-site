### TITLE
**Inerrancy and Worldview** - Vern S. Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 2010s Reformed evangelical defense of Scripture post-CSBI (1978), amid renewed challenges from naturalism, historical criticism, and postmodern hermeneutics.
 - Situated within the Westminster (Van Til/Frame) presuppositional and triperspectival milieu; companion to Poythress works on science, philosophy, and language.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Objections to inerrancy are not neutral**; they arise from rival worldviews that smuggle in alien standards of truth, language, and causation. A Trinitarian, theistic worldview provides the conditions for communication from God and thus for **trustworthy, inerrant Scripture**.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposes the **myth of neutrality**: all reasoning is worldview-laden; critics deploy naturalistic or relativist norms.
 - Grounds **language and truth in the Triune God** whose speech norms reality; Scripture as divine discourse can be fully true.
 - Clarifies **ordinary-language inerrancy**: God speaks truly using approximation, phenomenological description, hyperbole, and genre conventions without error.
 - Addresses **science and history**: divine providence and miracles fit the theistic frame; naturalistic exclusion of miracles is a worldview veto, not evidence.
 - Treats **textual transmission and canon**: inerrancy pertains to the autographic text; providence preserves a reliable textual tradition sufficient for the church.
 - Engages **alleged contradictions**: urges contextual reading, genre sensitivity, harmonization charity, and the noetic effects of sin in interpretation.
 - Integrates **Christology and authority**: the Lordship of Christ entails the authority of His Word; Jesus own view of Scripture underwrites inerrancy.
 - Applies to **ethics and culture**: biblical norms stand over human courts of plausibility shaped by fallen culture.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Positively: Augustine (truth and accommodation), Warfield and the CSBI on inerrancy, Van Til and Frame on presuppositions and perspectivalism, Reformed orthodoxy on revelation.
 - Critically engaged: naturalism, historicism, postmodern relativism; higher criticism; popular skepticism about miracles and textual reliability.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and inspiration**, **providence**, **creation**, **Trinity** (ground of meaning), **Christology** (Christ s view of Scripture), **anthropology/sin** (noetic effects), **ecclesiology and canon**, **soteriology** (trustworthiness of promises), **eschatology** (apocalyptic genre and prophecy).

- **Center of gravity**
 - **Inerrancy as allegiance to the speaking Lord**: Scripture, as the covenant Word of the Triune God, must norm and reshape our worldview rather than be judged by alien criteria.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Trinitarian grounding of language and logic; Scripture as divine speech-act.
 - Ordinary-language precision: inerrancy flexes with genre and purpose; precisionism is a category mistake.
 - Integrates apologetics, hermeneutics, and doctrine through a unified **worldview lens**.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **naturalistic reduction**: disallows a priori exclusion of miracles and prophecy.
 - Against **postmodern indeterminacy**: meaning is stable because God is faithful speaker.
 - Against **flat Biblicism or wooden harmonization**: commends literary, historical, and theological sensitivity under authority of the text.

- **Innovations / conceptual tools**
 - **Perspectival triad** (normative, situational, existential) applied to inerrancy debates.
 - Clarified taxonomy of error vs. imprecision, accommodation, and phenomenological description.
 - Worldview diagnosis as a method for triaging objections.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, accessible, post-CSBI defense, complementing works on science and hermeneutics.
 - Utilized in seminary curricula for apologetics, bibliology, and pastoral method; sometimes critiqued by non-presuppositionalists for its transcendental stance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a **portable framework** to engage new objections without chasing every instance.
 - Strengthens pastoral confidence to preach, teach, and harmonize texts across genres and doctrines.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy (CSBI sense)**: Scripture, in the autographs, tells the truth in all it affirms, according to its own literary purposes and conventions.
- **Worldview**: A network of ultimate commitments that frames evidence, interpretation, and standards of rationality.
- **Presupposition**: Pre-theoretical commitments that guide reasoning; never neutral.
- **Divine speech**: God s communicative action; Scripture as His covenant Word carrying infallible authority.
- **Accommodation**: God s fitting of revelation to human capacities without endorsing falsehood.
- **Ordinary-language precision**: Truthfulness measured by intent and genre, not by modern technical exactness.
- **Phenomenological description**: Reporting how things appear (e.g., sunrise) truly, without implying false cosmology.
- **Genre sensitivity**: Discernment of literary form (poetry, apocalyptic, narrative) to identify what is being affirmed.
- **Harmonization charity**: Integrative reading that seeks coherence, resisting premature contradiction claims.
- **Noetic effects of sin**: Sin s distortion of reasoning and interpretation.
- **Providence and miracle**: God s rule over nature; miracle is not a violation but a special act of the same sovereign Lord.
- **Canon and autographs**: Inerrancy pertains to original writings; reliable transmission under providence grounds confidence in extant text.
- **Triperspectivalism**: Normative (God s norms), situational (facts), existential (self/agent) perspectives interrelated in knowing.
- **Speech-act categories**: Locution/illocution/perlocution help parse what Scripture asserts and intends.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - **Bibliology**: Definition source for inerrancy framed by worldview and genre theory; guide for handling difficulties and variants.
 - **Ecclesiology & sacraments**: Grounds Scripture s primacy over church tradition; stabilizes doctrinal and liturgical norms.
 - **Soteriology and Christology**: Underwrites confidence in gospel promises and Jesus testimony to Scripture s authority.
 - **Eschatology and sin**: Models reading apocalyptic literature and diagnoses interpretive skepticism via the noetic effects of sin.
