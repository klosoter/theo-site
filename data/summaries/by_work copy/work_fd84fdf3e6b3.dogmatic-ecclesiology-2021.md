### TITLE
Dogmatic Ecclesiology (2021) - Tom Greggs

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary academic theology (early 21st century). Responds to longstanding fragmentation between systematic/dogmatic theology and practical/sociological treatments of the church; emerges amid renewed interest in Trinitarian theology, sacramentality, and public theology across Protestant and ecumenical contexts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Ecclesiology must be reclaimed as a genuinely dogmatic locus - that is, the doctrine of the church must be developed within the normative shape of dogmatic theology (Trinity, Christ, revelation, eschatology), not treated merely as applied or descriptive social-science material. The church's identity, offices, sacraments, and mission are theological categories rooted in divine being and economy.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Stage-setting: maps current deficiencies in ecclesial studies (sociologizing, privatization, institutional reduction).
 - Method: argues for a dogmatic method that reads Scripture and tradition through the presuppositions of Trinitarian and Christological doctrine; integrates historical retrieval and constructive correlation with contemporary contexts.
 - Theological grounding: locates the church's ontology in the Triune God and the person and work of Christ - the church is constituted by participation in the life of the Trinity incarnationally mediated by sacraments and ministry.
 - Key loci developed: revelation/scripture as ecclesial, sacraments as constitutive, ministry and authority as theological offices, covenant and mission in eschatological horizon.
 - Practical implications: ecclesial identity shapes worship, polity, ethics, and public witness; ecclesiology must resist reduction to a set of functions or merely cultural forms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** dialogic engagement with Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Robert Jenson, contemporary Anglican/Protestant and Roman Catholic ecclesiologies, plus conciliar texts (esp. Vatican II) and select patristic resources. Engages historical-critical scholarship and contemporary systematic method debates.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (ground of communion), Christology (headship), revelation and Scripture (ecclesial reception), sacraments (baptism, Eucharist), ministry/ordination and ecclesial office, authority and tradition, covenant, eschatology (telos of the church), grace and sanctification.
- **Closing line:** Theologically robust ecclesiology is necessarily dogmatic: the church is to be named and shaped not by sociology or pragmatics but by its rootedness in the Triune God, mediated in Christ and enacted sacramentally toward eschatological consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reclaims the term "dogmatic" positively for ecclesiology, insisting dogmatics supplies the normative categories for thinking the church.
 - Emphasizes an ontological account of the church (church as a theological "what" grounded in divine reality) over purely functional descriptions.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against reductionist sociological, managerial, or exclusively pastoral treatments of the church.
 - Offers a corrective to purely confessional or fideistic accounts by maintaining scriptural and historical retrieval within a systematic dogmatic frame.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tightens the link between "ecclesiality" and Trinitarian being (moves beyond Christo-centric accounts alone to stress communal participation in Triune life).
 - Stresses the constitutive role of sacraments and ordained ministry in ecclesial identity rather than treating them as mere signs or aids.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well regarded in academic ecclesiology and systematic theology circles for reframing ecclesiology as dogmatic theology; influences graduate seminars in ecclesiology and dogmatics.
 - Increasingly referenced in Anglican, Reformed, and ecumenical conversations where doctrinal clarity about church identity and ministry is sought.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact manifesto for integrating dogmatic method with ecclesial questions.
 - Useful for courses on ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and systematic method as a corrective to disciplinary fragmentation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dogmatic method:** Theological approach that prioritizes normative doctrines (Trinity, Christ) for shaping other loci, applied here to ecclesiology.
- **Ecclesial ontology:** The claim that the church has a theologically grounded "being" derived from participation in the Triune life.
- **Trinitarian grounding:** The church's communal life is rooted in the relational ontology of Father, Son, and Spirit.
- **Christological constitution:** Christ as head; the church's institution and mission are derivatively ordered to Christ's person and work.
- **Sacramentality:** Sacraments (baptism, Eucharist) are constitutive instruments of ecclesial being, not merely symbolic practices.
- **Ministry and office:** Ordained structures interpreted theologically - offices serve constitutive, not merely functional, roles in the church's identity.
- **Koinonia (communion):** The communal reality of the church as participation in divine communion; social and spiritual dimensions integrated.
- **Authority and tradition:** Authority understood theologically (rooted in revelation and Trinitarian ordering) and mediated through tradition and communal discernment.
- **Scripture as ecclesial:** Scripture's authority and interpretation are situated within church life and dogmatic horizons.
- **Covenant and mission:** The church is covenantal and missional, directed eschatologically toward God's consummation.
- **Eschatological telos:** The church's identity and practices are oriented toward final fulfillment in God's kingdom.
- **Communion as witness:** Ecclesial communion constitutes credible public witness in the world.
- **Constitutive vs. instrumental:** Distinction applied to sacraments and offices - Greggs stresses a constitutive reading.
- **Normative retrieval:** Use of patristic and confessional resources within systematic, dogmatic reconstruction.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for courses and essays that need a dogmatic articulation of "what the church is."
- As a **polemic** against sociological or purely pragmatic ecclesiologies; used to argue for theological norms in church life.
- As an **exegetical-model pivot** for reading New Testament ecclesiology through Trinitarian and sacramental categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking sacramental theology, ministry, and public theology within one dogmatic frame.
