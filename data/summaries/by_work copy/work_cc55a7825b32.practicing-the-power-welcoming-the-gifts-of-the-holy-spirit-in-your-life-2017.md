### TITLE
**Sam Storms, Practicing the Power: Welcoming the Gifts of the Holy Spirit in Your Life** (2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid renewed debates post-Strange Fire (2013), within a Reformed-evangelical milieu sympathetic to Third Wave praxis.
 - Aimed at pastors and lay leaders seeking biblically ordered charismatic ministry in local churches.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** The New Testament gifts of the Spirit continue and should be earnestly desired and practiced under Scripture and pastoral oversight for the churchs edification and mission.
 - **Problem:** How to integrate charismatic practice with Reformed theology without excess, fear, or disorder.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Biblical warrant:** Exegesis of 1 Cor 12-14; Acts; Eph 4; 1 Thess 5 to argue continuation and order.
 - **Theological frame:** Inaugurated eschatology explains partiality; gifts as non-canonical forms of revelation, tested by Scripture.
 - **Pastoral practice:** Steps for cultivating congregational hunger (prayer, fasting), training ministry teams, protocols for prophecy, healing, deliverance, and tongues with evaluation and feedback.
 - **Safeguards:** Love-driven ethos, elder oversight, discernment, discipline for abuses, and liturgical order.
 - **Mission and sanctification:** Gifts serve holiness and edification, not status or spectacle.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **For continuation:** Wayne Grudem (prophecy), D. A. Carson (1 Cor), Jonathan Edwards (discernment, affections), John Wimber/Third Wave praxis.
 - **Against cessationism:** Replies to B. B. Warfield and contemporary cessationists (e.g., MacArthur), while affirming sola Scriptura and Reformed soteriology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture:** Canon closed; congregational prophecy is fallible and must be weighed.
 - **Pneumatology:** Distribution, purpose, and testing of charismata.
 - **Ecclesiology:** Corporate worship order, leadership, discipline.
 - **Sanctification:** Gifts as means of edification within the church.
 - **Eschatology:** Already/not yet kingdom dynamics shaping expectations for healing and signs.
 - **Spiritual warfare:** Deliverance practiced with sobriety and oversight.

- **Closing line**
 - Pursue love and earnestly desire the gifts, practicing power under Scripture for the churchs upbuilding and Christs mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Reformed continuationism:** High view of sovereignty and Scripture joined to robust practice of gifts.
 - **How-to pastoral manual:** Concrete steps for leaders to implement prophecy, healing, and deliverance with accountability.
 - **Affections and discernment:** Edwardsian tests prioritize Christ-exalting fruit over dramatic phenomena.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - **Against cessationism:** No exegetical necessity for gifts ceasing; warns that open-but-cautious can become functionally closed.
 - **Against excess:** Rejects manipulative hype, prosperity claims, and guaranteed-healing rhetoric; insists on testing and order.
 - **Against over-realized eschatology:** Healing is sought in faith but submitted to Gods sovereign will.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Fallible congregational prophecy:** Distinguishes from Scripture-quality revelation; mandates weighing by elders and body.
 - **Culture of expectation with guardrails:** Normalizes risk-taking obedience paired with evaluation and repentance.
 - **Gifts as means of grace:** Charismata serve sanctification, not identity performance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among Reformed-charismatic pastors, Acts 29 and Third Wave contexts; engaged (and contested) by cessationists; appreciated by evangelicals seeking practical guidance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Bridges exegesis, theology, and implementable practice; a standard field manual for sober, Scripture-regulated charismatic ministry in Reformed settings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism:** View that all New Testament gifts remain operative until Christs return.
- **Cessationism:** Position that certain gifts (e.g., tongues, prophecy) ceased with the apostles; Storms offers exegetical and pastoral rebuttals.
- **Prophecy (NT congregational):** Spirit-prompted impressions reported humbly and weighed; non-canonical and fallible.
 - Tested by Scripture, character, and congregational discernment (1 Thess 5:20-22; 1 Cor 14:29).
- **Words of knowledge/wisdom:** Specific Spirit-given insights for ministry; always subject to testing and Scripture.
- **Healing:** Petitionary prayer for the sick; expected but not presumed; results vary within the already/not yet.
- **Tongues (glossolalia):** Prayer or praise in unlearned speech; public use requires interpretation; private use edifies the believer.
- **Discernment of spirits:** Recognizing demonic, fleshly, or divine sources; crucial for guarding corporate practice.
- **Deliverance ministry:** Pastoral, sober approach to demonic oppression with elder oversight and follow-up discipleship.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The kingdom has come but not in fullness; explains partial healings and ongoing suffering.
- **Means of grace (charismata):** Gifts as instruments for edification and sanctification within the body.
- **Order in worship:** All things done decently and in order (1 Cor 14:40); protocols, time limits, and elder governance.
- **Risk and humility:** Willingness to act on impressions while embracing correction and accountability.
- **Edification (oikodome):** The governing telos of all gifts; love is the measure and motive.
