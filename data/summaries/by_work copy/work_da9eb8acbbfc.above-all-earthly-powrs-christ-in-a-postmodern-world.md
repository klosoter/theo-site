### TITLE
Above All Earthly Pow'rs: Christ in a Postmodern World - David F. Wells

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Reformed milieu confronting the rise of postmodern culture, secularization, and the commodification of religion.
 - Wells writes as a conservative evangelical critic of both liberal Protestantism and pragmatic, consumer-driven evangelicalism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary culture (postmodernity and late modern secularism) has displaced Christ with rival "earthly powers" (culture, consumerism, therapeutic religion), and the church's weakening is traceable to a loss of doctrinal theology and faithful means of grace.
 - Theology must recover its proper task: doctrinal, disciplined, Christ-centered proclamation that governs Christian life and witness.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: surveys cultural shifts (secularization, privatization of religion, therapeutic ethos) that hollow out Christian belief.
 - Critique: indicts modern and evangelical tendencies to accommodate culture - moralism, experiential reductionism, pragmatic church growth strategies.
 - Recovery: calls for a disciplined **theology as science** (principia) rooted in revelation, and for robust use of the **means of grace** (preaching, sacraments, prayer) as formative instruments.
 - Pastoral implications: priorities for seminary formation, homiletics, sacramental practice, and congregational life arise from recovered doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Cultural theorists on secularization and postmodernity (broad engagement, not systematic citation of any single philosopher).
 - Historic Reformed and evangelical sources as corrective; implicit contrasts with liberal theologians, pragmatic evangelical leaders, and pietistic privatizers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture (central).
 - Christology: sovereignty and lordship of Christ over culture.
 - Ecclesiology: church as bearer of the means of grace.
 - Sacramental theology and preaching as formative means.
 - Practical theology: preaching, pastoral formation, mission.

- **Site usage (three topical emphases)**
 - **Nature and Task of Theology:** Wells argues theology's task is to speak authoritatively about God grounded in Scripture, diagnosing cultural idols and orienting the church to Christ.
 - **Theological Method (Principia: Theology as Science):** insists theology be a disciplined, principled intellectual discipline - not an applied social science nor a marketing technique - with method derived from revelation and doctrinal norms.
 - **Means of Grace - Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer:** emphasizes recovered preaching as doctrinal and formative; sacraments as objective means (not merely symbolic); prayer as central to ecclesial life.

- **Closing line**
 - Wells summons the church to recover a doctrinal, disciplined, and Christ-centered theology that reclaims preaching, sacraments, and prayer as the means by which Christ is above all earthly powers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Unwavering focus on the institutional and doctrinal recovery of the church as the vehicle of Christ's lordship in a postmodern world.
 - Integrates cultural critique with ecclesial formation: diagnosing culture is subordinate to reforming the church's theological life.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against liberal accommodation: rejects theology reduced to cultural relevance at the cost of truth.
 - Against pragmatic evangelicalism: opposes therapeutic, market-driven church strategies that sacralize success metrics.
 - Against privatized pietism: insists doctrine and corporate means of grace shape communal identity, not merely individual experience.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Revives the phraseology of theology-as-science (principia) in a contemporary evangelical context to stress disciplined method.
 - Recasts "means of grace" discourse for postmodern-era pastoral practice, linking it directly to cultural witness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a prophetic critique; used in seminary discussions on homiletics, ecclesiology, and cultural engagement.
 - Criticized by some for diagnostic severity and perceived lack of constructive engagement with pluralism; praised for clarity and pastoral urgency.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes rigorous rethinking of theological method and pastoral priorities; a durable resource for training pastors in doctrinal preaching and sacramental faithfulness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Postmodernity** - cultural condition that fragments grand narratives; Wells sees it as both challenge and symptom of Christ's displacement.
- **Earthly powers** - cultural, political, economic forces that assume supremacy over Christ (title motif).
- **Christocentrism** - insistence that theology, preaching, and ecclesial life be ordered to the person and work of Christ.
- **Theology as science (principia)** - theology conceived as disciplined, principled intellectual inquiry grounded in revelation, not subjective taste or social science.
- **Authority of Scripture** - foundational norm for theology, methodological anchor for critique and recovery.
- **Means of grace** - preaching, sacraments, prayer presented as formative, objective channels of divine life to the church.
 - Preaching: doctrinal, formative, not merely motivational.
 - Sacraments: efficacious signs/means (against purely symbolic or privatized readings).
 - Prayer: corporate and disciplinary, shaping communal dependence on God.
- **Cultural diagnosis** - analysis of secularization, privatization, and therapeutic religion as causes of ecclesial decline.
- **Doctrinal retrieval** - reclaiming historic doctrines as the core content of Christian formation.
- **Therapeutic religion** - critique of faith reduced to self-help and emotional well-being.
- **Pragmatism in ministry** - term of reproach for church practices governed by results-oriented metrics rather than doctrine.
- **Ecclesial formation** - renewing church structures and practices to produce Christian identity rooted in doctrine and means of grace.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for the **nature and task of theology**: to argue for doctrine-centered theological education.
 - As a polemic in **methodology**: to defend theology-as-science (principia) against utilitarian or sociological reductions.
 - As a practical-exegetical model for **means of grace**: used in homiletics and sacramental theology courses to reclaim preaching and sacraments as central to pastoral ministry.
