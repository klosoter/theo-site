### TITLE
**Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief** (2013), John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context.** Late 20th-early 21st c. Reformed evangelical theology; Westminster/Van Tilian milieu; post-Bavinck revival of dogmatics for church and academy.
- **Central thesis.** **Theology is the application of the Word of God by persons to all areas of life**, under the **covenant lordship** of the triune God, viewed through mutually interpreting **perspectives**.
- **Core argument / structure.**
 - **Prolegomena and Revelation:** Scripture as God's authoritative speech; inerrancy; canon; illumination; revelation in events, words, and persons (speech-act categories).
 - **God and Trinity:** Lordship attributes (**authority, control, presence**); classical attributes reframed personally; simplicity/impassibility affirmed with biblical nuance; triune relations and missions.
 - **Creation, Providence, and Law:** Creator-creature distinction; providence as meticulous sovereignty; moral order grounded in divine lordship.
 - **Anthropology and Sin:** Image of God in knowledge, righteousness, holiness; comprehensive fall; noetic effects of sin.
 - **Christology:** Person (two natures, one person) and work (obedience, atonement with penal-substitution as central, victory and example as integrative perspectives).
 - **Pneumatology:** Spirit's inspiration, regeneration, sanctification, gifts; cautious openness to contemporary gifts under biblical regulation.
 - **Covenant and Soteriology:** Covenant unity; union with Christ integrating historia/ordo salutis; calling, regeneration, faith, repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, glorification.
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacraments:** Church as covenant community under Word; means of grace; Presbyterian polity; **baptism** (including infants of believers); **Lord's Supper** with spiritual real presence; worship shaped by the Word (reframed regulative principle).
 - **Eschatology:** Inaugurated eschatology; amillennial trajectory; resurrection and new creation; balanced treatments of death, intermediate state, return, judgment, consummation.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors.** Scripture; Augustine, Aquinas; Calvin, Turretin; Warfield, Hodge, Bavinck, Murray; Van Til; interaction with Barth/neo-orthodoxy, liberalism, process/open theism; analytic theists (e.g., Plantinga); contemporary evangelical dogmatics.
- **Doctrines treated.** Revelation, canon, attributes, Trinity, creation/providence, anthropology/sin, Christology, atonement, Spirit, covenant, salvation, church/sacraments, last things.
- **Center of gravity.** The **triune Lord's covenantal authority, control, and presence in Christ by the Spirit through the Word** governs all doctrine and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Tri-perspectival method.** Normative (Word/authority), situational (world/control), existential (self/presence) as mutually interpreting lenses across loci.
- **Lordship paradigm.** Attributes and ethics organized by **authority, control, presence**; not mere taxonomy but a unifying theological grammar.
- **Theology-as-application.** Dogmatics is inherently practical and pastoral without sacrificing rigor; doctrine terminates in worship and obedience.
- **Speech-act account of revelation.** Emphasizes God's performative discourse (locution/illocution/perlocution) to integrate propositional truth with redemptive acts and personal address.
- **Classical theism, biblically recalibrated.** Upholds aseity, simplicity, omniscience, omnipotence, impassibility, while articulating God's real covenantal emotions and actions without change in being or decree.
- **Covenant unity.** One gracious redemptive covenant administered diversely; continuity of law/gospel and means of grace; integrates historia and ordo via union with Christ.
- **Compatibilism.** Strong providence and real human responsibility; freedom as acting according to one's strongest inclination under God's decree.
- **Worship and the regulative principle.** Recasts as a **Scripture principle**: God's Word norms worship; allows prudent forms while guarding God-centered elements.
- **Corrections/contrasts.**
 - Against encyclopedic system-building detached from Scripture/exegesis; against relativism (perspectivalism is not subjectivism).
 - Pushback on Barthian actualism for undercutting inerrant Scripture; on open theism/process for compromising sovereignty; on strict Thomism for impersonal idioms.
- **Reception/influence.** Widely used in Reformed seminaries; appreciated in the New Calvinism; sometimes critiqued for breadth or for nuancing classical attributes and RPW; valued for clarity and pastoral traction.
- **Enduring value.** A flexible, Scripture-saturated framework that travels across loci and disciplines, aiding preaching, catechesis, apologetics, and ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theology as application.** Definitional: doctrine aims at obedient practice under God's Word.
- **Tri-perspectivalism.** Normative/situational/existential perspectives that coinhere; using one rightly entails the others.
 - Contrast: combats reductionisms (mere proof-texting, mere experience, or mere cultural analysis).
- **Lordship attributes.** **Authority** (norms), **control** (sovereign rule), **presence** (covenantal nearness) as an organizing triad.
- **Covenant lordship.** God relates as suzerain to His people; frames revelation, redemption, ethics, and worship.
- **Speech-act revelation.** God's words do things; integrates inspiration, infallibility, efficacy of Scripture.
- **Sola Scriptura and inerrancy.** Scripture as the supreme norm; errorless in all it affirms.
- **Analogical knowledge.** True but creaturely knowledge of God; rejects univocalism and skepticism.
- **Compatibilist freedom.** Divine sovereignty compatible with responsible human choice.
- **Union with Christ.** The soteriological hinge uniting benefits and stages (historia/ordo).
- **Penal substitution within a multi-faceted atonement.** Central while embracing victory/example as perspectives.
- **Means of grace.** Word, sacraments, prayer as Spirit's ordinary conduits.
- **Regulative/Scripture principle.** Word-governed elements with prudential forms.
- **Spiritual presence in the Supper.** Real communion with Christ by the Spirit, by faith.
- **Inaugurated eschatology.** Already/not yet; typically amillennial orientation.

- **How the work is used.**
 - **Definition source:** standard citations for theology, revelation, and lordship categories.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** tri-perspectival grids for method, ethics, and attributes.
 - **Polemic/defense:** resource against open theism, process, and neo-orthodox views of Scripture.
 - **Exegetical model:** integrates biblical theology with systematics for preaching and catechesis.
