### TITLE
God's Foreknowledge and Man's Free Will - Richard Rice

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th‑century analytic and evangelical theological debate over divine foreknowledge, providence, and human freedom.
 - Conversation situated among classical Augustinian/Thomistic theism, Reformation compatibilism, Arminian libertarianism, Molinism (middle knowledge), and emergent Open Theism.
 - Audience: seminary students and theologians seeking a clear, systematic presentation of options and consequences.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Central problem: How to reconcile **God's exhaustive foreknowledge** with **genuine human libertarian free will** without lapsing into determinism or denying divine omniscience.
 - Rice's working thesis: a form of **middle knowledge (Molinism)** or robust account of counterfactuals of freedom offers the most coherent reconciliation, preserving divine providence and human moral responsibility.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic survey: defines terms (foreknowledge, omniscience, freedom, necessity, contingency) and maps classical positions.
 - Evaluation of major options:
 - **Compatibilist/Calvinist** model: endorses divine decree determining choices; critique focuses on threats to moral responsibility.
 - **Simple foreknowledge/Arminian** model: God knows future free acts without determining them; Rice tests coherence and explanatory power.
 - **Middle knowledge/Molinism**: God knows what free creatures would do in any circumstance (counterfactuals), enabling providential planning without coercion.
 - **Open Theism**: God knows possibilities but not settled future free acts; Rice examines pastoral motivations and theological costs.
 - Philosophical tools: modal logic, analysis of counterfactual conditionals, discussion of divine timelessness and causation.
 - Biblical and doctrinal testing: exegesis of key texts (e.g., Gen 18, Jonah, Isaiah, Romans, Matthew), and assessment of implications for election, prayer, and providence.
 - Conclusion: Middle knowledge best preserves divine omniscience and libertarian freedom while providing a plausible account of providential governance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luis de Molina.
 - Reformation and post‑Reformation: Calvin, Arminius.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents and critics of Molinism (e.g., Plantinga, Craig), Open Theists (e.g., Pinnock, Sanders), and analytic philosophers working on counterfactuals.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes: omniscience, omnipotence, immutability/timelessness.
 - Providence and predestination.
 - Human freedom and moral responsibility.
 - Theological method: Scripture, reason, and philosophical theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Rice centers theology on a solution that safeguards **both God's comprehensive knowledge and genuine human freedom**, arguing that an appropriately formulated middle‑knowledge account best harmonizes biblical theism with libertarian moral agency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear, pedagogical mapping of positions with sustained attention to the logic of counterfactuals of freedom.
 - Practical theology emphasis: relates abstract models to prayer, providence, and pastoral intuition.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges compatibilist reductions of freedom as incompatible with moral responsibility.
 - Critiques Open Theism for weakening divine omniscience and traditional doctrines of providence.
 - Identifies weaknesses in naive simple‑foreknowledge accounts (insufficient explanatory purchase for providence).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rigorous defense of **counterfactuals of freedom** as coherent and theologically serviceable.
 - Nuanced distinctions among God's kinds of knowledge: natural, middle, and free knowledge, emphasizing their role in divine deliberation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued as a clear, accessible entry to contemporary debates on foreknowledge; used in evangelical and some mainline training contexts.
 - Cited by defenders of Molinism and by scholars seeking a balanced critique of Open Theism and strict determinism.
 - Criticized by some for reliance on contested metaphysical claims about counterfactuals and divine temporality.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, systematic toolkit for teaching the foreknowledge/free‑will problem.
 - Functions as a dependable survey plus positive proposal useful for classroom debate and curriculum on providence and freedom.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Foreknowledge** - God's knowledge of future states; central problem is its compatibility with free will.
- **Omniscience** - exhaustive divine knowledge; Rice treats scope and modalities (knowing of all truths, including counterfactuals).
- **Libertarian free will** - freedom defined by genuine alternative possibilities; Rice aims to preserve this against determinism.
- **Compatibilism** - view that divine determinism is compatible with moral responsibility; treated and critiqued.
- **Simple foreknowledge** - God simply knows future free acts without determining them; evaluated for coherence.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism)** - God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (what free creatures would do in any circumstance); presented as Rice's favored reconciliation.
 - Sub‑note: distinguishes **natural knowledge** (what God knows independent of decree) and **free knowledge** (what God knows after decree).
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - conditional statements about what a person would freely do under hypothetical circumstances; philosophically crucial and defended as intelligible.
- **Open Theism** - view that future free choices are not fully knowable; Rice examines theological costs of restricting divine knowledge.
- **Providence** - how God governs history; analysis of how each model affects providential explanation.
- **Divine timelessness/atemporality** - treated as a background metaphysical issue that bears on how God knows temporal events.
- **Moral responsibility** - theological ethics hinge; used as a test case for acceptability of reconciling views.
- **Modal logic** - analytic tool employed to clarify necessity, contingency, and possibility in theological claims.
- **Counterfactual dependence** - relation Rice uses to explain how God can foresee without causally determining.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for explaining middle knowledge and counterfactuals within systematic theology texts.
 - As a **polemic** against strict compatibilism and Open Theism - useful in apologetic and confessional debates.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for reading providence texts and shaping pastoral perspectives on prayer and human responsibility.
