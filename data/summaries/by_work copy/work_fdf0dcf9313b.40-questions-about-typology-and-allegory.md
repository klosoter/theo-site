### TITLE
40 Questions About Typology and Allegory - Mitchell L. Chase

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/ Reformed conversation on biblical interpretation. The work appears in a Q&A format aimed at pastors, students, and informed laity responding to modern disputes between literal-historical exegesis, redemptive-historical typology, and older allegorical tendencies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Typology is a legitimate, bounded hermeneutical practice rooted in redemptive history and Scripture's own promise-fulfillment patterns; it must be distinguished from arbitrary or speculative allegory while avoiding a sterile literalism that misses Christological fulfillment.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - The book frames the issue as 40 targeted questions spanning definitions, methodology, exegetical tests, and pastoral application.
 - It first defines typology and allegory, then develops **criteria** for valid types (historicity, divine intention or promise, congruence with New Testament fulfillment, and canonical fit).
 - It evaluates classic and disputed examples (Adam/Christ, Passover/Eucharist, Jonah/Jesus, David as a type of Christ), applying the criteria.
 - It offers practical rules for preachers and teachers: how to argue typologically without eisegesis, and how to use types in catechesis and sacramental theology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** The book dialogues implicitly and explicitly with patristic allegorists (e.g., Origen), medieval/early modern typological tradition, Reformation critics of allegory (e.g., Calvin), and modern interpreters in the redemptive-historical vein (following Vos, Geerhardus Vos-like patterns, and contemporary evangelical scholars).
- **Doctrines treated:** Hermeneutics, revelation and Scripture authority, Christology (fulfillment motif), soteriology (typological signs of saving action), covenant theology (recurring covenantal patterns), sacraments and ecclesiology (use of typology in preaching and liturgy).
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is that typology, rightly bounded by historical-grammatical and canonical criteria, is a necessary and theologically fruitful means of seeing Christ as the fulfillment of Israel's story without collapsing into arbitrary allegory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents a compact, question-driven method for testing purported types rather than offering only abstract theory.
 - Emphasizes a **promise-fulfillment nexus**: typology is valid where earlier persons/events are intentionally oriented toward divine promises realized in Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects the excesses of classical allegory (free symbolic reading) by insisting on historical anchors and canonical confirmation.
 - Pushes back on strict literalists who dismiss typology entirely; argues typology complements historical-grammatical exegesis when constrained by clear tests.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulates practical **tests for typological validity** (e.g., textual signals, New Testament citation, theological coherence, covenantal continuity).
 - Clarifies a working distinction between legitimate "foreshadowing" and illicit "spiritualizing."
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Used modestly in evangelical classrooms, seminaries, and pulpit training as a concise corrective to both spiritualizing allegory and anti-typical reductionism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Durable as a compact catechetical and pedagogical tool for pastors and students learning to apply typology responsibly in preaching and theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology:** The interpretive practice of reading persons/events in Israel as prefigurations that find fulfillment in Christ and the new covenant.
- **Allegory:** A method that reads texts as purely symbolic with correspondences often independent of historical or authorial intention; treated as suspect when untethered to textual or canonical markers.
- **Type / Antitype:** 
 - *Type:* Precursor event/person in redemptive history. 
 - *Antitype:* The corresponding fulfillment in Christ or the church.
- **Promise-fulfillment nexus:** The requirement that typological reading be anchored in divine promises and their realization.
- **Historical-grammatical method:** The foundational exegetical approach that typology must not override; typology supplements rather than replaces it.
- **Christocentrism:** Reading Scripture with Christ as the interpretive center-balanced, not eisegetical.
- **Canonical approach:** Using the New Testament and the canon's shape to confirm typological readings.
- **Spiritualizing:** Illicit method that detaches meaning from historical context; contrasted with responsible typology.
- **Analogy of faith:** The test of theological coherence across Scripture applied to typological claims.
- **Textual signals for types:** Explicit NT citations, fulfillment language (e.g., "so also"), or covenantal continuity.
- **Foreshadowing:** A weaker term indicating anticipatory resemblance without full typological status.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic:** Reading Scripture as a unified unfolding of redemption with recurring patterns culminating in Christ.
- **Literal sense vs. typological sense:** Distinction emphasized - typology reads fulfilled sense without denying original literal meaning.
- **Eisegesis (warning):** The practice typology must avoid; the book gives criteria to prevent it.
- **Pastoral-sacramental use:** Guidelines for applying typology in preaching and observing sacraments without speculative inference.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Serves as a concise definitional reference and set of tests for typology in hermeneutics courses.
 - Functions as a polemic against both unchecked allegory and anti-typological literalism; a practical exegetical model for preaching and covenantal theology.
