### TITLE
**Jonathan Edwards, Miscellanies (notebooks)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Ongoing private theological notebooks spanning c. 1722-1758, written amid New England Puritan-Reformed orthodoxy, the Enlightenment, and the Great Awakening; posthumously published in the Yale Works. Functioned as a workshop for later treatises (Freedom of the Will, Original Sin, End for Which God Created the World).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Not a single thesis but a developing, integrative vision: God's ultimate end is the communication of his own glory, perceived as beauty, ordering decrees, providence, sin, and redemption in a Christocentric, Trinitarian teleology.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Teleology of glory:** God's end governs all means; creation is the emanation of divine fullness; moral government displays attributes in harmony.
 - **Aesthetic metaphysic:** Beauty as consent or proportion of being to being; true virtue as benevolence to being in general; sin as the contrary, a contracted self-love.
 - **Providence and permission:** Strong decree with purposive permission of sin for greater manifestations of holiness, justice, and mercy; compatibilist moral necessity.
 - **Christological center:** Speculation on the fittingness or certainty of the incarnation even absent the fall; Christ as the archetype in whom creation is summed.
 - **Covenant and headship:** Adam as federal head; union with Christ as new head; eschatology as consummate consent and joy in God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics (Ames, Turretin), Puritan divines (Owen); engagement with Arminian and moralist critics (e.g., Whitby, Taylor); philosophical background from Locke, occasional reference to Leibnizian best-world talk, and a Newtonian-inflected account of order.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and the senses of the heart; Trinity as archetype of consent and love; creation and providence; decree, election, and reprobation; hamartiology and original sin; Christology and the incarnation's teleology; soteriology and union; eschatology and glory.
- **Closing line:** The notebooks converge on this center of gravity: the triune God glorifies himself by communicating his excellency in Christ to creatures brought to a consenting, participatory beauty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Beauty and consent** as master-concepts unifying metaphysics, ethics, and soteriology.
 - **Emanation and communication** of divine fullness as creation's rationale.
 - **Compatibilist necessity** grounding responsibility in dispositions and motives.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **libertarian freedom** and bare permission; insists on purposive divine willing that secures certain outcomes without coercion.
 - Nuances **best possible world** claims by locating goodness in fitness to God's end, not in creaturely maximal aggregate.
 - Leans toward a **Christocentric teleology** of creation that can support an incarnation irrespective of the fall, contrasting some Thomist lines while echoing Scotist intuition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Being in general**, **true virtue**, **consent**, **excellency**, **new sense of the heart**, **moral necessity**, **fitness** as cross-loci pivots.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Seedbed for the **New Divinity** (Hopkins, Emmons) on decrees, virtue, and the uses of sin in providence.
 - Modern retrievals in Reformed and evangelical theology on **God's glory** (e.g., doxological teleology) and in analytic theology on **compatibilism** and **permission of evil**.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A map of Edwards's system in formation, offering precedents, arguments, and categories for teaching hamartiology, providence, election, and Christology together under a teleological-aesthetic frame.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Being in general:** The totality of created being as the proper object of benevolence; contrasts with private, self-referential good.
- **Excellency:** The divine beauty perceived in harmonious consent of perfections; the intrinsic attractiveness of God.
- **Consent (or harmony):** The fitting proportion by which beings correspond; the moral form of love; sin is dis-consent.
- **True virtue:** Disposition of benevolence to being in general grounded in love to God; distinguishes natural from spiritual goodness.
- **Moral necessity:** Certainty of choice arising from strongest motive and disposition; compatible with responsibility.
 - Contrasts with metaphysical necessity, which would remove contingency of created acts.
- **Divine decree:** Comprehensive, wise determination of ends and means, including permissive willing of sin for holy ends.
- **Permission of sin:** Not bare non-prevention but ordered, purposive allowance that secures displays of justice and mercy.
- **Federal headship:** Adam and Christ as covenantal representatives; structures original sin and redemption.
- **Communication of God's fullness:** Creation and redemption as God's self-gift; frames providence and eschatology.
- **Fitness or meetness:** The criterion by which God orders means to end; proximate analog to best-world talk.
- **New sense of the heart:** Regenerated perception of excellency in divine things; epistemic key to spiritual knowledge.
- **Incarnation irrespective of the fall:** Christ as summative end of creation; speculative but recurrent theme.
- **Proportion and beauty:** Aesthetic grammar for doctrine, ethics, and church order.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a conceptual and argumentative source in Nature And Origin Of Sin, especially on self-love, federal headship, and privation vs positive inclination.
 - As a compatibilist and teleological model in Divine Foreknowledge Providence And The Problem Of Evil, grounding purposive permission and display-of-glory theodicy.
 - As a Christological and teleological prompt in What If Adam Had Not Sinned, supplying arguments for the fittingness of an unfallen incarnation.
 - As a decretal framework in Divine Decrees Election And Reprobation, unifying ends-means order, unconditional election, and asymmetry of reprobation.
