### TITLE
**Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae** (Compendium of Didactic and Elenctic Theology) - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th-century Reformed orthodoxy at the Academy of Geneva; post-Reformation scholastic method serving confessional Protestantism amid polemics with Rome, Socinians, Remonstrants, Anabaptists, and Lutherans.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To set forth a comprehensive, Scripture-normed system of theology that is both didactic (positive) and elenctic (polemical), defending Reformed doctrine by precise distinctions, careful exegesis, and ordered disputation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Principia:** God as principium essendi; Scripture as principium cognoscendi; reason ministerial under revelation.
 - **Doctrine of God and Trinity:** Simplicity, immutability, attributes; one essence, three persons; eternal generation and procession.
 - **Decree and Providence:** Eternal, wise, free, definite decree; compatibilist freedom; concursus with secondary causes; infralapsarian ordering.
 - **Creation and Anthropology:** Creation ex nihilo; image of God as knowledge, righteousness, holiness; covenant of works; original sin and immediate imputation.
 - **Christology and Soteriology:** Two natures, one person; states and offices of Christ; penal substitution; active and passive obedience; definite atonement (sufficient for all, efficient for the elect); effectual calling, faith as instrument, justification by imputed righteousness, adoption, sanctification, perseverance.
 - **Covenant Theology:** Pactum salutis; covenant of works; covenant of grace administered through promises, law, and sacraments.
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacraments:** Marks of the church; ministerial office; two sacraments; paedobaptism; real spiritual presence in the Supper; rejection of transubstantiation and consubstantiation.
 - **Eschatology:** Intermediate state; resurrection; last judgment; eternal reward and punishment; rejection of purgatory and chiliastic millennialism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture foremost; Augustine, Aquinas, Lombard; Calvin, Beza, Junius, Polanus, Ames; polemics with Bellarmine (Rome), Socinus and the Racovians, Arminius/Episcopius, Anabaptists, and Lutheran scholastics on ubiquity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation/Scripture, God and Trinity, decrees, creation/providence, anthropology, Christology, soteriology, covenant, church/sacraments, last things.
- **Closing line:** A school of precision serving piety: theology from Scripture, through covenant and Christ, to the worship and consolation of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Didactico-elenctic method:** Positive exposition coupled with targeted refutation via quaestio, thesis, objections, and replies.
 - **Fine-grained distinctions:** Will of God (decretive/preceptive), necessity (of consequence vs of the thing), freedom (spontaneity vs indifference).
 - **Federal structure:** Pactum salutis grounding the covenant of grace; robust covenant of works with promise of eschatological life.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against Rome: Scripture's autopistos authority; justification by imputation; two sacraments; rejection of merit de condigno and purgatory.
 - Against Socinians: Trinity, satisfaction, penal substitution, Christ's deity, miracles, and the immortality of the soul.
 - Against Remonstrants: Unconditional election, particular redemption, total depravity with moral inability, effectual calling, perseverance.
 - Against Lutherans (selected points): Denial of ubiquity of Christ's human nature; affirmation of extra Calvinisticum; spiritual, not corporeal, presence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of **archetypal/ectypal** theology; principia essendi/cognoscendi; immediate imputation; active/passive obedience; concursus.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical for Reformed scholasticism; standard text in Geneva and beyond; shaping federal and confessional theology; key resource in modern Reformed retrievals.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models careful exegesis tied to system; supplies tested distinctions across loci; offers a comprehensive polemical map for doctrinal clarity and catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Didactic/Elenctic:** Positive instruction coupled with polemical refutation.
- **Principium essendi / cognoscendi:** God as ground of being; Scripture as ground of knowing in theology.
- **Autopistos (self-authenticating) Scripture:** Scripture bears its own authority; the Spirit witnesses internally.
 - Distinguishes autographa (inerrant originals) and apographa (faithful copies) under providential preservation.
- **Archetypal/Ectypal theology:** God's self-knowledge vs accommodated knowledge granted to creatures; guards humility and method.
- **Infralapsarianism:** Order of decrees with election from the fallen mass; affirms divine sovereignty without making God author of sin.
- **Concursus:** God's concurrence with secondary causes; preserves contingency and responsibility.
- **Libertas spontaneitatis (not indifferentiae):** Human freedom as voluntary choice consistent with moral nature; compatible with necessity of consequence.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** Adamic probation with promised life; postlapsarian covenant grounded in Christ, received by faith.
- **Pactum Salutis:** Intra-trinitarian counsel establishing Christ as mediator and head of the elect.
- **Immediate imputation:** Adam's guilt reckoned to his posterity; corruption also conveyed, preserving both guilt and depravity.
- **Active and Passive obedience of Christ:** Fulfillment of the law and bearing of penalty both imputed for justification.
- **Extra Calvinisticum:** The Logos is not circumscribed by the human nature; upholds true two-nature Christology.
- **Sacramental union; signs and seals:** Visible signs instrumentally exhibit and confirm grace; spiritual real presence in the Supper.
- **Analogia fidei:** Scripture interprets Scripture within the rule of faith; doctrinal coherence governs exegesis.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definition source for key Reformed distinctions (freedom, imputation, covenant).
 - As a polemical handbook against Roman, Socinian, Remonstrant, and Lutheran errors.
 - As an exegetical and methodological model for reading Scripture with scholastic clarity.
 - As a conceptual pivot connecting Trinity, Christology, covenant, and salvation in a unified system.
