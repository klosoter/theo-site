### TITLE
Andy Crouch - Relevant Christianity Today essays on **Vocation, Dominion, and the Cultural Mandate** (selected CT pieces synthesizing themes later developed in Culture Making)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-2000 evangelicalism wrestling with postmodern culture, technology, and the waning power of institutional Christianity; CT pieces aimed at pastors, lay leaders, and cultural-engaged evangelicals. Reflects Crouch's move from journalism to public theology.
- **Central thesis:** Christians are called to exercise **dominion** not as domination but as skilled, humble stewardship - a vocation to make, cultivate, and sustain culture that honors God and the imago Dei.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modern evangelical responses split between retreatist piety and triumphalist political strategies; both misunderstand power and vocation.
 - Theological reframe: return to Genesis mandate read through imago Dei - human calling is creative stewardship (culture-making), not mere exploitation or withdrawal.
 - Practical prescription: cultivate institutions, practices, and vocations (arts, business, technology, family, church) as arenas of faithful creativity; redistribute and reform power toward enabling practices.
 - Pastoral implications: formation, apprenticeship, and habit-shaping matter more than policy rhetoric; vocation is a primary site of discipleship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** biblical witness (Genesis, wisdom literature, New Testament ethics); interlocution with evangelical culture-war rhetoric, secular technocracy, and earlier Reformed emphases on vocation (Kuyperian echoes), plus cultural critics (artists, technologists).
- **Doctrines treated:** creation (including imago Dei), providence, vocation, ethics (power and stewardship), ecclesiology (church as vocation formation), and implicit eschatology (kingdom as inaugurated stewardship).
- **Closing line:** Theology of vocation that reframes the cultural mandate as **practiced, humble, creative stewardship** - shaping human flourishing by cultivating creation, institutions, and persons rather than seizing power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **skillful making** and institution-building (arts, craft, tech, business) as theological work equal to ministry.
 - Recasts dominion-language into a moral grammar of **cultivation** and stewardship rather than domination.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on both pietistic withdrawal and politicized triumphalism; criticizes simplistic "culture-war" strategies as theologically and practically inadequate.
 - Offers a corrective to readings of Kuyper that collapse vocation into mere sphere-sovereignty by stressing formative practices and relational power.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Distinguishes modes of power: **power-over (domination)** vs **power-to/create and power-with (enabling)** - theological grounding for non-coercive cultural influence.
 - Treats vocation as the central theological category for ethics and public engagement rather than only ecclesial or doctrinal identity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received among evangelicals seeking a positive public theology; influenced pastors, church-planters, Christian entrepreneurs, and academics interested in public faith.
 - Adopted in curricula on vocation, cited in debates on Christians in arts and business; some critics call it insufficiently structural about systemic injustice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable bridge between biblical theology and cultural practice; useful for theological formation, church teaching, and vocational discipleship programs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Vocation:** calling of believers in all spheres; primary locus of discipleship and cultural engagement.
- **Dominion / Cultural Mandate:** mission to steward and cultivate creation; read as cultivation, not domination.
- **Imago Dei:** theological foundation for human creativity, responsibility, and dignity in cultural work.
- **Culture-making:** practical arts of forming practices, institutions, and artifacts that sustain human flourishing.
- **Power-over vs power-to / power-with:** ethical taxonomy distinguishing coercive control from creative, enabling authority.
- **Stewardship:** responsibility for created goods, institutions, and persons entrusted to human care.
- **Common grace:** framework for locating non-Christian cultural goods as legit objects of stewardship and cooperation.
- **Institutions:** practices and structures (schools, businesses, media, churches) as sites of vocational theological action.
- **Formation / apprenticeship:** means of cultivating vocational virtues and habits; emphasis on practice over propositionalism.
- **Neighbor / public good:** vocation oriented beyond individual success toward communal flourishing.
- **Creativity (arts, craft, tech):** elevated as theological acts, not peripheral hobbies.
- **Eschatological orientation (inaugurated kingdom):** cultural work done in faithful hope, not utopian triumphalism.
- **Power ethics:** normative framework for when and how Christians may exercise authority.
- **Practice theology:** emphasis on embodied habits and institutions rather than abstract policy alone.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical vocational theology and for reinterpreting the cultural mandate.
 - As a **polemic** against triumphalist culture-war tactics and passive pietism, steering churches toward formation and creativity.
 - As an **exegetical model** reading Genesis and Scripture through vocation and stewardship rather than dominion-as-conquest.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula on faith & work, public theology, and Christian engagement with arts and technology.
