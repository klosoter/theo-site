### TITLE
The Good God (sections on Adam and federal headship) - Michael Reeves

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Anglican theological writing (21st century). Reeves writes pastorally for church and academy, within a broadly Reformed/covenantal milieu that seeks to recover classical doctrine for the church today.
 - Moves within renewed interest in covenant theology, the doctrine of creation, and debates over original sin and representation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Adam functions as *federal representative* (federal head) whose vocation, failure, and resultant consequences must be read against God's goodness and covenant ordering; Christ as the true representative (second Adam) reverses Adam's condemnation by imputed righteousness.
 - The problem addressed: how to hold both divine goodness and the judicial imputation of Adam's sin without collapsing into moralism, Pelagianism, or a depersonalized collectivism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Sketches Adam's created vocation as image-bearing, kingly/servant headship and covenantal stewardship.
 - Explains the nature of federal headship: representative agency, covenantal bond between head and people, and the judicial reality of imputation.
 - Connects Adam's fall to the ruined status of humanity (loss of original righteousness) and the need for a representative savior.
 - Presents Christ as the obedient, faithful second Adam whose righteousness is reckoned to believers, restoring what Adam forfeited.
 - Emphasizes God's goodness as the interpretive key: divine ordering, covenant justice, and merciful provision in Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed and patristic tradition underlying the doctrine (Augustine, Calvin, Westminster formulations).
 - Contemporary evangelical debates over imputation, corporate personality, and individual moral responsibility.
 - Engages biblical texts implicitly and explicitly (Genesis 1-3, Romans 5) and counters modern individualism and therapeutic cultural readings of sin.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (image of God, original righteousness), hamartiology (original sin), covenant theology (covenant of works/covenant of grace), soteriology (imputation, justification), Christology (Christ as second Adam), and divine attributes (especially goodness and justice).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Reeves locates federal headship within the framework of God's ordering goodness: Adam's representative failure explains our need and Christ's representative faithfulness effects our restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reads federal headship through the theological lens of **God's goodness** (not merely juridical logic), making covenantal ordering pastoral and teleological.
 - Stresses Adam's vocational role (steward, image-bearer, royal-servant) rather than reducing him to a mere abstract head for imputation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects individualistic and moralistic misreadings that privatize sin and ignore corporate representation.
 - Distinguishes from crude collectivist accounts by maintaining individual responsibility alongside corporate representation.
 - Pushes back against purely metaphysical accounts (seminal headship alone) by affirming the covenantal, representational reality emphasized in classical Reformed formulations.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts federal headship more relationally and vocationally - representation as stewardship under God's good ordering.
 - Frames imputation within the economy of covenantal justice and mercy so it reads pastorally rather than merely forensic.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in Reformed-evangelical circles for clarity and pastoral warmth; used in preaching, small-group teaching, and introductory doctrinal courses.
 - Influences contemporary conversations on how to integrate classical doctrines of sin and representation with pastoral ministry.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, workable synthesis of covenantal, biblical, and pastoral emphases that aids teaching on origins, sin, and Christ's representative work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal headship** - Adam as representative who legally/relationally binds his descendants to his covenantal standing.
- **Imputation** - The reckoning of Adam's sin (and Christ's righteousness) to others; theological explanation for corporate guilt and grace.
- **Original sin** - The fallen condition inherited by humanity, loss of original righteousness and corrupted will.
- **Original righteousness** - The created status of Adam as image-bearer; what was forfeited in the fall.
- **Covenant of works** - The divine arrangement under which Adam's obedience would secure life for his progeny.
- **Covenant of grace** - God's merciful covenant fulfilled in Christ, the second Adam, who secures restoration.
- **Second Adam** - Christ as the faithful representative whose obedience and righteousness are imputed to believers.
- **Representative / vocational headship** - Focus on Adam's stewardship, kingship, and relational authority as the texture of representation.
- **Forensic vs. relational language** - Reeves balances legal categories (condemnation, justification) with relational/covenantal categories (bond, stewardship).
- **Corporate personality / corporate solidarity** - The theological anthropology that explains how one person's act can bind many within covenant structures.
- **Divine goodness** - Serving as the hermeneutical key: God's ordering, justice, and gracious provision shape interpretation of headship and imputation.
- **Anthropology of image-bearing** - Grounds human dignity and vocation that were marred by Adam's fall.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for teaching federal headship in accessible, pastoral terms.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology, creation doctrine, and soteriology - especially useful in sermons on Genesis and Romans.
 - As a **polemic** against individualism and reductionist accounts of sin while avoiding abstruse scholasticism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-3 and Romans 5 within a covenantal and pastoral framework.
