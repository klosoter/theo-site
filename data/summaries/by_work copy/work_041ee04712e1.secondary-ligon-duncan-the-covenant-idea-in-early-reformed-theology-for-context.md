### TITLE
**Secondary: Ligon Duncan, "The Covenant Idea in Early Reformed Theology"** - summarized and indexed by John Ball for the Covenant Theology in Reformed Tradition file. Focus: development and function of covenantal thought in 16th-17th-century Reformed theology and its confessional legacy.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑20th/early‑21st century retropsective study of early Reformed sources (Calvin, Bullinger, Beza, Ursinus, Olevianus, Heidelberg tradition, English and Dutch Reformed writers).
 - Part of a broader revival of covenantal studies in contemporary Reformed scholarship; addresses confessional and pastoral applications.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The covenant concept functions as the formative organizing principle in early Reformed theology - shaping soteriology, sacramentology, ecclesiology, and law/ gospel relations - but its articulation varied and was refined over time from biblical exegesis into systematic doctrines (notably the covenants of works and grace).
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical tracing: how biblical exegesis and pastoral catechesis produced a covenantal vocabulary in Reformed circles.
 - Analytical move: shows covenant as mediational framework - relations between God and humanity are described in covenantal categories (promises, conditions, signs, mediators).
 - Systematic move: links covenant idea to key Reformed doctrines - Christ as covenant mediator, federal headship, sacramental signs as covenant seals.
 - Clarificatory move: distinguishes early formulations from later scholastic precisions (e.g., emergence of explicit "covenant of works" language).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin, Heinrich Bullinger, Zacharias Ursinus, Caspar Olevianus, Theodore Beza, confessions (Heidelberg, Westminster), selected English and Dutch Reformed divines.
 - Interlocutors: medieval scholastic contractarian models, Roman Catholic criticisms, and later antithetical readings (e.g., dispensationalists).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology broadly (covenant of works, covenant of grace)
 - Christology (mediatorship and federal headship)
 - Soteriology (promise/fulfillment and covenantal application)
 - Sacramentology (signs and seals; baptism as covenant sign)
 - Ecclesiology (covenant community, membership, catechesis)
 - Scripture and revelation (covenant as hermeneutical key)
- **Closing line**
 - Duncan locates the theological center of early Reformed thought in a covenantal vision that orders revelation, redemption, and the church - historically variegated but theologically cohesive in making covenant the grammar of Reformed doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats covenant not merely as a legal contract but as relational, promissory, and sacramental - a comprehensive framework for piety and polity.
 - Emphasizes pastoral and catechetical origins of covenant language (catechisms, sermons) alongside scholastic treatment.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on readings that reduce Reformed covenant language to mere juridical federalism or later scholastic abstractions.
 - Distinguishes early Reformed nuance from subsequent systematic codifications (e.g., exact formulation of covenant of works appears gradually).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the covenant as a hermeneutical key rather than merely a doctrinal locus; highlights continuity across loci rather than isolated doctrines.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in modern Reformed curricula and confessional recovery movements; used to argue for confessional fidelity to covenantal structure in preaching, catechesis, and sacramental practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies historical development and theological coherence of covenant ideas, making it a valuable teaching tool for both historical theology and systematic construction in Reformed contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - relational bond between God and people defined by promises, obligations, and signs; central hermeneutical category.
- **Covenant of Works** - prelapsarian arrangement between God and Adam; discussed as an early Reformed construct that becomes explicit over time.
- **Covenant of Grace** - God's eternal promise of salvation in Christ; the primary structure for Reformed soteriology.
- **Federalism (federal headship)** - the concept that representative heads (Adam, Christ) bear responsibilities and benefits for their respective parties.
- **Mediator** - Christ as the appointed one who fulfills covenant obligations and secures covenant promises.
- **Sign and Seal (Sacramentality)** - baptism and the Lord's Supper function as visible signs and seals of covenant promises and membership.
- **Typology / Promise‑Fulfillment** - interpretive method linking Old Testament covenants and institutions to Christ and the New Covenant.
- **Law and Gospel (Covenantal relation)** - law understood as covenant stipulation and gospel as covenant promise; relation clarified within covenant framework.
- **Covenant Community / Church** - the people constituted by covenant membership; polity and discipline flow from covenant principles.
- **Ratification / Administration** - how covenants are enacted and administered publicly (e.g., sacraments, vows, oath language).
- **Conditions / Obligations** - covenantal duties (obedience, faith) and their place alongside forensic declarations.
- **Seals of Promise** - the function of sacraments as assurance of promised benefits.
- **Catechesis and Pastoral Usage** - the practical medium through which covenant theology entered lay consciousness.
- **Confessional Formulation** - how covenantal language is codified in confessions and catechisms.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for covenant theology's scope and grammar in Reformed studies.
- As a **polemic tool** against reductive readings (scholastic legalism, dispensational separations).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture typologically and covenantally.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching confessional soteriology, sacramentology, and ecclesiology.
