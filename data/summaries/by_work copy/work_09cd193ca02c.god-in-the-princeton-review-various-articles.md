### TITLE
"God" in The Princeton Review (various articles) - Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century Old Princeton (Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review), confessional Presbyterianism.
 - Intellectual milieu: Scottish Common Sense Realism, anti-speculative posture against German Idealism, Transcendentalism, Unitarianism, and early higher criticism; interlocution with rising Darwinism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian God is the self-existent, personal, immutable, simple, omniscient, holy, and triune Creator and covenant Lord, known chiefly by Scripture. Theology is an inductive science from revealed facts; natural theology confirms but cannot supply gospel knowledge.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Sources and method: Scripture as principium cognoscendi; reason ministerial, not magisterial.
 - Existence and attributes: classical theism; anti-pantheist defense of personality.
 - Trinity: one essence, three persons; biblical-grounded Nicene orthodoxy.
 - Creation and providence: ex nihilo, concursus, miracles as extraordinary providence.
 - Covenant: works and grace as modes of divine condescension, grounding federal headship.
 - Anthropology and sin: image of God, original righteousness, Adamic headship.
 - Christology: two natures, one person; mediator reveals God and secures penal substitution.
 - Poles of engagement: rebuttals of Schleiermacher, Hegel, Taylor (New Haven), Bushnell, Strauss, De Wette; later critique of Darwinian naturalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive: Augustine, Calvin, Turretin, Westminster Standards; Reid, Hamilton, Butler; Hengstenberg; Princeton colleagues A. Alexander, J. A. Alexander, W. H. Green.
 - Critical: Schleiermacher, Hegel, Cousin, Unitarian divines, N. W. Taylor, Bushnell, Strauss, De Wette; Darwin as emblem of atheistic naturalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology: inspiration (verbal-plenary), authority, perspicuity, sufficiency; analogia fidei.
 - Trinity and attributes: simplicity, immutability, impassibility, sovereignty, foreknowledge.
 - Covenant theology: works and grace; federal representation; divine condescension.
 - Creation and anthropology: imago Dei, creation ex nihilo, providence, freedom and decree.
 - Christology and atonement: anhypostasia-enhypostasia implicitly; communicatio idiomatum; penal substitution over against governmental theories.
- **Closing line**
 - Center of gravity: the sovereign, triune God freely reveals himself in Scripture and acts covenantedly in creation and redemption; fidelity means submitting reason to revealed facts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Theology as an inductive science from biblical data; Scripture as storehouse of facts.
 - Strong defense of divine personality against pantheism and Absolute-idea metaphysics.
 - Robust classical attributes with careful use of analogy to preserve simplicity.
 - Covenant as mode of divine condescension without implying change in God.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Schleiermacher: revelation over feeling-of-dependence; doctrine precedes piety.
 - Against Hegelianism and Transcendentalism: rejects a becoming Absolute or immanentist identity.
 - Against Unitarian/Sabellian readings: affirms consubstantial trinitarian persons.
 - Against New England Theology: rejects moral government atonement; upholds federal headship.
 - Against Darwinism: identifies reductive naturalism with practical atheism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Methodological deployment of common-sense realism and the facts of consciousness.
 - Inductive method in theology; analogical predication to guard Creator-creature distinction.
 - Tight linkage of covenantal categories to theology proper without compromising immutability.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Normative within Old Princeton; formative for American Presbyterianism and evangelical classical theism.
 - Utilized by A. A. Hodge, Warfield, and Machen; later critiqued by neo-orthodoxy for rationalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear doctrinal criteria; sturdy trinitarian and attribute formulations.
 - Pedagogically strong polemics; integrative framework across loci grounded in Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity (self-existence)**: God is of himself, underived; grounds all creaturely dependence.
- **Simplicity**: No composition in God; attributes identical with essence; avoids reifying properties.
- **Immutability and impassibility**: No change in being, decree, or passions; anthropopathisms read analogically.
- **Personality of God**: Intellect, will, and holiness in perfection; rejects impersonal Absolute.
- **Trinity**: One essence, three persons; eternal generation and procession; anti-Socinian, anti-Arian, anti-Sabellian.
- **Revelation and inspiration**: Special revelation culminates in Scripture; verbal-plenary; sufficiency and perspicuity.
- **Theology as inductive science**: Systematizing biblical facts under the Spirit; reason serves revelation.
- **Natural theology**: Real but subordinate; design and causality arguments; cannot yield saving knowledge.
- **Creation ex nihilo and providence**: Free act; concursus; miracles as extraordinary acts within divine plan.
- **Covenant of works/grace**: Divine condescension structuring relation to Adam and to Christ; federal headship.
- **Image of God**: Rational-moral capacities and original righteousness; marred, not erased, by sin.
- **Divine sovereignty and foreknowledge**: Comprehensive decree; compatibilist freedom; prayer and means affirmed.
- **Christological union**: One person, two natures; mediator reveals God; penal substitutionary atonement.
- **Analogy and anthropomorphism**: Predication neither univocal nor equivocal; safeguards transcendence.
- **Anti-pantheism**: Persistent refutation of identity theories and immanentist collapse of Creator-creature distinction.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source for attributes, Trinity, and covenant formulations.
 - Polemical touchstone against Unitarianism, pantheism, higher criticism, and naturalistic evolution.
 - Exegetical model for gathering and coordinating biblical data.
 - Conceptual pivot linking bibliology to theology proper, creation, anthropology, and Christology.
