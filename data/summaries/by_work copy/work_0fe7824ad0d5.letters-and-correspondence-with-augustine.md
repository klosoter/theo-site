### TITLE
Letters and Correspondence with Augustine - Prosper of Aquitaine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Mid-5th century Gallic/Western Church (c. 420s-450s). Prosper, a layman of Aquitaine, becomes a chief advocate for Augustine's theology in Gaul after Augustine's letters and treatises circulate. The correspondence is set against the **Pelagian controversy** and the rise of what later is called **Semi-Pelagianism** (notably associated with John Cassian and certain Gallic bishops/monks).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To defend and systematize Augustine's doctrines of **original sin, prevenient and efficacious grace, and predestination**, and to repel Pelagian and semi-Pelagian attempts to ground the beginning of salvation in human initiative.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Exchange of letters that combine pastoral appeals, theological argument, and canonical/legal advice. Major moves:
 - Affirmation that **all good begins with divine grace**; human will requires prevenient grace even to will to will the good.
 - Rejection of any theory that locates the first movement toward God solely in unaided human freedom (the semi-Pelagian tendency).
 - Defense of Augustine's formulations about predestination and reprobation insofar as they safeguard grace against Pelagianism.
 - Practical guidance to Gallic bishops and clergy on episcopal responses, synodal action, and baptismal practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Augustine (principal correspondent and theological exemplar), John Cassian (principal target in semi-Pelagian debate), Gallic bishops and monasteries, local synods, Pelagius and Pelagian proponents as background antagonists.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Grace** (prevenient, efficacious, sufficient), **free will** (liberum arbitrium), **original sin**, **predestination/reprobation**, **baptism**, **merit and cooperation** (cooperatio), pastoral/episcopal authority.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Prosper's letters aim to secure that salvation is initiated and guaranteed by God's free, efficacious grace, thus defending Augustine's anti-Pelagian trajectory and shaping Western reception of Augustinianism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Systematic popularization and extension of Augustine's language in a Gallic context; sharper insistence on **grace as the necessary first cause** of any salvific act. Prosper often uses practical pastoral tones to translate Augustine's theology into episcopal policy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Direct correction of John Cassian and his interpreters who insisted upon a genuine human first-move in conversion. Prosper identifies and contests the "middle path" that would give the will an initiating role apart from grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Early explicit polemical framing of "semi-Pelagian" tendencies (though the formal label develops later). Uses contrastive pairs-**gratia praeveniens** (prevenient grace) vs. human spontaneity; **gratia efficax** vs. mere sufficient grace-to clarify controversies.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Influential among later Western theologians who appealed to Augustine: formed part of the patrimony cited at the Council of Orange (529) and extensively used by medieval and Reformation theologians defending strong views of grace and predestination. Catholic theology later nuances Prosper's strictest formulations but recognizes his role in shaping anti-Pelagian consensus.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - A concise, pastorally engaged record of early Augustinian apologetics; indispensable for understanding how Augustinian theology moved from North Africa to Gaul and how the Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian disputes were concretely managed by church leaders.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prevenient grace (gratia praeveniens):** grace that precedes any human assent and is necessary to enable even the desire for God.
- **Efficacious grace (gratia efficax):** grace that effectively brings about the salvation-prompted act it intends (not merely sufficient in possibility).
- **Sufficient grace (gratia sufficiens):** grace that could be effective if accepted-distinguished by Prosper from efficacious grace in polemic against human-initiated salvation.
- **Predestination (praedestinatio):** God's eternal election to salvation; Prosper defends Augustine's strong predestinarian thrust while engaging pastoral consequences.
- **Reprobation:** the counterpart doctrine concerning those not elected; Prosper affirms divine freedom but is careful against deterministic misreadings that render God the author of sin.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale):** universal corruption of human nature post-Fall; central to the need for prevenient grace.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium):** retained by Prosper but reinterpreted: will is real yet unable to initiate salvation without prior grace.
- **Cooperation (cooperatio):** human response made possible by grace; Prosper stresses cooperation is enabled, not initiated, by human agency.
- **Pelagianism:** doctrine denying the necessity of prevenient grace; Prosper opposes it vehemently.
- **Semi-Pelagianism:** term for positions attributing the initial step to the human will; Prosper is among the earliest critics of such positions.
- **Baptism (esp. infant baptism):** discussed as means entwined with original sin and grace-Prosper defends normative infant baptism as grounded in Augustinian logic.
- **Pastoral/polemical letter:** genre form-Practical theology applied to ecclesial governance and doctrinal correction.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **polemic** source against Pelagianism and semi-Pelagian tendencies. 
 - As a **secondary definitional witness** for Augustinian formulations on grace and predestination. 
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** showing application of doctrine to episcopal decision-making and synodal practice.
