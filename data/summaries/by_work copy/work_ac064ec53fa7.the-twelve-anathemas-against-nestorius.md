### TITLE
The Twelve Anathemas (Against Nestorius) - Cyril of Alexandria

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 430s CE; composed in the lead-up to and milieu of the Council of Ephesus (431).
 - Part of the Alexandrian theological response to Antiochene Christological emphases and the teachings associated with Nestorius and Theodore of Mopsuestia.
 - Polemical and conciliar atmosphere: ecclesiastical politics between Alexandria and Antioch, imperial involvement, urgent attempt to define Christological language for the church.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To repudiate any teaching that separates Christ into two subjects or persons such that the divine and human operate in distinct, non-united subjects.
 - To assert the real, personal union (hypostatic union) of the Word and the human nature in one single subject - the incarnate Word - and to defend calling Mary Theotokos.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Twelve anathemas: successive condemnations of specific Nestorian propositions or implications.
 - Each anathema targets a formulation that purportedly makes Christ two hypostases, or refuses to ascribe actions/affections rightly to the one Person.
 - Emphasis on scriptural, patristic, and soteriological grounds: only a united subject effectually redeems and mediates salvation.
 - Key moves:
 - Deny that the human nature of Christ is an independent subject separate from the Logos.
 - Insist that the Word truly became flesh (Logos sarx) and that properties and acts properly belong to the one Person.
 - Uphold Theotokos as necessary to guard the unity of the incarnate Person.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary target: Nestorius (Patriarch of Constantinople) and readings from the Antiochene school, notably Theodore of Mopsuestia.
 - Alexandrian tradition appealed to: usage of Athanasius, earlier Christological vocabulary developed in Alexandria.
 - Conciliar actors: Cyril, John of Antioch (as rival/confirmer later), the imperial court as arbiter.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (principal): person, nature, incarnation, communicatio idiomatum.
 - Indirectly touches Trinity (by defending the identity of the divine subject), soteriology (how unity secures redemption), and Mariology (Theotokos).

- **Closing line**
 - The Twelve Anathemas compress Cyril's theological center: the incarnate Word is one hypostasis whose unity is the necessary ground for true redemption; to deny that unity is to fracture salvation and must be anathematized.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Relentless focus on the *subject* (hypostasis) of redemptive acts rather than merely on parallel natures; rhetorical force in anathematizing error.
 - Uses the motif of salvific necessity - only a single, personal subject can unite mediation and suffering.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Antiochene tendencies that stressed moral/functional distinction of natures to the point of personhood (Nestorianism).
 - Contrasts with more dyophysite exegesis by insisting on the communicative nexus between divine and human in one hypostasis.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Consolidates language about the hypostatic union that later councils and theologians would deploy.
 - Paves the way for the later "mia physis tou Theou Logou sesarkomene" formulations (though Cyril's language is debated and later contested).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Decisive influence at the Council of Ephesus; instrumental in Nestorius's condemnation.
 - Adopted and developed by Eastern Orthodoxy; later read both as orthodox exemplar and as a source of controversy in Monophysite/Miaphysite debates.
 - In Western/Reformed traditions: used as a principal patristic witness against Nestorian bifurcation of personhood and as an early support for communicatio idiomatum.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of concise conciliar polemic that ties Christology tightly to soteriology.
 - Valuable for teaching the person-nature problem, the sacramental logic of union, and the ecclesial stakes of doctrinal language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostasis** - the personal subject; Cyril insists the incarnate subject is the one Logos who assumes human nature.
- **Physis (nature)** - Cyril treats human and divine natures as real, but united in one hypostasis in the incarnate Word.
- **Person / Prosopon** - used to identify the subject who acts and suffers; central to opposing a two-person Christ.
- **Theotokos** - "God-bearer"; defended as the right title for Mary because the one born is the God-incarnate Word.
- **Hypostatic Union** - the doctrine at stake: real, personal union of divine and human in Christ; the work's cited topic.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - the communication of properties: Cyril argues that properties of both natures can be predicated of the one Person.
- **Anthesis / Anathema** - conciliar condemnations; Cyril's anathemas function as doctrinal boundary markers.
- **Logos sarx (Word made flesh)** - expression emphasizing the incarnation as real and determinate in one subject.
- **Subject of acts** - Cyril's phraseology for the necessity that one subject accomplishes redemption.
- **Nestorianism** - the target label for teachings that separate Christ's personhood; explained negatively by Cyril's anathemas.
- **Monophysitism / Miaphysitism (later relation)** - later movements that will appropriate or react to Cyril's language about unity; not Cyril's intent but historically connected.
- **Soteriological necessity** - shorthand for Cyril's argument that unity of Person is essential for effective salvation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for early Christian Christology and for establishing vocabulary about hypostasis vs. nature.
- As a **polemic exemplar** against Nestorian bifurcation and in later debates about personhood and communion of properties.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Gospel texts about the acts and titles of Christ in light of a single personal subject.
