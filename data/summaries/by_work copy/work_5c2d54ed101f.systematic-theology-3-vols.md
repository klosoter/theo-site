### TITLE
Systematic Theology (3 vols.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context:** Classic confessional Reformed theology in a post-Reformation, Protestant-orthodox idiom; often associated with Old School Presbyterian and federal scholastic retrieval against Enlightenment rationalism, rising liberalism, and higher criticism.
- **Central thesis / problem:** How the triune God is known through Scripture and covenants, and how redemption accomplished by Christ is applied by the Spirit to sinners, yielding a coherent, churchly doctrine that is at once exegetical, confessional, and catholic in scope.
- **Core structure (typical 3-vol. arc):**
 - **Vol. I: Principia and God.** Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, inerrancy, canonicity), attributes and works of God, Trinity, decree, creation, providence.
 - **Vol. II: Man and Christ.** Anthropology, image of God, covenant of works, fall and original sin, person of Christ (two natures, communicatio idiomatum), states and offices.
 - **Vol. III: Salvation, Church, Last Things.** Atonement, ordo salutis (calling to glorification), union with Christ, justification and sanctification, perseverance, church and sacraments, civil polity, eschatology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:**
 - **Sources:** Scripture as principium cognoscendi; ecumenical creeds; Reformed confessions (e.g., Westminster); Augustine, Athanasius; Aquinas on nature/grace and divine attributes; Calvin, Beza; Reformed scholastics (Turretin, Witsius).
 - **Interlocutors:** Rome (authority, merit), Socinians (Trinity, atonement), Arminians (grace, election), Rationalists/Higher critics (revelation), Liberal Protestantism (experience-centered theology).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation/Bibliology; Theology Proper and Trinity; Creation/Providence; Anthropology and Sin; Christology; Soteriology (atonement, justification, sanctification, perseverance); Ecclesiology and Sacraments; Eschatology; Covenant Theology throughout.
- **Center of gravity:** God sovereignly relates to creation by covenant; Scripture normatively reveals this economy; Christ mediates redemption federally and personally, applied by the Spirit to the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** 
 - **Federal triad:** Covenants of redemption, works, and grace as the backbone of redemptive history.
 - **Strong Bibliology:** Plenary verbal inspiration, inerrancy, perspicuity, sufficiency; analogy of faith as hermeneutic.
 - **Forensic soteriology with union:** Imputation within union with Christ; justification by faith alone alongside progressive sanctification.
 - **Classical theism:** Simplicity, immutability, impassibility, aseity; decree and providence articulated with concursus.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** 
 - Against **Rome:** Scripture as supreme norm; rejection of condign merit; two sacraments; definitive, once-for-all satisfaction by Christ.
 - Against **Arminianism:** Unconditional election, definite atonement in intent, effectual calling, perseverance of the saints.
 - Against **Socinian/liberal revisions:** Nicene and Chalcedonian dogma; penal substitution; historical reliability and authority of Scripture.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves:** Principia of theology (essendi/cognoscendi); ordo salutis distinctions; active/passive obedience; federal headship; law/gospel distinction; communicatio idiomatum carefully delimited; covenant as unifying category.
- **Reception and influence:** Standard seminary reference in Reformed circles; benchmark for evangelical doctrines of Scripture and justification; widely cited in polemics and catechetical instruction; engaged critically by neo-orthodox and contemporary analytic theology.
- **Enduring value:** Doctrinal clarity, canonical synthesis, confessional alignment, and didactic order; a stable map for preaching, catechesis, and system-building.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plenary verbal inspiration:** Spirit superintends authors so that words are God-breathed; grounds inerrancy.
- **Inerrancy / infallibility:** Scripture true in all it affirms; cannot fail in purpose.
- **Perspicuity and sufficiency:** Essential saving truths are clear; Scripture contains all things necessary for faith and life.
- **Analogy of faith/Scripture:** Interpret Scripture by Scripture; clearer texts govern the obscure.
- **Covenant of works:** Prelapsarian covenant with Adam promising life upon perfect obedience; basis for federal headship and law principle.
- **Covenant of grace:** Post-fall administration of salvation by promise through Christ, unfolding through the epochs to fulfillment in the New Covenant.
- **Covenant of redemption (pactum salutis):** Intra-trinitarian counsel to redeem the elect; undergirds definite atonement and missions.
- **Federal headship and imputation:** Adam and Christ as representatives; guilt and righteousness reckoned to their people.
- **Union with Christ:** Spirit-wrought bond in which all benefits are shared; logical fountainhead of ordo salutis.
- **Atonement (penal substitution):** Christ bears penalty due to sin, satisfying divine justice; includes active/passive obedience.
- **Justification vs. sanctification:** Forensic declaration based on imputed righteousness vs. transformative holiness by the Spirit.
- **Concursus and providence:** Divine concurrence with creaturely causes without confusion or compulsion; preserves sovereignty and responsibility.
- **Divine simplicity and immutability:** God is not composed and does not change; stabilizes doctrine of attributes and decree.
- **Original sin / total depravity:** Corruption and guilt inherited from Adam; pervasive inability apart from grace.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Definition source:** Standard definitions for Scripture, covenant, justification, Trinity.
 - **Polemic:** Citations in debates with Roman Catholic, Arminian, and liberal positions.
 - **Exegetical model:** Proof-text method tethered to canonical synthesis and confessional norms.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Covenant and union with Christ as integrating frameworks across doctrines.
