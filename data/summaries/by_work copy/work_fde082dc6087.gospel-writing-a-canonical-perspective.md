### TITLE
Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective - Francis Watson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century New Testament scholarship; conversation with the revival of canonical criticism (Brevard Childs et al.), literary/narrative approaches, and renewed debates over historical Jesus methodology.
 - Positioned against dominant strands of form- and source-critical reconstruction and engages contemporaries working on evangelist identity, genre, and reception (e.g., Richard Bauckham, Richard Hays, narrative critics).
- **Central thesis**
 - The Gospels are best read and understood as canonical writings: theologically shaped narrative texts whose final forms, reception in the church, and canonical function must be primary for interpretation. Gospel writing is a theological act situated within the canonical trajectory of Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Articulates a methodological shift from reconstructing hypothetical pre-texts or a putative "historical Jesus" to close attention to the Gospels as finalized, ecclesially authorized documents.
 - Demonstrates how literary form, intertextual engagement with the Hebrew Scriptures, and theological shaping converge in the final form of each Gospel.
 - Argues that canonical reading preserves both historical sensitivity and theological authority, enabling a reading that respects apostolicity and ecclesial use without capitulating to reductive source skepticism.
 - Explores implications for genres, authorial claims, and the relation between text, tradition, and community reception.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with canonical critics (Brevard Childs), narrative and literary critics, historiographical skeptics (historical-Jesus scholars), and proponents of eyewitness testimony theories (e.g., debate with strands of Bauckham).
 - Dialogue with historical-critical traditions (form and redaction criticism), and with recent exegetical projects integrating Old Testament intertextuality.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as narrative revelation centered on Christ), Christology (portrayal of Jesus within canonical narratives), authority and apostolicity (basis and function of Gospel canonicity), hermeneutics (final-form reading), and tradition/reception (how church usage shapes meaning).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Gospel writing is a canonical-theological practice: the Gospels are authoritative narrative theologies whose final forms, ecclesial reception, and scriptural intertextuality determine their theological and interpretive priority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of the final canonical form over hypothetical source reconstructions for theological and interpretive purposes.
 - Emphasis on the Gospels as intentionally theological compositions embedded in the scriptural canon rather than as raw repositories of unprocessed historical data.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges the modern scholarly tendency to treat the Gospels primarily as collections of traditions to be de-layered; proposes that such deconstruction often misses the theological logic of the final text.
 - Distinguishes from both maximalist historical reconstructions and minimalist skepticism by defending a canon-informed historiography that preserves critical rigor.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "gospel writing" as a canonical act-writing that participates in the shaping of Scripture-rather than mere reportage or compilation.
 - Stresses "canonical reading" as methodologically decisive for theological interpretation and ecclesial appropriation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Appreciated in circles advocating canonical and theological readings of Scripture; influential for scholars seeking bridges between historical criticism and theological hermeneutics.
 - Provoked critique from both strict historical-critical scholars (who see it as downplaying source-critical necessity) and some conservative quarters (who worry about historical relativization), yet widely used in theological exegesis and preaching scholarship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for integrating literary, theological, and canonical concerns; useful for preachers, systematic theologians, and exegetes seeking to read the Gospels as Scripture rather than solely as historical witnesses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canonical criticism / canonical perspective**
 - Reading texts in light of their final form and ecclesial function within Scripture.
- **Final form**
 - The text as received and used by the community; decisive for meaning and theology.
- **Gospel writing**
 - The act and product of composing evangelic narratives that function as canonical proclamation.
- **Intertextuality**
 - The Gospels' theological weaving of Hebrew Scripture motifs and texts to shape Christological claim.
- **Apostolicity**
 - The claim and criterion tying Gospel authority to apostolic origin and reception.
- **Genre (Gospel as narrative theology)**
 - The Gospels as theological narratives, not simply biographies or chronologies.
- **Form- and redaction-criticism (critique)**
 - Watson critiques their exclusive priority while retaining their insights where they illuminate composition and tradition.
- **Historical Jesus vs. canonical Jesus**
 - Distinguishes reconstructive historical aims from the theological, canonical portrait presented by the Gospels.
- **Reception history / ecclesial use**
 - The church's appropriation and reading of the Gospel texts as integral to meaning and authority.
- **Hermeneutical canonical priority**
 - The methodological claim that interpretation should begin with and be governed by the canonical text.
- **Theological exegesis**
 - Reading that attends to doctrinal articulation embedded in narrative form.
- **Authority (textual and ecclesial)**
 - How canonical status confers normative interpretive weight and shapes doctrinal reading.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for canonical approaches to Gospel studies and hermeneutics.
 - As a polemic resource against reductionist historical-critical reconstructions emphasizing pre-texts over final form.
 - As an exegetical model for sermon preparation, theological interpretation, and integrating Old Testament-New Testament intertextuality.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking New Testament scholarship with systematic theological concerns about revelation, Christology, and scriptural authority.
