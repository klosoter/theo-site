### TITLE
Theoretical-Practical Theology, Vol. 4: Redemption in Christ - Petrus van Mastricht

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th-early 18th century Dutch Reformed scholasticism. Mastricht (1630-1706) writes as pastor-theologian reacting to Remonstrant (Arminian) challenges, Cartesian philosophizing, and confessional controversies. The work is part of a didactic multi-volume Theoretico-Practica aiming to unite dogmatics and piety.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To demonstrate biblically and systematically that redemption is accomplished in Christ objectively (satisfaction, atonement) and applied subjectively (union, faith, sanctification), grounded in the eternal covenant between Father and Son (pactum salutis) with Christ as federal head.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of Christ's person (hypostatic union) as prerequisite for saving work.
 - Legal and covenantal account of the atonement: necessity of satisfaction, Christ's penal substitution, and the nature of his obedience (active and passive).
 - Federal framework: the pactum salutis as the eternal agreement determining Christ's mediatorial work and his role as covenant head.
 - Application of redemption: union with Christ, imputation of righteousness, justification, and consequent sanctification and assurance.
 - Practical loci: pastoral implications for assurance, preaching, sacraments, and Christian life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (extensive exegesis), Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics (Voetius, Cocceius tensions), and polemical responses to Remonstrants/Arminians, Socinians, and Roman Catholic claims.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (pactum salutis), Christology (two natures, offices), soteriology (atonement, satisfaction, imputation, justification, sanctification), union with Christ, Trinity (ad intra/ad extra relations insofar as they bear on redemption), sacramental application.
- **Closing line:** Mastricht centers redemption on the eternal covenantal pact and Christ's federal headship, insisting that sound doctrine and fervent piety are inseparable: God's salvific plan is covenantal in origin, Christ is the appointed surety, and believers receive salvation by union and imputation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm, classical insistence on the **pactum salutis** as the metaphysical-covenantal ground of Christ's mediatorship, articulated with scholastic precision but pastoral purpose.
 - Balanced treatment of **Christ's twofold obedience** (active and passive) with careful legal-theological categories (satisfaction, merit, imputation).
 - Integration of rigorous systematic proofs with practical applications-doctrine always aimed at sanctification and pastoral assurance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against Arminian undermining of definite election and the federal link between Christ and the elect; rejects Socinian moralistic atonement models.
 - Moderates extremes in Voetian/Cocceian controversies: loyal to Reformed confessions while engaging methodological disputes (e.g., covenant language and chronology).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precision in the use of "pactum salutis" to bind pretemporal decree, mediatorial appointment, and soteriological necessity into one coherent doctrine.
 - Clear deployment of juridical language (law, debt, satisfaction) married to covenantal relational language (surety, headship).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly regarded within conservative Reformed circles as a model of learned pastoral theology; influenced later continental and British Reformed teachers.
 - Rediscovered in modern confessional renewals for its synthesis of doctrine and piety and its robust covenantal framework.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Teaches students how to argue classic Reformed soteriology with Scripture, historical theology, and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Serves as a touchstone for discussions on pactal formulations of redemption and the loci where doctrine bears on life and ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum salutis (covenant of redemption):** Eternal agreement between Father and Son determining Christ's mediatorial role; grounds the atonement and federal representation.
- **Christ as covenant head / federal headship:** Christ legally represents the elect; his obedience and sufferings are accounted to them.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's fulfilling of the law in life, meriting righteousness to be imputed.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death as penal satisfaction for sin.
- **Satisfaction / penal substitution:** The juridical payment of guilt by Christ, satisfying divine justice; central to Mastricht's atonement account.
- **Imputation:** The forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers (and of sin to Christ in his sufferings).
- **Union with Christ:** The instrumental ground of application-faith unites sinner to Christ so his benefits become theirs.
- **Justification:** Declarative act based on imputed righteousness; distinguished from sanctification as covenantal consequence.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive moral renewal resulting from union and Spirit-work, treated practically.
- **Hypostatic union:** Christ's two natures united in one person, necessary for the efficacy of his work.
- **Merits of Christ:** Value accrued by Christ's obedience and suffering, applied to the elect by covenantal promise.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral emphasis tied to objective foundations (pact, promises, sacraments) and subjective signs.
- **Covenantal chronology:** Distinguishes pretemporal covenant agreements from economic outworking in history.
- **Federalism vs. individualism:** Mastricht emphasizes federal relations (headship, surety) over purely individualistic soteriology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed terms (pactum salutis, federal headship, imputation).
 - As a **polemic model** against Arminian, Socinian, and Roman Catholic accounts of atonement.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for relating doctrinal loci (Christology, covenant, soteriology) to preaching, sacraments, and assurance.
