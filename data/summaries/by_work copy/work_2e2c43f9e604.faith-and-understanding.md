### TITLE
**Faith and Understanding** (Glauben und Verstehen) - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Interwar and postwar German Protestant theology; Marburg school; essays spanning c. 1920s-1950s, translated mid-20th century.
 - Situated between dialectical theology and existential philosophy; shaped by historical criticism and the crisis of modernity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can the New Testament gospel, expressed in mythic-cosmological language, address modern persons truthfully? Answer: through **demythologizing** and **existential interpretation**, so that faith becomes obedient self-understanding before God in the eschatological Word.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - The NT proclaims an event, not a doctrine: the **kerygma** of the crucified-and-raised Christ as God's decisive address.
 - Myth must be interpreted, not discarded: its intent is to speak of human existence before God; demythologizing renders this intent intelligible.
 - Faith is not assent to propositions or ancient cosmologies but **decision** (Entscheidung) evoked by the Word that frees from inauthentic existence.
 - History vs. historicity: the saving reality is encountered as an existential event in proclamation, not as a manageable object of Historie.
 - Church and sacraments serve the Word; their meaning is realized as obedient response in the community.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Influences: **Luther** (justification, Word), **Kierkegaard** (decision, offense), **Heidegger** (existential analysis), History-of-Religions school.
 - Dialogue/contrast: **Barth** and Brunner (revelation, objectivity), **Dibelius** and form criticism, **Cullmann** and **Pannenberg** (Heilsgeschichte), **Kasemann** (eschatology), postwar hermeneutics.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology:** Word of God as event in proclamation; Scripture as apostolic witness requiring interpretation.
 - **Soteriology:** justification by faith as liberated self-understanding; sin as inauthentic existence; grace as eschatological power.
 - **Christology:** functional and kerygmatic focus; resurrection as proclamation-event rather than a provable historical datum.
 - **Pneumatology:** Spirit as the power of the eschatological Word creating faith and community.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** church as community of hearing; sacraments as enactments bound to the Word, not metaphysical mechanisms.
 - **Covenant / Law-Gospel:** law exposes inauthenticity; gospel grants new existence; promise-fulfillment read existentially rather than as salvation-history continuum.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: **God's eschatological address in the kerygma creates understanding in faith**, freeing persons for authentic obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Demythologizing** without reduction to secular ethics; recovery of myth's existential intent.
 - **Event-language** for revelation: Word as happening, not deposit.
 - Sharp distinction between **Historie** (objectifying history) and **Geschichtlichkeit** (existential historicity).
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against liberal historicism: the gospel is not verified by neutral history.
 - Against dogmatic objectivism: revelation is not a static thing but God's present address.
 - Against salvation-history schemes: resists linear Heilsgeschichte as objective proof; insists on existential encounter.
 - Against sacramental realism and biblicist inerrancy: prioritizes the Word's address over metaphysical accounts and infallibilism.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Pre-understanding** (Vorverstandnis) in exegesis; the interpreter's situatedness.
 - **Faith as obedience** and decision; **self-understanding** as soteriological category.
 - **Existential hermeneutics** applied to biblical texts via form criticism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked robust debate with Barthians and salvation-history theologians; significant for hermeneutics (Gadamer-era), NT studies, and the New Quest for the Historical Jesus.
 - In Reformed circles: often a foil; yet appropriated for hermeneutical self-critique and Word-centered proclamation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forces clarity on what we claim when we say Scripture is God's Word.
 - Models culturally aware translation of apostolic witness without capitulating to naturalism.
 - Offers precise tools to distinguish proclamation from cosmology and to read law/gospel existentially.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologizing (Entmythologisierung):** Interpreting mythic language to disclose its existential claim rather than discarding it.
- **Kerygma:** The apostolic proclamation in which Christ encounters hearers as Lord.
- **Existential interpretation:** Reading texts for their claim on human existence before God.
- **Decision (Entscheidung):** Faith as obedient response created by the Word.
- **Authenticity / Inauthenticity:** Modes of existence; sin as self-reliant inauthenticity overcome by grace.
- **Historie vs. Geschichtlichkeit:** Objectifiable past versus lived historicity where saving encounter occurs.
- **Word as event (Ereignis):** Revelation occurs as God's address, not as information alone.
- **Pre-understanding (Vorverstandnis):** The interpreter's horizon shaping exegesis; requires critical reflection.
- **Justification by faith:** Freedom from self-justification; receiving new self-understanding in Christ.
- **Resurrection as proclamation:** Easter as the eschatological meaning disclosed in witness, not a provable datum.
- **Spirit:** The power of the kerygma effecting new life and community.
- **Law and gospel:** Law exposes bondage; gospel grants eschatological freedom now (Heute).
- **Form criticism (Formgeschichte):** Method for discerning Sitz im Leben of texts, serving hermeneutics.
- **Heilsgeschichte (salvation history):** Critiqued as objectifying; reinterpreted via existential encounter.
- **Self-understanding (Selbstverstandnis):** Soteriological transformation of the person under the Word.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a conceptual pivot for hermeneutics and proclamation-centered **Bibliology**.
 - As a foil or resource in **Soteriology** (faith, justification) and **Christology** (kerygma-centered).
 - To recalibrate **Ecclesiology & Sacraments** around Word-event rather than metaphysics.
 - To challenge or refine **Covenant/Heilsgeschichte** frameworks with existential-exegetical rigor.
