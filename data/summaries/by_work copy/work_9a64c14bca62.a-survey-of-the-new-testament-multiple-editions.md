### TITLE
A Survey of the New Testament (multiple editions) - Robert H. Gundry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th to early 21st century evangelical scholarship; written as a seminary/undergraduate textbook situated in the tradition of grammatical-historical exegesis and conservative evangelical theology. Responds to rising historical-critical and sociological readings (including the New Perspective on Paul).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Provide an accessible yet exegetically disciplined introduction to each New Testament book while defending traditional evangelical readings-especially classical forensic justification-against revisionist readings such as the New Perspective on Paul (NPP).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Book-by-book introductions: authorship, date, provenance, purpose, structure, key verses.
 - Exegetical synopsis: pericope summaries, theological themes, and pastoral implications.
 - Thematic treatments: recurring attention to soteriology, Pauline theology, and the interpretation of "works of the law."
 - Polemical threads: sustained critiques of NPP readings of Paul and defense of forensic imputation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Critical interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright (NPP proponents).
 - Standard historical-critical and evangelical commentators; frequent appeal to early church readings and classical Reformation categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (central), imputation, Pauline soteriology, covenant language, Christology, atonement (forensic emphasis), righteousness (dikaiosyne), law and works, ecclesiology and eschatology in summary.
- **Closing line:** An evangelical, exegetically grounded NT survey that systematically defends traditional forensic imputation of righteousness and critiques covenantal/communal re-readings advanced by the New Perspective on Paul.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Explicit and repeated defense of **forensic imputation** as the correct locus of Paul's doctrine of justification.
 - Strong commitment to grammatical-historical exegesis while remaining readable as a survey text.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against NPP's reframing of "justification" as primarily covenantal/relational status (covenantal nomism).
 - Counters readings that downplay legal/forensic language in Paul by stressing traditional semantic ranges of dikaiosyne and logizomai.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precision in distinguishing **forensic declaration** (imputation) from **transformative** or **relational** accounts of justification.
 - Frequent pairings of exegetical detail with doctrinal consequence to make theological commitments explicit.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical colleges and seminaries as a dependable survey; respected for clarity and pedagogy.
 - Criticized by NPP advocates as defending anachronistic Reformation categories; nevertheless influential as a counterweight.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model for integrating textual exegesis with doctrinal application; valuable for instructors who want a conservative exegetical baseline and for students studying debates over justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Gundry treats as primarily **forensic** - a legal declaration by God that the believer is righteous on account of Christ.
- **Forensic imputation:** The imputing (crediting) of Christ's righteousness to believers; central explanatory mechanism for salvation in Gundry's reading.
- **Imputation vs. impartation:** Distinguishes the **legal reckoning** (imputation) from **moral transformation** (impartation), affirming both but prioritizing imputation for Pauline soteriology.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP):** Summarized and critiqued; Gundry rejects NPP's move to recast "works of the law" as boundary markers rather than works meriting righteousness.
- **Covenantal nomism:** Labeled as inadequate when used to overturn forensic readings; Gundry argues covenant language in Paul does not obviate forensic categories.
- **Works of the law:** Understood by Gundry primarily in relation to soteriological merit and the law's role in human inability, not merely ethnoreligious boundary maintenance.
- **Dikaiosyne (righteousness):** Interpreted with attention to legal-judicial senses in Paul alongside relational senses; asserts semantic weight for divine declaration.
- **Logizomai / reckoning:** Key Pauline verb for crediting righteousness; Gundry emphasizes classical "counting/crediting" usage.
- **Faith (pistis):** Treated as the instrumental means by which imputed righteousness is received; differentiated from works as ground or meritorious cause.
- **Law (nomos):** Discussed both as revelation leading to condemnation and as a teacher toward Christ; Gundry resists reductive sociological accounts.
- **Penal substitution / atonement:** Often affirmed as consistent with forensic imputation; Gundry treats substitutionary aspects as integral to Pauline soteriology.
- **Covenant:** Used but not as a replacement for forensic categories; covenant language interacts with justification without eliminating the legal declaration.
- **Exegetical model:** Gundry consistently models close textual analysis that yields doctrinal conclusions rather than theological imposition.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical formulations of forensic justification and imputation.
 - As a **polemic** and counter-resource against New Perspective readings in Pauline studies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating book surveys with doctrinal synthesis in classroom settings.
