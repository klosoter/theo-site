### TITLE
The Puritans: Their Origins and Successors (1987) - Martyn Lloyd-Jones

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th-century evangelical retrieval: Welsh Reformed preacher Lloyd-Jones surveys 16th-17th century Puritanism for a contemporary Protestant audience.
 - Written from a pastoral-theological standpoint amid renewed interest in revival, holiness, and the Spirit in postwar evangelicalism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Puritans represent a coherently Reformed, biblically rooted movement that fused rigorous doctrinal orthodoxy with intense experiential religion; their model is urgently corrective to both liberal rationalism and sentimental pietism in modern churches.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical sketch: origins in Reformation and Calvinist theology, development in English context.
 - Theological analysis: how Puritan doctrine produced distinct spiritual practices (preaching, personal piety, pastoral care).
 - Practical application: retrieval of Puritan pastoral methods and spiritual disciplines for revival and sanctification today.
 - Implicit critique of subsequent movements that either secularize doctrine or privatize experience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary Puritan authors emphasized: John Owen, Richard Sibbes, William Perkins, John Bunyan, Thomas Goodwin, Rutherford, and earlier Calvinist influences.
 - Interlocutors: Latitudinarians, Arminians, pietists, and later evangelical/charismatic trends; Lloyd-Jones reads Puritans against these.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Emphasis on conversion, assurance, justification, sanctification, union with Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, preaching, pastoral theology, and covenantal piety.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Puritan synthesis: doctrinal fidelity to sovereign grace married to Spirit-wrought, heart-level holiness - a pastoral theology that insists the Spirit effects both justification and progressive sanctification through faithful preaching and discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Lloyd-Jones highlights the Puritan insistence on *experimental* religion: doctrine must be known internally, not merely affirmed intellectually.
 - Strong pastoral orientation: theology is judged by its capacity to humble, revive, and sanctify the soul.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters Enlightenment-influenced dry orthodoxy by restoring pastoral intimacy and spiritual seriousness.
 - Distinguishes Puritan spirituality from pietistic subjectivism and from charismatic excessism; affirms Spirit-empowerment yet within scriptural, covenantal boundaries.

- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Re-introduces "experimental" as technical: experiential confirmation of doctrinal truths.
 - Reframes sanctification as the fruit of union with Christ mediated by preaching, sacrament, and Spirit, not merely moral effort or ecstatic phenomena.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in late 20th-century Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; instrumental in the neo-Puritan and pastor-training movements.
 - Influenced pastoral curricula, devotional literature, and debates over revival, assurance, and the Spirit.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a pastoral-theological manual: merges historical theology, practical ministry, and spiritual formation; valuable for preachers, pastors, and those studying sanctification and Spirit theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Puritanism**
 - A movement combining Calvinist doctrine with rigorous personal and ecclesial holiness.
- **Experimental religion**
 - The Puritan demand that doctrine be verified by inward experience and assurance.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological locus for both justification and ongoing sanctification.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive, Spirit-enabled conformity to Christ; disciplined, covenantal, and pastorally nourished.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Lloyd-Jones reads Puritanism as equating Spirit-baptism primarily with union in conversion (not necessarily a separate second blessing) (see Lloyd-Jones, The Puritans: Their Origins and Successors, 1987).
- **Spiritual gifts**
 - Understood as ordered to the building up of the church and inseparable from holiness; extraordinary gifts are recognized but subordinated to Scripture and sanctification (see Lloyd-Jones, 1987).
- **Assurance**
 - Affirms inward testimony of the Spirit as normative for confidence in salvation.
- **Mortification / vivification**
 - Twofold dynamic: mortification (putting sin to death) and vivification (growth in new life) described as Spirit-work within sanctification.
- **Preaching**
 - The primary means ordained by God for conveying both truth and Spirit-empowerment in the Puritan scheme.
- **Covenantal piety**
 - Religious life framed within covenantal obligations and means (Word, prayer, sacraments).

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "experimental religion" and Puritan soteriology in contemporary pastoral theology.
 - As a **polemic tool** against dry orthodoxy, unchecked pietism, and unregulated charismatic claims about Spirit baptism and gifts.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for integrating preaching, pastoral care, and discipleship in studies of sanctification.
