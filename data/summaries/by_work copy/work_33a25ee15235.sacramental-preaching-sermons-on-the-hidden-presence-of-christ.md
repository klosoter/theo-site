### TITLE
Sacramental Preaching: Sermons on the Hidden Presence of Christ - Hans Boersma

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary, early 21st-century contribution to the ressourcement and liturgical-revival currents within broadly Reformed/Anglo-Catholic theology.
 - Responds to modern homiletical tendencies that separate proclamation from sacrament and that prioritize information over encounter.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Preaching is properly sacramental: it is a liturgical, enacted means by which the hidden presence of Christ is mediated to the faithful. The work addresses the problem of a "bare" propositional preaching model that divorces Word and Sacrament and so occludes Christ's real (though mediated) presence.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - The sermon collection models sacramental preaching and argues for its theology through sermonic practice plus theological reflection:
 - Critique of purely informational or therapeutic sermon styles that leave listeners cognitively informed but spiritually unenchanted.
 - Retrieval of patristic and medieval accounts of sacramentality to show continuity with a pre-modern sacramental imagination.
 - Reformed retrieval: engagement with Calvinian "spiritual real presence" as a corrective to both nominalism and purely symbolic readings.
 - Practical homiletical implications: preaching should shape sacramental imagination, prepare for Eucharist, and function as an ecclesial rite (anamnesis, epiclesis, proclamation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic witnesses (implicitly and explicitly), medieval sacramental theology, Calvin and Reformed interpreters, contemporary homileticians and liturgists.
 - Converses with modern secularizing tendencies in preaching and with sacramental critics in both Protestant and liberal circles.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Word and sacrament, Eucharistic presence (Christology and soteriology), ecclesiology (the church as locus of mediation), liturgy and sacramental ontology.
- **Closing line**
 - Preaching, rightly practiced, is not mere information but a sacramental vocation: a liturgical means by which the hidden Christ becomes present to and formative of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that preaching itself is sacramental - not only the sacraments of baptism and Eucharist - and thus that sermons participate in the economy of presence rather than only in didactic transmission.
 - Recovery of a metaphysic of mediation: signs do not merely point; they effect and participate in the reality they signify.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects modern homiletical models that prioritize existential relevance or psychological impact over ontological mediation.
 - Offers a middle path between memorialism (purely symbolic) and a naïve corporealism by affirming a real, hidden presence mediated by sign and Spirit (drawing on Calvinian language without capitulating to a strictly literalist corporeal presence).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the phrase **"sacramental preaching"** as both descriptive and normative: preaching that enacts presence.
 - Emphasizes the language of **hidden presence** to capture paradox: Christ is truly present but in a mediated, non-sensory way.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among pastors and theologians seeking to recover liturgical depth in preaching in Reformed and ecumenical contexts.
 - Cited as a corrective in homiletical curricula that aim to connect sermon and sacrament, and in discussions about worship renewal.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a practiced-theology model: sermons that illustrate theological claims about presence.
 - Serves as a bridge text for students and pastors wanting a theologically robust, liturgically sensitive homiletics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacramental preaching**
 - Preaching that functions as a liturgical means of grace, participating in the mediation of Christ.
- **Hidden presence**
 - Christ's real but mediated presence in Word and sacrament; present without visible corporeal manifestation.
- **Real presence (spiritual)**
 - Affirmation of real participation in Christ through sign and Spirit; positioned against purely symbolic or purely corporal accounts.
- **Sign and thing signified**
 - The sacramental relation where signs effect and embody the reality they signify; a corrective to semiotic reductionism.
- **Anamnesis**
 - Liturgical remembering enacted in sermon and sacrament; preaching helps re-member the church into Christ.
- **Epiclesis**
 - The invocation of the Spirit that makes presence effective; applied analogically to preaching's dependence on Spirit-led enactment.
- **Sacramental imagination**
 - The cultivated habit of seeing the world and worship as mediated by divine presence; pedagogical aim of sermons.
- **Performative Word**
 - The Word as act (not merely proposition): proclamation that effects what it names through ecclesial mediation.
- **Liturgical hexis / ecclesial disposition**
 - Formation of the congregation's posture and habits through repeated sacramental acts including preaching.
- **Mediation vs. immediacy**
 - Emphasizes mediated access to Christ (through signs, Word, Church) over private, immediate experiences.
- **Reformed retrieval**
 - Use of Calvinian categories (spiritual presence, union with Christ) to buttress sacramental realism in a Reformed frame.
- **Pastoral implication**
 - Preachers must prepare congregations for sacramental reception, not merely instruct them.
- **Against propositionalism**
 - Critiques preaching that reduces faith to assent to propositions without ecclesial formation.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for sacramental homiletics; as a **polemic** against purely informational preaching; as an **exegetical model** showing patristic readings that unite sermon and sacrament; and as a **conceptual pivot** in worship renewal conversations.
