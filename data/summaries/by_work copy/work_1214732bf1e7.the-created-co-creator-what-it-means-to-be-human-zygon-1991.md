### TITLE
The Created Co-Creator: What It Means to Be Human (Philip Hefner, Zygon, 1991)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in Zygon (1991) amid intensifying religion-science dialogue, the rise of bioethics, post-Darwinian anthropology, and growing concern about technology, ecology, and culture. Hefner writes as a systematic theologian engaging biological and social sciences; he is often read in mainline Protestant and interdisciplinary science-theology circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Imago Dei should be understood not primarily as a static property (rationality, soul) but as a *created vocation*: humans are creaturely co-creators with God. This reframes human identity, responsibility, and sin in relation to culture, technology, and evolutionary history.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Critique of dualistic and static accounts of human nature (soul/body split; narrow rationalism).
 - Presentation of material from biology and cultural studies to support **psychosomatic unity** and humans as symbolic, culture-making animals.
 - Theological redefinition: Imago Dei as a *role*-God creates creatures intended to participate creatively in the world (co-creation), thus grounding human uniqueness without metaphysical dualism.
 - Ethical consequences: technological responsibility, stewardship reinterpreted as co-creative vocation, and a corrective to both arrogant dominion and moral paralysis.
 - Eschatological and ecclesial implications: human creativity is oriented toward consummation under divine providence; church vocation includes formation for responsible co-creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** scientific sources on evolution and culture; longstanding theological loci (Augustine/Aquinas functional and substantive Imago Dei traditions implicitly addressed); dialogue with process and relational thinkers (e.g., Whitehead/Teilhard tendencies), and with contemporary theology of technology and ecology.
- **Doctrines treated:** theological anthropology (Imago Dei), creation and providence, sin and moral responsibility (esp. technological/collective sin), ecclesiology (formation), and eschatology (directionality of human creativity).
- **Closing line:** Hefner centers the Imago Dei as a created, vocational capacity for co-creative stewardship-humanity is both creature and agent, called to shape creation in partnership with God and accountable for the moral consequences.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Central neologism: **"Created co-creator"** - being human is a creaturely calling to co-create, not independent lordship.
 - Strong insistence on **psychosomatic unity**: no soul/body dualism; personhood is embodied, culturally enacted creativity.
 - Integrative use of evolutionary and cultural science to reconstruct a theological anthropology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects classical substantive Imago Dei readings (mind/soul as locus) and simple dominion models by relocating the image in relational, functional vocation.
 - Counters techno-utopian autonomy by insisting on creaturely limits and responsibility; counters anti-technology eco-asceticism by recognizing creative vocation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Presentation of human creativity as theologically normative and theologically accountable.
 - Use of cultural evolution and human symbolicity as theological data for the Imago Dei.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in theology-science dialogue, bioethics, and ecotheology; influential among mainline Protestant and ecumenical scholars.
 - Less uptake in conservative Reformed contexts that prefer substantive or covenantal Imago Dei readings, though useful as a conversation partner.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise, teachable framework linking Imago Dei to contemporary issues (technology, environment, genetics).
 - Durable as a bridge text for theologians, ethicists, and scientists addressing human vocation and responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Created co-creator:** Core phrase - humans are creaturely agents appointed to participate with God in shaping creation.
- **Imago Dei (functional/vocational reading):** The image of God as a role or capacity (creaturely creativity and relationality) rather than primarily an ontological property.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** Affirmation that human persons are embodied unities; theological anthropology must integrate body, mind, and culture.
- **Creativity (creaturely creativity):** The distinctive human capacity to generate culture, technologies, and symbolic worlds - the locus of co-creation.
- **Cultural/cumulative evolution:** Use of biological and cultural evolution to explain human distinctiveness without diminishing creatureliness.
- **Technological mediation:** Technology as an extension of co-creative vocation that needs ethical and theological critique.
- **Stewardship as vocation:** Dominion reframed as responsible co-creation under divine sovereignty.
- **Moral accountability/structural sin:** Attention to collective and technological forms of sin arising from misused co-creative powers.
- **Providence and eschatological orientation:** Human creativity is historically situated yet goal-directed within divine purposes.
- **Mediation of creation/ecclesial formation:** Church's role in forming persons for responsible co-creation.
- **Created limits:** Emphasis on creaturely finitude that constrains and orients human agency.
- **Bio-cultural coevolution (implicit):** Interplay of biological capacities and cultural inventions in shaping human nature.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary, vocational readings of the Imago Dei in theology-anthropology courses.
- As a **polemic/resource** against dualism and simplistic dominion models in ethics of technology and environmental theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in interdisciplinary work (bioethics, theology & science) supplying a model for integrating biological data with normative theological claims.
