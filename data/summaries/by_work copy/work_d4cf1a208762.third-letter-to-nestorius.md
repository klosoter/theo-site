### TITLE
Third Letter to Nestorius - Cyril of Alexandria (431)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in 431 during the Christological controversy between Cyril of Alexandria and Nestorius of Constantinople. Composed in the immediate lead-up to the Council of Ephesus; part of Cyril's extended epistolary campaign to expound and defend Alexandrian Christology against perceived Antiochene divisionism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the unity of the Person (hypostasis/prosopon) of the incarnate Son against Nestorian insistence on a real separation between the divine Word and the man Jesus; defend the title Theotokos and the reality of the Word's assumption of human nature.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Starts from scriptural exegesis (Gospels, Pauline texts) to show that predicates of God are ascribed to the one who suffered and died (thereby insisting on one subject).
 - Denies any real numerical or ontological separation of persons in Christ; insists that the divine Logos is truly incarnate and acts as one hypostasis.
 - Appeals to patrimony of language (Theotokos) and ecclesial tradition as corrective to speculative abstraction that separates natures into two persons.
 - Uses philosophical distinctions (ousia, physis, hypostasis, prosopon) to frame a theological solution: two natures communicatively united in one person without confusion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Direct addressee Nestorius; appeals to scripture, prior Alexandrian teachers (notably Athanasius by implication), and emerging conciliar practice; refutes Antiochene emphases on the separability of the two natures.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (background presuppositions), **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**, **Hypostatic Union**, the appropriateness of the title **Theotokos**, and the groundwork for **Communicatio Idiomatum**.
- **Closing line:** Cyril aims to show that the eternal Son truly became flesh and that all divine and human predicates are coherently and inseparably ascribable to the one incarnate Person.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the personal unity (hypostatic unity) of Christ as the decisive category for Christology; person trumps isolated attribution to nature.
 - Heavy reliance on Scripture to move from action/predicate to ontological conclusion (if God dies, the one who died is the one God united to).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct polemic against Nestorian insistence on a "conjunction" of two persons; Cyril contends that such a stance makes salvation impossible because the Savior must be one person who unites divine and human.
 - Corrects Antiochene accent on the separability of natures by emphasizing communicative attributions and the existential reality of the Word's assumption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Strategic use of hypostasis/prosopon language to insist on personal unity without collapsing the distinction of natures - a formative move toward the later Chalcedonian vocabulary.
 - Systematic application of communicatio idiomatum: attributing experiences (e.g., suffering) to the one who is both God and man.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Heavily cited at Ephesus (431) and later by both Chalcedonian and Miaphysite parties; Cyril became the touchstone for later definitions though his language was read in divergent ways.
 - Reformed and Protestant theologians have repeatedly appealed to Cyril for clear formulations of the communicatio idiomatum and the reality of the incarnation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, scripturally grounded model of hypostatic union and eternal Sonship that is indispensable for understanding post-Nicene Christology and the reception-history of Chalcedon.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** Cyril's central category - one hypostasis in which two natures are truly united; used polemically to deny two-person Christologies.
- **Theotokos:** Title defended as scriptural and theological shorthand for the Word's true assumption of human nature.
- **Prosopon / Hypostasis:** Emphasized as the personal subject; Cyril uses these to secure unity against Nestorian prosopic-duality.
- **Physis (Nature):** Two natures affirmed (divine and human) yet united without confusion in one hypostasis.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** Frequent technique - attributes proper to one nature (e.g., suffering, death) to the one Person; foundational for later formulations.
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation:** Cyril insists the Son is eternally the one who becomes incarnate; incarnation is not an adoption but an assumption of human nature by the eternal Son.
- **Nestorianism (as polemical target):** Cyril characterizes Nestorianism as illicitly dividing the person of Christ, thereby undermining redemption.
- **Chalcedonian Definition and Two Natures Doctrine:** Cyril's language is a primary antecedent; Chalcedon appeals to Cyril to articulate "one person in two natures" though later councils nuance his rhetorical formulas.
- **Ousia (essence):** Background metaphysical term informing how nature is spoken of without collapsing persons.
- **Scriptural exegesis as decisive norm:** Cyril foregrounds scriptural predication over abstract metaphysics in resolving Christological questions.
- **Reception hinge:** Cyril functions as a bridge - cited to support both Chalcedonian clarity and Miaphysite readings, making him a contested but central authority.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: foundational prior text for Chalcedonian and post-Chalcedonian christological formulations.
 - As **polemic**: standard refutation of Nestorian separationism and guard against anthropological reductions of the Son.
 - As **exegetical model**: exemplar of using Scripture to ground ontological claims about the person of Christ.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: authoritative source for the doctrine of communicatio idiomatum and the theological claim of the eternal Son's real incarnation.
