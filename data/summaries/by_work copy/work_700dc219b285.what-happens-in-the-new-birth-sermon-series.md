### TITLE
What Happens in the New Birth? (sermon series) - John Piper

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical preaching (late 20th-early 21st century). Delivered in congregational sermon form, rooted in Baptist/Reformed pulpits and circulating widely via Desiring God resources. Engages postmodern pastoral concerns about assurance and conversion in an era of decisionism and therapeutic religion.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The new birth (regeneration) is a sovereign, Spirit-wrought, effectual work by which God gives a dead sinner a new heart, enabling true faith and repentance; it is monergistic, necessary for salvation, and distinct from merely outward profession.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of key New Testament texts (notably John 3; Titus 3; Ezekiel 36) that describe being "born again" or "born of the Spirit."
 - Diagnosis: human inability (deadness in sin; inability to seek God) necessitates divine initiation.
 - Doctrine: the Holy Spirit renovates will and affections-gives new desires, sight, and faith.
 - Application: pastoral markers of regeneration (fruit, perseverance, joy in God, desire for Christ), cautions against equating profession with birth.
 - Assurance and pastoral care: how to hold together divine sovereignty and human responsibility in gospel invitations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture primary; theological tradition of Augustine, Calvin, Puritans (e.g., John Owen), and contemporary Reformed writers. Implicit polemic against Arminian/semi-Pelagian emphases, decisionist evangelism, and moralistic approaches to conversion.
- **Doctrines treated:** Regeneration (primary), effectual calling, Holy Spirit (person and work), union with Christ, faith and repentance (as gifts/fruit), election and divine sovereignty, assurance, sanctification.
- **Closing line:** The new birth is the sovereign, decisive act of the Holy Spirit that makes sinners alive to God and secures true faith and repentance as God's gifts, not human achievements.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong pastoral stress on **joy in God** as both fruit and evidence of true regeneration (consistent with Piper's Christian Hedonism).
 - Clear pastoral markers for discerning authentic new birth-inner desire for Christ and persevering love-without offering a mechanical checklist.
 - Tight linking of regeneration to effectual calling: God's internal summons that creates the capacity to believe.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against decisionism: regeneration is not mere assent at an altar call but a sovereign work antecedent to credible faith.
 - Corrects moralistic or therapeutic gospel tendencies by re-centering radical inability and divine initiative.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical neologisms, but rhetorically reinforces terms like **"new heart"**, **"dead made alive"**, and **"effectual calling"** with contemporary pastoral examples.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical contexts for teaching assurance and conversion; influential in pastoral formation and evangelism strategy within desiringGod circles.
 - Criticized by Arminian and some charismatic readers for strong monergistic framing and perceived downplaying of human assent dynamics.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Crisp homiletical model that marries rigorous Reformed soteriology with sensitive pastoral application; durable resource for preaching, discipleship, and clarifying doubts about conversion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New birth / born again:** The radical, Spirit-wrought qualitative change in a person from spiritual death to life; central phrase anchored in John 3.
- **Regeneration:** Technical term for the new birth; described as monergistic (God alone acts), instantaneous in its bestowal, and antecedent to justifying faith.
- **Effectual calling:** The internal summons of the Spirit by which God effectively brings the elect to faith; distinguished from general proclamation.
- **Monergism:** The doctrine that regeneration is the work of God alone; used to oppose synergistic or semi-Pelagian views.
- **Dead in sin:** Anthropological diagnosis-human spiritual incapacity and inability to initiate salvation or seek God without divine power.
- **New heart / circumcised heart:** Ezekiel-type language for God-given affections and inclinations toward Himself; denotes inward renewal.
- **Faith (as gift):** Faith understood largely as a gracious effect of regeneration, though accompanied by human responsibility and evidences.
- **Repentance (fruit of new birth):** Presented as the necessary, Spirit-wrought turning that follows regeneration rather than a mere human decision preceding it.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral concern; assurance is founded on the objective work of God (regeneration, scripture promises) and subjective evidences (fruit, desire for Christ).
- **Spirit's internal testimony:** The Holy Spirit's work in creating new desires and confirming adoption; helps explain experiential certainties.
- **Union with Christ:** Regeneration initiates the believer's vital union, enabling justification and sanctification to unfold.
- **Perseverance/fruit:** Indicators of authentic new birth-ongoing growth, love for God, and perseverance under trial.
- **Effectual vs general call:** Practical distinction for evangelism and soteriology-preaching is the general call; regeneration is the effectual call that accomplishes salvation.

How this work is used across loci:
- Definition source: Clear, pastoral definitions of regeneration and effectual calling for sermon preparation and catechesis.
- Polemic tool: Used to counter decisionism, semi-Pelagian conversion models, and superficial conversion indicators.
- Exegetical/homiletical model: Exemplifies faithful exposition of John 3, Titus 3, and Ezekiel 36 integrated with pastoral application.
- Conceptual pivot: Serves as a compact bridge between doctrinal soteriology and everyday pastoral concerns about assurance and gospel fruit.
