### TITLE
Confession of Christian Religion (Confessio Christianae Fidei, 1562) - Girolamo (Jerome) Zanchi

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the mid-16th century (1562) amid the consolidation of Reformed doctrine after Calvin and the controversies sparked by Trent. Zanchi, an Italian exile and Reformed teacher (Strasbourg, Bern), addresses a learned Protestant audience and ecclesiastical authorities, shaping confessional identity for Italian and Swiss circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To present a coherent Reformed confession of faith that defends and systematises the doctrine of God's eternal decrees - especially election and reprobation - while safeguarding divine justice, providence, and human responsibility against Roman Catholic, semi-Pelagian, and later libertarian objections.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Asserts the absolute sovereignty of God in creation, providence, and salvation; divine decrees are eternal, free, and efficacious.
 - Affirms **unconditional election** and the corresponding doctrine of **reprobation** as genuine parts of the single, eternal decree - not conditioned on foreseen merit or faith.
 - Distinguishes levels of God's will (decretive vs. preceptive; secret vs. revealed) to preserve both God's moral goodness and the objective reality of reprobation.
 - Frames human will as genuinely responsible yet bound by sin, with grace as effectually renewing and overcoming natural corruption.
 - Applies the doctrine pastorally: assurance for the elect, sober humility and warning for sinners, and a doctrine of providence that explains the presence of sin without making God its author.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and Calvin are primary patristic and Reform antecedents; engagement with contemporary Catholic scholastic positions (Council of Trent) and with Pelagian/Arminian-leaning tendencies; draws on biblical exegesis (especially Romans, Ephesians) and Reformed scholastic categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, God and attributes, decrees (providence, election, reprobation), Christology (atonement as effective for the elect), grace (effectual calling), human sin and freedom, assurance and perseverance.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Zanchi's Confession locates the pivot of Christian doctrine in God's eternal, free decrees - a doctrine of election and reprobation that underscores divine sovereignty while insisting on moral responsibility and pastoral assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Careful schematic distinction between the various "wills" of God (decretive vs. preceptive; secret vs. revealed) to reconcile reprobation with divine goodness.
 - Emphasis on the logical priority and coherence of the single decree: election and reprobation are not ad hoc responses but integral to God's eternal plan.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects any view that makes election contingent upon foreseen faith or works (contra semi-Pelagianism and conditional predestination).
 - More systematising and scholastic in method than Calvin's pastoral catechetical style; offers sharper categorical distinctions than some earlier Reformers.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines scholastic-Reformed vocabulary for speaking of providence, permission, and divine will distinctions, anticipating later Reformed orthodoxy's technical apparatus.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued within Reformed academic circles and Italian Reformed communities; less famous than Calvin but influential among Reformed scholastics and teachers.
 - Provided a bridge between early Reformation exegesis and later 17th-century Reformed orthodoxy (used as a reference point for debates over predestination).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models a disciplined, pastoral yet rigorous formulation of election/reprobation.
 - Useful for teaching the interaction of metaphysical divine sovereignty and ethical responsibility within Reformed theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Decretum (Divine Decree):** God's eternal, sovereign determination of all that happens, including election and reprobation.
- **Predestinatio / Election:** Unconditional choice by God to save a people; basis for assurance and particular redemption.
- **Reprobatio / Reprobation:** The decretive counterpart to election; the just ordaining of some to pass under God's judicial permission and condemnation.
- **Voluntas decretiva (Decretive Will):** God's eternal, hidden will by which he decrees outcomes.
 - Contrasted with **voluntas praeceptiva** (preceptive/revealed will), God's law and command for human obedience.
- **Providentia (Providence):** God's preserving governance that orders events to ends, permitting sin without causally authoring it as a moral evil.
- **Gratia efficax (Effectual Grace):** Grace that inevitably achieves its salvific end in the elect; distinguished from common or general grace.
- **Foreknowledge (Praevisio):** Treated in relational but not deterministic terms - God's knowledge does not make election conditional on foreseen faith.
- **Human Will (Volo humani):** Genuine but bound by sin; Zanchi maintains compatibilist freedom under divine sovereignty.
- **Perseverantia (Perseverance):** Security rooted in the decree and effectual grace, providing pastoral assurance.
- **Permission (Permissio):** God's allowance of sin for greater ends, without making God the author of sin.
- **Secret vs. Revealed Will:** Tool for addressing difficulties about God's goodness and the reality of reprobation.
- **Double Predestination (as discussed):** Affirmed insofar as both election and reprobation belong to the eternal counsel, carefully qualified to avoid imputing sin to God.
- **Theological uses across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed doctrine of decrees (systematic locus: providence/predestination).
 - As a **polemic resource** against semi-Pelagian/Arminian claims and Tridentine objections.
 - As an **exegetical model** particularly for Romans and Ephesians, showing how texts undergird a doctrine of unconditional election.
