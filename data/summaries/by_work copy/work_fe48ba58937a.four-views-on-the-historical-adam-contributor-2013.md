### TITLE
Four Views on the Historical Adam (contributor: C. John Collins, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2013 amid intensified evangelical debates about Adam, original sin, and evolutionary science; part of a multi-author volume presenting competing evangelical positions.
 - Theological milieu: conservative to moderate evangelical scholarship negotiating fidelity to biblical exegesis with (some) openness to mainstream science.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Collins defends a **historical Adam** who functions as humanity's original representative (federal head) and as the bearer of the image of God; he argues that the Bible presents Adam as a real historical individual whose fall has corporate consequences.
 - Core problem addressed: Can the biblical doctrine of Adam and corporate sin be sustained in light of modern genetics and evolutionary accounts of human origins?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation
 - Careful close reading of Genesis 1-3 and Pauline texts (esp. Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) to show biblical authors presuppose a historical figure as the origin-point of human moral status and sin.
 - Linguistic and narrative arguments for treating Adam as an actual person in Israelite memory.
 - Theological implications
 - Defends **federal headship** (Adam as representative) as the mechanism for corporate guilt/imputation, necessary for Pauline doctrines of sin and redemption.
 - Science-theology interface
 - Argues for methodological caution: biblical claims are theological/anthropological and should not be automatically reduced to scientific descriptions.
 - Allows limited accommodation to scientific accounts (e.g., early Homo sapiens population structure) but resists treating Adam as merely a literary archetype or late theological invention.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with other contributors in the volume (e.g., theistic evolutionists and archetypal readings), and with prominent voices in the field of science and faith (evolutionary biology, geneticists).
 - Engages Pauline scholarship, Old Testament exegesis, and broader evangelical apologetics literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (image of God), sin (original sin, imputation), revelation (how Scripture discloses history), soteriology (atonement's link to Adam), and biblical hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - Collins centers the theological necessity of a real, representative Adam for biblical soteriology while urging disciplined interface with science that preserves exegetical integrity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong exegetical priority: Collins insists the theological claims of Scripture about Adam must guide interpretation of scientific data rather than the reverse.
 - Nuanced engagement with science: he permits dialogue with genetics/evolution but refuses reduction of Adam to non-historical typology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both extremes:
 - Against reading Genesis as purely mythic/archetypal (denies loss of historicity).
 - Against simplistic concordism that forces Genesis into contemporary scientific categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Clarifies and defends the **federal headship** model as biblically rooted and theologically indispensable for doctrines of imputation and redemption.
 - Emphasizes methodological distinction between biblical-theological claims and empirical scientific descriptions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable among evangelicals seeking a middle path: readable to pastors and credible to scholars.
 - Frequently cited in debates about Adam and original sin as a robust exegetical rebuttal to non-historical readings.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for disciplined, text-driven theology that engages science without capitulation; useful in classroom settings and pastoral formation where doctrine and science intersect.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historical Adam**
 - Adam as an actual, historical individual who stands as the origin-point of human moral status and culpability.
- **Federal headship**
 - Adam as representative of humanity; his act brings corporate consequences imputed to his descendants.
- **Original sin / imputation**
 - The doctrine that Adam's sin results in a sinful state or guilt that affects humanity; Collins defends imputation as the theological category needed to preserve Pauline soteriology.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)**
 - Treated as a theological status conferred on human beings; Adam is paradigmatic bearer.
- **Exegetical primacy**
 - The methodological stance that Scripture's plain sense governs theological claims before scientific hypotheses.
- **Science-theology boundary**
 - Collins stresses careful delimitation between what the Bible claims theologically and what empirical science describes.
- **Archetypal / literary Adam**
 - The position Collins critiques when it reduces Adam to symbolic or non-historical status.
- **Genetic / population evidence (e.g., mitochondrial Eve)**
 - Scientific data discussed but not allowed to unilaterally redefine biblical claim; used to inform, not override, theological conclusions.
- **Pauline theology (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15)**
 - Key New Testament loci used to argue for Adam's representative role and the necessity of a real first human for soteriological logic.
- **Narrative-historical reading**
 - Approach that treats Genesis narratives as historical narrative with theological purpose.
- **Methodological humility**
 - Principle recommended for theologians interacting with evolving scientific results.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an **exegetical model**: a text-driven template for reading Genesis and Paul together.
 - As a **polemic resource**: to rebut non-historical/archetypal readings of Adam within evangelical debates.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: to preserve federal doctrine of Adam while allowing limited, disciplined conversation with science.
