### TITLE
Justification by Faith in Catholic-Protestant Dialogue: An Evangelical Assessment (Anthony N. S. Lane, 2002)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (JDDJ, 1999) ecumenical milieu; early 21st-century evangelical engagement with Catholic-Protestant rapprochement. Lane writes as an evangelical Anglican scholar assessing theological convergence and lingering divergences.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The dialogue has yielded valuable moves toward agreement, but significant evangelical reservations remain. Lane argues for preserving the **forensic, declarative** character of justification and the doctrine of **imputed righteousness** while acknowledging points of overlap; he stresses clarity about how justification relates to adoption and sanctification.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of ecumenical statements (notably JDDJ) and what they affirm about sin, grace, faith, and righteousness.
 - Exegetical defense of classical Protestant readings of Paul (Romans, Galatians) emphasizing justification as a courtroom declaration rather than merely an inward transformation.
 - Analysis of Catholic formulations - praise for shared concern about grace and works, critique of ambiguous language that risks collapsing forensic declaration into infused righteousness.
 - Specific attention to **adoption**: argued as a distinct, relational consequence of justification rooted in union with Christ and vital for assurance.
 - Practical and pastoral implications: assurance of salvation, the role of sacramental life, and the integrity of evangelical proclamation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** JDDJ and its authors, Roman Catholic theologians involved in the dialogue, classic Protestant Reformers (implicitly as exegetical and doctrinal standards), Pauline corpus as primary scriptural locus.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (primary), righteousness (imputed vs infused), faith, grace, works, sanctification, **adoption**, union with Christ, sacraments (in relation to grace).
- **Closing line:** A measured evangelical verdict: welcome ecumenical rapprochement where it is clear and biblical, but resist formulations that obscure the forensic declaration and the distinctives (imputation, assurance, adoption) essential to Protestant soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **forensic/declarative** aspect of justification as non-negotiable for evangelical identity.
 - Explicit linking of **adoption** to justification as the relational, assurance-bearing fruit of being declared righteous in Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects readings of JDDJ that treat rapprochement as full doctrinal unity; urges parsing between genuine agreement and retained ambiguities.
 - Challenges Catholic-sounding conciliation that might reduce imputation to mere sanctification or moral transformation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful triage of language: recommends parsing terms like "righteousness of God" into functional categories (constitutive/forensic vs effective/sanctifying) to avoid conflation.
 - Re-centers **adoption** as a theological pivot that clarifies the relational consequences of forensic justification.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in evangelical and Reformed circles as a clear, moderate critique of ecumenical texts; used by scholars and church leaders cautious about JDDJ implications.
 - Influential as a model for assessing dialogue documents: charitable acknowledgement plus doctrinal vigilance.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Concise, balanced template for evangelical engagement in ecumenical theology.
 - Useful for teaching the distinct roles of forensic justification, adoption, and sanctification without polemical excess.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification by faith** - Central subject; defended as forensic declaration received by faith, not earned by works.
- **Forensic / declarative** - Emphasizes legal verdict imagery; cornerstone of Lane's evangelical insistence.
- **Imputed righteousness** - Righteousness accounted to the believer through Christ; contrasted with infused righteousness.
- **Infused righteousness** - Catholic formulation emphasizing interior sanctifying grace; treated as distinct from (and not substitutable for) imputation.
- **Union with Christ** - The mediating reality linking justification to adoption and sanctification.
- **Adoption** - Treated as the relational, filial outcome of justification; grounds for assurance and filial privileges.
 - Relation to justification: not identical to forensic declaration but the personal, relational consequence established by it.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive transformation; distinguished from justification so that moral growth cannot be conflated with the declarative act.
- **Assurance** - The pastoral implication stressed by Lane; depends on forensic and adoptive language.
- **Works / merit** - Discussed as response and fruit of justification, not the basis for it.
- **Righteousness of God** - Urged to be read with categories: constitutive (what justifies) vs effective (what sanctifies).
- **JDDJ (Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification)** - Primary ecumenical text engaged; Lane reads it sympathetically but critically.
- **Sacramental grace** - Recognized in Catholic theology; Lane cautions against allowing sacramental language to obscure forensic clarity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary evangelical articulation of justification and adoption.
- As **polemic** in ecumenical debates warning against terminological ambiguity that blurs imputation and infusion.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline soteriology with attention to both legal metaphor and filial consequences (adoption).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching how justification, adoption, and sanctification interrelate without collapsing distinctive loci.
