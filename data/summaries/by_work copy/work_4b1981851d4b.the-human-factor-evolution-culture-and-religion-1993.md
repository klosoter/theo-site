### TITLE
The Human Factor: Evolution, Culture, and Religion (Philip Hefner, 1993)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s: post-Darwinian theology, growing interdisciplinary engagement between theology and evolutionary biology; period of intensified conversation about culture, technology, and modernity.
 - Hefner writes from a progressive Protestant constructive-theological milieu (Lutheran influences), addressing theologians and scientists seeking synthesis rather than confrontation.

- **Central thesis**
 - Humans are a single **psychosomatic** or biosocial unity whose distinctive **symbolic capacity** makes them "created co-creators": through culture and technology humans participate in ongoing creation. Theology must reconceive anthropology, creation, and religion in light of evolution without reducing the religious to mere epiphenomena.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates the continuity between biological evolution and human cultural emergence.
 - Argues for an ontological category of the **biosocial**: human persons are neither merely biological organisms nor merely cultural agents but integrative beings whose biology enables symbolic culture.
 - Locates religion as an emergent cultural structure shaped by, and shaping, human evolution and self-understanding.
 - Proposes theological responses: reinterpretation of **imago Dei**, vocation of co-creation, ethics for technological culture, and a theological anthropology that resists dualism and reductionism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages evolutionary biology and sociobiology literature; interacts with thinkers like Whitehead (process sensibilities), Teilhard de Chardin (evolutionary spirituality), and contemporary science-theology interlocutors.
 - Contrasts with strict creationist, dualist, and reductive naturalist accounts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation**: continuous and operative in human cultural activity.
 - **Anthropology**: human nature as biosocial, psychosomatic unity; reinterpretation of **imago Dei**.
 - **Sin and ethics**: cultural structures mediate moral agency; responsibility for co-creation and technological consequences.
 - **Religion**: treated as cultural-symbolic phenomenon bearing theological significance, not merely by-product.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Theology must integrate evolutionary science by recognizing humans as **created co-creators** whose symbolic, psychosomatic life continues the divine act of creation within cultural history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, programmatic claim that humans are **created co-creators**: vocation of human participation in creation via culture and technology.
 - Emphasis on **psychosomatic unity** and the biosocial: rejects body-soul dualism and purely culturalist accounts.
 - Treats religion as an evolved cultural capacity with genuine theological significance rather than mere illusion or reduction.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both classical dualist anthropology (soul detached from body) and reductionist naturalism (religion as survival mechanism only).
 - Contrasts with conservative anti-evolutionary theologies by affirming evolutionary history but resisting purely secularizing interpretations.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and operationalized **created co-creator** as a theological anthropology pivot.
 - Systematized use of **biosocial** and **symbolic capacity** as central categories linking biology and culture.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among theologians working at the interface of science and religion, constructive theological anthropology, and ecological ethics.
 - Cited in discussions of technology, culture theology, and evolutionary theology; welcomed by liberal and mainline Protestant circles, critiqued by conservative theologians for perceived accommodation to naturalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for teaching theological anthropology that respects scientific knowledge while preserving theological meaning.
 - Useful heuristic for ethics of technology and ecological theology, and for framing religion as a culturally embedded, theologically relevant faculty.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Created co-creator**
 - Humans as divinely created agents who continue creation through culture, technology, and symbolic action.
- **Biosocial**
 - Human beings as integrated biological and social/cultural organisms; neither purely biological nor purely cultural.
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Rejection of body-soul dualism; human personhood as embodied psychic life.
- **Symbolic capacity**
 - The uniquely human ability to create and manipulate symbols (language, ritual, art) that produce cultural worlds.
- **Culture as second nature**
 - Culture emerges from biological capacities and becomes the environment shaping human behavior and identity.
- **Imago Dei (reinterpreted)**
 - Image of God grounded in relational, creative, and symbolic capacities rather than ontological substance separable from embodiment.
- **Religion as cultural system**
 - Religion is an emergent, regulative, meaning-making dimension of human culture with theological import.
- **Co-creation ethics**
 - Ethical framework emphasizing responsibility for cultural and technological consequences of human creative acts.
- **Evolutionary theology**
 - Theology that incorporates evolutionary narratives into doctrines of creation, eschatology, and anthropology.
- **Non-reductive naturalism**
 - A stance that accepts natural explanations without reducing all meaning and value to material causes.
- **Technological mediation**
 - Concept that tools and technologies extend human co-creative role and pose theological/ethical challenges.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary theological anthropology (terms like created co-creator, biosocial, psychosomatic unity).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theology-science dialogue, ethical reflection on technology, and ecological theology-bridging evolutionary biology and normative theology.
- As a **polemic** against dualist and reductionist accounts, offering an alternative constructive model for ministers, ethicists, and theologians.
