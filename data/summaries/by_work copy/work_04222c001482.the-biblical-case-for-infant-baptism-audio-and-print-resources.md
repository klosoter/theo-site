### TITLE
**The Biblical Case for Infant Baptism** - Gregg Strawbridge (audio and print resources)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical debate over baptism (late 20th-21st century). Addresses renewed Protestant interest in sacramental theology and persistent credobaptist (believers' baptism) identity among Baptists.
 - Resources presented in both audio (sermons/lectures) and print formats for parish and academic use.

- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament warrants baptizing infants of believing parents because baptism functions as the covenantal sign and seal that replaces circumcision; household baptisms and covenant theology together ground paedobaptism. Baptism is a sign of inclusion in the covenant community rather than an automatic instrument of regeneration.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical case:
 - Readings of key texts: Acts household baptisms (Acts 2, 16, 1 Cor 1), Genesis-Exodus circumcision commands, Colossians/Colossian parallels that link circumcision and baptism (e.g., Col 2:11-12).
 - Argues the pattern of covenant continuity: Israelite infants received the sign (circumcision); the New Covenant continues sign-application in baptism to covenant children.
 - Theological consolidation:
 - Defines baptism as a covenantal sign and seal - visual and communal marking of inclusion, promise, and obligation.
 - Distinguishes sign/seal efficacy (assurance/confirmation) from regeneration; rebuts notions that infant baptism guarantees salvation.
 - Polemical refutation:
 - Engages typical credobaptist objections: alleged absence of infant examples, alleged faith prerequisite, and mode-focused arguments (immersion vs sprinkling).
 - Reinterprets household baptism lists as inclusive of infant children and argues that faith requirement applies to covenant community membership over chronological age.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary credobaptist theologians and popular Baptist apologetics.
 - Interacts with classical Reformed paedobaptist writers and patristic evidence where relevant.
 - Uses biblical scholarship on household structures, covenant literature, and sacramental theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace), sacramentology (sign and seal), ecclesiology (membership), soteriology (regeneration vs covenant inclusion), and the relation between Old and New Covenants.

- **Closing line**
 - Strawbridge centers the controversy on covenant continuity: baptism should be administered to covenant children as the New Testament analogue of circumcision - ecclesial sign, not automatic saving instrument.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on covenantal continuity as hermeneutical key: the Old Testament household-sign logic is decisive for New Testament practice.
 - Clear pastoral framing: infant baptism as formative and covenantal discipline for church nurture, not as a sacrament that forces immediate soteriological effects.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects credobaptist readings that isolate baptism from Israelite covenant forms and downplay household inclusivity.
 - Contrasts with both sacramentalist extremes (baptismal regeneration) and minimalist views that make baptism merely symbolic of individual choice.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Careful analytic distinction between *sign* (what baptism represents) and *seal* (assurance/promissory function), applied with pastoral nuance to infants.
 - Emphasizes sociological-historical readings of household texts to recover likely presence of children.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in some Reformed and Presbyterian circles as a concise contemporary defense of paedobaptism.
 - Credobaptist circles critique the interpretive weight given to household baptism lists and to typology between circumcision and baptism.
 - Used as a practical resource for pastoral instruction and denominational training.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, church-oriented articulation of why paedobaptism coheres with covenant theology.
 - Useful bridge between exegetical argumentation and pastoral application; serves as a concise reference for classroom and pulpit engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Paedobaptism** - Baptism administered to infants of believing parents as a covenant sign.
- **Credobaptism** - View that baptism is for professing believers only; principal interlocutor.
- **Covenant of grace** - The theological framework linking Old and New Testament inclusion.
- **Sign and seal** - Primary sacramental categories used: sign = visible representation; seal = confirmation/assurance of promise.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology** - Argument that baptism replaces circumcision as covenant sign; used to justify infant reception.
- **Household baptisms** - Acts passages listing households baptized; read here as including children/infants.
- **Efficacy (of baptism)** - Clarified as non-regenerative in itself; confers covenant standing and assurance rather than guaranteed salvation.
- **Regeneration vs covenant inclusion** - Distinction between inner saving work of the Spirit and external marking of covenant membership.
- **Mode (immersion/affusion/sprinkling)** - Treated as secondary to theological meaning; method debated but not decisive for infant reception.
- **Infant faith** - Theological category distinguishing explicit personal faith from covenantal positioning that anticipates future personal faith.
- **Ecclesial nurture** - Pastoral implication: baptism places infants under covenantal instruction and discipline.
- **Household/patrilineal social structure** - Sociological reading informing exegesis of New Testament household lists.
- **Promise-children** - Term for infants who receive the covenant sign by virtue of parental faith and covenant status.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against credobaptist readings of Acts and Romans.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading household baptism texts within covenant history.
 - As a **pastoral resource** for catechesis on church membership and sacramental practice.
