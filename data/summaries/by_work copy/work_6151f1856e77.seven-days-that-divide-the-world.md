### TITLE
Seven Days That Divide the World - John C. Lennox

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical apologetic engagement with New Atheism and contemporary science; written amid public debates between high-profile scientists (e.g., Dawkins, Hawking) and Christian apologists. Lennox writes as a mathematician and Christian apologist addressing both popular and academic readers.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Genesis 1 presents a theologically authoritative, historically anchored account of creation; the seven-day structure is decisive for Christian doctrine and is compatible with-though not reducible to-scientific accounts. The book contests philosophical/metaphysical naturalism and non-literal readings that sever theology from historical claims.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose the cultural claim: science has displaced the need for divine explanation (New Atheist line; methodological naturalism promoted to metaphysical naturalism).
 - Exegetical assessment: analyze Genesis 1 genre, syntax, and theological motifs (e.g., divine speech, "days," Sabbath) and survey alternative readings (gap theory, day-age, framework, theistic evolution).
 - Scientific survey: present relevant cosmology and biology (Big Bang, fine-tuning, origin-of-life problems) to show that modern science does not mandate a materialistic origin story.
 - Integrative proposal: defend a historically credible reading of the seven days that preserves theological claims (creation ex nihilo, creator-creature distinction, imago Dei, human uniqueness) while engaging scientific findings without capitulating to reductionism.
 - Practical/theological implications: link the seven-day pattern to Sabbath theology and to the shape of redemption history.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Prominent New Atheists (Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens), leading scientists and philosophers of science, proponents of various Genesis readings (day-age, framework scholars), and classic theological sources (patristic and medieval discussions about creation and allegory are used as background).
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation (including ex nihilo and divine causality), revelation and Scripture (authority and hermeneutics), anthropological issues (imago Dei, human uniqueness), providence, and the interface between theology and natural science.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The seven days are theologically decisive: Genesis anchors Christian claims about God, humanity, and history; science may inform detail but cannot supplant the creedal truth that God is the intentional Creator of a good, ordered world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that Genesis 1 functions as historical-theological narrative whose seven-day schema carries soteriological and liturgical weight (Sabbath as interpretive key).
 - Balanced apologetic posture: intellectually rigorous engagement with science without capitulating to either scientism or anti-intellectual fideism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Counters New Atheist claims that science renders the Creator superfluous by showing scientific data remain compatible with creationism/theism.
 - Critiques both extreme literalist (young-earth) and conciliatory theistic-evolutionist models when they disconnect Genesis from its theological claims.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the argumentative force of the seven-day pattern as a theological-practical hermeneutical pivot rather than merely a chronological problem to be solved.
 - Reframes debates from "old vs. young earth" to whether Genesis' theological claims about purpose and order are preserved under a reading.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical apologetics and in dialogues between Christians and secular scientists; welcomed for clarity by many lay and academic readers.
 - Criticized by strict young-earth advocates for not centering geology/chronology as primary and by some liberal scholars for sustained literalism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A clear model for integrating scientific literacy with conservative exegesis; durable as a pedagogical resource for courses on theology-science interaction and for pastors confronting popular scientistic objections.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Seven days:** Central motif; read as structuring theological claim (creation order + Sabbath significance).
- **Genesis 1 (historical-theological reading):** Treated as narrative with propositional truth about origins, not merely myth or mythopoetic imagery.
- **Methodological naturalism vs. metaphysical naturalism:** Distinction used to argue science is a method, not a metaphysics that can displace God.
- **Day-age / Gap / Framework / Theistic evolution:** Alternatives surveyed and critiqued with regard to their exegetical coherence and theological consequences.
- **Fine-tuning:** Scientific datum deployed to argue for intentional design and against brute materialism.
- **Creation ex nihilo:** Affirmed as doctrinal baseline; used to ground Creator-creature distinction.
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** Central to anthropological claims about human uniqueness and moral responsibility.
- **Sabbath theology:** Hermeneutical key linking creation week to liturgy, ethics, and eschatology.
- **Historical narrative / literal sense:** Emphasized as primary exegetical category while allowing attention to genre and poetic elements.
- **Science-theology dialogue:** Treated as complementary disciplines with distinct but intersecting claims.
- **Anthropic considerations:** Employed to show apparent fine-tuning and contingency at cosmological and biological levels.
- **Polemic against scientism:** Recurrent rhetorical and philosophical target.
- **Hermeneutical prudence:** Advocacy for careful, theologically informed reading of Genesis in light of scientific data.

How the work is used:
- As an apologetic resource to rebut scientistic atheism and to defend the intelligibility of theism alongside cosmology.
- As an exegetical model defending a historically grounded reading of Genesis that preserves doctrinal consequences (creation, Sabbath, imago Dei).
- As a conceptual pivot in teaching: to show how theological commitments shape interpretation of scientific data and how science can inform-but not determine-doctrine.
