### TITLE
**Willem J. van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism** 
Secondary guide to early modern Reformed orthodoxy, with Francis Turretin as a key exemplar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early modern Reformed orthodoxy, c. 1560-1725; academy, pulpit, and consistory.
 - Post-Reformation consolidation under confessionalization; engagement with Renaissance humanism and Aristotelian method.
 - Polemical context: Roman Catholic (Suarez, Bellarmine), Lutheran scholastic, Remonstrant/Arminian, Socinian, and early Cartesian challenges.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Reformed scholasticism is a method of teaching and disputing in service of exegesis and piety, not a rationalist deviation from the Reformation.
 - Continuity and development from Calvin to the Reformed Orthodox; distinctions clarify rather than obscure doctrine.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Define scholasticism as pedagogical method: quaestio, disputatio, loci ordering, use of distinctions and syllogistic clarity.
 - Historical survey: from Reformation to high orthodoxy (Junius, Polanus, Ames, Voetius, Cocceius, Turretin, Mastricht) and later trajectories.
 - Methodological heart: principia of theology; archetypal-ectypal distinction; Scripture and Spirit; logical tools as ministerial, not magisterial.
 - Doctrinal case studies showing method at work:
 - God and Trinity; Christology; covenant and law-gospel; ordo salutis; church and sacraments; providence and eschatology.
 - Hermeneutical guidance for reading scholastic texts contextually (schools, curricula, disputations, genres).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed: Calvin, Beza, Junius, Perkins, Polanus, Ames, Voetius, Cocceius, Turretin, Owen, Mastricht.
 - Medieval and patristic: Augustine, Lombard, Aquinas, Scotus, Suarez.
 - Opponents: Bellarmine, the Remonstrants, Socinians, Cartesian theologians; dialogue with Lutheran orthodox (Gerhard).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology: principium cognoscendi, sufficiency, clarity, autographa-apographa, analogia fidei.
 - Theology proper: archetypal-ectypal, simplicity, attributes, Trinity.
 - Christology: two natures, communicatio idiomatum, extra Calvinisticum.
 - Pneumatology: testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum, effectual calling, union with Christ.
 - Soteriology: covenant of works and grace, pactum salutis, ordo salutis, assurance.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: marks, means of grace, presence of Christ, discipline.
 - Eschatology: resurrection, judgment, millennial views in confessional perspective.

- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: principled, church-serving method where Scripture and Spirit constitute theology, and scholastic distinctions order doctrine for truth, worship, and pastoral care.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Scholasticism as method and school culture, not a timeless system; retrieval of archetypal-ectypal theology for epistemic humility.
 - Federal theology as integrative architecture binding loci across exegesis, dogma, and practice.
 - Clarifies genres: commentary, disputation, locus, catechesis, elenctic treatise.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rebuts the Calvin-versus-the-Calvinists thesis; shows organic continuity from Reformers to orthodoxy.
 - Distinguishes Reformed use of Aristotle as ministerial from rationalism; rejects the analogia entis.
 - Nuances differences with Rome and Lutheranism on Scripture, justification, Christology, and sacramentology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Accessible taxonomy of distinctions (real, formal, virtual) and principia (essendi vs cognoscendi; external vs internal).
 - Re-centers Junius s archetypal-ectypal distinction for theological method and doxology.
 - Highlights elenctic theology as charitable, ordered polemic bound to exegesis and confession.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed anglophone retrieval of Reformed orthodoxy; guided renewed readings of Turretin and Mastricht.
 - Incorporated widely in seminary curricula; shaped editorial introductions to classic texts and translations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides stable definitions and maps of the field for advanced study.
 - Offers a cross-loci framework linking Bibliology, Trinity, Christology, covenant, church, and last things.
 - Trains readers to weigh scholastic distinctions pastorally and exegetically.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scholasticism**: a pedagogical method (questions, objections, responses) serving exegesis and doctrine.
- **Methodus**: ordered presentation of loci; from clarity to charity in instruction and dispute.
- **Quaestio / Disputatio**: formal problem-posing and debate to test and refine doctrine.
- **Distinctiones**: real, formal, virtual distinctions that preserve unity while articulating complexity.
- **Archetypal vs Ectypal Theology**: God s self-knowledge vs our accommodated knowledge; grounds humility.
- **Principia theologiae**
 - Principium essendi: God as the being-principle of theology.
 - Principium cognoscendi externum: Scripture as external cognitive principle.
 - Principium cognoscendi internum: the Spirit s internal testimony.
- **Elenctic theology**: polemical clarification tethered to Scripture and confession (e.g., Turretin).
- **Federal theology**: covenantal frame uniting creation, law-gospel, Christ, and salvation.
- **Covenant of works / grace**: two economies under one divine purpose; law and promise coordinated in Christ.
- **Pactum salutis**: intra-Trinitarian counsel grounding the economy of redemption.
- **Ordo salutis**: ordered description of Spirit-applied benefits in union with Christ.
- **Testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum**: the Spirit s witness granting Scripture s certainty.
- **Analogia fidei (vs analogia entis)**: Scripture interprets Scripture; denial of creaturely analogy as knowledge-principle.
- **Communicatio idiomatum / Extra Calvinisticum**: Christological clarity on the union without confusion; real presence without ubiquity.
- **Marks of the church / Means of grace**: Word, sacraments, and discipline as instituted means for faith and holiness.

- **How this work is used**
 - Methodological primer and definition-source across loci, stabilizing key terms and distinctions.
 - Conceptual pivot for principia, covenant architecture, and the Scripture-Spirit relation.
 - Polemical map for situating debates with Rome, Remonstrants, Socinians, and Cartesianism.
 - Exegetical and pedagogical model for reading Turretin and other Reformed Orthodox in context.
