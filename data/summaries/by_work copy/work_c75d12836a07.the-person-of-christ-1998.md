### TITLE
The Person of Christ (1998) - Donald Macleod 
Concise theological treatment of classic Christology from a conservative Reformed standpoint; systematic, exegetical, and polemical engagement with modern and historical alternatives.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; written amid renewed interest in classical Christology and in reaction to rising kenotic and existential models of the incarnation.
 - Engages both patristic (Chalcedon/Cyril) and post-Reformation (Owen, Reformed scholastics) resources while conversing with contemporary scholars who press kenotic, existential, or psychologizing accounts of Christ.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defends a Chalcedonian, two-natures-in-one-person account of Christ against ontological kenosis and any suggestion that the incarnate Son ceased to possess divine attributes; integrates this with a robust affirmation of the threefold office and Christ's non-peccability.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical data on the person of Christ (Gospels, Paul, Hebrews) emphasizing personal unity and distinct natures.
 - Doctrinal formulation: careful definition of hypostatic union and communicatio idiomatum so as to preserve both distinction and unity.
 - Polemic: critique of kenosis theories that imply ontological diminution; defense of voluntarist/self-limiting models that preserve divine immutability.
 - Application: discussion of Christ's offices (munus triplex) and the theological implications for atonement, mediation, and rule.
 - Treatment of impeccability: theological and biblical case that Christ was incapable of sin though truly tempted.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Patristic sources and Chalcedonian tradition, John Owen and Reformed scholastics, modern kenotic proponents and critics; Macleod dialogues with both historical confessions and contemporary scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and natures), Trinity in relation to the Son's incarnation, atonement and priesthood, revelation and mediation (prophet/king/priest), soteriology ramifications (impeccability, temptation, sinlessness).
- **Closing line**
 - A disciplined, Reformed recovery of classical Chalcedonian Christology: the Son willingly limits the exercise of divine attributes in the incarnation but does not undergo ontological loss; his single person accomplishes prophetic, priestly, and kingly work while remaining incapable of sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between *ontological* diminution (rejected) and *voluntary functional self-limitation* (affirmed) in interpreting Philippians 2 and related texts.
 - Emphasis on the hypostatic union as the key hermeneutical principle for ascribing actions and properties to Christ without confusing natures.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct correction of kenotic (ontological) readings that make the Son cease to be omnipotent/omniscient in the incarnation.
 - Pushback against any modern tendency to reduce Christ's person to merely moral example or exemplary obedience.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes a careful language of "self-limitation" or "non-exercise" of divine attributes rather than "emptying" as subtraction; insists on disciplined use of communicatio idiomatum.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a reliable, readable defense of classical Christology; often cited in syllabi on systematic Christology.
 - Used as a corrective resource by those opposing kenotic and "peccability" proposals.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to combine biblical exegesis, historical theology, and systematic formulation; valuable for pastors and students wanting a compact yet rigorous statement of orthodox Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - central category: two complete natures (divine and human) united in one person (the Son).
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - disciplined allowance of attributing properties of each nature to the one person without confusion.
- **Kenosis** - treated critically:
 - Distinguishes biblical "emptying" (Phil 2) as voluntary self-limitation of exercise, not loss of divine attributes.
 - Rejects ontological kenosis (the Son ceases to be fully divine).
- **Self-limitation / non-exercise** - Macleod's preferred way to speak about incarnation-bound restraint of divine prerogatives.
- **Munus triplex (threefold office)** - prophet, priest, king integrated in the one person; used to explain revelation, atonement, and sovereign rule.
- **Impeccability** - affirmative doctrine: Christ could be tempted yet was incapable of sinning due to the union with the Logos and divine sustaining grace.
- **Peccability (rejected)** - the position that Christ could have sinned; Macleod argues against this on biblical and theological grounds.
- **Chalcedonian formulation** - normative hermeneutical anchor throughout the book; used to adjudicate modern proposals.
- **Philippians 2 / kenosis exegesis** - exegetical model emphasizing voluntary humility, not subtraction of deity.
- **Temptation and sinlessness** - careful treatment preserving genuine human susceptibility to temptation and real divine preservation from sin.
- **Divine attributes in the incarnation** - explained as retained intrinsically, but some functions not exercised by the incarnate Son.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for orthodox two-natures Christology in systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic resource** against ontological kenoticism and peccability proposals.
- As an **exegetical-model** for interpreting Philippians 2 and Hebrews in Christological debates.
