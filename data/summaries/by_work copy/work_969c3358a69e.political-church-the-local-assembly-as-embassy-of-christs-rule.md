### TITLE
Political Church: The Local Assembly as Embassy of Christ's Rule - Jonathan Leeman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary evangelical-Reformed context (21st century). Emerges from the 9Marks network and broader evangelical debates about the church's public role after rising concerns over Christian nationalism, political tribalism, and institutional decline in Western churches.
- **Central thesis:** The local church is inherently a political body: it functions as an "embassy" of Christ's kingship in the world, exercising a form of noncoercive, covenantal rule that is distinct from but not irrelevant to secular politics.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - The term "political" is reclaimed for the church: political in the sense of polis/ordering, rule, and allegiance, not partisan campaigning.
 - The local assembly is the primary site where Christ's rule is enacted through word, sacraments, discipline, and pastoral governance.
 - Healthy ecclesial politics requires proper polity (elders), visible discipline, and public worship that shapes consciences and habits.
 - The church's political vocation is both public (witness to the common good) and particular (covenantal life of the gathered saints); it confronts both the privatization and the politicization of the gospel.
 - Practical implications: churches should cultivate internal health, resist capture by civil power or partisan agendas, and form people for faithful, prophetic engagement in wider civic life.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged:** Leeman draws on the Reformed tradition broadly (Reformers and Puritans), patristic concepts of the polis, Anglican and Presbyterian polity models, and contemporary debates with proponents of Christian nationalism and withdrawalist sectarianism. He dialogizes implicitly with Kuyperian sphere-sovereignty and with critics of confessional ecclesiology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (central); Christology (lordship and kingship of Christ); covenant (church as covenant community); sacraments (means of forming the polity); church-state relations; pastoral office and eldership; ethics and public witness; implicit eschatology (kingdom-now/kingdom-not-yet).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Theologically robust public life begins with the local church's embodied allegiance to Christ's rule - an embassy that forms people by Word, sacrament, and discipline so they can witness faithfully in the world without becoming a mere arm of civil power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Reclaiming "political" for ecclesial identity: the church is political because it orders life under Christ, not because it functions as a political party.
 - The *local assembly* (not broader Christianity or Christian institutions) is primary for political formation.
 - "Embassy" metaphor: church as diplomatic presence of Christ's rule within an alien culture.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against Christian nationalism: resists conflating civil power with gospel authority; warns of church capitulation to partisan ends.
 - Against privatism/withdrawalism: rejects the idea that faithful Christianity is only personal piety or separatism; insists on public, visible, ordered congregation.
 - Nuances to Kuyperian public theology: affirms cultural engagement but recenters the locus of political identity on the local church rather than institutional cultural transformation as primary.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Political church as a technical, ecclesiological category - distinct from secular politics, civic religion, or mere social activism.
 - Emphasis on ecclesial "rule" enacted through pastoral governance, not state coercion.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in Reformed-evangelical circles, pastoral conferences, and seminary courses on ecclesiology and public theology.
 - Frequently cited in debates over Christian nationalism, church politicization, and elder-led polity.
 - Criticized by some for being insufficiently engaged with systemic political injustice or for a perceived inwardness.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies a theologically grounded middle way between politicized religion and privatized faith.
 - Useful corrective to churches tempted by partisan capture or pulpit silence; durable for pastoral formation and ecclesial ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Political church:** Church conceived as a polity that orders life under Christ; not partisan politics.
- **Local assembly:** The gathered congregation as the primary site of Christian political formation.
- **Embassy of Christ's rule:** Metaphor for the church's diplomatic, representative presence in the world, living under a foreign king (Christ).
- **Lordship of Christ:** Christ's kingship as the basis for ecclesial authority and political ordering.
- **Covenant community:** The church's defining structure - relational, committed, and formative.
- **Elders / polity:** Pastoral governance as the mechanism of ecclesial rule and discipline.
- **Discipline:** Visible corrective practice that preserves the church's witness and ordering.
- **Sacraments (Word & Table/Baptism):** Means by which the church enacts and teaches Christ's rule in embodied form.
- **Public witness:** Noncoercive testimony and formation aimed at the common good, distinct from partisan activity.
- **Separation of church and state:** Protective distinction that guards the church's political vocation without endorsing secular isolation.
- **Christian nationalism:** Critiqued as a conflation of national identity with gospel authority.
- **Privatization / withdrawalism:** Critiqued as shrinking the church's public, ordered calling.
- **Sphere-sovereignty (contrast):** Leeman nods to broader cultural engagement but prioritizes the local church over broad institutional culture-making as the primary political agent.
- **Kingdom-now/kingdom-not-yet:** Implicit framework: church embodies kingdom realities now while awaiting consummation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for an ecclesial understanding of "political" distinct from partisan politics.
 - As a polemic against Christian nationalism and against privatized religiosity; often cited in public-theology debates.
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model for elder-led polity, discipline, and sacramental formation in local church practice.
