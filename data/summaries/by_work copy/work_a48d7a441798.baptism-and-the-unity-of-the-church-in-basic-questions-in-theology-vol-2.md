### TITLE
**Baptism and the Unity of the Church** (in Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2) - Wolfhart Pannenberg

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-1960s/early-1970s ecumenical milieu (post-Vatican II; vigorous WCC Faith and Order work).
 - Pannenberg's program: revelation in history, truth as eschatologically manifested, strong ecclesial-ecumenical concern.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How can divided churches confess one church? Answer: the church's visible unity is grounded in the **one baptism** into Christ, which proleptically realizes the eschatological people of God and obligates mutual recognition across confessions.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural grounding of unity in baptism: Matt 28:19; Rom 6; 1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:27-28; Eph 4:4-6.
 - Sacrament and Word: baptism as enactment of the gospel's promise, not magical causality; the Spirit's agency unites to Christ and his body.
 - Eschatological orientation: baptism confers an identity determined by the future lordship of Christ; ecclesial unity is anticipatory but real.
 - Faith and appropriation: baptism's gift requires lifelong reception in faith and catechesis; ecclesial practices should honor both objective promise and personal response.
 - Ecclesial implications: mutual recognition of trinitarian baptism is the basis for inter-church acknowledgment; rebaptism denies the gospel's singular act.
 - Pastoral/ecumenical proposals: strengthen catechesis and confession without undermining baptism's once-for-all character; order of sacraments shaped by mission and unity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogue with Augustine (sacrament and unity), Luther and Calvin (Word-sacrament, sign and seal), Roman Catholic sacramental theology (ex opere operato, character), Barth (critique of sacramentalism and of infant baptism), Anabaptist/Baptist arguments for believer's baptism; engages conciliar/ecumenical reports.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture; Trinity (into the name of the Father, Son, Spirit); Christology (union with Christ); Pneumatology; Ecclesiology and Sacraments; Soteriology (justification, regeneration, adoption); Eschatology (prolepsis of the kingdom); Anthropology (identity-in-community); Covenant/People of God.
- **Closing line**
 - The one church subsists in history as the community of the baptized, whose eschatological identity in Christ grounds and summons visible unity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Eschatological prolepsis**: baptism grants, from the future of God, a present identity that founds unity.
 - **Public truth**: baptism is a public act binding persons to the public lordship of Christ, not a private religious experience.
 - **Unity-in-difference**: baptismal unity precedes and norms denominational differences.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **Barth's** reduction of baptism to human act: insists on sacramental objectivity under the Word and Spirit.
 - Against **ex opere operato** misunderstandings: efficacy is God's act mediated by the Word, requiring faith's ongoing reception.
 - Against **rebaptism**: affirms once-for-all baptism where trinitarian form and gospel intention are present.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reinterpretation of **baptismal character** as eschatological identity and vocation.
 - Tension of **objective gift** and **subjective appropriation** held within an eschatological horizon.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Helped shape ecumenical consensus around recognition of one baptism; often cited in dialogues leading up to BEM.
 - Reformed readers appreciated Word-centered sacramentality and covenantal overtones, while debating infant baptism's status.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a biblically saturated, dogmatically integrated, and ecumenically useful account of baptism as the foundation of visible unity and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One baptism (Eph 4:5)**: the single divine act incorporating into Christ and his body; ground of unity and mutual recognition.
- **Prolepsis**: anticipatory realization of the eschaton; baptism grants a future-determined identity now.
- **Revelation in history**: baptism participates in God's historical self-disclosure centered in Christ's resurrection.
- **Word and sacrament**: inseparable; baptism is the gospel in enacted form, effective by the Spirit through the Word.
- **Union with Christ**: baptism signifies and effects incorporation into Christ's death and resurrection (Rom 6).
- **Pneumatological agency**: the Spirit is the efficient agent of baptismal incorporation and perseverance.
- **Baptismal character**: not a quasi-physical mark but an enduring vocation and belonging grounded in God's promise.
- **Faith and catechesis**: personal trust and instruction are necessary for the ongoing appropriation of the baptismal gift.
- **Mutual recognition**: churches should acknowledge any trinitarian baptism performed with gospel intent; rebaptism rejected.
- **Ecclesial visibility**: baptism creates obligations toward concrete fellowship, discipline, and shared mission.
- **Covenant/People of God**: baptism as entry into the covenant community defined by God's promise and future.
- **New creation**: baptism signifies participation in the eschatological renewal of humanity and creation.
- **Public truth of the gospel**: baptism locates believers in a public, communal confession under Christ's lordship.
- **Eucharistic relation**: baptism orders the table; communion presumes baptismal belonging, pressing toward fuller unity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Bibliology: model of Word-saturated sacramental theology and canonical synthesis.
 - Theology proper/Trinity: grounding unity in the triune name and action.
 - Covenant/Soteriology: resource for sign-and-seal accounts balancing promise and faith.
 - Ecclesiology/Eschatology: conceptual pivot for ecumenical unity and the church's proleptic identity.
