### TITLE
**Structure of Biblical Authority** - Meredith G. Kline (1st ed. 1972; rev. ed. 1997). A covenantal account of Scripture as the treaty-document of the Great King.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship, engaging ANE treaty research and post-neo-orthodox debates on inspiration, canon, and authority. In dialogue with historical criticism and form-criticism while retrieving confessional Reformed doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture's authority is covenantal. The Bible is the canonized treaty by which God, the divine Suzerain, administers his kingdom. Canon, prophecy, apostolate, and church life are structured by covenant form, oath, and sanctions.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **ANE suzerainty-treaty form** frames biblical covenants: preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, sanctions, witnesses, deposition, and public reading.
 - **Decalogue and Deuteronomy as treaty:** the two tablets are duplicate copies for both parties; the ark functions as treaty chest; covenant text is deposited as witness.
 - **Prophetic office as covenant emissaries:** prophets prosecute covenant lawsuit, extend and apply the treaty, and participate in canon formation under divine authorization.
 - **Apostolic authority and canon closure:** the risen Christ as Suzerain commissions apostles as foundational emissaries; their writings constitute the New Covenant treaty corpus, delimiting the canon.
 - **Oath and sacraments:** covenant signs seal oath obligations and sanctions; the church's worship, discipline, and sacraments are treaty-administrative acts under the canon.
 - **Eschatological sanctions and theocracy:** old-covenant holy war and land-tenure judgments are typological intrusions of final judgment; the new covenant is non-theocratic in civil form yet retains final-sanction realities.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** ANE treaty studies (esp. G. E. Mendenhall; Hittite and Assyrian corpora); engagement with Wellhausen and form/redaction critics; correction to Barth/neo-orthodoxy on event vs text; retrieval of Vosian biblical theology and Reformed confessions.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and inspiration; canon and ecclesial reception; covenant theology (works, grace, typological republication); sacraments as oath-seals; ethics and civil order; eschatology of sanctions; anthropology in covenant office.
- **Closing line:** Scripture is the covenant charter of God's kingdom, the Spirit-given treaty by which the Lord rules, blesses, and judges his people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Canon-as-treaty:** authority inheres in the covenant document, not in later community ratification.
 - **Two-tablet duplication:** both tablets contain the full Decalogue as bilateral copies deposited before God.
 - **Prophetic lawsuit paradigm:** prophets as covenant prosecutors grounding ethical exhortation and judgment oracles.
 - **Typological theocracy and intrusion:** Mosaic order prefigures final judgment; explains holy war without normalizing it for the church age.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **neo-orthodoxy:** revelation is not event apart from text; the canon is the locus of divine authority.
 - Against **ecclesial positivism:** the church receives rather than constitutes the canon.
 - Against **theonomy:** Israel's civil-penal system was typological and not perpetually normative.
 - Nuancing **dispensationalism:** continuity of covenant administration with redemptive-historical development, not atomized dispensations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Document clause** and **canon-consciousness** in Scripture.
 - **Oath-sanction** reading of sacraments and covenant administration.
 - **Republication** as a typological works principle for Israel's land tenure, distinct from the ordo salutis.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Catalyzed Reformed canonical studies; shaped OPC/URC circles and Klinean biblical theology; informed debates on republication, theonomy, and canonicity; anticipated aspects of canonical approach.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Integrates ANE form with confessional theology; supplies a robust, text-based ground for inerrancy, canon, sacraments, ethics, and eschatology; offers a durable framework for exegesis and dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Suzerainty-vassal treaty:** ANE political covenant form structuring biblical covenants and canon.

 - **Covenant theology:** clarifies works/grace, republication, sanctions, and administration.
 - **Eschatology and ethics:** frames sanctions, holy war, and church-age non-theocratic ethic.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments:** grounds sacraments and church discipline as oath-administering acts under the canon.
