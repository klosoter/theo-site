### TITLE
Contributions of Steve Schlissel to The Federal Vision (ed. Steve Wilkins, 2004) - summary notes on Federal Vision monocovenantal emphases

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century intra-Reformed debate (2000s). The Federal Vision collection gathers a cohort of mostly conservative Reformed authors revisiting covenant theology, sacraments, and soteriology amid concerns about nominalism, individualism, and pastoral practice in North American Presbyterian and Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Schlissel's essay participates in the Federal Vision project to reconceive covenant theology around a **monocovenantal** framework: the unity and corporate reality of the covenant of grace across Old and New Testaments, and the ecclesial efficacy of baptism and covenant markers in forming covenant membership and identity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: classical federalism and some contemporary piety have privatized covenant life and overstressed forensic imputation detached from covenantal fellowship.
 - Proposal: recover **covenantal union** and the objective, communal dimensions of grace signified in sacraments; treat baptism and covenantal promises as means by which individuals are incorporated into the covenant community.
 - Theological consequences: reframe justification language to account for covenantal standing and corporate faithfulness, resist sterile antinomian or purely forensic reductions.
 - Pastoral/disciplinary implications: call for robust corporate discipline, catechesis, and sacramental practice that reflects objective covenant membership while still distinguishing true faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engagement with classical Reformed confessions (Westminster), 17th-century federalists, contemporary critics (confessionalists alarmed by Federal Vision), and biblical exegesis on covenant passages (e.g., household baptisms, covenant signs). Implicit dialog with proponents of strong forensic imputation and with those emphasizing the invisible church.
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant (mono- vs. two-covenant models), sacraments (baptismal efficacy and sign/seal dynamics), union with Christ, justification (forensic vs. covenantal/relative language), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church; covenant membership), perseverance and covenant faithfulness.
- **Closing line:** Schlissel's contribution centers the **objective, corporate reality of the covenant** - arguing that sacramental incorporation and communal covenanthood must shape Reformed soteriology and ecclesial practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong emphasis on **monocovenantal continuity** - one covenant of grace across redemptive history rather than sharply bifurcated administrations.
 - Focus on the **objective efficacy of covenant signs** (especially baptism) to confer covenant status and identity, not merely as individual testimonies.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges a narrow forensic-only account of justification by insisting on covenantal standing and communal belonging as essential theological categories.
 - Pushes back against sharp dichotomies between the visible and invisible church as neglecting the real corporate promises given to covenant households.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-foregrounding of "covenantal union" language to mediate between union-with-Christ doctrine and forensic imputation.
 - Use of household/baptism imagery to reframe membership theology-arguing for a more integrated sign-seal-effect model.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Contribution is part of a broader, contested movement: influential among some Reformed pastors and theologians seeking pastoral and ecclesial renewal; criticized by others who saw the Federal Vision as undermining justification by faith alone or blurring regenerate/nominal distinctions.
 - Sparked sustained debate, presbytery and denominational responses, and further clarifications and critiques in subsequent literature.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes careful re-examination of covenant language, sacramental theology, and the corporate shape of salvation; useful for courses on covenant theology, ecclesiology, and pastoral praxis even where one disagrees.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal Vision:** loose label for a cluster of Reformed proposals emphasizing covenantal corporate identity, sacramental efficacy, and ecclesial reality over privatized soteriology.
- **Monocovenantalism:** the claim that there is one covenant of grace across both Testaments, maintaining continuity in promises and covenantal status.
- **Covenantal union:** term for the believer's incorporation into Christ mediated by covenant signs and communal belonging; links union-with-Christ to corporate covenant membership.
- **Baptismal efficacy:** Schlissel's accent on baptism as a sign that **actually** establishes covenant standing and identity in the community (distinguished from sacramental magic or automatic salvation).
- **Sign/Seal/Effect model:** triadic view where signs (baptism) both testify and as seals mediate covenant promises with real (though non-automatic) effect on covenant standing.
- **Forensic imputation (contrast):** traditional emphasis on legal declaration of righteousness; Federal Vision seeks to nuance this by situating imputation within covenantal incorporation.
- **Visible/invisible church distinction:** re-emphasized complexity - visible church includes covenant members by sign; invisible church denotes the elect, but the corporate reality of promise must be honored.
- **Covenant faithfulness:** ethical and persevering response expected of covenant members; not merely evidence of election but constitutive of covenant life.
- **Household baptism:** use of household narrative data (household baptisms in Acts) to argue for covenant family membership practices.
- **Perseverance and discipline:** pastoral imperative: corporate discipline and catechesis follow from real covenant membership.
- **Ecclesial identity:** identity of persons is shaped by covenant membership; ecclesiology is central to soteriology in the Federal Vision frame.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **polemic** against overly individualistic or forensic-only models of justification.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading covenant texts and household baptisms.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology and pastoral ecclesiology - useful in teaching debates on baptism, church membership, and covenant continuity.
