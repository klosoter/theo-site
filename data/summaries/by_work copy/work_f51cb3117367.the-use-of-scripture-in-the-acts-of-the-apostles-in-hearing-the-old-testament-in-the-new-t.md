### TITLE
**The Use of Scripture in the Acts of the Apostles** - David W. Pao (essay in Hearing the Old Testament in the New Testament, 2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2000s evangelical and academic conversation about New Testament hermeneutics, canonical approaches, and early Christian use of the Old Testament; engages both historical-critical and theological readings of Acts.
 - Dialogue with scholarship on LXX usage, early Jewish interpretive methods (midrash), and narrative readings of Luke-Acts.

- **Central thesis**
 - Acts consistently employs the Old Testament (primarily the LXX) in **typological and fulfillment-shaped** ways to interpret the life, death, resurrection of Jesus and the apostolic mission - not as random proof-texting but as a deliberate narrative theology that reinterprets Israel's history around Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates patterns of citation, quotation formulae, allusion, and narrative appropriation across Acts.
 - Argues these patterns form a hermeneutical strategy:
 - Apostolic speeches recast Israel's Scriptures as fulfilled in Christ (e.g., prophetic texts applied to Jesus and to the church's mission).
 - Narrative scenes (e.g., Joel in Pentecost, Stephen's speech, Paul's synagogal address) show Scripture used to legitimate apostolic action and to reframe Israel's story.
 - Typology functions both as interpretive device and as theological claim: episodes in Israel's past are presented as foreshadowing or paradigmatic for Christ and the church.
 - Emphasizes the LXX as the operative textual matrix shaping Luke's intertextual moves.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Jewish interpretive practice (midrashic analogues), Septuagint textual studies, and contemporary scholars of Acts and Paul (e.g., those focusing on quotation/allusion, narrative theology).
 - Dialogues implicitly with reductionist readings that separate historical-critical source analysis from theological reading.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as interpretive key), Christology (Jesus as fulfillment), Covenant and election (continuity and redefinition of Israel), Ecclesiology (church as continuation/fulfillment of Israel's vocation), soteriology (Scriptural witness to salvation-historical events), hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - Acts reads and wields the Old Testament typologically and fulfillment-wise to narrate a continuity-and-transformation story: Israel's Scriptures find their decisive center in Christ and the apostolic mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Acts not merely as a repository of citations but as a **narrative-theological program** that systematically reinterprets Israel's Scriptures for Christian identity and mission.
 - Prioritizes **typology** as a coherent hermeneutical category rather than incidental rhetoric.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that reduce Acts' use of Scripture to ad hoc proof-texting or mere rhetorical appeal; insists on patterned, theologically motivated use.
 - Contrasts with strictly historical-critical accounts that separate author's theology from his use of Scripture; Pao integrates literary, theological, and historical perspectives.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames Luke-Acts' scriptural usage as a deliberate **fulfillment-typology complex**: fulfillment citations and typological recapitulation work together to reconfigure Israel's past for the present church.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in evangelical and academic studies of Acts for sharpening attention to typology and LXX context.
 - Cited by those advancing canonical, narrative, and theological readings of New Testament Scripture use; used in studies of mission theology and early Christian identity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a clear methodological model for reading Acts as Scripture-shaped narrative; valuable for preaching, teaching, and scholarly exegetical work that seeks to preserve theological coherence and historical sensitivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology**
 - Central hermeneutical category: Israel's events/figures cast as foreshadows fulfilled in Christ and the church.
- **Fulfillment**
 - Scriptural citations framed as fulfillment claims; not mere citation but theological closure of prior promises.
- **Septuagint (LXX)**
 - The primary textual horizon shaping Luke's quotations and allusions.
- **Citation formulae**
 - Speech openings and quotation markers that function to authorize apostolic interpretation.
- **Allusion vs. Quotation**
 - Distinguishes explicit citation from implicit literary echo; both are meaningful in Acts' theology.
- **Midrashic parallels**
 - Analogues to Jewish interpretive practices; shows creative, theological reading rather than literalist exegesis.
- **Narrative recapitulation**
 - The technique of retelling Israel's history so that episodes are paradigmatic for Christian events.
- **Apostolic hermeneutic**
 - The interpretive stance embodied by apostles and narratively endorsed by Luke.
- **Continuity and transformation**
 - Theological themes showing Israel preserved but redefined in Christ.
- **Scriptural authority**
 - Scripture functions as apologetic, catechetical, and formative authority in the narrative.
- **Prophetic fulfillment**
 - Use of prophetic texts to articulate Jesus' identity and mission.
- **Covenant imagination**
 - How Acts reinterprets covenant promises for the church's mission to Jews and Gentiles.
- **Mission rhetoric**
 - Scripture used to justify and authorize expansion to the Gentiles.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts' intertextuality (quotation + allusion).
 - As a **definition source** for typology and fulfillment in Luke-Acts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in mission and ecclesiology studies stressing scriptural legitimation of Gentile inclusion.
