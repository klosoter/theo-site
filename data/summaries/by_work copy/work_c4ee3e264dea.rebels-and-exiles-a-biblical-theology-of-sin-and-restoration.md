### TITLE
Rebels and Exiles: A Biblical Theology of Sin and Restoration - Matthew S. Harmon

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/Reformed academic milieu engaging canonical biblical theology, covenantal frameworks, and renewed interest in exile/return motifs in both Old and New Testament studies. Aimed at pastors, seminarians, and scholars rethinking sin and restoration through the Bible's own story.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Sin is best understood as covenantal rebellion that produces exile (relational, ecclesial, and spatial separation from God's presence); biblical restoration is the divinely initiated reversal of that exile in a covenantal, typological, and eschatological sequence centered on Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose: Scripture frames human disobedience primarily as rebellion against God's covenant claims, not merely as isolated moral failures.
 - Consequence: Rebellion issues in various forms of exile (garden/land loss, temple absence, political displacement, social fragmentation).
 - Promise: Divine responses (promises, covenants, prophetic word) aim at restoration - renewal of presence, people, place, and rule.
 - Fulfillment: Jesus construed as the decisive restoration - true Israel, faithful Davidic king, and temple-presencing agent inaugurating eschatological return.
 - Application: The church participates in restoration through covenant fidelity, worship, justice, and witness to the new-creation reality already begun.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Canonical witnesses (Genesis through Revelation) as primary interlocutors; engages classic covenantal and Reformed concerns about sin and atonement; dialogue with recent biblical-theological scholarship that emphasizes exile, typology, and inaugurated eschatology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sin (nature, corporate dimensions), covenant, narrative/typological theology, Christology (Christ as covenant head/true Israel/Davidic king), atonement (restorative scope), ecclesiology (people as renewed covenant community), eschatology (inaugurated/new creation), worship/temple presence.
- **Closing line:** The book frames the Bible's central drama as God calling rebels back from exile through covenantal, typological, and Christ-centered restoration, thereby relocating sin and salvation within corporate, historical, and eschatological horizons.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **rebellion** (covenantal infidelity) over purely forensic or individualistic accounts of sin.
 - Treats **exile** as a multi-layered category (spatial, liturgical, political, social) that clarifies both the damage of sin and the shape of restoration.
 - Places **Christ** centrally as the one who embodies Israel's faithfulness and thereby reverses exile structurally (king, temple, and people).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back on models that isolate sin as individual guilt without due attention to corporate and structural dimensions.
 - Offers an alternative to purely moralistic or therapeutic readings by returning to covenantal and narrative categories rooted in Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts familiar terms (sin, repentance, atonement) within an exile/restoration schema to underscore spatial and communal dynamics.
 - Uses the triplet **presence-people-place** (presence of God, people of God, land/temple) as a recurring diagnostic and constructive motif.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Useful in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles that value covenantal biblical theology; attractive for preachers and teachers who need a narrative frame for sin and salvation.
 - Likely used as a constructive resource rather than a polemical manifesto; stimulates conversation with both biblical theologians and pastors engaged in discipleship and social witness.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear, pastorally-oriented biblical-theological schema linking sin to exile and salvation to restoration.
 - Serves as a reliable bridge between exegetical detail and doctrinal synthesis-particularly for courses on sin, covenant, and biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rebel / Rebellion:** Sin framed as covenant breach; primary moral-political category for human disobedience.
- **Exile:** Consequence of rebellion; includes literal dispersion and metaphorical separation from divine presence and communal wholeness.
- **Restoration:** Divine work of reversing exile; involves presence, people, and place being renewed.
- **Covenant fidelity:** Central ethic; restoration hinges on God's faithfulness and the call for a restored faithful people.
- **True Israel / Typological Christology:** Jesus as the faithful Israel and Davidic king who embodies covenantal reversal.
- **Temple/Presence motif:** Temple as locus of God's presence; temple-loss and temple-restoration drive theological narrative.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / New creation:** Restoration is both already and not-yet; Christ inaugurates final return and renewal.
- **Corporate sin / Social dimensions:** Sin understood at communal and structural levels, not merely private moral failure.
- **Remnant / People of God:** Persistent theme emphasizing covenant continuity and the formation of a renewed covenant community.
- **Presence-People-Place triad:** Diagnostic grid for reading biblical episodes and mapping restoration.
- **Repentance/Return (teshuvah):** Restoration practice that has both individual and communal forms, oriented toward covenant reconciliation.
- **Atonement as restoration:** Emphasis on restorative and reconciliatory ends of Christ's work rather than only juridical categories.
- **Typology & Canonical Reading:** Uses typology within a canonical framework to show progressive fulfillment.
- **Justice & Worship integration:** Restoration requires liturgical renewal and social justice as signs of returned presence.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for sin-as-rebellion and exile-structure in biblical-theological courses.
 - As a **polemic** against individualistic or purely forensic accounts of sin and salvation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching canonical narratives (Genesis, exile-prophets, Gospels, Revelation) with an integrated covenantal frame.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesial formation curricula linking worship, mission, and social discipleship to restoration theology.
