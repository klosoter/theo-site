### TITLE
**The Christ of the Covenants** (O. Palmer Robertson, 1980, P&R) 

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed resurgence; debates with dispensationalism, rising Pentecostal/charismatic movements, and intramural disputes over Mosaic republication and the pactum salutis. Uses ANE treaty studies to frame biblical covenants.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture unfolds one unified, Christ-centered covenantal plan of redemption. A covenant is a **bond in blood sovereignly administered**; the covenants successively advance the **Immanuel principle** (God with us) culminating in Christ and the New Covenant.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Definition and method:** Covenant as divinely initiated, oath-sanctioned bond; canonical, redemptive-historical reading with typology disciplined by exegesis.
 - **Covenant with Creation (Adam):** Real covenantal arrangement with life/death sanctions; rejects reducing it to a pure works-contract while acknowledging probation under representative headship.
 - **Noahic covenant:** Stabilizes creation for redemptive history; common grace arena for special grace to unfold.
 - **Abrahamic covenant:** Promises of seed, land, blessing; oath-cutting and sign; international scope; Christ as the true Seed.
 - **Mosaic covenant:** Suzerain-vassal form; law serves pedagogical and typological functions within the one covenant of grace; not a covenant of works in substance.
 - **Davidic covenant:** Royal focus; messianic king as covenant head; trajectories to Christ.
 - **New Covenant in Christ:** Fulfillment and transformation, not abrogation of promise; Spirit-gifted people, new heart, final forgiveness; sacramental signs re-centered in Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Westminster standards, Geerhardus Vos, Ridderbos; ANE treaty scholarship (Mendenhall, Kitchen); interacts critically with dispensationalists (Scofield, Ryrie), and contrasts with Kline on republication emphases; cautious toward speculative intra-Trinitarian covenant formulations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and typology, covenant theology proper, federal headship, Christology (mediator, seed, king), pneumatology (Spirit as New Covenant gift), ecclesiology (church as the Israel of God), sacraments (signs of the covenant), eschatology (kingdom fulfillment; Romans 11 within a covenantal, non-nationalistic frame).
- **Closing line:** The one plan of God advances by covenants to bring **God with us** to its climactic realization in **Christ, the covenant Head**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Signature definition: **covenant = a bond in blood sovereignly administered**.
 - **Immanuel principle** as the unifying thread across covenants.
 - Strong, text-driven typology tying Adam, Abraham, Moses, David to Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **dispensationalism**: one people of God; promises to Abraham fulfilled in Christ and his body.
 - Against Mosaic **republication as to substance**: Mosaic law within covenant of grace; law exposes sin and tutors to Christ.
 - Nuances the prefall arrangement: prefers **Covenant of Creation** over a naked **Covenant of Works**, while retaining probation and sanctions.
 - Cautious on a rigid **pactum salutis** schema; stresses biblical economy and Christ as historical covenant head.
 - Charismatic claims: New Covenant gift of the Spirit normatively tied to word and sacraments, not ongoing revelatory sign-gifts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The memorable definition of covenant; the **Emmanuel principle**; attention to ANE treaty form without collapsing Scripture into ANE parallels.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Seminary staple for covenant survey; widely cited in Reformed defenses of infant baptism and ecclesial continuity.
 - Debated by Klinean republication advocates and by 1689 Federalists/New Covenant Theologians.
 - Shapes covenantal readings of Romans 11 that resist ethnic-restorationist eschatologies.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clear map of biblical covenants; exegetical care; Christocentric telos; portable categories for preaching and teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** A bond in blood sovereignly administered; oath-bound relationship with life/death sanctions.
- **Immanuel principle:** God-with-us presence as covenantal telos from Eden to New Creation.
- **Covenant of Creation (Adamic):** Prefall probation under federal headship; gracious fellowship with sanction-bearing stipulation.
- **Covenant of Grace:** One redemptive covenant administered through Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic economies, fulfilled in Christ.
- **Federal headship:** Representative role of Adam and Christ; frames guilt and righteousness (Rom 5).
- **Suzerainty-vassal treaty:** ANE form illuminating Mosaic covenant structure (preamble, stipulations, sanctions).
- **Oath and blood:** Covenant ratification by sacrifice; Genesis 15 as paradigmatic oath-cutting.
- **Seed motif:** Corporate and singular seed; climaxes in Christ and those united to him (Gal 3).
- **Typology:** God-ordained correspondences escalating from type to antitype; bounded by textual indicators.
- **Republication (debate):** Denies Mosaic covenant as works in substance; affirms pedagogical law use within grace.
- **Pactum salutis:** Treated cautiously; Christ undeniably functions as covenant head securing redemption.
- **New Covenant:** Eschatological administration with Spirit, new heart, definitive forgiveness; Christ as mediator.
- **Ecclesial continuity:** Church as Israel of God; baptism as covenant sign replacing circumcision in administration, including households.
- **Romans 11 and Israel:** All Israel read within covenantal unity; opposes nationalistic restorationism.
- **Spirit and gifts:** Spirit as New Covenant blessing; extraordinary revelatory gifts tied to redemptive-historical foundation, not normative.

- **How the work is used across loci:**
 - **Definition source:** Standard definition of covenant and organizing grid for biblical theology.
 - **Exegetical model:** Genesis 15, 17; Deuteronomic treaty patterns; Davidic promise read to Christ.
 - **Polemic:** Against dispensationalism, strong-form republication, and continuationist appeals to normativity of sign-gifts.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Frames Christology (covenant head), ecclesiology (one people), and eschatology (fulfillment structure, including Romans 11).
