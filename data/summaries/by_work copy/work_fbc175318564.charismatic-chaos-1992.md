### TITLE
Charismatic Chaos (1992) - John F. MacArthur

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1992 amid late-20th-century charismatic renewals: post-1970s Pentecostal/charismatic expansion, the "Third Wave" (power evangelism, Vineyard/Wimber), and rising controversies over manifestations (prophecy, tongues, healing).
 - MacArthur as conservative evangelical pastor/teacher (Grace Community Church; The Master's Seminary) writing from a Reformed-leaning, cessationist perspective with pastoral and polemical intent.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The contemporary charismatic movement promotes unbiblical, uncontrolled manifestations of the Spirit that undermine Scripture, church order, and sound doctrine; many charismatic practices are not from God but from psychological, demonic, or cultural sources.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic opening: catalogue of charismatic phenomena and personal/ pastoral encounters.
 - Biblical critique: exegetical arguments for cessationism and tests for authentic gifts; emphasis on canonical sufficiency and normative New Testament patterns.
 - Historical and sociological analysis: tracing modern charismatic leaders and movements, noting theological error and pastoral harm.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: warnings about authority, disorder in worship, vulnerability to deception, and the need for doctrinal recovery.
 - Practical recommendations: reaffirm Scripture as final authority, restore orderly worship, reject subjective "extra-biblical" revelation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Charismatic leaders and influencers critiqued: John Wimber, Benny Hinn, Kenneth Hagin, Kathryn Kuhlman (historical), and various "prophets" and evangelists.
 - Scriptural texts used for polemic: key pneumatological passages (1 Corinthians 12-14, Acts, 1 Thessalonians), sola Scriptura appeals, and Reformation/evangelical doctrine.
 - Anecdotal reports, journalistic and pastoral case studies; engagement with both popular charismatic literature and some theological responses.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology:** gifts (charismata), baptism in the Spirit, ongoing revelation.
 - **Revelation and authority:** sufficiency and finality of Scripture vs. extra‑biblical revelation.
 - **Ecclesiology and worship:** order, authority, pastoral oversight.
 - **Soteriology and sanctification:** implications of experientialism for assurance and discipleship.
 - Secondary attention to demonology (source of some manifestations) and epistemology (criteria for truth).

- **Closing line**
 - MacArthur's theological center of gravity: a robust sola Scriptura and cessationist pneumato logy insisting that Christian experience must be subordinated to biblical norm and orderly church authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Vigorous pairing of pastoral concern with polemical precision: not merely academic critique but practical warnings for congregations and leaders.
 - Repeated insistence that subjective spiritual experiences are epistemologically suspect unless disciplined by Scripture and ecclesial oversight.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with charismatic/continuationist claims for normative ongoing revelation and frequent miraculous gifts.
 - Challenges the Third Wave's emphasis on "power encounters" and openness to new prophetic word, asserting historic cessationism rooted in New Testament patterns.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized "charismatic chaos" as a label for the phenomenon of disorderly, unchecked manifestations.
 - Operational criteria for testing alleged prophetic or charismatic phenomena (consistency with Scripture, fruit, accountability).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative and Reformed circles; became a go-to polemic for cessationists in the 1990s.
 - Criticized by charismatics as caricatured and by some scholars for selective evidence; stimulated extensive debate and follow-up responses from continuity proponents.
 - Used in seminary curricula, pastoral training, and denominational discussions on worship and gifts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for understanding evangelical cessationist argumentation and pastoral precautions.
 - Serves as a concentrated snapshot of 1990s controversies; useful for teaching on pneumatology, discernment, and worship order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism**
 - The view that sign gifts (apostleship, prophecy, tongues as revelatory) ceased with the apostolic era; central organizing thesis.

- **Charismatic / Charismatic movement**
 - Broad term for those emphasizing current gifts/manifestations of the Spirit; MacArthur treats it as heterogeneous but mostly errant.

- **Charismatic chaos**
 - MacArthur's coinage for disorderly, uncontrolled manifestations and their ecclesial consequences.

- **Gifts/charismata**
 - Distinction made between gifts intended for apostolic-era foundation and normative spiritual gifts under Scripture's authority.

- **Tongues**
 - Treated as often ecstatic, non-apostolic language phenomena; contrasted with biblically normative glossolalia and xenolalia.

- **Prophecy (modern)**
 - Critiqued as often subjective, uncontrolled, and prone to error or deception; tested against Scripture and fruit.

- **Baptism in the Holy Spirit**
 - Distinguished from regeneration and conversion; MacArthur argues it is not a separate normative experience for post-apostolic Christians.

- **Power evangelism / Power encounters**
 - Term for evangelistic strategies relying on miraculous signs; criticized as manipulative and theologically unsound.

- **Sola Scriptura / extra-biblical revelation**
 - Central norm; extra-biblical "revelations" are rejected as authority and often suspect in origin.

- **Discernment**
 - Emphasized as pastoral duty; calls for testing spirits and prophetic claims.

- **Order in worship**
 - Priority on orderly, Scripture-governed worship (esp. 1 Corinthians 14).

- **Demonology / Deception**
 - Posits demonic activity as a plausible source of some charismatic phenomena.

- **Subjective experience**
 - Criticized as unreliable unless bounded by Scripture and church oversight.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** primer against modern charismatic practices and leaders.
- As a **definition source** for evangelical cessationism and tests for authentic gifts.
- As a **pastoral-exegetical model** for disciplining church worship and assessing alleged revelations.
