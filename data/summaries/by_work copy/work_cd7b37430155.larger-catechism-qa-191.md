### TITLE
**Westminster Larger Catechism Q&A 191: The Second Petition, Thy kingdom come**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 1640s Westminster Assembly, English Reformed orthodoxy amid civil conflict; catechetical explication of the Lord's Prayer within a confessional, covenantal, and ecclesial program.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** What is comprehensively asked when Christians pray, Thy kingdom come? Answer: the full advance of Christ's mediatorial reign in grace and power unto glory, through ordained means, over sin, Satan, the world, the church, and history.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Begin with human plight: by nature under the dominion of sin and Satan.
 - Petition for destruction of rival kingdoms: overthrow of sin and Satan's rule.
 - Petition for gospel advance: propagation throughout the world.
 - Petition for redemptive-historical ingathering: calling of the Jews and fullness of the Gentiles.
 - Petition for ecclesial order: church furnished with officers and ordinances; purged from corruption.
 - Petition for civil space: true religion countenanced and maintained by the magistrate.
 - Petition for effectual means: pure administration made effective to convert the lost and edify the saints.
 - Petition for internal reign and consummation: Christ ruling hearts now; hastening his second coming and our reigning with him forever.
 - Petition for providential governance: exercise of Christ's kingdom of power to serve these ends.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustinian two cities; Calvin on Christ's kingship and the church's polity; Reformed scholastic distinctions (kingdom of power/grace/glory); dialoguing against Rome (papal supremacy), Radical movements (antinomian/anabaptist perfectionism), millenarianism (Fifth Monarchists), and Erastian overreach.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and the means of grace; Christology (mediatorial kingship); Pneumatology (effectual application); Soteriology (conversion, sanctification, perseverance); Ecclesiology and ministry; Missiology; Eschatology (already/not yet); Providence; Covenant inclusion of Jew and Gentile.
- **Closing line:** The petition centers on Christ's kingly office ordering church and world unto the triumph of grace now and the glory to come.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Sweeping scope: personal, ecclesial, missional, civil, cosmic, and eschatological horizons in a single petition.
 - Explicit mention of the Jews' calling and Gentile fullness as prayer priorities.
 - Threefold kingdom frame implied: power (providence), grace (church), glory (consummation).
 - Strong stress on ordained means: officers, ordinances, pure administration, effectual operations.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against privatized spirituality: the kingdom is not merely inward but public and historical.
 - Against political messianism: the magistrate serves, but Christ alone rules the church.
 - Against Rome and sectarianism: reformed, ordered ministry and pure worship, not papal monarchy or charismatic disorder.
 - Against over-realized eschatology: present advance with prayerful longing for the Parousia, not triumphalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Catechetical fusion of missions and eschatology under one petition.
 - Integrating civil concern under Christ's kingdom of power to secure the church's peace and purity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - A standard Reformed lens for kingdom theology and prayer, widely cited devotionally and dogmatically.
 - The magistrate clause received nuanced reception in later American contexts; the missional and ecclesial emphases remain paradigmatic.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A compact map of the kingdom across loci; a practical intercession agenda aligned with confessional Reformed ecclesiology and eschatology.
