### TITLE
Biblical Faith and Natural Theology (1993) - James Barr

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century biblical scholarship reacting to renewed interest in natural theology across analytic philosophy and evangelical apologetics.
 - Barr writes from an Old Testament critical-historical and linguistic-hermeneutical posture, continuing his lifelong campaign against theological slippage caused by imprecise language and category mistakes.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible's witness to God and the nature of biblical faith cannot be reduced to or grounded in the projects of natural theology; appeals to "what can be known about God from nature" distort biblical categories and the character of revealed faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Conceptual groundwork: clarifies meanings of "know," "see," "revelation," and "knowledge of God" in biblical languages and genres.
 - Scriptural survey: examines key biblical texts often cited for natural theology (e.g., Psalm 19, Romans 1:18-20, Job, wisdom literature) and demonstrates they do not function as endorsements of a justificatory natural theology that grounds salvific faith.
 - Philosophical-theological critique: argues that natural theology imports philosophical assumptions (e.g., analogy of being, epistemic proofs) alien to biblical modes of disclosure and covenantal faith.
 - Theological consequence: insists that Christian faith is constituted by divine self-disclosure in history and covenant (special revelation), not by unaided rational inference from nature.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: selective engagement with Augustine, Aquinas, and medieval analogical traditions insofar as they shaped natural theology.
 - Modern interlocutors: critiques implicit and explicit toward contemporary defenders of natural theology and certain strains of apologetics; conversant with modern biblical-critical scholarship.
 - Barthian resonance: affinity with critiques of natural theology akin to Karl Barth's negative assessment, though Barr brings linguistic and exegetical tools rather than purely dogmatic argumentation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs general), knowledge of God, apologetics, soteriology (indirectly, insofar as grounds of faith affect justification), covenant theology implications, biblical hermeneutics, occasional treatment of anthropological texts related to Adam (see site usage).
- **Closing line**
 - Barr's central theological gravity: biblical faith is a response to particular divine self-revelation and must be defended on hermeneutical and revelatory, not merely natural-philosophical, grounds.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous linguistic and genre-sensitive exegesis as primary tool to evaluate claims about natural theology; attention to semantic range of biblical verbs like "to know" and idioms of "seeing" God.
 - Emphasis on the **covenantal and historical particularity** of biblical revelation as decisive for Christian faith.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges the classical Thomistic and Enlightenment confidence that nature provides a reliable justificatory route to knowledge of the triune God.
 - Closer to Barthian suspicion of natural theology but deploys philological and exegetical critique rather than purely dogmatic rejection.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinguishes carefully between descriptive "knowledge-of-God" talk within scripture and the epistemic claims of philosophically framed natural theology; highlights equivocations normally left unremarked in theological debate.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked substantial conversation among biblical scholars, theologians, and apologists; used by those skeptical of bridging arguments from natural revelation to saving faith.
 - Influential in ecclesial and academic circles that prioritize exegetical fidelity over systematic assimilation of philosophical natural theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a methodological corrective: teaches students and teachers to resist proof-texting and to attend to language, genre, and covenantal context when using Scripture in apologetic or systematic arguments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural theology**
 - The project of inferring truths about God from nature or reason apart from special revelation; Barr critiques its suitability for grounding biblical faith.
- **Biblical faith**
 - Faith constituted by response to divine self-revelation (special revelation) in covenantal and historical acts.
- **General revelation**
 - Divine disclosure in nature; treated as limited, descriptive, not salvific or justificatory in biblical terms.
- **Special revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure in Scripture and redemptive history; for Barr, the decisive locus for faith.
- **"Know/knowledge" (biblical semantics)**
 - Emphasizes range and context-dependent meaning; often relational or covenantal rather than epistemic in philosophical sense.
- **"See/seeing God" (biblical idiom)**
 - Often metaphorical, visionary, or ethical; not straightforward empirical warrant for theological proofs.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)**
 - Philosophical-theological premise underpinning much classical natural theology; Barr warns against importing it uncritically into biblical exegesis.
- **Proof-texting**
 - The practice of using isolated texts to prove philosophical theologies; Barr critiques its prevalence and misuse.
- **Covenantal particularity**
 - The idea that God's revelation and saving purposes are historically and covenantally located; central corrective to universalizing natural theology.
- **Historicity of Adam**
 - Barr cautions against grounding the doctrine of Adam's historicity or federal headship on natural-theological moves; he urges careful exegesis of Pauline and Genesis texts.
- **Federal headship**
 - The theological construct of Adam as representative; Barr stresses that biblical texts often require nuanced hermeneutical handling rather than assumption of straightforward natural-theological support.
- **Hermeneutical vigilance**
 - Key methodological posture recommended: attend to language, genre, and canonical context before drawing systematic or apologetic inferences.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against constructing apologetics or systematic theology that rests primarily on natural theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading texts invoked in debates about general revelation and doctrines like Adamic headship.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and debates that distinguish biblical modes of disclosure from philosophical claims about knowledge of God.
