### TITLE
**The Death of Character: Moral Education in an Age Without Good or Evil** - James Davison Hunter (2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published at the turn of the 21st century amid concerns about civic decline, culture wars, and the retreat of shared moral vocabularies in the United States.
 - Hunter writes as a sociologist of religion and public life addressing educators, clergy, and cultural critics; engages debates in moral psychology, education theory, and virtue ethics.
- **Central thesis**
 - Modern schooling and public institutions have largely abandoned robust moral formation; character has "died" as a public and shared project because moral discourse has been privatized, therapeuticized, and relativized.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: tracks historical and institutional shifts (progressive education, therapeutic culture, pluralism) that erode authoritative moral claims.
 - Mechanisms: shows how institutional incentives, curricular choices, and cultural sensibilities produce anemic moral vocabularies and fragmented moral authorities.
 - Consequences: diminished civic virtue, weakened vocational commitments, and inability of institutions to cultivate dispositions for the common good.
 - Prescription (implicit and practical): recovery of practices, institutions, and vocabularies capable of sustaining character formation-rooted in traditions that locate the good beyond expressive individualism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages educational theorists and psychologists (e.g., Lawrence Kohlberg), character-education debates (e.g., Thomas Lickona), and cultural critics (Alasdair MacIntyre's diagnosis of moral fragmentation is a resonant backdrop).
 - Dialogues with progressive pedagogy, the self-esteem movement, therapeutic culture, and liberal pluralism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Not a systematic theological treatise; nevertheless intersects with:
 - **Vocation**: formation oriented to duty and calling rather than self-expression.
 - **Cultural mandate / dominion**: implications for how Christians and institutions steward cultural goods and civic orders.
 - **Other theological loci** (revelation, covenant, Trinity, Christology) are not developed formally but the work presupposes a need for transcendent moral telos and communal anchors.
- **Closing line**
 - The book's theological center of gravity: moral formation requires ordered institutions and a publicly articulated good-without those, vocation and cultural stewardship become untethered and character withers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Institutional analysis: locates the crisis in structures and cultures of schooling and public institutions rather than merely in individual moral failure.
 - Focus on moral language and authority: shows how loss of shared moral vocabulary disables formative practices.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both libertarian individualism and technocratic schooling that treat moral education as neutral skill-building or identity validation.
 - Contrasts with Kohlbergian stage models by emphasizing social and cultural formation over cognitive moral reasoning alone.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Treats character decline as a sociological "death" produced by cultural ecosystems-invites thinking of moral formation as ecological and institutional.
 - Frames moral education as intertwined with civic and vocational goods rather than merely private virtue.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read across religion, education, and sociology; influential in conservative and religious discussions of education reform and civic renewal.
 - Criticized by some progressives for underestimating pluralism and by some secularists for implicit privileging of transcendent goods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative institutional critique useful for theologians and ministers thinking about formation, vocation, and the church's role in cultural renewal.
 - Serves as a bridge between sociological diagnosis and normative theological reflection on the cultural mandate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Character** - Dispositional moral integrity cultivated by institutions; the book's central casualty.
- **Moral education** - The pedagogical/institutional processes that form habits, commitments, and civic virtues.
- **Therapeutic culture / therapeutic ethos** - A prevailing orientation that prioritizes self-esteem, personal fulfillment, and emotional well-being over moral obligations.
- **Expressive individualism** - Cultural norm that centers self-realization as the primary telos, undermining communal moral claims.
- **Moral relativism / pluralism** - The fragmentation that makes authoritative moral language publicly contestable or privatized.
- **Institutions** - Family, school, church, civic bodies seen as primary loci for forming character; analyzed as having lost formative capacity.
- **Moral vocabulary / discourse** - Shared language for naming goods and evils; its erosion is a key mechanism of decline.
- **Vocation** - A telos-oriented notion of work and life calling; highlighted as an alternative framework to self-expression.
 - Relation: vocation grounds competence and service to the common good, connecting formation to dominion/cultural mandate.
- **Cultural mandate / dominion** - Theological-linguistic resource for envisioning communal stewardship and vocational responsibility in culture.
- **Moral ecology** - Hunter's implicit model for how cultural practices, institutions, and vocabularies interact to sustain or kill character.
- **Civic virtue** - Public-facing dispositions necessary for democratic life; diminished when character formation fails.
- **Moral authorities** - People and stories that instantiate and transmit the good (teachers, families, religious communities).
- **Formation practices** - Rituals, curricula, habits, and institutional incentives that create durable character.
- **Moral telos / transcendent good** - The notion that formation presupposes reference to a good beyond immediate subjective desires.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **diagnostic definition source** for debates on the crisis of moral education and civic decline.
 - As a **polemic** against therapeutic pedagogy, expressive individualism, and privatized morality.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theological conversations about vocation and the cultural mandate-informing ecclesial strategies for formation and public engagement.
