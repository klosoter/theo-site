### TITLE
Amillennialism and the Age to Come - Matthew Waymeyer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed/intellectual evangelical context: renewed scholarly interest in eschatological typology and covenantal readings of Scripture; dialogue with dispensational and premillennial paradigms.
 - Engages both historical (Augustine, Reformed) traditions and modern exegetical debates over Revelation and Pauline eschatology.

- **Central thesis**
 - The biblical "age to come" is best understood within an **amillennial, inaugurated-consummatory** framework: Christ's reign is real and present through the church, yet its final consummation (new heavens/new earth, final resurrection, judgment) remains future and decisive - not a literal thousand-year earthly reign.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical core: detailed readings of **Revelation 20**, key Synoptic kingdom sayings (Matt 24-25), Pauline texts (1 Cor 15; Rom 8), and Old Testament anticipatory texts.
 - Theological synthesis: integrates **covenant theology** (continuity of God's plan across ages) with **realized eschatology** (the kingdom is present in seed/administration) and future consummation.
 - Polemical moves: critiques literalist-millennial hermeneutics and dispensational segmentation of redemptive history; shows how apocalyptic symbolism and typology point to inaugurated-but-not-yet fulfillment.
 - Practical-ecclesial consequences: emphasizes Christian vocation in kingdom witness, patience under present affliction, and eschatological hope oriented to renewal rather than earthly triumphalism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive interlocutors: Augustine (classic amillennial precedent), Reformed theologians (post-Reformation covenantal interpreters), recent amillennial advocates.
 - Opponents engaged: classical and dispensational premillennialists, literalist interpreters of Revelation, some postmillennial optimism.
 - Secondary resources: Jewish apocalyptic background for Revelation symbolism; lexical studies on aion/aionios and related idioms.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennium, resurrection, final judgment, new creation)
 - Covenant theology (continuity/discontinuity across ages)
 - Christology (kingly reign, inaugurated kingdom)
 - Ecclesiology (church as bearer of present kingdom)
 - Soteriology and sanctification in light of already/not-yet eschatology
 - Revelation and hermeneutics (apocalyptic genre, typology)

- **Closing line**
 - Waymeyer proposes an amillennial hermeneutic that reads the "age to come" as covenantally continuous yet eschatologically decisive: Christ reigns now, and the church lives in hopeful witness until the final, comprehensive renewal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers the phrase **"age to come"** as the organizing theological motif rather than the chronological "thousand years," shifting focus from temporal chronology to covenantal fulfilment.
 - Stresses a hermeneutic that balances **symbolic/apocalyptic sensitivity** with grammatical-historical exegesis.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects literalizing tendencies in dispensational premillennialism by reinterpreting Revelation's millennium symbolically and covenantally.
 - Distinguishes itself from triumphalist postmillennial optimism by retaining a robust future consummation and final judgment.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Presents an operational frame sometimes labelled **"covenantal inaugurated eschatology"** - marrying inaugurated realities (present reign) with covenantal promises awaiting finalization.
 - Reframes "millennium" questions as primarily **soteriological/eschatological** rather than political or strictly chronological.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful within Reformed seminaries and amillennial circles as a concise, pedagogical resource; often cited in overviews of contemporary amillennial defenses.
 - Functions as a corrective in dialogues with dispensational scholars and in ecumenical conversations about apocalyptic interpretation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how a covenantal reading of Scripture yields both robust present hope and future expectation.
 - Valuable as a concise exegetical-theological synthesis for teaching eschatology and ecclesial ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Age to Come (ho aion mellon)** - central organizing motif: covenantal future inaugurated but not yet consummated.
- **Amillennialism** - interpretive stance denying a literal 1000-year earthly reign; sees the millennium as symbolic of Christ's present reign.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / Already-Not-Yet** - Christ's kingdom is present in seed form but awaits consummation.
- **Millennium** - in this work treated as symbolic/apocalyptic language pointing to present-reign + future consummation, not a literal chronology.
- **New Heavens and New Earth** - ultimate eschatological goal; the final, physical-spiritual renewal of creation.
- **Resurrection (general and intermediate state)** - bodily resurrection as the final consummation; interim presence of souls conscious with Christ until the final resurrection.
- **Final Judgment** - a decisive, post-consummation accounting aligning with covenantal justice.
- **Kingdom of God** - both present power and future realm; ecclesial and cosmic dimensions emphasized.
- **Covenant (old/new; continuity/discontinuity)** - structural grid for reading the ages; promises move toward final fulfillment.
- **Typology / Apocalyptic symbolism** - primary hermeneutical tools for Revelation and related literature.
- **Aion / Aionios** - lexical attention to "age/ages" language underpinning the work's thesis.
- **Realized eschatology** - emphasis on what Christ has achieved now as a basis for hope.
- **Apocalyptic genre** - used to justify non-literal readings of Revelation's numeric and symbolic data.
- **Ecclesial witness** - pastoral implication: church's present mission shaped by inaugurated kingdom.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary amillennialism and "age to come" framing.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational literalism and chronological millenarianism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Revelation 20, Pauline eschatology, and Synoptic kingdom sayings in covenantal-historical perspective.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking covenant theology to eschatology and ecclesiology.
