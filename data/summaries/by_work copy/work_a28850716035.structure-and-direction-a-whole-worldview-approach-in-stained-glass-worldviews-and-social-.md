### TITLE
Structure and Direction: A Whole Worldview Approach (Al Wolters, in Stained Glass: Worldviews and Social Science)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th-century Reformed engagement with social science and Christian worldview studies. Situated in the Reformational/Kuyperian conversation that seeks to apply biblical categories to cultural analysis; dialogues with social-scientific methods and with thinkers in the neo-Calvinist tradition (Kuyper, Dooyeweerd) and contemporary Christian social critics.
- **Central thesis:** A robust Christian social analysis requires attending to both the *structure* of created reality (stable, normative institutions and patterns) and its *direction* (teleological movement shaped by covenantal history, fall, redemption, and eschatology). Neglect of either element produces distorted theology or social theory.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose two common failures in social theory:
 - Analytic accounts that emphasize static structures without theological telos (structure-only social science).
 - Teleological or progressive accounts that prescind from created order and institutional limits (direction-only ideologies).
 - Propose the **structure-and-direction** schema as a synthetic tool:
 - *Structure* = created norms, institutions, roles, differentiated cultural spheres grounded in Genesis and common grace.
 - *Direction* = covenantal history, sin's deforming influence, Christ's redemptive trajectory and eschatological consummation.
 - Show how this pair clarifies vocation, dominion, and the cultural mandate: Christians partake in stewardship of structures while oriented toward redemptive ends.
 - Apply the schema to social-scientific questions to correct reductionism and ideological teleology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Kuyperian/Reformational heritage (implicit Kuyper/Dooyeweerd themes), biblical texts (Genesis creation mandate, redemptive-historical motifs), conversation partners in social science critique and Christian social thought.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation and providence (order and normativity), sin and fall (distortion of direction), covenant (framework for direction), vocation and the cultural mandate/dominion, eschatology (final direction), implicit appeal to common grace and the lordship of Christ.
- **Closing line:** Theology that informs social understanding must hold together the *ordered fabric* of created life and its *redemptive teleology*-only then can vocation and cultural mandate be both responsible and hope-filled.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - The explicit binary of **structure** (what is established by creation) and **direction** (where history aims under covenant and redemption) as the analytic core for social theology.
 - Framing vocation and dominion not as abstract mandates but as tasks inside created structures oriented toward Christ's consummating rule.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** 
 - Corrects secular social science that treats institutions as value-neutral structures or mere variables.
 - Counters theological narratives that over-spiritualize direction (eschatology) while neglecting the normative texture of present institutions.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Repurposes Reformational insights into a concise, usable heuristic for interdisciplinary dialogue: a twofold lens that is both descriptive (structure) and normative-teleological (direction).
- **Reception and influence:** Widely cited in Reformed worldview and Christian social thought as a clarifying framework for applying Scripture to social sciences, education, and public policy. Functions as a moderate corrective to both pietistic privatization and militant cultural-political triumphalism.
- **Enduring value:** Offers teachers and students a portable analytic that connects biblical theology and concrete cultural analysis; preserves theological coherence while enabling responsible social critique and praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Structure:** Created institutions, roles, and normative patterns that give stability and intelligibility to cultural life.
- **Direction:** The teleological vector of history shaped by fall, promise, Christ's work, and eschatological hope.
- **Vocation:** The calling to exercise stewardship within structures toward redemptive ends.
- **Cultural mandate / Dominion:** The Genesis charge to populate, steward, and cultivate creation-interpreted through structure+direction.
- **Creation order / normativity:** The ontological grounding for structures and norms apart from merely contingent social arrangements.
- **Teleology / eschatology:** The forward-looking dimension that judges and orients present structures toward consummation.
- **Common grace:** The theological account explaining continuity and genuine good within non-Christian structures and social science data.
- **Sin / distortion:** The explanatory factor for why structures do not automatically fulfill intended direction.
- **Institutional analysis:** Attention to social forms (family, polity, economy, church) as structured realities with vocationallyembedded norms.
- **Worldview approach:** Holistic interpretive stance that situates empirical social inquiry within theological categories.
- **Social-scientific critique:** Use of structure+direction to evaluate secular methods that separate facts from final ends.
- **Normative order:** The binding moral contours embedded in created structures.
- **Practical theology:** Application of the schema to pastoral, educational, and policy-oriented contexts.
- **Redemptive-historical orientation:** Reading structures in light of covenantal story rather than abstract moralism.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for integrating vocation and dominion within a coherent worldview.
 - As a **polemic** against both secular reductionism in social science and theologically ahistorical spiritualizing of cultural engagement.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** or pedagogical tool for teaching how biblical theology informs social analysis and public praxis.
