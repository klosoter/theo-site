### TITLE
Commentary on Zechariah - Didymus the Blind (c. 4th cent., Alexandria)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 4th-century Alexandrian exegesis; Didymus (Didymus the Blind) taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria and wrote within the Origenist interpretive horizon while defending Nicene commitments against Arian and Pneumatomachian pressures.
 - Work functions as homiletic-exegetical commentary relying on the Septuagint and Alexandrian allegorical/typological method.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Zechariah is read christologically and pneumatologically: the prophet's visions disclose the Messiah and the sovereign, personal activity of the Holy Spirit as the divine agent empowering prophecy, restoration and sanctification.
 - A secondary polemical aim: to demonstrate the **personhood and deity of the Holy Spirit** against denials.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Sequential exegesis of Zechariah's visions, with repeated moves:
 - Literal-historical reading of the vision.
 - Typological identification of the figures (e.g., Branch as Christ).
 - Pneumatological application: Spirit as active, divine cause of Israel's restoration and prophetic speech.
 - Key exegetical anchor: Zechariah 4:6 ("Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit") is treated as a scriptural proof-text for the Spirit's independent divine agency.
 - Uses Zechariah's sacramental and eschatological imagery (cleansing fountain, anointing, seven eyes) to argue for the Spirit's sanctifying, revelatory and omniscient functions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy use of canonical Scripture, Septuagintal readings, and Origenic-Alexandrian exegetical techniques.
 - Implicit polemical interlocutors: Arians and Pneumatomachians who diminished Son/Spirit; didactic readers in catechesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and prophecy, Christology (messianic identification), pneumatology (personhood, deity, functions), eschatology and ecclesial sanctification.
- **Closing line**
 - Didymus frames Zechariah as an authoritative witness that the Holy Spirit is a personal, divine agent whose presence and power, not human strength, accomplish God's restorative and messianic purposes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, repeated exegetical linking of Zechariah 4:6 and surrounding imagery to the **person and divinity** of the Spirit - not merely as power but as a subject performing salvific acts.
 - Integration of Christological and pneumatological readings: the Spirit's work is consistently presented as inseparable from the messianic economy.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves to correct literalist or modalist readings that reduce the Spirit to impersonal force or to a mere mode of God's activity.
 - Argues against Pneumatomachian tendencies by treating the Spirit's attributes (omniscience, sanctifying efficacy, origin in God) as marks of deity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes functional markers (prophetic inspiration, sanctification, witnessing) as criteria for attributing personalhood and divinity, rather than abstract metaphysical definitions.
 - Uses typology (Branch, fountain, oil) to map OT-symbols onto the Spirit's vocational profile.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Eastern patristic circles as a compact Alexandrian pneumatological witness; later Origenist controversies affected reception but Didymus's pastoral-exegetical insights remained influential for Byzantine commentators.
 - Less direct impact on Reformed systematic treatments, but cited as early patristic evidence for Spirit-personhood and deity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies a careful, text-rooted defense of Spirit-deity from OT witnesses; useful for teaching pneumatology, patristic exegesis, and the continuity of Trinitarian argument from Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit (Pneuma)** - treated as a personal actor in Zechariah's visions, not an impersonal force.
- **Divinity of the Spirit** - ascribed by referencing divine actions and attributes (inspiration, sanctification, omniscience).
- **Personhood** - inferred from personal agency and relational activity (speaks, anoints, dwells).
- **Zechariah 4:6 ("Not by might…by my Spirit")** - primary proof-text for Spirit's role as determining cause of divine victory.
- **Branch (tsemach)** - messianic title mapped to the Spirit's anointing and Christological fulfillment.
- **Fountain/Cleansing (Zech 13:1 imagery)** - used to illustrate the Spirit's cleansing and sanctifying operation.
- **Seven eyes / lampstand imagery** - read as symbols of divine omniscience and the Spirit's revelatory function.
- **Septuagintal reading** - Didymus relies on LXX linguistic nuances to draw theological inferences.
- **Typology / allegory** - method for linking OT images to New Testament pneumatology.
- **Pneumatomachian (polemic)** - implicit adversary; Didymus's exegesis counters this denial of Spirit's deity.
- **Sanctification / anointing** - practical functions used to argue for personal, continuous Spirit activity.
- **Origin / procession language (circumscriptive)** - affirms Father as divine source without later Latin filioque formulations.
- **Prophecy / inspiration** - Spirit as the immediate cause of prophetic speech and insight.
- **Homoousios (contextual)** - theological horizon: Nicene commitment to shared divine essence undergirds his ascription of deity to Spirit.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: early patristic witness for Spirit's personhood and divinity grounded in OT exegesis.
- As a **polemic**: concise rebuttal-model against Pneumatomachian denials.
- As an **exegetical model**: exemplary Alexandrian typological reading connecting OT imagery to Trinitarian pneumatology.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: employs functional attributes (inspiration, sanctification) to move from text to theological claim.
