### TITLE
Story as Torah: Reading Old Testament Narrative Ethically - Gordon J. Wenham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical British OT scholarship; Wenham writes from conservative, confessional evangelical milieu with strong interest in biblical theology and faithful exegesis of narrative texts.
 - Responds to rise of narrative criticism, ethical criticism, and debates over the normative status of OT narratives in contemporary Christian ethics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Old Testament narrative functions as Torah: narratives do moral work comparable to legal material by shaping identity, judgment, and behavior; they teach ethics through exemplars, plot consequences, and depiction of the covenantal God rather than by explicit legal propositions alone.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Genre matters: narrative communicates differently than law but can be equally normative.
 - Narratives present paradigms (exemplars and anti-exemplars) that form communal imagination and moral habits.
 - Ethical reading must attend to:
 - the narrator's moral perspective and evaluation,
 - the character of God revealed,
 - covenantal context and the narrative's canonical placement.
 - Narratives instantiate divine norms by showing the operation/consequences of obedience and disobedience within salvation-history trajectories.
 - Concludes with implications for contemporary Christian ethics: responsible appropriation requires interpretive judgment, canonical theology, and attention to eschatological telos (e.g., new creation).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broader narrative-ethical conversations: narrative critics, theological interpreters, and legalists who marginalize narratives.
 - Implicit contrasts with scholars who treat narrative as merely descriptive or as non-normative background for legal material.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (narrative as disclosure of God's character and will)
 - Covenant (narrative as story-shaped covenantal instruction)
 - Ethics / moral formation (virtue formation via exemplars)
 - Eschatology (narrative teleology pointing to God's new creation; relevance to New Heavens and New Earth)
 - Biblical hermeneutics / authority (how narrative contributes to canonical normativity)

- **Closing line**
 - Wenham insists that to read the OT ethically is to read its stories as formative Torah: they do not replace law but function as covenantal instruction that shapes communal identity and anticipates the new creation toward which God is moving.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats narrative explicitly as a vehicle of Torah - i.e., law as formative story - rather than treating law and story as rival genres with distinct normative weight.
 - Prioritizes narratorial evaluation and the community's canonical reception as keys to ethical application.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - reductive legalism that confines Torah to legal codes,
 - relativistic readings that dismiss biblical narrative as merely historical or non-normative,
 - facile allegorization or moralizing that divorces story from covenantal particularity.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Story as Torah" functions as an interpretive category: narratives are seen as prescriptive by example, not necessarily by explicit command.
 - Emphasizes the role of exemplarity and plot consequences as moral pedagogy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in evangelical and Reformed circles as a corrective to either over-legalizing or anecdotal readings of OT narrative.
 - Influential for preachers, ethicists, and biblical-theologians seeking to integrate narrative into moral instruction.
 - Some conservative readers welcome its affirmation of OT moral force; some critics press for clearer criteria for normative transfer.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined framework for appropriating OT stories ethically: attention to narrator, covenantal context, and eschatological telos makes it durable for preaching, teaching, and ethical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Narrative as Torah**
 - The central coinage: narratives function as formative law by exemplifying covenantal norms.

- **Exemplar / Anti-exemplar**
 - Characters presented for imitation or avoidance; moral teaching through personhood and action.

- **Narratorial evaluation**
 - The narrator's implicit/explicit judgments that guide reader interpretation and ethical assessment.

- **Covenantal context**
 - The interpretive grid anchoring narrative action in God's promises, obligations, and covenant consequences.

- **Genre-sensitive normativity**
 - Normativity that recognizes different vehicles (law, narrative, prophecy) but affirms canonical ethical force.

- **Moral formation / habitus**
 - The communal and vocational shaping of dispositions through repeated narrative engagement.

- **Canon / canonical placement**
 - The interpretive importance of where stories sit within the whole Scripture and their role in theological trajectory.

- **Eschatological telos (New Heavens and New Earth)**
 - Narratives are teleological: they point forward to God's final work, informing present ethics by orienting hope toward new creation.

- **Imitatio Dei**
 - Reading narratives as invitations to reflect God's character in community life (prudential, not merely prescriptive).

- **Hermeneutical prudence**
 - Requirement for careful judgment when transferring narrative models to contemporary contexts.

- **Typology / foreshadowing**
 - Narrative personas/events as anticipatory patterns fulfilled in Christ and consummated in the new creation.

- **Practical theology use**
 - Applied in sermon ethics and discipleship to shape imagination and practice.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for "narrative ethics" and the claim that narrative can be normative Torah.
- As a **polemic** against readings that either nullify OT narratives' moral force or read them simply as laws in disguise.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching and classroom interpretation that integrates narrator, covenant, and canon.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Old Testament narrative formation to New Testament fulfillment and eschatological ethics (including reflection on the New Heavens and New Earth).
