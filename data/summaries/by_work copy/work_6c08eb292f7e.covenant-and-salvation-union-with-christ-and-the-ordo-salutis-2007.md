### TITLE
**Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ and the Ordo Salutis** (2007), Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Third volume in Hortons covenantal dogmatics (2002-2008), amid debates on New Perspective on Paul, Federal Vision, and ecumenical participation theologies.
 - Reformed ressourcement with attention to Calvin, Reformed orthodox, Bavinck, Vos; critical engagement with Barthian actualism and Mannermaa-style theosis.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Union with Christ** is the integrating center of salvation, covenantally and trinitarily construed, such that the **ordo salutis** (application) arises from and is ordered by the **historia salutis** (accomplishment) without collapsing the forensic into the transformative or vice versa.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reframes the ordo as a set of **distinct yet inseparable benefits** of union (duplex gratia: justification and sanctification) received by faith through the Spirit, via Word and sacrament.
 - **Covenantal ontology**: relations promised and enacted by God create the saving reality; avoids both abstract substance-metaphysics and sheer existential actualism.
 - **Forensic-ontic coordination**: imputation and renewal are coextensive gifts of union; justification is constitutive for definitive sanctification, with sanctification as its fruit.
 - **Pneumatological agency**: the Spirit as bond of union works through external means; election in Christ and effectual calling locate assurance extra nos.
 - **Ecclesial location**: salvation is ordinarily delivered in the churchs ministry; sacramental realism without sacramentalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive: Luther, Calvin, Reformed orthodox (Olevian, Ursinus, Witsius, Turretin), Bavinck, Vos, John Murray.
 - Critical-conversational: Barth and Torrance (christological actualism), New Perspective (Sanders, Dunn, Wright), Finnish Luther (Mannermaa), Federal Vision, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox accounts of participation and merit.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and covenant; Trinity and missions; Christology (mediator, covenant head); Pneumatology (bond of union); Anthropology (image, agency, freedom); Soteriology (election, calling, faith, repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, glorification); Ecclesiology and sacramentology; Assurance.
- **Closing line**
 - The **gospel is a covenantal, Spirit-mediated union with the crucified and risen Christ**, in which **forensic justification grounds transformative sanctification**, administered through Word and sacrament in the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers the ordo on **union with Christ** rather than on a mechanistic sequence.
 - Strong **law-gospel** and **extra nos** accents alongside robust participation and renewal.
 - **Means-of-grace realism**: the Spirits uniting work is ordinarily through proclamation and sacraments.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **participation-only** models that blur or relativize imputation; against **forensic-only** reductions that marginalize renewal.
 - Pushes back on **Barthian actualism** that dissolves covenantal and forensic structures; critiques **New Perspective** reductions of justification to boundary-marking; resists **Federal Vision** covenantal objectivism that threatens sola fide.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Covenantal ontology** and **communicative agency** (drawing on speech-act sensibilities) as a grammar for how Gods promised act creates salvific reality.
 - Tight integration of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** within an **already/not yet** eschatology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed dogmatics to stabilize the justification-sanctification relation under the umbrella of union.
 - Offers a mediating but confessional stance amid early 2000s Pauline and ecumenical debates; cited for its ecclesial-sacramental retrieval.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a **coherent map** for teaching salvation that is doctrinally Reformed, pastorally churchly, and dialogically engaged with contemporary scholarship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ (unio cum Christo)**: The Spirit-wrought relation by which believers partake of Christ and all his benefits; the structural center of salvation.
- **Ordo salutis**: Logical ordering of the applications of redemption; reframed as facets of union rather than a rigid temporal sequence.
- **Historia salutis**: Once-for-all accomplishment in Christ; norming context for the ordo.
- **Duplex gratia**: The twin benefits of union, **justification** (forensic) and **sanctification** (renewal), inseparable yet non-identical.
- **Forensic justification**: Gods judicial declaration in Christ, by imputation, received through faith alone.
 - Contrasted with: any model that makes justification a mere process of moral transformation.
- **Definitive and progressive sanctification**: New-creation break with sin (definitive) issuing in lifelong renewal (progressive) grounded in justification.
- **Adoption**: Filial status in the Son by the Spirit; coordinates with justification and sanctification as benefits of union.
- **Effectual calling/regeneration**: Spirits efficacious summons through the gospel, creating faith and uniting to Christ.
- **Faith (fiducia)**: Spirit-given receiving instrument, created by the Word; not a virtue that merits.
- **Means of grace**: Preaching and sacraments as ordinary instruments of union and communion.
- **Law-gospel distinction**: Hermeneutical and pastoral grammar preserving gratuity while directing sanctification.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace**: Federal backdrop for Adams probation and Christs federal headship.
- **Already/not yet**: Eschatological tension structuring assurance, holiness, and hope.
- **Spirit as bond of union**: Calvinian theme grounding the participatory dimension in pneumatology rather than ontology.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for union with Christ, duplex gratia, and ordo/historia relations.
 - As a **polemic resource** against NPP, Federal Vision, and over-realized participation theologies.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** integrating soteriology with covenant, ecclesiology, and sacramentology.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** for reading Pauline salvation in covenantal and eschatological terms.
