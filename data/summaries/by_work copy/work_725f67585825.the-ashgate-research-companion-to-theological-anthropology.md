### TITLE
The Ashgate Research Companion to Theological Anthropology - edited by Joshua R. Farris and Charles Taliaferro

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary interdisciplinary theological scholarship situated at the intersection of analytic philosophy of religion, historical theology, biblical studies, and the cognitive/biological sciences. Responds to late 20th-21st century debates about mind, personhood, and embodiment in a post-Darwinian, neurobiological age.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To reconceive classical Christian accounts of human nature (imago Dei, soul, personhood, sin, destiny) in light of analytic philosophical rigor and scientific advance, defending robust theological anthropology against both naive dualism and reductive naturalism.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of **historical** perspectives (Patristic, medieval, Reformation, modern) to show persistent questions and resources.
 - **Philosophical** chapters that analyze personhood, consciousness, mental causation, free will, and personal identity using contemporary analytic tools.
 - **Biblical and theological** treatments connecting exegesis (Genesis, Psalms, Pauline anthropology) with systematic loci (Christology, soteriology, eschatology).
 - **Interdisciplinary dialogue** with neuroscience, evolutionary theory, psychology, and ethics to test and refine models of embodied agency and moral responsibility.
 - Concluding reflections on eschatological restoration and the resurrection as definitive vindication of a theologically coherent anthropology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Barth, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Darwin; contemporary philosophers and scientists (analytic philosophers of mind, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists). Wide use of classical biblical texts (Genesis, Paul) and systematic loci (Trinity, Christology).
- **Doctrines treated:** Imago Dei, soul and body, personhood, freedom and moral responsibility, sin/hamartiology, Christological assumptions about human nature (incarnation), eschatology/resurrection, creation and providence, sociality and covenantal life.
- **Closing line:** The volume argues that a viable theological anthropology is necessarily interdisciplinary: it must preserve theological commitments (incarnation, resurrection, imago Dei) while engaging contemporary philosophy and science to articulate an embodied, relational, and eschatologically oriented account of the human person.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong commitment to **embodiment** and sociality as central to personhood rather than treating the soul as a detachable, private substance.
 - Persistent appeal to **trinitarian and Christological categories** as formative for a relational account of human persons.
 - Methodological pluralism that legitimizes both historical-theological exegesis and analytic philosophical argumentation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against both Cartesian substance dualism and reductive materialist eliminativism, offering intermediate models (hylomorphic or emergentist accounts).
 - Critiques some modern theological treatments that neglect scientific data or philosophical clarity, while also critiquing philosophers who ignore theological commitments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Renewed use of **"constitutive sociality"** and **"relational imago Dei"** as shorthand for persons formed by interpersonal and Trinitarian relations.
 - Nuanced deployment of **emergentism** and **nonreductive physicalism** within a theological frame that preserves eschatological continuity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted as a reference in graduate-level courses on theological anthropology, philosophy of religion, and interdisciplinary theology.
 - Valued across traditions for its analytic clarity; used by Reformed, Roman Catholic, and evangelical scholars for its careful balance of theology and philosophy.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Comprehensive bibliographies and constellation of models make it a durable starting point for research.
 - Functions as a bridge between historical theology and contemporary analytic/scientific debate, useful for thesis formation and syllabus design.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theological anthropology:** The study of human nature from theological commitments (creation, fall, redemption, consummation).
- **Imago Dei:** Theological locus for human dignity; in this volume stressed as relational/functional rather than merely substantial.
 - Contrast: substantive (soul-based) vs relational/trinitarian readings.
- **Personhood:** Analytic and theological criteria for what constitutes a person (continuity, consciousness, relational capacity, moral agency).
- **Soul (psyche/anima):** Historical and contemporary models examined-substance dualism, hylomorphism, and nonreductive physical approaches.
- **Embodiment:** Emphasis on bodily constitution of agency, cognition, and moral responsibility.
- **Hylomorphism:** Aristotelian account resurfaced as plausible theological alternative to Cartesianism and reductive materialism.
- **Emergentism / nonreductive physicalism:** Philosophical positions defended as compatible with theological commitments to resurrection and personal continuity.
- **Relationality / constitutive sociality:** Persons are primarily constituted in relations (Trinitarian analogy, covenantal community).
- **Christological anthropology:** How the incarnation and resurrection inform normative claims about human nature.
- **Eschatology / resurrection:** Final vindication and transformation of embodied persons; used to adjudicate acceptable models of personal persistence.
- **Sin / hamartiology:** Account of moral disorder that preserves responsibility in light of scientific accounts of human psychology.
- **Moral agency & virtue:** Integration of ethical formation with neuroscientific constraints and theological norms.
- **Neuroscience dialogue:** Careful engagement - not capitulation - to empirical findings about brain and cognition.
- **Methodological pluralism:** Explicit endorsement of multiple legitimate methods-historical, biblical, philosophical, scientific.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary theological accounts of imago Dei and embodied personhood.
 - As a **polemic** against both reductive naturalism and uncritical dualism.
 - As an **exegetical-conceptual model** linking biblical anthropology (Genesis, Paul) to systematic claims about incarnation and resurrection.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on personal identity, moral responsibility, and the theological reception of neuroscience.
