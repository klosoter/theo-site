### TITLE
**John Murray, "Calvin on the Atonement" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Westminster Reformed milieu; post-war retrieval and consolidation of classic Reformed doctrine.
 - Reprinted in Collected Writings vol. 4; aims to settle debates about Calvin's teaching vis-a-vis later Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin taught a **penal, substitutionary, priestly** atonement of **definite design and intrinsic efficacy**, not a merely hypothetical or universal provision; Murray shows the **unity of oblation and intercession** as decisive for the atonement's **extent**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Textual survey of Calvin's Institutes and commentaries on key loci (e.g., Isaiah 53; John; Romans; Hebrews).
 - Clarification of atonement terms: **expiation, propitiation, reconciliation, redemption, satisfaction**.
 - Argument from Christ's **priestly office**: the one for whom He offers Himself are those for whom He intercedes; scope of intercession determines scope of atonement (John 17; Heb 7).
 - Analysis of **intent, extent, efficacy**: the atonement accomplishes what it intends; application is embedded in accomplishment, not separable.
 - Handling universal language (world, all): exegetical specificity; distinguishes **sufficiency** from **designed efficiency** without collapsing into hypothetical universalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **Calvin** primary; medieval formula (Lombard's sufficiency/efficiency); alignment with **classic Reformed orthodoxy**.
 - Contrasts with **Amyraldian** hypothetical universalism; corrects modern claims of a Calvin vs. the Calvinists rift.
 - Resonances (not dependence) with **Owen** on definite atonement; avoids commercial reductionism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology**: Calvin's exegesis governs dogmatics; lexical and contextual attention to universal terms.
 - **Covenant theology**: Christ as **surety** and **mediator** of the covenant; federal headship frames substitution.
 - **Trinity/Christology**: priestly oblation to the Father; Spirit's application presupposed by efficacy.
 - **Soteriology**: justification by imputation, reconciliation, redemption accomplished/applied.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments**: atonement grounds visible church and sacramental participation in the benefits of Christ.
 - **Eschatology**: victory over death and the devil as fruits of propitiatory satisfaction.
- **Center of gravity**
 - The atonement is **priestly, penal, particular, and intrinsically effective**, with **intercession coterminous** with oblation for the elect.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Intercession-atonement unity** as a governing hermeneutic for extent.
 - **Intrinsic efficacy**: redemption is not mere provision but effectual achievement for its intended objects.
 - **Exegetical precision** in handling universal terms; pastoral sobriety in doctrinal formulation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects **hypothetical universalism** as alien to Calvin's own categories.
 - Nuances the **sufficiency/efficiency** formula to avoid implying an undirected or two-track divine will.
 - Does not rest the case on a **commercial transaction** motif; anchors it in priestly ministry and covenant **suretyship**.
- **Conceptual/terminological contributions**
 - Consolidates the now-familiar idiom **redemption accomplished and applied**.
 - Clarifies distinctions among **expiation, propitiation, reconciliation**, and their entailments for imputation and justification.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Frequently cited in debates over the **extent of the atonement** and the **Calvin vs. the Calvinists** narrative.
 - Influential within confessional Reformed circles; a staple reference for teaching penal substitution and definite atonement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of **biblically grounded, historically sensitive** dogmatics.
 - Offers a stable reference point for catechesis, preaching, and advanced study on atonement across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement**: Christ's priestly work in death, effecting reconciliation by substitutionary satisfaction.
- **Penal Substitution**: Christ bears the penalty due to sinners as their vicarious representative.
- **Satisfaction**: The meeting of divine justice in Christ's obedience unto death, securing pardon.
- **Expiation**: Removal of sin/guilt.
 - In Calvin/Murray: inseparable from propitiation.
- **Propitiation**: Pacification of God's wrath by Christ's sacrifice.
- **Reconciliation**: Change of relation God-ward achieved by the cross and applied by the Spirit.
- **Redemption**: Liberation by ransom price; stresses efficacy and accomplishment.
- **Imputation**: Legal reckoning of sin to Christ and righteousness to believers.
- **Suretyship (Heb 7:22)**: Christ as covenant guarantor who discharges the liabilities of His people.
- **Intercession**: Ongoing priestly prayer for the same people for whom He died; coextensive with oblation.
- **Extent vs. Intent**: The atonement saves those it is designed to save; design defines extent.
- **Sufficiency/Efficiency**: Christ's death of infinite sufficiency; efficiency limited to the elect by divine design.
- **Union with Christ**: The framework within which substitution and application cohere.
- **Duplex Gratia**: Justification and sanctification as twin benefits flowing from the same accomplished redemption.
- **Free Offer**: Universal proclamation grounded in the richness of Christ's sufficiency, not universal intent.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source**: standard for penal substitution and definite atonement in Christology/Soteriology.
 - **Polemic**: rebuttal to hypothetical universalism and Calvin-vs-Calvinists theses.
 - **Exegetical model**: handling of universal terms and the intercession-atonement linkage.
 - **Conceptual pivot**: links covenant suretyship, union, and ecclesial-sacramental practice to the cross's efficacy.
