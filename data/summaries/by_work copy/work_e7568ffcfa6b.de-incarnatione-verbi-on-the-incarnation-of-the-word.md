### TITLE
**De Incarnatione Verbi (On the Incarnation of the Word)** - Anselm of Canterbury

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 11th century Latin West; Benedictine monastic theology at the cusp of scholastic method. Written in the wake of Roscelin of Compiegne's tritheistic claims; engages Augustinian-Trinitarian grammar using Boethian person/nature distinctions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the unity of the divine essence and the orthodox claim that the one divine Word assumed a complete human nature without division or confusion, thus preserving both Trinitarian monotheism and the integrity of Christ's person and natures (cf. Hypostatic Union; Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Expose and rebut tritheism: three persons are not three substances; one simple essence subsists in three persons.
 - Clarify subject of incarnation: not the divine nature, nor the Trinity as a whole, but the Son (the Word) assumed human nature; the assumption is of nature, not of a human person.
 - Rule of predication: properties and acts are predicated of the one person according to either nature; divine operations remain inseparable, yet the Son is uniquely incarnate.
 - Safeguard Christ's impeccability and sinlessness as fitting to the union and mission of the Word (cf. Impeccability Of Christ).
 - Police language: avoid Nestorian division and Eutychian confusion; maintain that what is said of Christ is said of one and the same person under distinct natures (communicatio idiomatum in a carefully delimited sense).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine and Boethius as conceptual scaffolding; patristic councils (Nicaea, Ephesus, Chalcedon) as doctrinal horizon; Roscelin as immediate foil; indirect correction of Arian, Nestorian, and Eutychian trajectories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (unity of essence, distinction of persons), Christology (incarnation, two natures, predication, impeccability), soteriology (fitness of the mediator), theological language and logic.
- **Closing line:** The one Word of God, remaining what he was, fittingly assumed what he was not, so that without change in deity and without division in person, humanity is united to God for our salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Person, not nature, is the subject of incarnation and of predicates; operations are attributed according to nature.
 - Strong account of inseparable operations reconciled with the unique mission of the Son.
 - Fittingness (convenientia) arguments that harmonize metaphysics and soteriology.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against Roscelin: rejects nominalist tritheism by reasserting real distinction of persons within numerically one essence.
 - Against Nestorianism: no assumption of a human person; against Eutychianism: no mixing or conversion of natures; in line with Chalcedon's without confusion, change, division, separation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear deployment of the Boethian person/nature grammar to regulate Christological predication.
 - Early, precise Latin formulation of the theopaschite rule: One of the Trinity suffered in the flesh, grounding careful communicatio idiomatum.
 - Tightly reasoned account of impeccability as consequent upon the hypostatic union.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Prefigures scholastic method; taken up by Aquinas on personhood and predication.
 - Cited by Reformed scholastics for two-natures clarity and for the extra Calvinisticum implication that the Word remains uncircumscribed by the flesh.
 - Valued ecumenically as a lucid Latin witness to Chalcedonian orthodoxy.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model for how metaphysical clarity safeguards gospel confession.
 - A primer in reading Trinitarian and Christological loci together without collapse or separation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word (Verbum):** The Son, eternal and consubstantial with the Father, subject of incarnation.
- **Person (persona):** A subsistent relation; the who that assumes and suffers.
- **Nature (natura):** The what in which operations inhere; basis for attributing properties.
- **Assumption (assumptio):** The Word's taking of complete human nature, not a human person.
- **Hypostatic union:** Personal union of two complete natures in the one person of the Word (see: Hypostatic Union).
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Predication of properties of either nature to the one person; not a transfer of essences.
 - Guards against saying the divine nature suffers, while affirming God the Son suffered according to the flesh.
- **Inseparable operations:** All external divine works are indivisible; yet missions are appropriated personally.
- **Appropriation:** Fitting assignment of works to persons without dividing essence or operation.
- **Impeccability:** Christ could not sin, grounded in the person of the Word sustaining the human will (see: Impeccability Of Christ).
- **Theopaschite rule:** One of the Trinity suffered in the flesh; regulates passion language.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** Christ is one person in two natures, without confusion or division (see: Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine).
- **Fittingness (convenientia):** Rational congruity showing why the incarnation befits God's wisdom and goodness.
- **Tritheism:** Error of positing three substances; explicitly refuted.
- **Nestorianism / Eutychianism:** Twin errors avoided by person-nature clarity.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a doctrinal grammar source for defining person vs nature across Trinity and Christology.
 - As a polemical template against tritheism and Christological confusions.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking inseparable operations, missions, and Christ's unique incarnation.
 - As an exegetical-linguistic model for predication about Christ in Scripture and creeds.
