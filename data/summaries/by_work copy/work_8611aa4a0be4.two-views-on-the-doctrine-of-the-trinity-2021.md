### TITLE
Two Views on the Doctrine of the Trinity (2021) - Stephen R. Holmes; Thomas H. McCall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Anglican/evangelical conversation in analytic and historical theology (early 21st century). Published as a direct comparative volume in the "Two Views" format to foreground two rival constructive proposals and their responses.
 - Sits at the intersection of historical patristic retrieval, systematic concerns (divine simplicity, personhood), and recent philosophical theology on persons and relations.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The book stages two contrasting proposals about how to conceive the Trinity so as to do justice both to biblical witness and to classical doctrinal commitments: How are three divine persons related to one divine being without falling into modalism or tritheism? Each author proposes a different answer with theological and philosophical implications.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Each author (one taking a more classical/Western approach, the other a more relational/social approach) sets out a positive case:
 - Exposition of theological and biblical data bearing on the Trinity.
 - Systematic articulation of how persons and divine being relate (ontology of relations).
 - Implications for Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology.
 - Each then replies to the other's position, focusing on alleged failures: either abstraction and loss of personhood (critique of classicism) or collapse into ontological plurality/tritheism (critique of social models).
 - Final rejoinders sharpen distinctions over grounding of relations, the role of divine simplicity, and the proper method for moving from economic to immanent Trinity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic sources: Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa), Augustine.
 - Medieval and Reformation figures via doctrinal categories (Aquinas; later Western tradition).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: recent social/relational trinitarian proponents and analytic theologians (broadly represented), commentators on divine simplicity, and philosophers of personhood.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (primary), with sustained interaction with: divine simplicity, relations of origin, personhood, immanent vs economic Trinity, Christology (implications for incarnation and atonement), revelation and language about God, ecclesial and moral consequences.

- **Closing line**
 - A focused, dialogical presentation of two rival frameworks that forces readers to weigh historical fidelity, philosophical coherence, and pastoral consequences when theorizing the relation of threeness to oneness in God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The dialogical "two views" format makes polemic and constructive correction explicit: each view is given space to develop and to answer objections, not merely to be summarized.
 - Strong attention to methodological fit: how epistemology (what we can say about God) shapes metaphysical claims about persons and relations.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on facile conflations: e.g., against caricatures that social trinitarianism equals tritheism and that classicalism necessarily effaces personhood.
 - Reengages patristic texts with contemporary analytic tools, seeking a middle path between uncritical patristic appropriation and modern reductionism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and applies distinctions such as *constitutive vs. relational* accounts of personhood within the Trinity, and reframes debates about the ontological status of intra-divine relations for a lay- and academic-audience.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in classroom and seminar settings as an introductory paired treatment of current Trinitarian options.
 - Cited in evangelical and Anglican contexts as a fair-structured resource that highlights practical doctrinal stakes (preaching, worship, pastoral theology).

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact pedagogical resource and a compact primer for further research: useful for students to locate themselves in the modern debate and for instructors to assign a balanced pro/con encounter.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God is in himself (intra-divine life); central to debates about metaphysical grounding of relations.
- **Economic Trinity** - God as revealed and acting in history; used to test any account of the immanent Trinity by reference to Scripture and salvation history.
- **Divine simplicity** - The thesis that God has no metaphysical parts; invoked to resist accounts that make relations ontologically prior to unity.
- **Relations of origin** - Fatherhood, sonship, spiration as explanatory loci for distinct persons; debated in how literally these explain personhood.
- **Personhood (intra-Trinitarian)** - The nature of "person" in God; whether personhood is constituted by relations or by subsistent simplicity.
- **Social (relational) Trinitarianism** - Emphasizes interpersonal relations as constitutive of divine life and personhood; highlights relationality and community as theological analogies.
- **Classical (Augustinian/Western) Trinitarianism** - Emphasizes unity of divine essence and priority of being over relations; stresses divine simplicity and analogical language.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling; used to explain unity without loss of distinction.
- **Constitutive vs. Relational ontology** - Whether relations make persons what they are (constitutive) or express distinctions within a prior unity (relational).
- **Hypostasis** - Technical term for person; deployed historically and analytically to articulate three subsistences in one ousia (being).
- **Ontological vs. Economic priority** - Debates whether immanent structure determines economic actions or vice versa.
- **Tritheism / Modalism (as critiques)** - Charges leveled against social and classic accounts respectively; book uses them as diagnostic tools to refine positions.
- **Analytic patristics** - Use of analytic philosophical tools to read and appropriate patristic categories.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: concise contrasts between competing Trinitarian frameworks for classroom primers.
 - Polemic: a tool for sharpening critiques and defending theological commitments in intra-evangelical and ecumenical debate.
 - Exegetical and conceptual pivot: a springboard for linking biblical-theological data to metaphysical claims about persons and relations.
