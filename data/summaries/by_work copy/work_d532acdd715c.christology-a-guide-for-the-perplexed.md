### TITLE
**Christology: A Guide for the Perplexed** - Oliver D. Crisp

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century analytic-theological engagement with classical Christian dogma. Written within the "Guide for the Perplexed" genre to orient advanced students and pastors amid contemporary philosophical and historical complications. Situated in broadly Reformed/evangelical conversation but attentive to ecumenical patristic and medieval sources.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To clarify what it means to confess Jesus Christ as fully God and fully human in one person, to map the conceptual options available, and to show how Christian orthodoxy (properly understood) can answer philosophical objections about knowledge, will, passibility, and identity without incoherence.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: Historical and doctrinal landscape - surveys patristic, Chalcedonian, medieval, Reformation, and modern positions; sets up the key puzzles (e.g., divine omniscience vs. incarnate ignorance; immutability vs. suffering; two natures and personal identity).
 - Part II: Conceptual taxonomy - explicates models (Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Chalcedonian dyophysitism, kenotic options, two-minds/two-consciousness models, dyotheletism vs. monothelitism).
 - Part III: Analytic assessment - applies contemporary metaphysics of persons, properties, and constitution to evaluate rivals; examines communicatio idiomatum, the hypostatic union, and the compatibility of divine attributes with genuine human limitations.
 - Part IV: Soteriological and ecclesial implications - connects christological options to atonement, mediation, resurrection, and worship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Key patristic authors (Athanasius, Cyril), Chalcedon, Maximus the Confessor, medieval scholastics (Anselm, Aquinas), Reformers (Luther, Calvin), Karl Barth, and contemporary analytic theologians and philosophers of religion.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (as backdrop), hypostatic union, incarnation, kenosis, communicatio idiomatum, Christ's knowledge and will(s), atonement theories, resurrection and exaltation, sinlessness, mediation.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Crisp aims to vindicate a philosophically coherent, theologically faithful Christology that preserves Chalcedonian commitments while allowing for careful analytic nuance about how divine and human properties cohere in the one person of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous use of analytic metaphysics (persons, properties, constitution) rather than only historical-theological exegetical method.
 - Prioritizes conceptual clarity about what counts as a coherent union of natures and about what kinds of property attribution are permissible.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against simplistic kenotic or two-minds accounts that either collapse the personhood of Christ or fail to account for genuine human limitations.
 - Rehabilitates a qualified Chalcedonian dyophysitism against both reductionist naturalism and some post-Barthian over-corrections.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear taxonomy of contemporary models (e.g., distinct articulation of "two-minds" vs. "two-consciousness" approaches) and systematic criteria for assessing them.
 - Nuanced account of communicatio idiomatum using contemporary analytic resources (distinguishing types of predication/transference).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in analytic and evangelical academic circles as a concise, clear introduction that bridges historical orthodoxy and contemporary philosophy.
 - Frequently cited in debates on kenosis, Christ's knowledge, and the viability of dyotheletism in analytic theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact map of options with philosophical tools for assessment; excellent as a seminar primer and for pastors wanting to navigate advanced questions without losing theological rigor.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation:** The eternal Son taking human nature; central case-study for problems treated throughout.
- **Hypostatic union:** The doctrine that in Christ two natures are united in one person; analyzed for coherence and modes of predication.
- **Chalcedonian dyophysitism:** The traditional formula "two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation"; treated as the default to be clarified, not merely repeated.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying):** Interpretive options for Philippians 2:5-11; evaluated philosophically against risks of divestment of divine attributes.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** How properties of both natures are ascribed to the one person; Crisp distinguishes forms of property attribution and constraints.
- **Dyotheletism / Monothelitism:** Debate over one versus two wills in Christ; analyzed with attention to will as aspect of nature and implications for freedom and obedience.
- **Two-minds / Two-consciousness models:** Contemporary attempts to explain human/divine mental life in Christ; categorized and critiqued for personal integrity.
- **Divine impassibility vs. passibility:** How divine immutability relates to Christ's suffering and emotional experience; Crisp examines compatibilist strategies.
- **Atonement (Christus Victor, penal substitution, moral influence):** Linked to christological commitments; different christologies favor different soteriological frameworks.
- **Pre-existence & incarnation timing:** Philosophical problems about identity over time and the beginning of the human nature of the Son.
- **Resurrection and exaltation:** How post-resurrection identity bears on the unity of person and continuity of natures.
- **Sinlessness and human fallibility:** Distinction between genuine human limitations and moral incapacity for sin.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source**: Clear taxonomy and working definitions for classroom and research on modern christological options.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: Supplies analytic tools to translate patristic formulations into contemporary metaphysical language.
- As an **exegetical and polemical model**: Employed to critique inadequate popular christologies and to defend a refined Chalcedonian orthodoxy in ecumenical and evangelical contexts.
