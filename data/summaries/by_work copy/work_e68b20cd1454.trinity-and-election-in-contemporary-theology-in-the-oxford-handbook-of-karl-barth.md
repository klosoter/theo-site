### TITLE
**Trinity and Election in Contemporary Theology** - Bruce McCormack (in The Oxford Handbook of Karl Barth)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century scholarly debate about the relation of the Trinity to election; McCormack writes as a leading Barthian interpreter working within Anglo-American and Continental Barth reception.
 - Situated in renewed interest in Barth's dogmatics as corrective to both classical Reformed predestinarianism and modern immanent-Trinity reconstructions (e.g., Rahner, Pannenberg, Jenson).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - McCormack contends that Barth's *reformulation* of what Rahner had enjoined (commonly called "Rahner's Rule") relocates **election** as the decisive link between the economic and the immanent Trinity: election is not merely a consequence of Trinitarian relations but the primary Trinitarian act that defines God's being and revelation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Rahner's Rule: the methodological claim that we may speak of the immanent Trinity only insofar as it is disclosed in the economic Trinity.
 - Presentation of Barth's critique and reworking: Barth accepts the basic insight that God is known in God's acts but refuses Rahner's tendency to treat the immanent Trinity as speculative background; instead Barth posits **election** (the Father's election of the Son in the Spirit) as the inner-Trinitarian decision that grounds all economic action.
 - Demonstration of theological consequences:
 - Election becomes the ontological and revelatory center of the doctrine of God.
 - Christology and soteriology are thereby internal to the doctrine of God, not external appliqués.
 - The economic/immanent distinction is preserved but reconfigured: revelation discloses the inner life rather than merely corresponding to it.
 - Assessment of contemporary interlocutors and consequences for systematic loci (creation, covenant, eschatology).
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Karl Barth (central), Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), with reference to contemporary theologians who inherit or contest this reorientation (e.g., Jenson, Pannenberg, Moltmann).
 - Barth's own dogmatic texts (CD) are the primary source material; McCormack reads these attentively for doctrinal moves on election and the Trinity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic vs immanent), Election (eternal/Trinitarian), Christology, Revelation, Soteriology, and the doctrine of God's personhood and action.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth's reformulation-relocating election to the heart of Trinitarian ontology-reorients modern theology so that God's being is understood as decisively eventful and Christologically disclosed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Elevates **election** from a soteriological sub-topic to the central Trinitarian act that constitutes God's identity and relation to creation.
 - Treats revelation not as mere disclosure but as constitutive of the immanent life of God insofar as God is who elects the Son in the Spirit.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - To Rahner: McCormack (via Barth) resists treating the immanent Trinity as an ontological substrate to which economic acts merely correspond; instead election is the internal Trinitarian decision that must be read from the economy.
 - To speculative ontologies: critiques attempts to ground election in metaphysical necessity or static ontological categories.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts Rahner's Rule into a **Barthian axiom**: knowledge of God's being is shaped by the divine decision revealed in Christ - election as formative principle.
 - Emphasizes a performative ontology: God's being is evental (the "being" of God is in His deciding).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Barth scholarship and among Reformed theologians who want a Christocentric Trinitarian theology that preserves divine freedom without speculative projection.
 - Provoked debate with theologians who defend stronger forms of Rahnerian immanence or who prioritize social-trinitarian models (perichoretic relationality).
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for integrating doctrine of God and Christology; a durable corrective to both speculative immanence and crude predestinarianism.
 - Serves as a methodological exemplar for reading classical dogma through confessional and biblical priorities.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The methodological dictum that "what God has done in history is to be ascribed to the inner life of God." McCormack shows Barth reformulates its implications rather than simply accepting its metaphysical move.
- **Election**
 - Central Trinitarian act in Barth's reading: the Father's eternal choosing of the Son in the Spirit-constitutive of God's identity and primary locus of revelation.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as God is disclosed in God's actions; the sphere in which election and revelation occur.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God as God in himself; McCormack explains Barth's reconfiguration that the immanent life must be read from the economy (via election) without collapsing the distinction.
- **Christocentrism**
 - The theological posture that Christ is the decisive key to knowing God; used here to anchor election within the person and work of the Son.
- **Performative/decisional ontology**
 - The idea that God's being is essentially active (deciding/electing) rather than static substance.
- **Revelation as constitutive**
 - Revelation does not merely disclose a pre-existing inner life but participates in constituting our access to the immanent Trinity.
- **Perichoresis / relationality**
 - Background relational language; McCormack notes Barth affirms relationality but centers election as the specific relational act that binds Father, Son, Spirit.
- **Christology-Trinity nexus**
 - The linkage showing how doctrine of Christ governs Trinitarian doctrine through election.
- **Anti-speculative move**
 - Barthian corrective to speculative metaphysics; McCormack highlights this as central to contemporary uptake.
- **Analogy to loci**
 - Election functions as a pivot for reading other loci (creation, covenant, eschatology).
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: supplies a Barthian definition of election suitable for dogmatic entries.
 - As a **polemic**: employed against Rahnerian immanence and speculative Trinitarian accounts.
 - As an **exegetical model / conceptual pivot**: used to reconfigure Christology, soteriology, and revelation around the Trinitarian decision called election.
