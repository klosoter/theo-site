### TITLE
Covenant and Justification Debate (ed. Mark W. Karlberg) - Norman Shepherd (contributions and reception) 

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed debate; roots in Shepherd controversies at Westminster (1970s-1980s) and the later *Federal Vision* discussion. The edited volume collects contemporary essays and responses that revisit Shepherdian covenantal emphases within ongoing disputes over sola fide and covenant theology.
 - Milieu: conservative Reformed/Presbyterian confessionalism wrestling with covenantal readings of Paul and the relation of justification to covenant obedience.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Shepherd reframes justification within a covenantal account: justification is received by faith but must be understood in the context of covenantal union with Christ and covenantal obedience. This raises the question whether justification is strictly forensic/imputed or intrinsically tied to covenantal faithfulness (and thus to dispositions/works).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reasserts **faith as covenantal response**: faith is trusting, relational, and expressed in covenant obedience rather than a purely propositional assent.
 - Emphasizes **union with Christ and covenant status** as the locus of salvation blessings; justification is the covenantal bestowal of status grounded in Christ's work and received in covenantal faith.
 - Argues that **imputation and sanctification** cannot be kept entirely compartmentalized: the ethical fruit and covenantal obedience have a bearing on how justification is understood and experienced.
 - Moves from exegetical work on Pauline texts (notably Romans) to historical-theological engagement with Reformed standards.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Pauline exegesis (esp. Romans), **Westminster Standards**, Augustine and Calvin as historical touchstones.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: defenders and critics within the Federal Vision debate (e.g., proponents like Peter Leithart, critics like Michael Horton and others in confessional Reformed circles).
 - The collection situates Shepherd against traditional readings of imputation and sola fide.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic vs. covenantal account), union with Christ, covenant theology, faith and works, imputation (active/passive), baptismal union, sanctification, soteriological assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: a covenantal reframing of justification that presses the Reformed dichotomy between forensic imputation and covenantal obedience, provoking re-evaluation of how **faith, works, and covenant status** interrelate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places **covenant union** and covenantal obedience at the center of justification discourse rather than treating justification first as a legal declaration.
 - Treats **faith as inherently covenantal and ethical**, not merely an instrumental trust; obedience is the vocation of faith, not an extrinsic appendix.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges a strictly forensic-legal model dominant in classical Protestant formulations (Westminster/Calvinic summaries) by insisting that covenantal status and persevering faith shape the understanding of justification.
 - Pushes back on a sharp separation of justification and sanctification favored by many 20th-century Reformed theologians.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "faith" language to highlight **covenantal obedience**; sometimes described by critics as importing a different soteriological grammar (covenantal nomism-like emphases within a Reformed frame).
 - Emphasizes **status-in-union** over isolated forensic categories as the operative paradigm.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly controversial: mobilized formal ecclesiastical responses and sustained public debate. Influenced strands of the Federal Vision movement and provoked clarifying responses from confessional Reformed critics.
 - Continues to function as a touchstone in discussions about how to preserve sola fide while accounting for covenantal ethics and ecclesial markers (e.g., baptism, church discipline).

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes needed re-examination of soteriological categories; useful for testing coherence between covenant theology and Pauline forensic language.
 - Valuable as a case-study in how confessional communities negotiate doctrinal boundary maintenance and theological development.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification by faith** - central phrase; Shepherd affirms it but reads it through a covenantal-locative lens.
- **Forensic justification** - the legal-declarative model which Shepherd critiques as insufficient when isolated from covenant context.
- **Union with Christ** - the ontological/covenantal ground that Shepherd highlights as the locus of status and blessing.
- **Covenant / covenantal obedience** - primary frame: faith is a covenantal response entailing obedience; obedience shapes covenant life.
- **Imputation (active/passive)** - debated element: Shepherd's account raises questions about how (or whether) active obedience is imputed apart from covenantal union.
- **Faith as obedience** - key formulation: faith conceived not merely as assent but as faithful covenantal comportment.
- **Sanctification** - preserves ethical transformation; Shepherd blurs strict functional separation between justification and sanctification.
- **Baptismal union** - sacramental sign tied into covenantal standing and the debate over objective covenant membership.
- **Sola fide** - contested locus: Shepherd claims fidelity to sola fide but redefines its implications within covenantal structures.
- **Confessional standards (Westminster)** - serve as the measuring rod in critics' assessments.
- **Federal Vision** - broader movement with affinities to Shepherdian emphases (objective covenantal benefits, ecclesial marks).
- **Eschatological perseverance** - plays into how covenant faithfulness is read as part of the justification narrative.

How the work is used:
- As a **polemic** in debates over sola fide and covenant theology (both by critics and defenders).
- As a **conceptual pivot** for rethinking relations among union with Christ, covenant status, and forensic declaration.
- As an **exegetical model** for covenantal readings of Pauline texts (especially Romans).
- As a **definition source** for contemporary Federal Vision-related positions and for courses on modern Reformed controversies.
