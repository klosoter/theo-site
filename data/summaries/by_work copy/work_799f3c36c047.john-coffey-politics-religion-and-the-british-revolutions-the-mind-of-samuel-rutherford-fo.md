### TITLE
Politics, Religion and the British Revolutions: The Mind of Samuel Rutherford (John Coffey) - contextual background for Patrick Gillespie's milieu

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century British Revolutions (Scotland, England, Ireland); Covenanter movement and Presbyterian ascendancy; debates over monarchy, magistracy, and church polity. Coffey's study (early 21st-century scholarship) situates Samuel Rutherford within these crises and the broader intellectual networks of the period.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Rutherford's political theology is best understood as an integrated product of pastoral exegesis, covenantal doctrine, and practical responses to revolutionary politics: he constructs a theology that binds political authority to covenantal obligations, thereby legitimating limited resistance to tyrannical rulers.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Traces Rutherford's thought from pastoral letters and sermons to his political tracts.
 - Demonstrates how covenantal vocabulary (including intra-Trinitarian and federal themes) functions as the conceptual engine of his political prescriptions.
 - Situates Rutherford against royalist, Erastian, and some moderate Presbyterian interlocutors; shows continuities and divergences with continental and English Puritan resistance traditions.
 - Concludes that Rutherford's thought both justified coercive measures against sinful rulers and insisted on strict moral limits grounded in scripture and covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Samuel Rutherford (sermons, letters, Lex, Rex and other tracts).
 - Scottish Covenanter leaders and writers (e.g., Alexander Henderson), royalists, English Puritans, and continental Reformed texts.
 - Contextual reference to contemporaries whose political theology intersects with Rutherford's (e.g., Milton and republican strands, as counterpoints).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (federal structure: Covenant of Works/Grace; use of Covenant of Redemption motifs).
 - Church-state relations (Presbyterian polity vs Erastianism).
 - Authority, magistracy, and resistance theory (lesser magistrate, contractual obligations of rulers).
 - Biblical exegesis as normative source and pastoral application.
- **Closing line**
 - Coffey argues that Rutherford's theological mind makes covenant doctrine the hinge between pastoral theology and political praxis: the polity must answer to covenanted righteousness, and when rulers break that covenant, limited, scripturally regulated resistance becomes theologically intelligible.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes Rutherford's pastoral identity: political prescriptions flow from pastoral concern for covenant fidelity, not abstract political theory.
 - Highlights the theological density of his political language-especially the use of federal theology to justify political constraints.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Rutherford to a simple resistance theorist or proto-republican; Coffey shows nuance-Rutherford upheld order and magistracy while delimiting royal absolutism.
 - Contrasts Rutherford with both royalist divine-right formulations and with more radical republicanism; he is neither absolutist nor Jacobin.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-reads political categories through the lens of covenantal categories (e.g., rulers as covenantal heads under God).
 - Brings the Covenant of Redemption (intra-Trinitarian and federal connections) into discussion of political obligation-showing theological origins for political binding.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among later Covenanters and Presbyterian political praxis; modern scholars use Coffey to map the theology-politics nexus in the British revolutions.
 - Rehabilitates Rutherford's status as a major political theologian of the period rather than a marginal pastor.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a methodological model: read political theology through pastoral exegesis and covenantal categories.
 - Useful corrective against overstated secularization narratives about early modern political thought.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Federal notion of intra-Trinitarian agreement underpinning salvation; Coffey shows Rutherford's broader use as a theological analogue for political covenants binding rulers and people.
- **Covenant of Grace / Covenant of Works**
 - Traditional federal categories; used to explain Christ's headship and moral requirements placed upon Christian polity.
- **Lex, Rex**
 - Rutherford's articulation that law (lex) rules even kings (rex); shorthand for his argument that rulers are subject to covenant-law and scripture.
- **Magistracy / Lesser Magistrate**
 - Office of civil authority; lesser magistrate doctrine legitimates subordinate authorities to oppose or resist higher magistrates when covenant obligations are violated.
- **Presbyterian polity**
 - Church governance model central to Covenanter claims against Erastian royal control of churches.
- **Erastianism**
 - The thesis that the civil magistrate has ultimate authority over the church; Rutherford counters this, insisting on church covenantal autonomy under Christ.
- **Resistance theory**
 - Doctrinal toolkit for justifying opposition to tyrants; Rutherford's version is restrained, covenant-grounded, and pastoral rather than revolutionary.
- **Covenanted nation / national covenant**
 - The idea that a nation can enter corporate covenantal obligations before God; core to Scottish Covenanter identity and Rutherford's political ethics.
- **Pastoral exegesis**
 - Method: reading scripture with pastoral care that yields political as well as spiritual prescriptions.
- **Natural law / conscience**
 - Resources Rutherford appeals to in evaluating rulers' legitimacy under covenant obligations.
- **Political headship / federal head**
 - Concept of rulers as heads bound by covenant, analogous to Christ's headship under different terms.
- **Scriptural jurisprudence**
 - Use of biblical law as normative for civil governance and penal corrections.
- **Binding of kings**
 - The legal-moral accountability of monarchs within covenant terms.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **contextual definition source** for understanding mid-17th-century covenantal political theology (e.g., in reading Gillespie's milieu).
- As a **polemic and historiographical model** for linking pastoral theology to public political action-used in studies of resistance theory and church-state relations.
