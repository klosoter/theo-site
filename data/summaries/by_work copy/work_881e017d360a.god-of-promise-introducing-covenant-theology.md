### TITLE
**God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology** - Michael S. Horton (Baker, 2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Early 21st-c. Reformed retrieval (WSC-California); Klinean federal theology; debates with Dispensationalism, New Perspective on Paul (NPP), and Federal Vision. Increased use of ANE treaty studies and biblical-theological method.
- **Central thesis:** The triune God orders revelation and redemption covenantally: a prelapsarian **covenant of works** with Adam, and one unfolding **covenant of grace** consummated in Christ. Scripture is a covenant canon; law/gospel must be distinguished for assurance and faithful exegesis.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Covenant defined:** Oath-based, legal-personal relationship; ANE suzerainty and grant forms illumine biblical covenants; canon as covenant document with sanctions.
 - **Creation/Works covenant:** Adam under probation toward eschatological Sabbath-rest; real works principle; federal headship and imputation.
 - **Covenant of grace:** Unilateral promise to Abraham; Mosaic administration includes a typological republication of the works principle for national/temporal tenure; Davidic royal grant; New Covenant in Christ fulfills all conditions.
 - **Christ and salvation:** Christ as last Adam and true Israel; active/passive obedience; justification as forensic, by faith apart from works; good works as fruit, not merit.
 - **Church and sacraments:** Visible/invisible distinction; Word and sacraments as covenant **means of grace**; baptism and Supper as oath-signs sealing promises; assurance anchored in God's external word.
 - **Ethics and culture:** **Intrusion ethics** explain holy war/theocracy as eschatological foretaste; ordinary life governed by **common grace** under natural law; two-kingdoms contours.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Calvin, Westminster Standards, Vos, Kline; engages Murray and O. P. Robertson; critiques Ryrie/Scofield (Dispensationalism), Dunn/Wright (NPP), Shepherd/Federal Vision; interacts with Lutheran law/gospel and Reformed scholastic categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (general/special; Scripture's self-attestation), theology proper (divine faithfulness), anthropology (federal headship), Christology, soteriology (justification, sanctification, assurance), ecclesiology, sacramentology, ethics.
- **Center of gravity:** God binds Himself by promise and, in Christ, supplies the condition He demands, delivering His gifts through Word and sacrament.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Robustly **Klinean**: Mosaic republication, royal grant vs suzerainty, intrusion ethics.
 - Strong **law/gospel** hermeneutic for preaching and assurance.
 - Sacraments as **oath-signs** that objectively deliver Christ per promise.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against **Dispensationalism**: one people/covenant of grace; Christ-centered typology; church not a parenthesis.
 - Against **monocovenantalism/Federal Vision**: retains a real works covenant; rejects covenantal faithfulness as instrument of justification.
 - Against **NPP**: defends forensic justification and imputation; "works of the law" not mere boundary markers.
 - Nuances classic Reformed by explicit **republication** and two-kingdoms/common-grace ethics.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves:**
 - Scripture as **covenant canon**; sacraments as **oath-signs**; **grant vs law** covenants; **intrusion** as ethical category.
- **Reception / influence:**
 - Standard entry-point to confessional/Klinean covenant theology in churches/seminaries.
 - Frequently cited in debates on republication, FV, paedobaptism, law/gospel preaching.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Integrates redemptive history with doctrinal loci; stabilizes assurance; provides a clear hermeneutic and pastoral framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works (Creation):** Adam's probation under a works principle toward eschatological life; basis for Christ's fulfilling obedience.
- **Covenant of Grace:** Single, unfolding promise administered through Abraham, Moses, David, and fulfilled in the New Covenant; received by faith alone.
- **Republication (Mosaic):** Reassertion of the works principle for Israel's typological, national blessings (land/tenure), not eternal salvation.
- **Royal Grant vs Suzerainty Treaty:** ANE forms clarifying Abrahamic/Davidic (grant) and Mosaic (law) structures; frames biblical covenants.
- **Law/Gospel Distinction:** Law commands/condemns; gospel promises/gives Christ. Hermeneutical and pastoral key for justification and assurance.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; imputation of guilt/righteousness.
- **Merit (proper/typological):** Only Christ merits salvifically; Israel's obedience yields typological, temporal goods, not eternal life.
- **Intrusion Ethics:** Theocracy/holy war as eschatological preview within Israel; not normative for the common kingdom.
- **Common Grace and Preparatory Grace:** Universal restraint and gifts vs the law's preparatory/typological role leading to Christ; distinguished from saving grace.
- **Means of Grace:** Word and sacraments as covenant instruments that deliver the promised Christ.
- **Visible/Invisible Church:** Covenant community vs the elect; clarifies apostasy warnings and assurance.
- **Sacramental Oath-Signs:** Baptism and the Supper seal God's promise and bind recipients to covenant loyalty.
- **Self-Attestation and Authority of Scripture:** Bible as covenant document bearing intrinsic divine authority; Spirit's witness confirms it.
- **General and Special Revelation:** Creation/conscience vs redemptive speech-acts; the latter necessary for saving knowledge.
- **Justification and Imputation (NPP critiques):** Forensic declaration grounded in Christ's obedience; rejects covenantal nomism as instrument.
- **How this work is used:**
 - Definition source for covenant structures across loci (creation, redemption, church, sacraments).
 - Polemic against Dispensationalism, NPP, and Federal Vision on law/gospel, justification, and Israel/church.
 - Exegetical model employing ANE treaty analysis and typology.
 - Conceptual pivot connecting assurance, preaching, and the means of grace to covenant promise.
