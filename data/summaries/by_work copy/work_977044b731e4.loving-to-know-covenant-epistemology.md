### TITLE
**Loving to Know: Covenant Epistemology - Esther Meek (2006)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within early 21st-century Christian epistemology; interacts with Reformed theological tradition and recent analytic/virtue-epistemology currents.
 - Aimed at repairing the divide between academic epistemology and lived Christian practice; pedagogical and ecclesial concerns inform the project.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Knowledge is essentially covenantal and relational: to know rightly is to be engaged in a loving, trust-based covenantal relationship with God and creatures. Modern epistemology's quest for dispassionate, foundational certainty misconstrues knowing and thus impoverishes Christian faith and practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern/evidentialist/foundationalist epistemology abstracts knowing into detached propositional justification; this severs knowledge from the moral and relational character of knowers.
 - Positive proposal: a **covenant epistemology** reframes knowing as skillful, fiduciary, and practice-embedded - a form of loving engagement that depends on faithfulness and trust.
 - Knowing is an enacted competence (habit, practice, skill), not merely a static set of justified beliefs.
 - Trust and testimony are primary epistemic virtues: God as reliable covenantal knower grounds creaturely trust.
 - Norms for knowledge are tracked within covenantal commitments and relational accountability rather than purely internalist justification.
 - Applications: implications for Scripture, ecclesial formation, apologetics, and ordinary inquiry - Christians cultivate epistemic habits rooted in covenant fidelity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with: classical foundationalism and evidentialism (critique), contemporary Reformed epistemology (overlaps and contrasts with Plantinga/Wolterstorff), virtue epistemology, and practical theology.
 - Draws resources from biblical covenantal language, historical Reformed thought, and philosophical accounts of skill, habit, and trust.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant, faith/trust, ecclesial knowledge, epistemic virtue and practice; secondary implications for Christology (incarnational knowing) and pneumatology (Spirit as knower/guide).

- **Closing line**
 - Knowledge, for Christians, is not chiefly a matter of detached justification but the cultivated, covenantal competence of loving to know God and neighbor within faithful relational practices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers **love** and **covenant** as epistemic categories - knowledge is morally and relationally constituted.
 - Treats epistemology as a set of **practices and skills** (habitual know-how) shaped by covenantal commitments and ecclesial formation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects modern epistemology's priority of neutral foundations: rejects the picture of belief as merely atomistic and justificatory.
 - Contrasts with some strands of Reformed epistemology by emphasizing practice and covenant rather than primarily warrant grounded in warrant-producing faculties.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Coins and systematizes the term **covenant epistemology** as a programmatic alternative.
 - Introduces a vocabulary of **fiduciary trust, covenantal fidelity, and skillful engagement** to reframe knowledge norms.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Christian higher education, pastoral theology, and by theologians seeking integration of doctrine and epistemology.
 - Influential among scholars sympathetic to virtue/holistic epistemology; debated by analytic epistemologists over methodological rigor.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for thinking about how doctrine, formation, and practice shape knowing; especially useful for pedagogy, ecclesial formation, and apologetic posture that resists modernist isolationism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant epistemology**
 - The view that knowledge arises within covenantal, trust-based relations and practices rather than from detached, purely justificatory methods.

- **Loving to know**
 - The central ideal: knowing as an act of love - attentive, faithful, and skilled relating to object(s) of knowledge.

- **Fiduciary / fiduciary trust**
 - Trust rooted in covenantal relation; epistemic reliance on trustworthy agents (not merely probabilistic justification).

- **Fidelity**
 - Moral/relational faithfulness as an epistemic norm governing how one pursues and sustains knowledge.

- **Skillful engagement / habit (hexis)**
 - Knowledge as cultivated competence; emphasis on practice, training, and embodied know-how.

- **Practice-based epistemology**
 - Epistemic norms derived from concrete communal and ecclesial practices, not abstract foundations.

- **Participatory knowing**
 - The knower's participation in a relational process (with God and community) that constitutes insight.

- **Testimony & ecclesial formation**
 - Testimony is primary epistemic route; church shapes trustworthy epistemic agents.

- **Revelation (as covenantal disclosure)**
 - Scripture and divine action disclose reality within covenantal terms - integrated into epistemic practice.

- **Contrast: foundationalism / evidentialism**
 - Modern models that Meek critiques for isolating beliefs from moral-relational formation.

- **Epistemic virtue**
 - Intellectual character traits (trustworthiness, humility, attentiveness) cultivated within covenantal life.

- **Practical implications**
 - Knowledge formation practices (habits, liturgy, pedagogy) matter for truth-seeking.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Christian/Relational epistemology and for courses on theology of knowledge.
- As a **polemic** against foundationalist/evidentialist epistemologies and as corrective to overly cognitive models of belief.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for reading Scripture and training congregants in epistemic habits.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates connecting doctrine (covenant, revelation) with epistemology, virtue theory, and practices of witness.
