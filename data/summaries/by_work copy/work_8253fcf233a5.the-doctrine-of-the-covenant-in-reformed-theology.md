### TITLE
**The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology** - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th/early 20th-century Reformed and Old Princeton milieu; a bridge between Dutch neo-Calvinism and Anglo-American confessionalism. First written in Dutch, later translated and widely circulated via Vos's shorter writings.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The covenant is the architectonic form of God's redemptive communion with humanity, comprising a prelapsarian **covenant of works** and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace**, both grounded in the intra-Trinitarian **pactum salutis**. This structure safeguards federal headship, imputation, and the Christological fulfillment of Adam's vocation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Historical survey:** From Olevianus and Ursinus through Perkins, Polanus, Gomarus, Cocceius, Witsius, and Turretin; assesses whether covenant functions as a Reformed central dogma (Vos: architectonic but not absolutized).
 - **Covenant of works:** Adam as federal head under a divinely condescending arrangement with promise of eschatological life; probation; sacramental signs (tree of life, Sabbath); no Pelagian merit but covenantal reward by appointment.
 - **Covenant of grace:** One substance, multiple administrations (Abrahamic to New); Christ as mediator and surety; faith as the instrument; law retained as rule of gratitude.
 - **Pactum salutis and Trinity:** Father ordains, Son undertakes obedience as second Adam, Spirit applies benefits; the ground of the unity and efficacy of redemption.
 - **Law-gospel and Mosaic economy:** Upholds unity of the covenant of grace while explaining Mosaic particularities (pedagogical and typological functions, with cautious acknowledgment of a works principle in a subservient, typological sense).
 - **Soteriological entailments:** Imputation of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness; necessity of Christ's **active and passive obedience** for justification and consummation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Reformed orthodox federalists (Cocceius, Witsius, Turretin), Heidelberg tradition (Olevianus, Ursinus), Westminster Standards; contrasts with Lutheran law-gospel framing and later rationalist or moralist reductions.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and biblical theology, covenant, Trinity, Christology, sin and imputation, justification and sanctification, ecclesiology and sacraments, eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Covenant is God's condescending form of communion that orders all of redemptive history and finds its telos when the second Adam secures the promised eschatological life for his people by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Covenant as the formal principle of divine-human fellowship, not merely a didactic device.
 - Eschatological orientation of the prefall arrangement; Adam's goal was higher, indefectible life.
 - Strong Trinitarian grounding via the pactum salutis.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Rejects making covenant a single central dogma eclipsing other loci; it coordinates rather than dominates.
 - Distinguishes Reformed federalism from Lutheran law-gospel dualism without denying their distinction.
 - Resists Cocceian antinomian readings and dispensational ruptures; upholds one covenant of grace with diverse administrations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies **condescension** as the basis of the covenant of works; merit is covenantal-appointive, not condign.
 - Tightens the Adam-Christ federal parallel, making Christ's active obedience non-negotiable.
 - Integrates biblical-theological history (organic development) with dogmatic clarity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in Reformed discussions of covenant architecture; formative for 20th-century biblical theology (Vosian school) and for later federal-eschatological syntheses (e.g., Klinean typology).
 - Frequently cited in debates on republication, imputation, and active obedience.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Reliable map of classic Reformed covenant doctrine.
 - Pedagogically potent for linking Trinity, Christology, and soteriology through a single federal framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works (Foedus Operum):** Prelapsarian arrangement; Adam as federal head under probation with promise of higher life.
- **Covenant of Grace:** Postlapsarian, one in substance across administrations; Christ mediates, faith receives.
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption):** Intra-Trinitarian counsel; Father sends, Son undertakes obedience, Spirit applies.
- **Federal Headship:** Representative role of Adam and Christ; ground of imputation.
- **Imputation:** Forensic accounting of guilt/righteousness; Adam to all, Christ to believers.
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** Christ's lifelong law-keeping and curse-bearing; both essential for justification and life.
- **Divine Condescension:** Non-necessitated stooping of God to bind Himself by promise; basis of the prefall covenantal reward.
- **Probation:** Time-bound testing of Adam with eschatological stakes.
- **Eschatological Life:** Higher, immutable communion envisioned in the prefall promise, realized in Christ.
- **Administration:** The covenant of grace expressed through historical economies (Abrahamic, Mosaic, New).
- **Typology:** Mosaic forms prefigure Christ; law serves pedagogical and typological functions.
- **Law-Gospel Relation:** Distinct yet united within the covenantal framework; law as rule of gratitude in grace.
- **Sacraments as Signs and Seals:** Covenant-confirming rites (circumcision/baptism, Passover/Lord's Supper) across administrations.
- **Suretyship (Fidejussor):** Christ's covenantal undertaking to secure the blessings for His people.
- **Organic Revelation:** Progressive, unified redemptive history culminating in Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed covenant categories and their Trinitarian grounding.
 - As a polemical anchor for imputation and Christ's active obedience in justification.
 - As an exegetical model for Adam-Christ typology and Mosaic pedagogy.
 - As a conceptual pivot integrating covenant theology with Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology.
