### TITLE
Jesus and the Demise of Death: Resurrection, Afterlife, and the Fate of the Christian - Matthew Levering

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Roman Catholic systematic and biblical theology; part of renewed patristic retrieval in 21st‑century Catholic thought. Addresses current debates in Pauline studies, analytic philosophy of personal identity, and popular evangelical/Protestant eschatologies.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Jesus' resurrection decisively undoes the power of death**: immortality is not an innate property of the soul but an eschatological gift inaugurated by Christ; Christian hope is grounded in bodily resurrection and the transfiguration of creation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation in Paul (esp. 1 Cor 15, Rom 6-8) and Johannine/apocalyptic texts: resurrection as participatory and covenantal.
 - Patristic and medieval retrieval: Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Aquinas used to displace Greek dualism and recover hylomorphic anthropology.
 - Philosophical/theological critique of alternatives:
 - rejects innate soul‑immortality (Platonic residue),
 - critiques soul‑sleep and purely spiritualized afterlife accounts,
 - engages annihilationism and modern naturalist reductionism.
 - Systematic synthesis: Christology grounds soteriology and eschatology; sacramental life participates in the death/resurrection economy.
 - Practical and pastoral implications for death, mourning, and Christian hope.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical: Paul, John, Revelation.
 - Patristic: Irenaeus, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine.
 - Medieval: Aquinas.
 - Contemporary: N. T. Wright, Jürgen Moltmann, Hans Urs von Balthasar; dialogues with analytic philosophers of personal identity and theologians defending soul‑immortality.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Resurrection, afterlife, eschatology, anthropology (soul/body), Christology, soteriology, sacramental theology, judgment (particular and general), immortality.
- **Closing line**
 - Levering locates Christian hope in the **death‑conquering, body‑renewing resurrection of Christ**, arguing that the future life is a gift that reconfigures human nature and the cosmos.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp recovery of classical **hylomorphic anthropology**: human persons are unified soul‑body composites; immortality is a bestowed, eschatological reality rather than an intrinsic possession.
 - **Resurrection as ontological and cosmic**: not merely moral example or private immaterial survival but the transfiguration of embodied human life and creation.
 - Strong integration of sacramental theology with eschatology: baptism and Eucharist as real participation in Christ's defeat of death.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters both Platonic/dualistic assumptions prevalent in popular Christianity and reductionist secular accounts that privatize or naturalize death.
 - More classical and metaphysically robust than some recent Protestant proposals that emphasize continuity of consciousness apart from bodily restoration.
 - In dialogue with N. T. Wright: broadly sympathetic in insistence on bodily resurrection but Leving stresses stronger continuity with historic Catholic doctrinal formulations.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"demise of death"** frames death as an enemy whose end is enacted and inaugurated by Christ rather than a neutral transition.
 - Rearticulation of **immortality** as a gift conferred in Christ rather than an anthropological given.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Catholic systematic theology for its patristic grounding and accessible integration of biblical, historical, and philosophical resources.
 - Used in ecumenical conversations on eschatology as a corrective to dualistic and overly individualistic afterlife models.
 - Critiques: some analytic philosophers and Protestant defenders of natural immortality press for clearer engagement with technical theories of personal identity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent, teachable synthesis of biblical exegesis, patristic wisdom, and systematic reflection; strong resource for preaching, catechesis, and advanced study in Christian eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection** - central event; Christ's bodily rising that inaugurates the future, bodily life for believers.
- **Death (as enemy)** - ontological disorder and privation overcome by Christ; not merely cessation but a power to be defeated.
- **Immortality (eschatological gift)** - not innate; conferred by God in and through Christ's resurrection.
- **Hylomorphic anthropology** - human nature as soul‑body unity; used to resist platonic dualism and justify bodily resurrection.
- **Intermediate state** - treated critically; temporary condition before final resurrection, but not the locus of final human destiny.
- **Particular and General Judgment** - both affirmed and integrated: personal destiny is particularized yet culminates in cosmic judgment/consummation.
- **Transfiguration of matter** - creation participates in resurrection life; sacraments prefigure this renewal.
- **Bodily continuity/identity** - continuity of personal identity is defended through bodily resurrection rather than mere psychological continuity.
- **Purgatory / purification** - situated within Catholic eschatological framework as part of sanctification toward the beatific life.
- **Annihilationism** - engaged as a rival view and critiqued for failing to do justice to bodily and cosmic redemption.
- **Soul‑sleep** - reviewed and critiqued as incompatible with biblical and patristic testimony to active communion with God prior to final resurrection.
- **Beatific vision** - the final fulfilled vision of God that presupposes resurrection and transformed embodiment.
- **Sacramental participation** - baptism and Eucharist as real participation in death/resurrection economy; sacramental life anticipates eschatological reality.
- **Pauline participation (union with Christ)** - theological linchpin: believers are "in Christ" and share in his death and resurrection.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Catholic account of resurrection and immortality (useful in systematic loci on eschatology and anthropology).
- As a **polemic resource** against platonic dualism, annihilationism, and soul‑sleep in theological debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul (1 Cor 15, Romans) and apocalyptic texts within a sacramental, christocentric framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, sacramental theology, and cosmic eschatology in teaching and preaching.
