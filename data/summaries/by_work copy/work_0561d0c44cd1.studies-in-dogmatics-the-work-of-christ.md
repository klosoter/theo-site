### TITLE
**Studies in Dogmatics: The Work of Christ** - G. C. Berkouwer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 1960s Dutch Reformed dogmatics, Free University Amsterdam; mid-century dialogue with Barthian theology, Roman Catholic ressourcement and Vatican II, and post-liberal critiques of classic atonement.
 - Part of Berkouwer's Studies in Dogmatics, aiming at biblically saturated, confessional yet non-scholastic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The multifaceted, once-for-all work of Christ culminates in His obedient suffering, death, and resurrection as reconciliation with God, to be grasped by faith and applied by the Spirit; dogmatics must resist absolutizing any single atonement theory and instead attend to Scripture's rich witness.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Biblical concentration:** Survey of New Testament kerygma; cross-resurrection unity; the scandal and necessity of the cross.
 - **Obedience of the Son:** Unity of active and passive obedience; covenantal representation; curse-bearing.
 - **Atonement motifs in concert:** Substitution, sacrifice, propitiation/expiation, reconciliation, victory over sin, death, and the devil.
 - **Humiliation and exaltation:** From incarnation to ascension and session; the priestly intercession of the risen Lord.
 - **Faith and assurance:** Justification grounded extra nos; assurance anchored in Christ's finished work, not introspection.
 - **Application by the Spirit:** Union with Christ; ordo salutis within the history of salvation; ecclesial and sacramental participation without repetition.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture; Reformed confessions (Belgic, Heidelberg, Dort); Calvin and the Reformers; Anselm; Aulen; Barth and Brunner; critiques of Socinian and moral-influence reductions; engagement with Roman Catholic views on sacrifice and the Mass.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology:** Person and mediatorial obedience; states of Christ.
 - **Soteriology:** Atonement, reconciliation, justification, assurance, union with Christ.
 - **Pneumatology:** Application of redemption.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments:** Church's proclamation; Lord's Supper and baptism as participation in the once-for-all.
 - **Sin:** Guilt, wrath, and the gravity of estrangement.
 - **Covenant theology:** Federal headship, second Adam.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity is the once-for-all reconciling obedience of the crucified and risen Christ, received by faith and ministered by the Spirit to the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Refusal to canonize a single atonement theory; insistence on the biblical pluriformity of the cross.
 - Strong cross-resurrection unity; victory never detached from substitution and reconciliation.
 - Unity of Christ's active and passive obedience as one obedient history.
 - Emphasis on the once-for-all character of Christ's priestly work against any cultic repetition.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against scholastic over-systematization and speculative intratrinitarian contracts detached from exegesis.
 - Against moral-influence or existential reductions that dissolve guilt and wrath.
 - Qualifies Christus Victor when severed from guilt-removal; qualifies penal accounts when reduced to mechanism or legalism.
 - Critique of the Roman Catholic Mass as re-sacrifice; critique of universalist drifts in some Barthian trajectories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Correlation** method: dogmatics as responsive to scriptural witness within living faith, not deductive system-building.
 - **Pluriformity** or richness of atonement motifs held in concert.
 - **Once-for-all** as hermeneutical key for priesthood, sacrifice, and assurance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries as a mediating, biblically anchored account; dialogue partner for Barthians and evangelicals.
 - Cited for balanced treatment of substitution alongside Christus Victor and reconciliation.
- **Enduring value**
 - A reliable guide for preaching the cross, teaching assurance, and framing sacramental practice within Christ's finished work.
 - Models a humble, exegetical dogmatics tethered to confession and catholicity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reconciliation (katallage):** Objective restoration to God through Christ's death; center of apostolic preaching.
- **Substitution:** Christ in our place under judgment; indispensable but never a bare legal transfer.
- **Propitiation and expiation:** God's wrath averted and guilt removed through Christ's sacrifice.
 - Propitiation avoids caricature by grounding in divine love; expiation guards the moral reality of sin.
- **Obedience of Christ:** Active and passive as one indivisible filial obedience culminating at the cross.
- **Humiliation and exaltation:** From incarnation and suffering to resurrection, ascension, and session; states form one saving trajectory.
- **Christus Victor:** Triumph over powers as inseparable from atonement for guilt.
- **Curse-bearing:** Christ made a curse for us; covenantal and representative, not merely forensic fiction.
- **Justification:** Extra nos righteousness grounded in Christ alone; assurance anchored in His finished work.
- **Union with Christ:** Spirit-wrought participation that applies the benefits without repeating the sacrifice.
- **Once-for-all (hapax):** Non-repeatable priestly act; regulates sacramental theology and assurance.
- **Intercession:** Ongoing priestly ministry of the exalted Christ securing believers' perseverance.
- **Faith:** Trust that receives Christ's work, not a meritorious cause; oriented to the kerygma.
- **Ordo salutis and historia salutis:** Application framed within the once-accomplished redemptive history.
- **Sacrament as participation:** Baptism and Supper signify and seal communion in the crucified and risen Lord, not fresh oblation.
- **Covenantal headship:** Second Adam's representative obedience as the matrix of atonement.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a doctrinal synthesis for Christology and soteriology that integrates multiple biblical atonement motifs.
 - As a polemical resource against reductionist atonement accounts and against sacrificial repetition.
 - As an exegetical model tying cross and resurrection and regulating assurance and preaching.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking union with Christ to ecclesiology and sacramental practice.
