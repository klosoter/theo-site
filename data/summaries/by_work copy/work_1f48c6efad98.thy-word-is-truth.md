### TITLE
Thy Word is Truth - E. J. Young

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century conservative Reformed theological milieu in North America; reaction against liberal higher criticism, modernist accommodations, and emerging reconciliatory readings of Genesis. Young writes as an Old Testament scholar defending traditional bibliology and historical exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture is verbally true and historically reliable; Genesis (including the Days of Creation) must be read by the grammar-historical method rather than surrendered to naturalistic chronologies or speculative harmonizations.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation of Scripture's truthfulness as the presupposition for exegesis (bibliology first).
 - Methodological defense: the grammatical-historical method and the normal sense of words (no unnecessary allegory).
 - Focus on Genesis 1: linguistic and contextual analysis of yom ("day"), sequence, and Sabbath pattern to establish the intended historicity and temporality of the creative acts.
 - Polemical engagement: critiques of gap theories, day-age interpretations, and theological accommodation to speculative science.
 - Theological outworking: creation ex nihilo, divine fiat activity, providential ordering, and the Sabbath as interpretive key.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit and explicit critique of liberal higher critics and modernist theologians; interacts with historical readings (both traditional Protestant interpreters and contemporary old-earth proponents); relies on Hebrew linguistic data, canonical cross-references, and theological axioms rather than speculative geology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration (inerrancy/verbal truth), creation (including ex nihilo), providence, Sabbath theology as interpretive of Genesis, and hermeneutics (grammatical-historical method).
- **Closing line:** The authority and truth of Scripture demand a historically plain reading of Genesis: God's spoken acts in time are the foundation for theology and must not be surrendered to speculative chronological systems.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - A disciplined, Old-Testament-grounded insistence that biblical language be read by its normal semantic range; avoids philosophically driven reinterpretation.
 - Elevates the Sabbath motif as confirming the structure and temporality of the creation week.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against both liberal denials of historicity and conservative attempts to fuse Scripture with speculative scientific chronologies; rejects ad hoc harmonizations.
 - Contrasts with day-age and gap theories by arguing hermeneutical priority rather than scientific retrofit.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Not so much new terms as a forceful reapplication of classical Reformed bibliology to the Genesis chronology; stresses the mutuality of grammatical exegesis and doctrinal conviction.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among mid-to-late 20th-century conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars as a clear statement defending plain reading and inerrancy.
 - Used as a polemical tool in debates over creation, hermeneutics, and the authority of Scripture.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a concise model of how Old Testament scholarship can defend bibliological conservatism; useful for seminarians learning to combine linguistic detail with doctrinal commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy / Verbal truth:** Scripture is true in its assertions; Young treats truthfulness as foundational, not optional.
- **Grammatical-historical method:** Preferred hermeneutic; context, grammar, and normal semantic range determine meaning.
- **Yom ("day"):** Central lexical focus - argued to carry its ordinary temporal sense in Genesis 1, especially given context and the ordinal plus "evening and morning."
- **Sabbath typology:** The pattern of seven days and the Sabbath functions as theological confirmation of literal days.
- **Creation ex nihilo:** Affirmed as the theistic, biblical account of origin; opposes naturalistic explanations.
- **Divine fiat / divine activity:** God as active speaker whose commands bring forth reality; emphasizes the immediacy and efficacy of divine speech.
- **Historical reading / plain sense:** The commitment to the straightforward, historical sense of narrative texts as the default interpretive posture.
- **Polemic against accommodation:** Critique of attempts to reinterpret biblical statements primarily to align with contemporary scientific models.
- **Gap theory / Day-age theory / Framework approaches:** Noted as rival readings; Young critiques gap and day-age concessions and treats the framework view skeptically when it abandons historicity.
- **Bibliology:** The doctrine of Scripture as the controlling lens for all theology and interpretation.
- **Hermeneutical priority:** The principle that sound method (biblical grammar and theology) must govern conclusions about extrabiblical matters like chronology.
- **Providence:** The ongoing ordering of creation that derives from God's sovereign creative acts.
- **Canonical cross-reference:** Use of scripture to interpret scripture; Old Testament proofs used to buttress Genesis readings.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed positions on inerrancy and the proper hermeneutic for Genesis.
 - As a **polemic** against old-earth/day-age and liberal-critical readings of creation.
 - As an **exegetical model** showing how Hebrew lexical and contextual analysis connects to doctrinal conclusions.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching bibliology: Scripture's truth governs the relation between theology and natural science.
