### TITLE
Pierced for Our Transgressions: Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution - edited by Steve Jeffery, Michael Ovey, and Andrew Sach (evangelical Reformed symposium defending penal substitution)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed response (post-2000) to renewed critique of penal substitution (PSA) from academic and popular theologians.
 - Aimed at pastors, students, and theologians within conservative Protestant circles seeking robust biblical, historical, and pastoral vindication of PSA.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Penal substitution is a biblically faithful, historically continuous, and pastorally necessary account of Christ's atonement; critiques that dismiss it as violent, unbiblical, or ethically defective are mistaken and based on category errors or selective readings.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Multi-author collection combining:
 - **Biblical exegesis**: close readings of key Pauline and Johannine texts (e.g., Romans, 2 Corinthians, Isaiah, Psalms) arguing for vicarious penalty-bearing and propitiation language.
 - **Historical theology**: tracing continuity from early church, through medieval satisfaction theory, to Reformed articulations (Calvin, Owen) showing PSA is not modern imposition.
 - **Theological synthesis**: integrating forensic (legal/penal) and sacrificial imagery without reducing one to the other.
 - **Apologetic & pastoral response**: addressing contemporary ethical objections (divine violence, scapegoating), pastoral consolations, and worship implications.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on classical Reformed theologians (Calvin, Owen), patristic glimpses, and engages contemporary critics such as proponents of **Christus Victor**, **Moral Influence**, René Girardian scapegoat theory, and selective critiques by modern scholars (e.g., some readings associated with N. T. Wright).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Atonement (primary), Christology (vicarious suffering and representative obedience), justification (imputation), covenant (covenantal satisfaction), propitiation, divine wrath and forgiveness, sacrificial typology.
- **Closing line**
 - The collection contends that penal substitutional atonement is theologically central and indispensable for a biblically coherent gospel that secures both God's justice and mercy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses integration of **forensic (penal)** and **sacrificial** dimensions rather than pitting them; insists on the necessity of **vicarious penal bearing** alongside sacrificial imagery.
 - Strong pastoral concern: shows how PSA comforts conscience and grounds assurance and liturgy.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Girardian scapegoat readings by distinguishing human scapegoating logic from divine, substitutionary penal action grounded in covenant and law.
 - Corrects caricatures that portray PSA as arbitrary divine violence by explicating God's righteousness, covenant commitments, and the communicative aim of propitiation.
- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications**
 - Clarifies terms: **propitiation** vs. **expiation**; **satisfaction** vs. mere penal suffering; **substitution** as both representative and penal, not merely exemplarist.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a go-to corrective to postmodern/postliberal critiques of the atonement.
 - Used in seminary courses, pastoral training, and apologetic encounters; contributed to a modest resurgence of explicit PSA defenses in the 2010s.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for teaching: concise, multi-angle defense combining exegesis, doctrine, and pastoral theology; useful as a compact reference and polemical tool.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Penal substitution (PSA)** - Christ bears the penalty due to sinners; central thesis defended.
- **Propitiation** - Christ turns away divine wrath through expiatory sacrifice; emphasis on God's righteous response, not caprice.
- **Satisfaction** - Christ satisfies the demands of divine justice and covenant law; linked to Reformed forensic vocabulary.
- **Imputation** - Christ's righteousness credited to believers and our sins imputed to Christ; forensic exchange model.
- **Substitution** - Vicarious representation: Christ acts on behalf of the elect, both bearing penalty and securing righteousness.
- **Expiation** - Removal of sin; authors clarify relation to propitiation (expulsion of guilt vs. turning aside wrath).
- **Forensic language / legal metaphors** - Central explanatory framework (guilt, penalty, justification); defended as biblical and pastorally necessary.
- **Sacrificial imagery** - Temple/Isaianic motifs used to show continuity with OT sacrifice while maintaining penal element.
- **Wrath of God** - Treated as a real, just response to sin; PSA grounds the removal of wrath in Christ's penal work.
- **Covenant** - Atonement situated within covenantal obligations and covenant faithfulness, not merely abstruse metaphysics.
- **Christus Victor** - Acknowledged as complementary in some respects but critiqued if presented as a replacement for penal accounts.
- **Moral Influence theory** - Distanced and critiqued as insufficient to explain forensic, cosmic dimensions of redemption.
- **Scapegoat / Girardian readings** - Engaged critically; distinguished from divine substitution based on moral and theological criteria.
- **Representative obedience** - Emphasized alongside substitution: Christ's obedience earns righteousness for believers.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** and concise articulation of PSA for lectures and doctrinal summaries.
 - As a **polemic** against Girardian, Moral Influence, and some progressive critiques-frequently cited in apologetic debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading penal and sacrificial texts (Romans, Isaiah, Psalms) together in Reformed systematic frameworks.
