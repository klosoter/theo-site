### TITLE
Imputation and Impartation: Union with Christ in American Reformed Theology (William B. Evans, 2008)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century scholarly reassessment of classic Reformed soteriology; conversation between historical theology, Systematic theology, and pastoral/experiential concerns in American Reformed circles.
 - Engages American Puritan and Presbyterian developments (18th-20th centuries) and their reception in Princeton and mid-20th-century Reformed scholarship.
 - Situated amid renewed attention to the doctrine of union with Christ and the pneumatological shaping of justification/sanctification.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - American Reformed theology has oscillated between two ways of speaking about the fruits of Christ's work: **forensic imputation** (Christ's righteousness credited to believers) and **impartation** (Christ's life communicated and transforming believers). Evans contends that a careful account of **union with Christ**, understood with a distinct role for the Spirit, reconciles and reorients this polarity.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical survey of American Reformed figures and movements showing varying emphases on imputation or impartation.
 - Analytical distinction between legal/federal language and organic/participatory language in the texts of Scripture and theologians.
 - Exegetical focus on Pauline union texts (e.g., Romans, Galatians) to show how union grounds both forensic and participatory effects.
 - Theological synthesis: the Spirit is the **mediator and actualizer** of union, enabling both the declaration (imputation) and the real participation (impartation) without collapsing justification into sanctification.
 - Normative proposal: a relational, Spirit-centered model of union that preserves forensic assurance while accounting for transformative sanctification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Early American Reformed voices (New England Puritans; Jonathan Edwards and Hopkinsian developments), 19th-century Presbyterianism (e.g., Charles Hodge), Princeton theologians (B. B. Warfield), and 20th-century Reformed systematicians (e.g., John Murray).
 - Scriptural exegesis of Paul, historic Reformed confessions, and contemporary secondary literature on union and the Spirit.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic imputation), sanctification (impartation), union with Christ, covenant theology, the person and work of the Holy Spirit, Christology (vicarious atonement, federal headship), and ecclesiology insofar as union shapes communal identity.

- **Closing line**
 - Evans locates the doctrinal center of gravity in a **Spirit-mediated union with Christ** that upholds forensic imputation while giving theological priority to the real, participatory life believers share with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes the **Spirit as the ontological bond** of union-not merely as sanctifying effect but as the agency that constitutes believers' participation in Christ.
 - Frames imputation and impartation as **complementary effects** rooted in one relational reality (union), rather than as mutually exclusive alternatives.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against readings that reduce American Reformed thought to an imputation-only schema; also critiques those who flatten justification into moral transformation.
 - Rehabilitates overlooked American voices (e.g., Hopkinsian and Edwardsian nuance) that employed participatory language without abandoning forensic categories.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - A working typology that distinguishes **forensic, federal, organic, and participatory** registers of union-language and shows their interdependence.
 - Emphasizes "Spirit-mediated participation" as a key phrase to bridge older categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful among historians and systematicians rethinking classical Reformed soteriology; cited in literature on union with Christ and pneumatology.
 - Pragmatic traction in pastoral theology and Reformed seminaries seeking integrated accounts of assurance and holiness.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies historical development in American Reformed thought, supplies a durable hermeneutic for Pauline union texts, and offers a balanced framework for contemporary debates about justification and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation** - The forensic crediting of Christ's righteousness to believers; central to justification and legal standing before God.
- **Impartation** - The communicative giving of Christ's life and holiness to believers; emphasizes sanctification and real participation.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological-relational bond grounding both imputation and impartation; primary theological hinge of the work.
 - Relation to imputation: union makes the believer the recipient of Christ's legal benefits.
 - Relation to impartation: union is the conduit for participation in Christ's life by the Spirit.
- **Spirit-mediated participation** - The idea that the Holy Spirit actualizes the believer's union, effecting both justification and transformation.
- **Forensic (legal) register** - Language of declaration, credit, guilt/innocence used in justification discussions.
- **Organic/participatory register** - Language of life, indwelling, and growth used in sanctification and union talk.
- **Federal headship** - Christ as representative head whose acts are reckoned to his people; core to imputation.
- **Hopkinsian nuance** - American tendency to articulate strong participatory and moral dimensions without abandoning federal categories.
- **Alien righteousness** - The status of Christ's righteousness as foreign yet reckoned to believers (imputation).
- **Participatory atonement** - Emphasis that believers actually partake of Christ's reconciling life, not only credit.
- **Assurance and holiness dialectic** - The pastoral problem Evans seeks to harmonize: how to sustain assurance while pressing for sanctification.
- **Typology of union-language** - Evans's analytic tool: forensic vs federal vs organic vs participatory.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **historical-theological definition source** for how American Reformed writers balanced imputation/impartation.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates that pit forensic justification against participatory sanctification.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline union texts with a pneumatological emphasis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pneumatology and soteriology courses to teach integration of justification and sanctification.
