### TITLE
The Nature of Man in Genesis 1-3 - John D. Currid (journal article)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical Old Testament scholarship; written for an academic theological journal audience engaged with both historical exegesis and contemporary doctrinal questions (notably biblical anthropology). Currid writes from a conservative Reformed-evangelical perspective emphasizing Hebrew exegesis and ANE context.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Genesis 1-3 presents human beings as divinely created, embodied unities bearing the image of God; the text better supports a model of *created souls* (creationism) and a psychosomatic anthropology than a Hellenistic dualism or an easy case for traducianism. The article asks: What is the nature of "man" according to the opening chapters, and what follows for the origin of the soul, sin, and human destiny?
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical focus on key texts: Genesis 1:26-27 (imago Dei), Genesis 2 (formation language: yatsar vs bara), and Genesis 3 (fall, curse, and consequence).
 - Linguistic and literary analysis to show:
 - "Image" (tselem) and "likeness" (demuth) in Genesis connote function/role (dominion, representation) rather than a Greek-style substantialist soul.
 - Terms for life/personhood (nephesh, ruach) are used in OT to describe embodied life; no clear biblical warrant for a separable immaterial soul in the Platonic sense.
 - Theologically synthesizes:
 - Human beings are bodily and spiritual (psuchosomatic unity).
 - Souls are immediately created by God at the origin (creationism) rather than generated by parents (traducianism), on the basis of biblical silence about parental generation of the soul and the language of divine forming/creating.
 - Original sin is presented as a corporate and federal reality affecting the whole human person and posterity, but its transmission must be accounted for theologically (Currid favors a model compatible with creationism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Genesis commentators and Hebrew linguists; interlocution with historical positions (traducianism vs creationism), church fathers and Reformation-era writers in outline; modern evangelical anthropologists and some patristic/medieval positions referenced to frame options.
- **Doctrines treated:** biblical anthropology (image of God), origin of the soul, original sin and its transmission, human vocation (dominion), God's creative activity, and implicit covenantal/uplifting role of humanity.
- **Closing line:** Genesis 1-3 portrays humans as God-formed, embodied image-bearers whose personhood originates in divine creative fiat; theological anthropology must therefore affirm bodily-spiritual unity and account for sin and descent while avoiding Hellenistic dualism and simplistic hereditarian accounts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong linguistic-historical reading of Hebrew terms to reframe "image" as primarily functional/representative rather than metaphysical substance.
 - Clear preference for a psychosomatic ontology that resists Greek dualism yet affirms an immaterial aspect of personhood that is directly created by God.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against scholars who read Genesis through Hellenistic categories and who therefore posit a separate immaterial soul that is inherited biologically (traducianist readings).
 - Opposes crude traducian accounts that make parental generation the straightforward biblical explanation for the soul's origin.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced pairing of "functional imago" language with a nonreductive bodily unity - holding function and ontological unity together as hermeneutical keys.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Appreciated in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise exegetical defense of creationism and psychosomatic humanism.
 - Cited in debates on soul origin and used as a corrective to dualistic or overly biological accounts in pastoral and academic settings.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Useful model for balancing close Hebrew exegesis with doctrinal needs (sin, salvation, personhood).
 - Serves as a teaching resource for courses on biblical anthropology and Genesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (tselem / demuth):** read functionally and relationally - humans as God's representatives with dominion; not primarily a metaphysical soul-stamp.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** human persons are integrated body-soul unities; language that avoids Greek dualism while recognizing immaterial capacities.
- **Creationism (of the soul):** doctrine that each human soul is directly created by God; Currid treats it as the more textually faithful option.
- **Traducianism:** doctrine that soul is generated by parents; treated as a rival position and argued against on exegetical and theological grounds.
- **Yatsar vs bara:** distinction between Hebrew verbs used in Genesis (formed vs created) employed to argue for divine formation/creation of the whole person.
- **Nephesh / ruach:** Old Testament terms for life/person/spirit used to ground an OT anthropology that is holistic and embodied.
- **Original sin / corporate headship:** fall as communal/federal reality affecting progeny; Currid insists on accounting for transmission while upholding creationism.
- **Dominion / vocation:** human role in Genesis (stewardship over creation) tied to the image-concept and ethical implications.
- **Formative language:** "formed" (yatsar) emphasizes God as potter of embodied personhood; used to argue against purely biological explanations of personhood.
- **Transmission of sin:** theological problem addressed-Currid favors a model compatible with created souls but stresses federal headship and environmental/hereditary factors as explanatory aids.
- **Antidualism:** rejection of Platonic separation of soul and body in favor of biblical categories.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for courses on Genesis and biblical anthropology (close Hebrew-linguistic reading).
 - As a **polemic resource** against traducianist and dualist positions in pastoral and doctrinal debates.
 - As a **definition source** for conceptualizing imago Dei in ethics, ecology, and social teaching.
