### TITLE
Simplicity, Triunity, and the Attributes of God - K. Scott Oliphint (contributor), in The Doctrine of God: A Global Introduction

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed engagement with classical theism within a global systematic-theology volume. Aimed at seminary students and scholarly readers wrestling with recent analytic, historical, and ecumenical debates over God's nature.
 - Oliphint writes from a conservative Reformed, classical-theist perspective that converses with scholastic sources (Augustine, Aquinas, Reformation confessions) and contemporary analytic and doctrinal interlocutors.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The classical doctrine of **divine simplicity** is both biblically warranted and philosophically coherent with the doctrine of the Trinity and key attributes (aseity, immutability, impassibility). Proper distinctions and terminologies remove ostensible contradictions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establish the theological and biblical warrant for simplicity, showing why God must not be a composite being (to secure aseity, necessity, and ultimate sovereignty).
 - Clarify what is meant by "attributes" in classical theism: not parts but identical to God's essence, hence avoiding composition.
 - Demonstrate compatibility with the Trinity:
 - Distinguish **essence** and **persons** so that the triune persons are not ontologically separate parts of a composite God.
 - Employ scholastic distinctions (real vs. conceptual) to allow personal relations without violating simplicity.
 - Treat specific attributes:
 - **Aseity:** God is the independent ground of being; attributes flow from, and are identical with, this aseity.
 - **Immutability:** Explain change-talk analogically and preserve God's unchangeableness in essence while accounting for relational and economic acts.
 - **Impassibility:** Defend a qualified impassibility that affirms God does not suffer as creatures do while permitting genuine divine action and covenantal response.
 - Respond to modern critiques (social Trinitarianism, process theology, reductionist relational models) that claim simplicity undermines biblical Trinitarianism.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Aquinas, later scholastics and Reformation theologians.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: analytic philosophers/theologians and proponents of social Trinitarian or relational models of God; critical engagement with those who reject divine simplicity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs economic), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), revelation and language about God, implications for Christology and providence.

- **Closing line**
 - Upholds a classical-theist account in which simplicity secures God's ultimate unity and undergirds a robust, orthodox Trinitarianism and doctrine of attributes without reducing persons to parts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, systematic defense of the identity of divine attributes with the divine essence as the only way to avoid composition and to safeguard aseity and sovereignty.
 - Careful lexical and metaphysical distinctions to show how personal plurality (persons/relations) coheres with ontological simplicity.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against social Trinitarian or relational proposals that treat persons as ontological centers that imply metaphysical composition.
 - Challenges modern readings that interpret immutability and impassibility as incompatible with a God who acts in history; offers calibrated exegetical concessions while maintaining classical positions.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Reasserts the operative use of scholastic distinctions (real vs. conceptual, essence vs. person) as indispensable analytic tools for contemporary theology.
 - Frames impassibility and immutability pragmatically-preserving their metaphysical force while explaining scriptural language of divine response.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed and analytic-theology audiences as a concise, usable defense of classical theism within Trinitarian theology.
 - Critiqued by proponents of social Trinitarianism and theological camps emphasizing divine relationality and vulnerability.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, pedagogically effective bridge between historical scholastic resources and contemporary debates; valuable for teaching, confessional formation, and analytic apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity (DS)** - The doctrine that God is metaphysically simple: no composition of parts; attributes are identical with the divine essence.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence and independence; grounds the necessity and non-contingency of the divine being.
- **Immutability** - God does not undergo essential change; change language about God is accommodated analogically or relationally without implying ontological alteration.
- **Impassibility** - God does not suffer or undergo creaturely emotional/passive change; compatible with genuine divine action and covenantal responsiveness.
- **Trinity / Triunity** - One divine essence subsisting in three persons; persons are not parts but relational subsistences of the one essence.
- **Essence-Attribute Identity** - Attributes are not constituents but identical with God's essence (prevents composition).
- **Real vs. Conceptual Distinction** - Scholastic tools: real distinctions concern ontological differences (used cautiously); conceptual distinctions concern our ways of thinking about one simple reality.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity** - Distinguish God's external actions in history (economic) from eternal internal relations (immanent), harmonized with simplicity.
- **Social Trinitarianism (contrast)** - A position emphasizing personal plurality in ways Oliphint argues can imply problematic composition.
- **Analogy / Anthropomorphism** - Language about God uses analogy; anthropomorphic phrases express real truths without implying creature-like constitution.
- **Relationality (qualified)** - God is truly relational (Father-Son-Spirit) but relationality does not entail metaphysical dependency or multiplicity of essences.
- **Incarnation tension** - How impassibility and immutability relate to the suffering and change in the incarnate Son: solved by Chalcedonian distinction of natures and roles.
- **Sovereignty & Creation** - Attributes like aseity and immutability secure divine sovereignty over contingent creation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a compact **definition source** and defense for divine simplicity and related attributes in systemic-theology syllabi.
- As a **polemic** against social-Trinitarian and process-relational critiques, supplying analytic and scholastic tools.
- As an **exegetical-model** for treating biblical language about God's change, emotion, and response without abandoning classical attributes.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian doctrine to doctrine of attributes in Reformed and classical-theist curricula.
