### TITLE
Biblical Authority: A Critique of the Rogers/McKim Proposal - John D. Woodbridge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Located amid late 20th-century debates over Scripture (post-1960s to 1980s) when evangelicals, mainline Protestants, and neo-orthodox thinkers debated the locus and nature of biblical authority.
 - Responds to a growing interest in communitarian and canonical approaches to authority that distanced themselves from classical inerrantist formulations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Woodbridge argues that the Rogers/McKim formulation of biblical authority (which relocates authority in the interpretive community and canonical use) inadequately secures Scripture's objective, normative claim for doctrine and life.
 - He contends that a robust doctrine of Scripture must protect both historical-propositional content and the Bible's normative authority over the church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic move: articulates the Rogers/McKim proposal - emphasis on community reception, canonical function, and theological reading - and its attractions for those dissatisfied with rigid inerrantist language.
 - Critical move: exposes consequences of over-emphasizing communal or functional authority
 - Risks relativizing truth to community contexts.
 - Undermines propositional historicity required for doctrinal claims about Christ and salvation.
 - Constructive move: defends a middle path preserving evangelical commitments
 - Affirms the Bible as historically grounded revelation with propositional content.
 - Affirms the church's role in interpretation without making the community the ultimate locus of authority.
 - Calls for a normative, historically-informed hermeneutic that holds Scripture as final judge in theological method.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Rogers and McKim (representing a communitarian/canonical model).
 - Engages broader traditions: classical Protestant confessionalism, evangelical apologists, and contemporary hermeneutical trends (canonical criticism, community hermeneutics).
 - Uses historical-theological resources to show continuity with Protestant doctrine of Scripture.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (nature and content of divine self-disclosure).
 - Authority and sufficiency of Scripture (what makes Scripture normatively binding).
 - Hermeneutics (historical-grammatical method vs. community-based readings).
 - Indirectly touches on Christology and soteriology insofar as they depend on biblical propositional claims.
- **Closing line**
 - Woodbridge's theological center: Scripture must be defended as historically grounded and propositional in its saving witness while recognizing the church's interpretive role - without allowing communal reception to supersede the Bible's normative authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses a dual safeguard: protect historical-propositional content and maintain ecclesial interpretation - neither pure individualism nor uncritically tribal communitarianism.
 - Emphasizes continuity with classical Protestant commitments as a corrective to contextualist revisions.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Rogers/McKim by highlighting epistemic risks in shifting ultimate authority from text to community.
 - Contrasts with radical inerrantist rhetoric by offering a more nuanced, historically attentive defense that still affirms objective truth.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions between *final normative authority* (Scripture itself) and *mediating authority* (church/community), pressing for clearer nomenclature in debates.
 - Rearticulates "propositional content" in ways responsive to critics who dismiss propositional models as overly dogmatic.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative and confessional evangelical circles as a careful, measured rebuttal of community-centered accounts.
 - Less persuasive to liberal or postliberal theologians who already reject strong propositional models; nevertheless used as a touchstone in intramural evangelical discussions on authority.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a disciplined model for balancing text-centered and community-aware approaches.
 - Useful for teaching because it models critical engagement with contemporary hermeneutical proposals while defending confessional standards.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical authority** - the normative claim Scripture makes for faith and practice; central term under debate.
- **Rogers/McKim proposal** - shorthand for a communitarian/canonical model that places significant weight on community reception and canonical function.
- **Propositional revelation** - the thesis that Scripture communicates objective, truth-apt content that can ground doctrine.
- **Historical grounding** - insistence that biblical claims are tied to historical events and persons (implications for Christology and soteriology).
- **Inspiration/inherrancy** - discussed as theological loci; Woodbridge defends a high view while adapting language to avoid caricature.
- **Canonical authority** - the idea that the finished canon has a unique governing role in the church; Woodbridge affirms but resists making it equivalent to communal fiat.
- **Community hermeneutics** - interpretive emphasis on the believing community's role; critiqued where it becomes the final arbiter.
- **Final normative authority** - term used to mark Scripture as the ultimate judge in doctrine and life.
- **Mediating authority** - the church's role in interpreting and applying Scripture without supplanting Scripture's authority.
- **Historical-grammatical method** - recommended hermeneutical baseline to secure objective textual meaning.
- **Doctrinal epistemology** - concerns how theological knowledge is grounded; Woodbridge argues Scripture must be the epistemic foundation.
- **Confessional reading** - reading Scripture within historic doctrinal frameworks, balanced against exegetical responsibility.
- **Canonical criticism** - acknowledged as a helpful corrective but insufficient if it relativizes propositional truth.
- **Relativism risk** - the vulnerability identified when authority migrates from text to community.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative-evangelical statements on what constitutes adequate doctrine of Scripture.
- As a **polemic** in theological curricula against communitarian or postliberal relocations of authority.
- As a **methodological model** in hermeneutics courses balancing textual fidelity and ecclesial interpretation.
