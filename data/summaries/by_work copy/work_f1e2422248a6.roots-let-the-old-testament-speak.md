### TITLE
Roots: Let the Old Testament Speak - Alec Motyer 
Site usage: 1 reference - topic: **Christ In Ot And Nt**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical scholarship (British context). Motyer writes as an experienced pastor-theologian and OT exegete addressing pastors, students, and lay readers.
 - Reaction to both historical-critical reductionism and devotional neglect of the Old Testament in many Christian settings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament must be read and heard as Christian Scripture: it is intrinsically oriented toward Christ and finds its intelligibility, authority, and pastoral use when interpreted in light of the Christ-event and the New Testament witness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of OT witness showing recurrent motifs and institutions that point forward to Christ (promise/seed, covenant, kingship, sacrifice, temple, prophecy).
 - Demonstrates a consistent pattern of promise and fulfillment: the OT promises a Messiah and the covenantal framework; the NT reveals fulfillment in Christ.
 - Argues for a canonical, typological hermeneutic:
 - Types are historically grounded persons/events/institutions that find their true meaning in Christ (not arbitrary allegory).
 - Prophecy is predictive and anticipatory, yet rooted in covenant fidelity and covenantal context.
 - Practical application: equips preachers and teachers to proclaim the OT as the church's book about Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors are the biblical texts themselves (close canonical reading). Engages implicitly with:
 - Historical-critical tendencies that detach the OT from Christian reading.
 - Dispensational and purely moralistic readings that deny unified Christocentric sense.
 - Draws on classical Reformation and evangelical insights about Scripture's unity without extensive engagement with continental scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (canonical and Christocentric), covenant, Christology (Christ as fulfillment of OT types and promises), typology, soteriology (atonement themes), worship/temple theology, kingdom and messianic expectation.
- **Closing line**
 - Motyer's theological center of gravity: the Old Testament is authentically Christian Scripture only when heard as integrally pointing to and fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A pastoral-canonical approach: rigorous exegesis married to homiletical application - the OT speaks to Christ and to the church now.
 - A disciplined, non-allegorical typology: types are real historical realities whose telos is Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects reductionist-critical readings that treat the OT as an autonomous ancient literature unrelated to Jesus.
 - Counters readings that relegate the OT to mere moral instruction or separate dispensational epochs.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Plain, vivid pastoral language for typology and promise-fulfillment rather than technical critical jargon; reframes common OT motifs (seed, temple, sacrifice) as integrated Christological signposts.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received across conservative evangelical and Reformed-adjacent circles as a short, accessible defense of Christocentric OT reading.
 - Influential for pastors and Bible-study leaders seeking to preach the OT as Christian Scripture; often recommended alongside larger evangelical commentaries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise model for connecting OT exegesis to NT Christology, useful for homiletics, catechesis, and introductory OT theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christocentric reading** - Interpreting the OT primarily as a witness to Christ; not eisegesis but canonical fulfillment.
- **Typology / type** - Historical person/event/institution that anticipates and is fulfilled in Christ (e.g., sacrifices, temple, kings).
 - Distinguishes typology from allegory: historically grounded and telic.
- **Promise-Fulfillment** - The structural dialectic: divine promises in the OT find fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus.
- **Covenant** - The organizing theological frame; OT institutions and promises function within covenant history leading to Christ.
- **Messiah / Anointed One** - Central OT hope whose fullest expression is Jesus; title connects law, kingship, and priesthood motifs.
- **Sacrifice / Atonement** - OT sacrificial system viewed as a pedagogical and typological pointer to Christ's definitive atonement.
- **Temple / Presence** - Temple imagery anticipates the incarnate and ascended presence of Christ, re-anchoring worship in him.
- **Kingdom** - OT expectations of rule and restoration reinterpreted in the person and reign of Jesus.
- **Seed / Offspring motif** - Seed promises (e.g., Abrahamic) as messianic anticipation culminating in Christ.
- **Canonical hermeneutic** - Reading books within the whole biblical canon where the NT's testimony guides the OT's Christian interpretation.
- **Prophecy (predictive and covenantal)** - Prophecy is both predictive of the Messiah and covenantally rooted in calls to repentance and restoration.
- **Law and Gospel** - Law as covenantal demand; gospel as fulfillment in Christ - continuity without erasure of distinct form and function.
- **Pastoral exegesis** - Exegesis that aims at proclamation and pastoral formation, not merely academic description.
- **Fulfillment** - Key interpretive term: OT realities find their completed meaning in Christ's person and work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a succinct **definition source** for evangelical Christocentric interpretation of the OT.
 - As an **exegetical-homiletical model** for preaching the OT to a Christian congregation.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal critical minimization of Christ in the OT and against dispensational separatism.
