### TITLE
Against Marcion (Adversus Marcionem) - Tertullian (c. 208-212 CE)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 3rd-century Roman Church; Marcionism a major heresy proposing a canonical and theological rupture between Old and New Testaments.
 - Part of wider formation of Christian canon, apologetic responses to Gnosticism and docetism, and debates on Scripture-authenticity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Marcion posits two gods (a just creator of the Law and a good Father revealed in Christ) and rejects the Old Testament and large portions of Luke/Paul. Tertullian argues this fractures revelation and contradicts apostolic witness: there is one sovereign God who progressively reveals himself in history and Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Five-book polemic: detailed textual and theological refutation of Marcion's edited Luke and Pauline corpus; systematic dismantling of Marcionite dualism.
 - Textual/exegetical move: demonstrates that Marcion's Luke and Paul's letters are mutilated and inconsistent with the received tradition.
 - Historical/canonical move: appeals to ecclesial reception and apostolic usage as criteria for textual authenticity.
 - Theological move: defends unity of God, continuity between Law and Gospel, genuine incarnation and atonement, and providential authorship of creation.
 - Antidote to docetism: affirms Christ's real human descent and suffering against Marcion's denials.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Principal interlocutor: Marcion of Sinope. Implicitly interacts with other currents (Gnostics, proto-Valentinians) and uses Pauline corpus, Luke, Old Testament, and patristic exemplars (apostolic tradition).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (unity/continuity), Canon formation, Christology (incarnation, historicity of flesh), God (monotheism vs dualism), Creation & providence, Law vs Grace, typology, and implicitly anthropology (origin and transmission of human nature).
- **Closing line**
 - A sustained defense of the unity of God and Scripture: true Christianity insists on one covenantal God who both creates and redeems, and on an apostolically received canon that interprets the Old in light of the incarnate Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous combination of textual criticism, canonical argument (ecclesial reception), and dogmatic contention - a forensic method rare in such intensity among early Latin writers.
 - Vivid polemical style: rhetorical invective paired with systematic argumentation.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct, sustained correction of Marcionite dualism and selective redactionism; rejects any theological justification for excising the Old Testament.
 - Moves beyond mere apologetic assertion to a proto-historical claim: documents are authenticated by apostolic and ecclesial usage.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Early deployment of a canonical-criterial argument (use = authenticity) that anticipates later patristic appeals to reception.
 - Clear linking of canon, Christology, and soteriology as mutually sustaining theological loci.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in shaping orthodox anti-Marcionite tradition and in defending the legitimacy of the Old Testament as Christian Scripture.
 - Widely read in patristic and medieval traditions; influential for later debates on canon and continuity. Tertullian's later Montanism complicated his reception, but Adversus Marcionem remained a reference against dualistic heresies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating textual-historical critique with doctrinal defense; valuable for teaching on canon formation, anti-heretical method, and the theological interdependence of Old and New Testaments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Marcionism / Marcion**
 - Dualistic system: strict distinction between the OT demiurge (lawgiver) and the NT Father (gospel).
- **Demiurge**
 - Marcionite term for a creator god of justice; Tertullian rejects any separation between creator and Father.
- **Canon (ecclesial reception)**
 - Criterion: apostolic and church usage authenticate texts; Tertullian uses reception-history as proof against Marcion's edits.
- **Mutilated Luke / Edited Pauline Corpus**
 - Charge that Marcion deliberately excised passages that link Christ to the OT, betraying non-apostolic redaction.
- **Unity of God**
 - Central polemical point: one God who is creator, lawgiver, and redeemer.
- **Typology / Fulfillment**
 - OT events and institutions read as anticipations fulfilled in Christ - key hermeneutical tool against Marcion's dismissal of the OT.
- **Incarnation / Real Flesh**
 - Insistence on Christ's genuine human descent and suffering as historical and salvific (counter to docetic tendencies).
- **Providence & Creation**
 - Creator God is the author of history; continuity between creation and redemption rejects Marcionite disparagement of the world.
- **Law vs Gospel**
 - Reinterprets Law in light of Christ rather than discarding it; emphasizes continuity, not opposition.
- **Textual criticism**
 - Early instance of manuscript-comparison and authenticity-claim based on content and reception.
- **Polemic style**
 - Combines forensic argument with rhetorical invective; a hermeneutic and rhetorical model for later anti-heretical writing.
- **Anthropology / Traducianist inference**
 - While not the main focus, Tertullian's stress on Christ's real human origin supports his broader tendencies toward the transmission of human nature (traducianism), relevant to Traducianism vs Creationism debates.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary source on early **canon formation** and the criterion of ecclesial reception.
- As a model for **polemic** against dualism/gnosticism and for defending the continuity of revelation.
- As an **exegetical model** for OT→NT typology and christological readings.
- As a supporting text in debates on **anthropology** (traducianism vs creationism) insofar as it affirms Christ's genuine human descent against docetic denial.
