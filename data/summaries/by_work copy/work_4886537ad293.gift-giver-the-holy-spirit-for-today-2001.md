### TITLE
Gift & Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today (Craig S. Keener, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2001 amid renewed scholarly engagement between Pentecostal/charismatic communities and academic New Testament studies.
 - Addresses late-20th-century debates: charismatic renewal, Vineyard and Toronto movements, and polemics from conservative Reformed/cessationist authors.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit continues to give charismatic gifts (signs, prophecy, healings, tongues) as normative for church life and mission; cessationist claims that such gifts ceased with the apostolic age are exegetically and historically weak.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of NT pneumatology (Acts, Paul, Johannine Paraclete material) showing continuity between apostolic-era Spirit activity and later church practice.
 - Historical survey demonstrating recurrent charismatic phenomena across church history, undermining claims of early cessation.
 - Theological synthesis integrating Spirit-gifts with Trinitarian doctrine, revelation, and redemptive-history (eschatological continuity).
 - Pastoral praxis: guidelines for discernment, order, and correction of abuses while affirming experiential dimensions of Spirit ministry.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with cessationist scholarship (historical and theological critics), contemporary NT exegetes, classical church fathers, and Pentecostal theologians/practitioners.
 - Uses primary texts (Scripture, patristic witnesses) and modern scholarship to rebut historical-empirical cessationist claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (charismata, Spirit-baptism), Trinity (Spirit's relation to Father and Son), revelation (Spirit and Scripture), ecclesiology (gifts in church order), soteriology/sanctification (Spirit's ethical fruit vs gifts distinction).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Keener insists the Spirit as both *giver* and ongoing *gift-worker* is central to the church's mission and eschatological life: charismatic phenomena are neither merely primitive nor merely optional but integral to redemptive-historical continuity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Interdisciplinary balance: rigorous NT exegesis + broad historical sweep + pastoral sensitivity to contemporary charismatic practice.
 - Reframes charismatic gifts as normative instruments of mission and revelation-testimony rather than anomalies to be explained away.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges classic cessationist narrative that gifts vanished after apostolic age by showing recurring historical reports and different criteria for "apostolic authority."
 - Corrects some Pentecostal excesses by insisting on scriptural norms, communal discernment, and theological restraint (order, love, accountability).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Stresses the dual image of the Spirit as **Gift & Giver** - gifts are not isolated phenomena but relational acts of the Triune God in redemption.
 - Employs a redemptive-historical framing to argue continuity of Spirit activity toward consummation rather than simple replication of apostolic forms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among academic continuationists and used as a bridge text for conservative seminarians exploring charismatic claims.
 - Provoked careful rebuttals from cessationist scholars but influenced Reformed-charismatic dialogue by providing a scholarly, historically aware resource.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for integrating academic exegesis with pastoral concerns; valuable for teaching pneumatology, apologetics against cessationism, and ecumenical conversations on gifts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism**
 - Keener's positive program: charismatic gifts persist and are theologically normative (Gift & Giver, 2001).
- **Cessationism**
 - Treated as the primary opponent; Keener critiques its historical and exegetical foundations.
- **Charismata (spiritual gifts)**
 - Broad category including prophecy, tongues, healing, discernment - central to mission and witness.
- **Sign gifts**
 - Special emphasis on healing and miracles as validating gospel witness; Keener argues these reappear post-apostolically.
- **Paraclete**
 - Johannine term used to argue continuity of the Spirit's guiding, teaching, and revelatory functions.
- **Baptism in the Spirit**
 - Distinguished from water baptism and sanctification; often linked to empowerment for ministry and charismata in Keener's reading.
- **Redemptive history**
 - Keener places Spirit activity within the economy of redemption, seeing gifts as eschatological signs rather than merely primitive phenomena.
- **Normativity of Acts**
 - Argues Acts is both descriptive and normative for understanding Spirit-led mission patterns.
- **Discernment**
 - Emphasized as necessary communal practice to evaluate prophetic and miraculous claims.
- **Prophecy**
 - Reclaimed as a biblically normal gift with regulative limits (edification, testing).
- **Healing**
 - Treated as recurrent and theologically meaningful, not simply anecdotal.
- **Glossolalia (tongues)**
 - Analyzed as one form among charismata, requiring theological and pastoral interpretation.
- **Spirit and Scripture**
 - Maintains Scripture's authority while allowing for Spirit-led practices that do not supersede biblical normativity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary continuationist pneumatology and clarification of "gifts" vs "fruit."
 - As a **polemic** against classical cessationist claims (historical and exegetical rebuttal).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts and Pauline pneumatology within redemptive-history and normative ecclesiology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed-charismatic dialogues-scholarly resource for those seeking a theologically disciplined charismatic theology.
