### TITLE
Clean and Close (2022) - Andrew S. Farley

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the 2020s amid ongoing evangelical conversations about grace, law, and holiness. Emerges from the contemporary "grace movement" that critiques legalism and emphasizes assurance, pastoral application, and Pauline theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians are already **clean** by virtue of union with Christ (a definitive, positional sanctification) and are called to grow **close** to Jesus (progressive, relational sanctification). The book diagnoses a widespread confusion that turns sanctification into a performance test for acceptance with God.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation of a **definitive cleansing** at conversion grounded in justification and union with Christ (positional realities that make the believer holy in God's sight).
 - Reframing growth as **closeness** rather than moral achievement: sanctification as intimacy with Christ enabled by the Spirit, not primarily by human effort.
 - Practical exhortations to rest in Christ, pursue intimacy, and resist legalistic cycles of guilt-driven striving.
 - Pastoral application: how churches teach, how pastors comfort, and how believers live in assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy reliance on Pauline texts (especially Romans and Galatians) and general New Testament themes of union with Christ and the Spirit. Interacts implicitly and explicitly with evangelical legalism, "Lordship Salvation" debates, and broader traditions that stress moral effort (Wesleyan perfectionist strains, some revivalist/disciplinary emphases).
- **Doctrines treated:** Sanctification (definitive and progressive), justification, union with Christ, imputed righteousness, the role of the Holy Spirit, assurance, and pastoral theology of sin and growth.
- **Closing line:** Theologically, the book centers sanctification on the believer's reconciled identity in Christ ("clean") and pursues holiness through relational proximity to Jesus empowered by the Spirit ("close"), rejecting merit-based holiness as the pathway to acceptance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The twin motif **"Clean and Close"** reframes sanctification language into two complementary movements: forensic cleansing and relational growth.
 - Strong pastoral concern for **assurance**-sin does not cancel the definitive cleansing that grounds acceptance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters models that make present holiness the condition for justification or acceptance (a corrective to legalistic and some revivalistic pastoral practices).
 - Contrasts with versions of sanctification that overemphasize human effort; while not denying change, Farley relocates the locus of transformation to union with Christ and Spirit-initiated intimacy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes plain-language reframing (clean = positional; close = progressive) that reshapes how believers talk about growth without inventing new doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received among readers and pastors inclined to grace-centered pastoral care and those reacting against performance-driven piety.
 - Criticized by some Reformed and evangelical critics who fear downplaying mortification, means of grace discipline, or obedience as evidence of faith.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Valuable as a pastoral corrective and catechetical resource for teaching assurance and union with Christ.
 - Useful to stimulate debate about how churches frame holiness without abandoning biblical calls to transformation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definitive sanctification (Clean):** The positional, once-for-all cleansing of the believer by union with Christ and justification; grounds acceptance before God.
- **Progressive sanctification (Close):** Ongoing transformation that results from growing intimacy with Jesus, empowered by the Spirit.
- **Union with Christ:** The central theological basis for positional holiness and the source of power for progressive growth.
- **Positional holiness:** Legal/forensic status declared by God; distinct from moral performance.
- **Practical/positional distinction:** Recurrent contrast Farley uses to separate "who you are in Christ" from "what you do."
- **Assurance:** Confidence of acceptance rooted in Christ's work, not fluctuating moral performance.
- **Rest in Christ:** Pastoral motif urging cessation of guilt-driven striving and reliance on Christ for growth.
- **Spirit-empowered intimacy:** The mechanism by which closeness with Jesus effects holiness-cooperative but initiated and enabled by the Spirit.
- **Legalism / Performance-based sanctification:** Target of critique-any system that makes obedience the ground of acceptance rather than the fruit of union.
- **Lordship salvation (opponent reference):** Implicit interlocutor; Farley resists frameworks that conflate initial faith with immediate submission as the test of true conversion.
- **Imputed righteousness:** Underlies the "clean" claim-righteousness counted to believers by faith.
- **Means of grace (practical note):** Encouraged insofar as they foster closeness, not as works that secure acceptance.
- **Guilt-cycle pastoral diagnosis:** Psychological-theological observation about believers locked in guilt-driven stops and starts.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **pastoral resource** and catechetical text to teach assurance and combat legalism.
- As a **polemic** against performance-based sanctification models and pastoral practices.
- As an **exegetical model** reading Pauline texts through union-with-Christ and forensic-plus-relational lenses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula or sermons that aim to reframe holiness in terms of identity and intimacy rather than achievement.
