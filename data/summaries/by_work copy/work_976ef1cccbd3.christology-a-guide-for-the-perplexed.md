### TITLE
**Christology: A Guide for the Perplexed - Alan J. Spence**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary introductory-specialist aimed at advanced students and pastors; part of a series designed to give clear, historically informed guides to complex theological loci.
 - Milieu: late 20th/early 21st-century academic theology marked by renewed interest in classical dogma and by engagement with modern critical, feminist, liberation, and continental critiques.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To recover a coherent, biblically anchored Christology that honors the classical formulations (incarnation, Chalcedon, hypostatic union) while parsing and responding to modern philosophical and theological challenges to Christ's person and work.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical survey: Israelite and early Christian christological seeds, patristic debates, Councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon), medieval and Reformation developments.
 - Theological analysis: distinction and relation of person and nature; exegesis of key New Testament christological loci (Paul, Hebrews, John, the Gospels).
 - Contemporary engagement: critiques of reductionist modern projects (demythologizing, ethical-only readings), assessment of major modern proposals (kenoticism, Barthian, Rahnerian, liberationist, feminist).
 - Constructive proposal: a disciplined retrieval of classic categories rearticulated in relational and soteriological terms so that the incarnation remains both metaphysically intelligible and pastorally efficacious.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic: Athanasius, Cyril, Nestorius (as foil), Leo.
 - Medieval and Reformation: Aquinas, Luther, Calvin.
 - Modern: Harnack, Bultmann, Barth, Rahner, Moltmann.
 - Contemporary critics and constructive theologians: feminist, liberation, and process theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Incarnation, Trinity (as necessary context), hypostatic union, two natures and the Chalcedonian formula, communication of properties, kenosis, atonement theories, resurrection and exaltation, revelation and mediation, soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - A theologically conservative yet dialogical account that insists the person of Christ-fully God and fully human as in classical creeds-is the indispensable center of Christian theology and practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Pedagogical clarity: compresses complex historical debates into accessible frames without sacrificing nuance.
 - Emphasizes a relational reading of the hypostatic union: personhood before metaphysical aggregation, with relational properties shaping theological claims about mediation and revelation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges purely functional or ethical Christologies that reduce the incarnation to exemplarism.
 - Critiques both radical kenoticism that undermines divine impassibility and abstract metaphysical approaches that efface Christ's real humanity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the phrase **relational hypostatic union** to redirect attention from static metaphysical puzzles to the interpersonal dynamics within the one person of Christ (presence, agency, obedience).
 - Reframes communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum) as primarily soteriological rather than merely ontological.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in seminaries as a balanced introductory text; valued for bridging historical orthodoxy and contemporary concerns.
 - Not revolutionary in systematic terms, but praised for clarity and for prompting pastors/students to engage classical theology responsibly.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable primer for reintroducing Chalcedonian commitments to contemporary audiences.
 - Useful for ecumenical teaching: shows how Eastern and Western emphases can be read together for pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - the union of two natures in the one person of Christ; emphasized as personal and relational.
- **Chalcedonian formula** - doctrine of "one person in two natures"; presented as indispensable baseline for constructive work.
- **Person vs nature** - careful parsing of the grammatical and metaphysical distinction; person governs identity, nature governs properties.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - exchange/attribution of properties between divine and human in Christ; reframed soteriologically.
- **Kenosis** - self-emptying of the Son (Phil 2); examined critically to avoid loss of divine immutability or true human experience.
- **Incarnation** - central mystery: Word becoming flesh; both revelatory and salvific functions highlighted.
- **Atonement models** - surveyed (substitutionary, Christus Victor, moral influence, governmental) with constructive integration rather than exclusivity.
- **Revelation and mediation** - Christ as the definitive mediator who discloses God's being and will; theology of knowledge and presence.
- **Resurrection and exaltation** - treated as the decisive vindication of incarnational claims and the basis for eschatological hope.
- **Narrative christology** - reading Gospel accounts as theological narrative that shapes doctrinal formulations rather than a purely propositional skeleton.
- **Historical-critical method** - deployed as a tool but critiqued where it severs confession from exegesis.
- **Soteriology** - Christ's personhood is presented as the hinge for justification, sanctification, and deification (where applicable).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical terms (useful in courses and sermon preparation).
 - As a **polemic** against reductive modern Christologies (clarifies what is at stake).
 - As an **exegetical-model**: demonstrates how exegesis, historical theology, and systematic construction interrelate.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula bridging historical dogmatics and pastoral theology.
