### TITLE
The Many Faces of Evil: Theological Systems and the Problem of Evil (John S. Feinberg, 1994; rev. ed. 2004)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical engagement with analytic philosophy of religion; post-Plantinga resurgence in free-will theodicy; conservative Reformed-evangelical milieu (Feinberg at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School).
 - Aimed at pastors, theologians, and apologeticists seeking a systematic theological response to varied formulations of the problem of evil.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evil is multifaceted and must be treated as such; a robust response to the problem of evil must integrate biblical theology (sin, fall, redemption) with careful philosophical analysis (free will, causation, divine attributes).
 - Sin and creaturely freedom are primary loci for explaining moral evil; natural evil requires account via providence, secondary causation, and the broader moral-historical purposes of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Taxonomy: distinguishes and analyzes distinct "faces" of evil (moral, natural, metaphysical/ontological, incidental, gratuitous) so that different types receive targeted responses.
 - Biblical-theological grounding: locates origin of moral evil in creaturely rebellion (original sin, human responsibility) and treats Scripture as normative for understanding God's purposes.
 - Philosophical defense: engages analytic theodicies and defenses (including Plantinga's free-will defense, Hickian soul-making, skeptical theism), testing them for coherence with divine omnipotence, goodness, and providential sovereignty.
 - Synthesis: argues for a theodical strategy that combines (a) a theistic explanation rooted in human freedom and blameworthy sin, (b) a providential account of natural evils as permitted for greater goods (discipline, soul-making, prevention of worse evils), and (c) recognition of epistemic limits (humility about God's inscrutable reasons).
 - Practical/pastoral implications: shows how theological clarity preserves trust in God without cancelling honest grappling with suffering.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and patristic sources (Augustine, Irenaeus) for historical theodical options.
 - Contemporary analytic figures: Alvin Plantinga (free-will defense), John Hick (soul-making theodicy), skeptical theists, Hume and classical skeptics.
 - Biblical exegesis and Reformed systematicists as background critics/supporters.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin and human freedom (primary focus), providence and secondary causation, attributes of God (omnipotence, omniscience, goodness), theodicy vs defense, creation and fall, and implications for Christology/redemption (as final resolution of evil).

- **Closing line**
 - Feinberg locates the heart of theodical response in a biblically rooted, philosophically disciplined account of sin and creaturely freedom that preserves divine goodness and sovereign providence while accounting for the many "faces" of evil.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic taxonomy of types of evil so that responses are not monolithic; insistence that moral evil must be primary in any adequate theodicy.
 - Careful integration of exegetical data about sin and fall with analytic evaluations of contemporary theodicies.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Critical of purely Irenaean/soul-making approaches that downplay culpability or reduce Christ's redemptive work to mere developmental stage.
 - Argues that Plantinga-style libertarian defenses must be pressed theologically - not merely logically - to account for biblical categories like original sin and corporate guilt.
 - Pushes back on skeptical theism when it leads to epistemic paralysis or moral irresponsibility.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Many faces" taxonomy as a heuristic to prevent category-mistakes between moral and natural evil.
 - Emphasis on secondary causation as a bridge between providence and empirical instances of natural suffering.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded among conservative evangelicals for clarity and pastoral sensitivity; frequently cited in Reformed apologetics and seminary courses on theodicy.
 - Used as a corrective to simplistic theodicies and as a survey text that brings biblical theology into dialogue with analytic philosophy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical resource: balances rigorous argumentation with pastoral application.
 - Useful model for integrating systematic theology and analytic philosophy on the problem of evil.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Moral evil** - evils resulting from free creaturely agents; primary explanatory locus for Feinberg.
- **Natural evil** - suffering from natural processes (earthquakes, disease); treated via secondary causation and permitted providentially.
- **Metaphysical/ontological evil** - privation theory: evil as absence or corruption, not a created positive.
- **Free-will defense/theodicy** - analytic responses emphasizing genuine creaturely freedom as necessary for moral goods; heavily engaged and evaluated.
 - Relation to Plantinga: critique and appropriation of core intuitions while insisting on theological constraints.
- **Soul-making (Irenaean) theodicy** - developmental account of suffering as spiritual growth; critiqued for downplaying culpability and for limits on explicating gratuitous evils.
- **Skeptical theism** - epistemic humility about God's reasons; accepted in measure but criticized when it yields moral quietism.
- **Secondary causation** - creatures as genuine causal agents within God's sovereign will; central to explaining natural evils without implicating God as morally culpable.
- **Privation theory of evil** - evil as lack rather than substance; used to align philosophical and biblical accounts.
- **Original sin / corporate guilt** - doctrinal anchors for explaining systemic and inherited aspects of evil.
- **Theodicy vs defense** - distinction underscored: theodicy attempts to justify God's ways; defense aims to show compatibility of God and evil.
- **Gratuitous evil** - cases that seem unnecessary; Feinberg examines criteria and epistemic limits for labeling evils gratuitous.
- **Providence** - God's governance that permits, restricts, and purposes evil toward greater goods and final redemption.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition and taxonomy source** for courses on the problem of evil (clear distinctions among kinds of evil).
 - As a **polemic/resource** against purely Irenaean or skeptical-theist approaches that undermine biblical categories of sin and responsibility.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** integrating doctrine of sin, providence, and redemption with analytic apologetics.
