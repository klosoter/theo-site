### TITLE
Fragments of Julian of Eclanum preserved in Augustine's anti-Pelagian writings

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 5th century Western Church; controversy arising from Pelagius and Caelestius (c. 411-429).
 - Julian of Eclanum (b. c. 386), bishop and leading Pelagian apologist, opposed Augustine's developing doctrine of original sin and predestination.
 - Survives only in fragments and quotations embedded in Augustine's polemical works (notably De natura et gratia, De dono perseverantiae, and letters). Preservation is primarily hostile and selective.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defense of robust human moral responsibility and will-power against Augustine's account of inherited guilt and irresistibly efficacious grace.
 - Contest over whether sin and guilt are transmitted from Adam, the nature and role of grace, and the scope of free will in initiation and perseverance of salvation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis: Julian reads Paul and other Fathers to deny pelagian guilt-transmission and to interpret "all have sinned" (Rom 5) as representative, not forensic heredity.
 - Anthropology: distinction between natural human faculties (will, reason) and acquired inclinations; concupiscence is a disorder but not transmitted culpability.
 - Grace and cooperation:
 - Grace is remedial, instructive, and enabling but not absolutely causative of conversion; human will can assent unaided insofar as God supplies sufficient help.
 - Emphasizes synergy: divine help assists but does not override free volitional movement.
 - Polemical moves: accuses Augustine of determinism, undermining moral responsibility, and misreading Fathers.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine (principal antagonist), Pelagius, Caelestius.
 - Sources cited or referenced: Pauline epistles (esp. Romans), some patristic interpreters (selected Western and Eastern Fathers), and common pastoral theology on infant baptism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin / transmission of guilt, concupiscence
 - Grace (prevenient, assistive), free will (liberum arbitrium)
 - Predestination and perseverance (rejected deterministic predestination)
 - Baptism, infant status, moral responsibility and culpability

- **Closing line**
 - The fragments crystallize a Pelagian insistence on human moral agency and a remedial, non-coercive account of grace that stands as the primary foil to Augustinian doctrines of inherited guilt and efficacious, determining grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Firm insistence that human beings retain genuine capacity to refrain from sin ("posse non peccare" implications) without prior intrinsic guilt; grace as non-coercive aid.
 - Careful rhetorical separation between concupiscence as bodily disorder and personal culpability.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges Augustinian readings of Romans and the Fathers; asserts Augustine's view collapses moral responsibility into divine causation.
 - Opposes any notion that infants bear penal guilt due to Adamic sin; baptism seen as beneficial but not forensic absolution of inherited guilt.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced language of cooperation and assistance (synergy) that later debates label semi-Pelagian though Julian self-identifies with Pelagian emphases.
 - Reframing of "original sin" debate from metaphysical inheritance to moral and moral-psychological description.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Largely marginalized after the 418-431 condemnations of Pelagian positions; Julian himself condemned and exiled, his direct school suppressed in the West.
 - Fragments influence modern historians and theologians as a corrective lens on Pelagian thought rather than as an enduring ecclesial system.
 - Limited positive reception in later Protestant or Reformed circles; more influential as a foil to Augustinianism and as source material for discussions of freedom and prevenient grace.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides essential corrective to monolithic portrayals of Pelagianism, preserves exegetical strategies, and offers a clear statement of an early high view of moral responsibility and non-deterministic grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - Julian rejects juridical transmission of guilt from Adam; treats Adam's sin as exemplary, not forensic inheritance.
- **Transmission of guilt** - Denied; guilt is personal, not inherited by biological descent.
- **Concupiscence (concupiscentia)** - Seen as a disordered appetite/condition, not necessarily personal guilt in infants or newborns.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - Central: humans retain genuine capacity to choose rightly without being causally overridden by grace.
- **Grace (gratia)** - Helpful, instructive, necessary but non-coercive; enables but does not determine the will.
 - Relation to prevenient grace: anticipatory aid that leaves space for human assent.
- **Synergy / cooperation** - Key relational model: human will cooperates with divine aid in conversion and perseverance.
- **Predestination (praedestinatio)** - Rejected in deterministic or fatalistic forms; foreknowledge does not equate to causative determination.
- **Infant baptism** - Held as beneficial and fitting, but not as sacramental eradication of inherited guilt (since Julian denies inherited guilt).
- **Pauline exegesis** - Julian's hermeneutic reads Romans in representative, not forensic-hereditary, terms.
- **Moral responsibility / culpability** - Emphasized as personal and immediate; Augustine's account accused of undermining it.
- **Efficacious vs. sufficient grace** - Julian favors "sufficient/assisting" grace model over Augustine's strongly efficacious/decisive grace.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions on will, grace, and original sin.
 - As a **polemic foil** in Augustinian writings and later doctrinal history to illustrate the stakes and arguments against determinism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for alternative readings of Paul that prioritize representative sin and human agency.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in histories of soteriology and discussions of prevenient vs. efficacious grace.
