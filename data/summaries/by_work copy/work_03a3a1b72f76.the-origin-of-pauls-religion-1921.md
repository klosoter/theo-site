### TITLE
**The Origin of Pauls Religion (1921) - J. Gresham Machen** 
A historical-theological defense that Pauls gospel derives from the historical Jesus and the earliest apostolic witness, not from Hellenistic mystery cults, late ecclesiastical invention, or purely subjective experience.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 1921, Princeton theologian amid the modernist-fundamentalist controversy.
 - Targets the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule (history-of-religions school) and liberal Protestant claims of Hellenistic derivation.
- **Central thesis**
 - Pauls religion is continuous with the teaching and person of Jesus and the primitive church; its source is divine revelation confirmed in history, preeminently the resurrection.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of derivation theories:
 - **Jewish background:** Paul is a converted Pharisee; his gospel surpasses but does not negate OT monotheism and ethics.
 - **Hellenistic/mystery cults:** Parallels are superficial; no causal line explains Pauls doctrines of sin, grace, and the cross.
 - **Continuity with Jesus:** Early, high Christology and the centrality of the cross are present in pre-Pauline traditions (e.g., 1 Cor 15).
 - **The resurrection as historical event:** The linchpin that generated apostolic proclamation and Pauls conversion.
 - **Pauls theology summarized:** Objective atonement, justification by faith, union with Christ, the church as apostolic and catholic, revelation and Scripture.
 - **Epistemology:** Knowledge of God is grounded in special revelation, not mere religious experience.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Wrede, Bousset, Harnack, Deissmann, Reitzenstein; uses Acts and the Pauline corpus; cites pre-Pauline creedal material; appreciates historical defenders like Ramsay.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology:** Revelation, inspiration, apostolic authority, relation of canon and tradition.
 - **Theology proper & epistemology:** Existence and knowability of God; natural vs special revelation.
 - **Christology & soteriology:** Deity and lordship of Christ; necessity and objectivity of the atonement; justification.
 - **Hamartiology:** Radical sin and inability (anti-Pelagian).
 - **Ecclesiology:** One, holy, catholic, apostolic church grounded in the resurrection witness.
- **Closing line**
 - The historical resurrection of Jesus, received by apostolic revelation, stands as the wellspring of Pauls gospel and the churchs faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Historical method in service of confessional orthodoxy; the resurrection as public, evidential reality.
 - Reliance on identifiable pre-Pauline traditions to show continuity with Jesus.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters the mystery-cult hypothesis and reduction of Christianity to ethical ideals (Ritschlian/liberal).
 - Rejects the partition between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith; opposes Wrede-style claims that Paul invented Christianity.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - **Objective redemption:** Cross accomplishes salvation extra nos, not merely moral influence.
 - **Apostolic revelation and authority:** Gal 1 grounding for Scripture self-attestation; early catholicity rooted in apostolic witness, not later institution.
- **Reception / influence**
 - Shaped Reformed apologetics and evangelical confidence in early high Christology; anticipated later work by Hengel, Hurtado, and Bruce on primitive Christ devotion.
 - A standard rebuttal to syncretist accounts of Paul in academic and seminary contexts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating rigorous historical scholarship with doctrinal clarity on Scripture, Christ, and salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religionsgeschichtliche Schule:** Comparative approach Machen critiques for superficial parallels and causal overreach.
- **Mystery-cult hypothesis:** Claim that Pauline ideas (union, sacraments) derive from Greco-Roman cults; Machen shows disanalogies in content and aim.
- **Pre-Pauline tradition (1 Cor 15:3-5):** Early creed proving continuity of Paul with the primitive church and the resurrection kerygma.
- **Resurrection as historical event:** Fact grounding faith, apostleship, and ecclesial unity; not a myth or mere vision.
- **Apostolic revelation:** Pauls gospel received by revelation of Jesus Christ (Gal 1); basis for the self-attestation and authority of apostolic Scripture.
- **Inspiration and trustworthiness of Scripture:** While not a treatise on inerrancy, Machen argues for the reliability of Acts and the Pauline letters in historical claims.
- **Canon and tradition:** Canon recognized apostolic witness; tradition transmits but does not create gospel content.
- **Justification by faith:** Forensic acceptance on Christs merits, incompatible with Pelagian or semi-Pelagian schemes.
- **Objective, substitutionary atonement:** The cross satisfies divine holiness and secures reconciliation; necessity flows from Gods justice and human sin.
- **Radical sin / Augustinian hamartiology:** Human inability and guilt necessitate grace; explains Pauls conversion and message.
- **Existence and knowability of God:** Affirms natural knowledge (Rom 1) but insists on the primacy of special revelation for saving knowledge.
- **Epistemology of revelation:** Knowledge of God is grounded in Gods self-disclosure in Christ and Scripture, not religious feeling.
- **Early high Christology:** Titles and worship of Jesus present from the start; Paul preserves, not invents, the churchs confession.
- **One, holy, catholic, apostolic church:** Unity and universality arise from the common apostolic resurrection witness and gospel.

- **How the work is used**
 - As a polemical resource against Hellenistic-derivation theories of Paul across Christology and soteriology.
 - As an exegetical-historical model for employing pre-Pauline texts to establish continuity Jesus-Paul.
 - As a bibliological anchor for apostolic authority, self-attestation, and early canonical consciousness.
 - As a conceptual pivot in teaching sin, grace, and atonement within an Augustinian-Reformed frame.
