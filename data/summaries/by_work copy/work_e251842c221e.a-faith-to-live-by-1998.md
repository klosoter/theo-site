### TITLE
A Faith to Live By (1998) - Donald Macleod

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century conservative Reformed/evangelical milieu; pastoral-systematic treatment intended for churches and students seeking a robust but accessible articulation of Christian doctrine in an era of theological revisionism (kenoticism, debates over Sonship, etc.).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Orthodox doctrine must be intelligible and vital for Christian life; classical Trinitarian and Christological formulations safeguard gospel faith and provide the footing for Christian obedience and worship.
- **Core argument / structure:** Macleod moves from Scripture and historical doctrine to contemporary application.
 - Affirmation of biblical-theological primacy: exegesis grounds dogma.
 - Defense of classical Trinitarianism against modern distortions.
 - Detailed Christology: incarnation, two natures, impeccability, eternal Sonship; linkage of doctrine to pastoral life and piety.
 - Practical outworking: how doctrine shapes worship, witness, sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis, patristic and Reformation formularies, and contemporary debates-particularly kenotic theorists and modern challenges to classical Sonship and the traditional understanding of Christ's offices.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity, Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, impeccability, eternal Sonship), munus triplex (prophet-priest-king), soteriology, revelation and ecclesial implications.
- **Closing line:** Macleod insists that a faithful, life-giving Christianity is rooted in classical, biblically-grounded Christology and Trinitarian doctrine that both protects the gospel and directs Christian existence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that systematic doctrine must be pastoral: theology as formative for life and worship, not merely academic.
 - Concise, ekphrastic defenses of classical Christology aimed at non-specialists without sacrificing technical accuracy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit critique of kenotic Christologies that posit ontological diminution in the Son: Macleod argues such views compromise divine immutability and unity of divine essence.
 - Pushback on proposals that relativize eternal Sonship or suggest a merely functional/temporal sonship; he reasserts Sonship as eternal and essential to the Trinity and incarnation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical neologisms; rather, clarifying and reasserting classical categories (munus triplex, communicatio idiomatum) in service of pastoral theology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed/evangelical circles as a clear, reliable restatement of orthodox doctrine accessible to pastors and educated laity.
 - Cited by those countering modern kenotic trends and by instructors using a compact, pedagogical tract on Christology and practical theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful primer linking rigorous Christological convictions to everyday Christian discipleship.
 - Reliable resource for introductory courses on Christology, the offices of Christ, and pastoral applications of doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis / Kenotic theories**
 - Macleod critiques kenotic proposals that the Son emptied divine attributes at the incarnation; treats kenosis as theological shorthand that must not imply ontological change in deity.
- **Impeccability of Christ**
 - Affirmed: Christ was truly tempted yet could not sin; impeccability secures the moral perfection necessary for atoning obedience.
- **Munus triplex (Threefold office)**
 - Christ as Prophet, Priest, King; Macleod emphasizes this schema for both theology and pastoral ministry.
- **Eternal Sonship**
 - Defended as a Trinitarian truth: the Son's relational identity in the Godhead is eternal and grounds the incarnation.
- **Incarnation**
 - The Word became flesh without loss of deity; Macleod stresses the coherence of two natures and the communicatio idiomatum.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - Central explanatory category for how full deity and full humanity unite in one Person; used to rebut both Nestorian and Apollinarian errors.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Employed to explain how properties of both natures are ascribed to the one Person of Christ; key to Macleod's defense of orthodox predications (e.g., "God suffered" only in a qualified, Christological sense).
- **Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Macleod upholds divine immutability and argues against readings of incarnation that make Godpassible in a way that undermines divine constancy.
- **Two Natures (Philippians 2 / Chalcedon)**
 - Reiterated Chalcedonian formulation as the theological baseline for any faithful account of Christ.
- **Temptation and Obedience (active/passive)**
 - Christ's active obedience (fulfilling law) and passive obedience (suffering) are joined in his saving work; impeccability frames how temptations function.
- **Soteriology**
 - Christology supplies the mechanics of salvation: mediator who is fully God and fully man secures redemption.
- **Revelation**
 - Doctrine is rooted in Christ as the ultimate revelation; biblical exposition anchors doctrinal claims.
- **Pastoral Application**
 - Doctrinal convictions are applied to worship, moral formation, and evangelical witness.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for classical Christological terms in courses and sermons.
 - As a **polemic resource** against kenoticism and reductionist accounts of Sonship/functional subordination.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading key texts (Philippians 2, Hebrews) with doctrinal precision.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrinal orthodoxy to pastoral formation and Christian living.
