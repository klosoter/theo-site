### TITLE
Remembrance, Communion, and Hope: Rediscovering the Gospel at the Lord's Table - J. Todd Billings

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed and evangelical milieu (early 21st century). Pastoral-theological response to declining sacramental imagination in Protestant churches and to polarized debates between memorialists and high sacramentalists.
 - Dialogue with classical Reformed confessions and with patristic, medieval, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic sacramental theology while speaking into present pastoral practice.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper must be reclaimed as a gospel-shaped practice that does three interrelated things: **remembers** Christ (anamnesis), **communionizes** believers with Christ and one another (participation/union), and **grounds hope** in the eschatological promise (foreshadowing consummation). Current neglect or distortion of any of these diminishes the gospel's communicative power.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Stage 1: Diagnose contemporary problems - reduction of the Supper to private memory, cultural symbolism, or mere obedience; loss of communal and eschatological dimensions.
 - Stage 2: Recover theological resources - biblical exegesis (Pauline and Johannine), Reformed covenant theology, patristic anamnesis, and doctrine of union with Christ.
 - Stage 3: Theological synthesis - sacraments as **means of grace** within covenant community that effect real participation (not magical but not merely symbolic), grounded in Christ's promise and the Spirit's work.
 - Stage 4: Pastoral and liturgical implications - reshape worship, catechesis, and pastoral practice so the Table forms Christian identity, assurance, and hopeful living.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Reformed fathers notably **John Calvin**, Reformed confessions (Westminster, Belgic), and Reformed scholastic categories (sign and seal).
 - Dialogues with **Zwingli** (memorialism), **Luther** (real presence), patristic anamnetic tradition, and contemporary theologians pressing sacramental retrieval.
 - Scripture-focused: Pauline theology of the Supper (1 Cor. 10-11), Johannine themes (union with Christ), and covenantal narratives.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Sacramental theology** (nature and efficacy of sacraments)
 - **Christology** (presence of Christ in the Supper; mediatorial work)
 - **Union with Christ** (participation, communion)
 - **Covenant** (signs and seals within covenant community)
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit's role in making Christ present)
 - **Eschatology** (already/not-yet, foretaste)
 - Secondary: ecclesiology, soteriology, assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - Billings argues the Lord's Table is a gospel enactment: it remembers Christ's work, makes believers participants in him by the Spirit, and sustains eschatological hope for the church's consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses a tripartite grammar - **Remembrance, Communion, and Hope** - as mutually constitutive, not alternative descriptions.
 - Frames sacraments primarily as **gospel enactments** (proclamation performed) rather than mere signs or private memorials.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Critiques Zwinglian reductionism that detaches the Supper from objective promise and communal formation.
 - Avoids Lutheran metaphysics of corporeal presence while resisting a purely symbolic reading; affirms a **real, Spirit-wrought presence** without elevation to physical presence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses Reformed language of **sign and seal** but reconstrues it within an **anamnetic/eschatological** frame-seals as enacted promises that orient toward consummation.
 - Articulates a clear pastoral logic linking sacramental practice to Christian hope and ecclesial identity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable for pastors and Reformed theologians seeking sacramental retrieval; cited in contemporary Reformed liturgical renewal conversations.
 - Appreciated across broader evangelical and ecumenical contexts for bringing biblical depth without confessional polemics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Bridges biblical theology, historical theology, and pastoral practice; equips churches to renew Eucharistic practice in ways that form doctrine, piety, and hope together.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anamnesis (Remembrance)** - active liturgical memory that makes the saving event present; more than recollection, it invokes covenantal participation.
- **Communion/Participation** - believers partake of Christ by the Spirit; real spiritual communion without confounding with physical presence.
- **Means of grace** - sacraments function as instruments through which the Spirit communicates the gospel promise and effectually nourishes faith.
- **Sign and seal** - classical Reformed categories reinterpreted: signs as visible gospel witness; seals as enacted assurances of promise.
- **Real presence (spiritual)** - affirms Christ's true presence mediated by the Spirit; opposite of pure symbolic memorialism and distinct from corporeal presence claims.
- **Covenant logic** - sacraments situated within covenantal promises and communal obligations; the Table as covenantal meal shaping identity.
- **Eschatological foretaste (Hope)** - the Supper points beyond itself to final consummation; fosters already/not-yet orientation in Christian life.
- **Union with Christ** - central soteriological lens for sacramental participation and assurance.
- **Liturgical enactment / gospel enactment** - worship practices as performed theology that both preach and embody the gospel.
- **Anxiety/assurance dialectic** - pastoral attention to how the Table addresses believers' doubt and fosters assurance.
- **Pastoral catechesis** - sacraments as formative for discipleship and church discipline.
- **Reformed retrieval** - corrective project to recover sacramental richness within Reformed boundaries.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed sacramental theology (clarifies terms like "spiritual presence" and "gospel enactment").
 - As a **pastoral-exegetical model** for liturgy planners and pastors seeking to reform Eucharistic practice.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both reductionist memorialism and magical sacramentalism, carving a mediating Reformed path.
