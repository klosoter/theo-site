### TITLE
A Pentecostal Approach to Reformed Theology - Craig S. Keener, in The Spirit and the Church: Essays Honoring Donald Gee (2003)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century moment of growing dialogue between Pentecostal/charismatic movements and historic Protestant traditions. Published in an essay collection honoring Donald Gee (a key British classical Pentecostal leader), Keener writes as a Pentecostal New Testament scholar seeking constructive engagement with Reformed theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Pentecostal pneumatology can and should be integrated with core Reformed commitments: one can retain Reformed doctrinal convictions (Scripture, justification by faith, covenantal structure) while recovering the ongoing, normative work of the Holy Spirit (gifts, witness, sanctifying power) in contemporary church life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis: Luke-Acts and Pauline texts show continuity of Spirit gifts and activity beyond the apostolic era; cessationist readings are exegetically avoidable.
 - Historical retrieval: early and post-Reformation witnesses indicate a more continuous presence of charismatic phenomena than modern cessationism allows.
 - Theological synthesis: proposes a model where the Spirit's experiential presence functions as a companion to, not a replacement of, Reformed emphases on sola Scriptura and covenantal order.
 - Pastoral implications: integrating Pentecostal pneumatology corrects deficiencies in Reformed pastoral life (assurance, experiential sanctification, vigorous worship) without undermining doctrinal safeguards.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical text (especially Pauline and Lukan pneumatology), historical church evidence, and Reformed figures implicitly or explicitly (Calvinic emphases on Spirit, later Reformed cessationists). Dialogues with both cessationist critique and Reformed confessional concerns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, Spirit's role in interpretation)
 - Trinity and the person/role of the Holy Spirit
 - Ecclesiology (signs, sacraments, order, gifts)
 - Sanctification and assurance
 - Relation to covenant theology and justification (defended as compatible)
- **Closing line**
 - Keener argues for a disciplined but vivid synthesis: keep Reformed doctrinal anchors while reclaiming the Holy Spirit's active, charismatic presence as normative for worship, mission, and the believer's life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Pentecostal experience as a theological corrective to impersonal or overly abstract Reformed piety, while insisting on doctrinal integrity.
 - Elevates a biblical-historical case for continuationism targeted specifically at Reformed readers.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Reformed cessationism that marginalizes current Spirit-gifts; challenges Pentecostal tendencies to minimize doctrinal precision by proposing a confessionalizable Pentecostalism.
 - Places experiential claims under ecclesial and scriptural testing rather than private mysticism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Advocates a practical "pneumatic hermeneutic" - reading Scripture with attention to the Spirit's present work as confirming and shaping interpretation without replacing textual authority.
 - Frames Pentecostal gifts as normal instruments of covenantal life rather than occasional exceptions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Helped legitimize dialogue between Pentecostal scholars and Reformed theologians; often cited in discussions seeking a middle way between cessationism and anti-creedal charismaticism.
 - Influential among scholars and pastors seeking robust pneumatology compatible with confessional Reformed commitments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise model for integrating experience and doctrine; valuable for ecumenical theology, pastoral formation, and teaching on pneumatology within historically Reformed contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pentecostal pneumatology** - emphasis on present, experiential work of the Spirit (gifts, empowerment, witness).
- **Reformed commitments** - core commitments: sola Scriptura, justification by faith, covenantal frameworks; Keener argues these need not exclude charismatic praxis.
- **Continuationism vs. cessationism** - Keener argues for continuationism on exegetical and historical grounds, directly addressing Reformed cessationist positions.
- **Pneumatic hermeneutic** - reading and applying Scripture with active attention to the Spirit's confirming and guiding ministry.
- **Spirit's witness** - experiential assurance and inner testimony as complementary to scriptural assurance, subject to ecclesial verification.
- **Charismatic gifts** - tongues, prophecy, healing, etc., treated as potentially normative and ecclesially regulable rather than merely extraordinary.
- **Ecclesial testing** - procedures and safeguards for discerning Spirit-given manifestations within church order and doctrine.
- **Sacraments and Spirit** - reinterprets sacramental life to include charismatic expectation without abandoning Reformed sacramental theology.
- **Sanctification and assurance** - integrates Pentecostal emphasis on experiential sanctification with Reformed doctrine of progressive sanctification.
- **Covenant theology reframing** - proposes that charismatic activity is compatible with covenantal structures, enriching covenant life.
- **Experiential confirmation** - concept that Spirit-given experience can confirm doctrinal truth when measured by Scripture and tradition.
- **Doctrinal safeguards** - insistence on creedal/confessional boundaries to prevent excesses.
- **Pastoral pneumatology** - practical application for worship, healing ministry, and pastoral care within Reformed contexts.
- **Ecumenical bridge** - the essay's practical-cum-theological posture that makes constructive Protestant-Pentecostal dialogue possible.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for a synthesized Pentecostal-Reformed approach to pneumatology.
- As a **polemic** against Reformed cessationism and against unregulated charismatic practice.
- As an **exegetical model** for New Testament-based arguments supporting contemporary Spirit gifts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and discussions on integrating experiential pneumatology with confessional theology.
