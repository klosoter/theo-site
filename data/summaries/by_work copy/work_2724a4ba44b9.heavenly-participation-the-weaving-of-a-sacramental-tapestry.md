### TITLE
**Heavenly Participation: The Weaving of a Sacramental Tapestry - Hans Boersma**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary (early 21st century) ressourcement movement within Reformed and Anglican theological circles; published amid renewed interest in patristic theosis and sacramental theology.
 - Reaction to modern secularizing trajectories in theology (privatized religion, immanentism) and to Protestant tendencies that reduce sacraments to signs or symbols.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian worship and the sacraments are constitutive means by which believers **participate in the heavenly reality** of the triune God; sacraments are not merely signs but ontological instruments that incorporate the faithful into Christ and the heavenly liturgy.
 - Problem addressed: the fragmentation of Christian ontology and liturgical life that severs earthly worship from heavenly realities and thus impoverishes soteriology, ecclesiology, and cosmology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Retrieval of patristic and medieval insights about participation/theosis and sacramental mediation.
 - The sacraments (especially baptism and Eucharist) enact an ontological exchange: Christ's heavenly life is communicated to the church; they are entry points into the heavenly liturgy.
 - The liturgy is a site of revelation and transformation - a "tapestry" where Scripture, symbol, matter, and heavenly worship are woven together.
 - Proposes a theological hermeneutic that reads Scripture and sacrament typologically and liturgically rather than merely propositional or forensic.
 - Offers constructive proposals for a sacramental ontology that preserves Trinitarian integrity and eschatological orientation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Extensive engagement with Church Fathers (Athanasius, Irenaeus, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine), medieval sacramental thinkers, and Reformers (esp. Calvin) as well as contemporary critics (various Protestant and modernist strands).
 - Dialogues with modern theologians skeptical of sacramental realism (e.g., certain Barthian or Bultmannian approaches) and with contemporary ecumenical sacramental theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology (incarnation and the communicatio), soteriology (participation/theosis), sacramentology (baptism, Eucharist), ecclesiology (the church as eucharistic community), eschatology (heavenly worship and realized eschatology), creation and redemption.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The church's liturgical and sacramental life is the primary locus where heaven and earth are joined: sacraments are real means of heavenly participation that reorient Christian identity, cosmos, and destiny toward the triune God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong recovery of the patristic idea of theosis within a Western/Reformed frame; sacraments as vehicles of ontological participation rather than mere signifying acts.
 - Liturgical epistemology: liturgy as knowing (epistemic) not merely doing (practical), so worship shapes believers' ontology and cognition.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Protestant memorialist and purely forensic accounts of sacraments by restoring sacramental realism and material efficacy.
 - Critiques modern privatizing tendencies that detach doctrine from liturgical, embodied practice.
 - Offers a corrective to reductionist readings of Calvin by re-emphasizing incorporation and cosmic dimensions of his thought.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Sacramental tapestry" - a woven metaphor emphasizing the interrelation of Scripture, liturgy, matter, and heaven.
 - "Heavenly participation" as a compact theological program linking theosis, sacramental mediation, and eucharistic cosmology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary sacramental, liturgical, and patristic-ressourcement scholarship; influential among theologians seeking an ecumenical retrieval of sacramental realism.
 - Provoked critique from strict memorialists and some Barthian interpreters who resist ontological readings of the sacraments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust framework for reintegrating doctrine, liturgy, and spirituality; useful for worship renewal, ecumenical dialogue, and re-theorizing sacramental practice in postmodern contexts.
