### TITLE
Heralds of God - James S. Stewart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Scottish pastoral-theological milieu; Stewart writes as a Presbyterian minister and university chaplain addressing churches and pastors confronting modern secularism, pastoral dislocation, and the need for authentic proclamation.
 - Moves within a Reformed devotional tradition informed by evangelical piety and pastoral realism rather than abstract systematic theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The authority and efficacy of Christian proclamation depends not merely on doctrine or technique but on the preacher's real participation in Christ; true heraldship issues from union with Christ and the Spirit's work in the messenger.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Pastoral calling framed as "heraldship": proclamation is a personal vocation, not simply an office to be performed.
 - Union with Christ is presented as the ontological and pastoral basis for effective witness:
 - The herald speaks because he is spoken in; his identity and message are rooted in a living union.
 - The Spirit mediates that union and curls preaching into sacramental presence.
 - Practical consequences: integrity of life, pastoral intimacy, and the necessity of prayer, Bible-saturated life, and dependence on the Spirit for fruit.
 - Ends with exhortation to cultivate inward union so that outward proclamation becomes authentic and powerful.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on the Reformed and Puritan pastoral tradition for categories of vocation and devotion.
 - Uses Scripture and pastoral exemplars rather than systematic theologians; engages contemporary pastoral challenges more than technical polemics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Union with Christ** (central)
 - Christology (the herald's relation to the incarnate Word)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as mediator of union and presence)
 - Ecclesiology and ministry (nature of the church's office-bearers)
 - Soteriology and sanctification as rooted in union

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Proclamation is authentic and efficacious only when the herald is inwardly joined to Christ by the Spirit; ministry is existential participation before it is public performance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes the preacher's personal incorporation into Christ as the decisive theological-pastoral criterion for ministry effectiveness.
 - Treats preaching almost sacramentally: not replacing sacraments but making present the reality of Christ through the person united to Him.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against purely rhetorical, ethical, or programmatic models of ministry that prioritize skill, social relevance, or doctrine over the preacher's inner life.
 - Corrects clericalism by tying authority to participation in Christ rather than mere office or institutional power.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts ministerial identity under the label **"herald"** with theological force: heraldship is both vocation and ontological status conferred by union.
 - Uses pastoral categories (personality, presence, authenticity) as theological loci rather than mere pastoral technique.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in mid-to-late 20th century homiletics and pastoral formation in the Reformed and broader evangelical world.
 - Valued by pastors and seminary teachers for its integration of spirituality and ministry practice; less cited in strictly systematic debates but often used in pastoral theology curricula.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models how to root homiletics and pastoral identity in doctrine (union with Christ) without reducing ministry to abstract theology.
 - Serves as a corrective to competency-only formations and a resource for pastoral spirituality.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Herald** - the preacher as vocation-bearer whose speech issues from personal incorporation in Christ.
- **Union with Christ** - the decisive theological ground in Stewart: ontological participation that underwrites pastoral authority, identity, and fruitfulness.
- **Presence** - the mediated nearness of Christ in proclamation when the herald is united to Him.
- **Personality / Personal authenticity** - the preacher's lived self as the primary instrument of proclamation; integrity of life is non-negotiable.
- **Spirit as Mediator** - the Holy Spirit effects and sustains union, enabling the herald's speech to be more than argument.
- **Sacramental quality of proclamation** - preaching functions as a means whereby Christ's reality is presented to hearers when uttered by one joined to Him.
- **Vocation** - ministry conceived primarily as a calling grounded in being-in-Christ rather than social role or career.
- **Pastoral realism** - attention to concrete pastoral practices (prayer, Scripture, presence) anchored in theology.
- **Incarnation-analogy** - the herald participates in the incarnational pattern: personal presence conveying divine truth.
- **Authority rooted in relation** - distinction from authority rooted in office, legalism, or institutional role.
- **Sanctification as outworking** - the herald's life shows the transformative fruit of union, not merely orthodoxy of belief.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** in pastoral theology for what constitutes authentic ministry (heraldship grounded in union).
 - As a **polemic** against technique-driven homiletics and clericalism, insisting on inner formation.
 - As an **exegetical and homiletical model** for preaching that ties proclamation to the preacher's embodied union with Christ.
