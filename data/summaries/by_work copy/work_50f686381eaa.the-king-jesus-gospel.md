### TITLE
The King Jesus Gospel - Scot McKnight

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2011 amid evangelical debates over the content of the gospel, American church practice, and renewed interest in kingdom theology and narrative-focused preaching.
 - Part of a larger corrective movement that includes N.T. Wright and others who emphasize Jesus' lordship and inaugurated eschatology against privatized, conversion-centered evangelism.

- **Central thesis**
 - The true gospel is the proclamation that **Jesus is King** and that through his life, death, and resurrection God has begun to establish his kingdom; contemporary evangelical reductions that present the gospel primarily as a method for individual salvation are misshapen.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern evangelicalism commonly reduces the gospel to personal forgiveness and a conversion formula ("How to be saved"), divorcing it from Jesus' announcement of God's reign.
 - Biblical reorientation: the New Testament witness-especially Jesus' proclamation, the early kerygma, and Paul-presents the gospel as kingdom-centered news about a reigning Messiah and the creation of a covenant people.
 - Theological correction: salvation must be understood as participation in Christ's kingly rule and in the new community (church) called to embody the kingdom.
 - Practical consequences: preaching, evangelism, discipleship, and mission should call people to repent, follow Jesus as Lord, and live in the public ethics of the kingdom.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture (Gospels, Pauline kerygma) as primary authority.
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with modern evangelical practice (e.g., decisionism, altar-call models), and with scholars emphasizing justification as center (critique of reductionism).
 - Intellectual kinship with N.T. Wright and George Eldon Ladd on kingdom themes; corrective stance toward popularizers who privatize the gospel.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: Jesus as Messiah-King and Lord.
 - **Soteriology**: salvation framed as covenantal and communal participation in the inaugurated kingdom rather than merely forensic pardon.
 - **Eschatology**: inaugurated/realized eschatology-kingdom "already/not yet."
 - **Ecclesiology**: church as the visible people of the King called to embody kingdom life.
 - **Mission & ethics**: gospel has public, social, and moral implications.

- **Closing line**
 - The book insists the theological center of gravity for Christian proclamation is not a private transaction but the announcement: **Jesus is King; enter his kingdom by repentance and discipleship.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Re-centers the **kingship of Jesus** as the nucleus of the gospel rather than justification language or individualized soteriology.
 - Stresses gospel as **kerygma (public proclamation)** and communal summons to kingdom formation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges popular evangelical formulas (decision-oriented invitations, "ask Jesus into your heart") as truncated presentations that obscure Jesus' lordship and the ethical demands of discipleship.
 - While not denying atonement or justification, he opposes making these the sole explanatory center of the gospel.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Pivots language from "the gospel as rescue from sin" to "the gospel as the inauguration of royal rule"-a shift in focal imagery with pastoral and missionary consequences.
 - Recasts repentance as reorientation to Jesus' kingship and communal participation rather than merely remorse plus prayer.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in evangelical circles; praised as a corrective for overly individualistic evangelism and for renewing attention to Jesus' mission.
 - Criticized by some for underplaying traditional theological loci (e.g., forensic justification) or for not fully integrating systematic categories; debated in both popular and academic fora.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes rethinking of preaching, evangelism, and Christian discipleship; useful in courses on gospel theology, mission, and practical theology as a concise manifesto urging a return to biblical kerygma.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **King Jesus Gospel**
 - McKnight's label for gospel as proclamation of Jesus' kingship and the inauguration of God's reign.
- **Gospel (kerygma)**
 - Public announcement about what God has done in Christ; broader than individual conversion formulas.
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Central motif; both present reality and future consummation (inaugurated eschatology).
- **Repentance**
 - Reorientation to Jesus' rule; entry-point into kingdom discipleship.
- **Lordship / Kingship**
 - Core descriptor of Jesus; grounds discipleship, ethics, and community identity.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - "Already/not yet" framework: kingdom begun in Christ but awaiting consummation.
- **Church as covenant people**
 - Ecclesiology stresses communal, public witness and embodied kingdom life.
- **Personal salvation (criticized usage)**
 - The reduction McKnight critiques: gospel presented chiefly as private transaction for individual souls.
- **Discipleship**
 - Central response to the gospel; practical life under King Jesus.
- **Mission / witness**
 - Gospel entails both proclamation and the formation of a community that demonstrates kingdom realities.
- **Atonement / justification (secondary framing)**
 - Affirmed but relocated as components within the broader kingdom announcement, not as the defining center.
- **Narrative / biblical-theological reading**
 - Methodological posture: reads Scripture as unified story centered on Jesus' reign.
- **Public implications**
 - The gospel as social and ethical, not merely spiritualized interiority.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: to articulate a kingdom-centered definition of "gospel" in preaching and curricula.
 - As a **polemic**: to critique decisionist evangelism and privatized soteriology.
 - As an **exegetical model**: for preaching that foregrounds Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom and the church's public witness.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in mission studies and discipleship formation toward communal, kingdom-shaped practices.
