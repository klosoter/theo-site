### TITLE
**In the Shadow of the Temple: The Image of God in Genesis 1-3** 
Catherine L. McDowell (conference presentations)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Conference papers situated within recent evangelical and academic debates (late 20th-21st c.) on Genesis anthropology, influenced by ANE studies, priestly-source scholarship, and the rise of the functional/relational model (e.g., Walton, Middleton).
 - Engages both biblical-critical exegesis and constructive theological reflection for doctrine of humanity, worship, and vocation.

- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1-3 should be read in the *shadow of the temple*: Adam and Eve are presented as the cultic, priestly image (tselem) of God within Eden-as-sanctuary. The imago Dei is primarily a sacerdotal-functional vocation (rule + worship), whose failure in Genesis 3 is a form of temple desecration that Christ subsequently restores.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of textual signals linking Eden and temple architecture (gardens, cherubim, tree of life, eastward positioning).
 - philological analysis of key terms (tselem, demut) and their functional-social resonance in ANE contexts.
 - Theocratic/priestic reading: Adam as vice-regent/priest whose duty is to cultivate and guard the sanctuary-world.
 - The Fall reframed as cultic rebellion - not merely ontological loss but vocational dislocation.
 - Systematic implications: how this reading informs anthropology, covenant, Christology (Christ as true Image/priest), ecclesiology and liturgy.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical texts: Genesis 1-3 (P and J layers), Psalms, Ezekiel, Priestly tradition.
 - ANE parallels (temple-cosmos motifs), modern interlocutors such as John H. Walton, Meredith G. Kline, J. Richard Middleton, and patristic echoes (Image/Likeness tradition).
 - Methodologically interacts with history-of-religions, canonical, and theological readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (Imago Dei), sin and the Fall, covenantal responsibility, priesthood/temple theology, Christology (Image-fulfillment), soteriology (restoration), ecclesiology and worship.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the image of God in Genesis 1-3 is first and foremost a liturgical-priestly vocation - humans as God's temple-keepers whose proper being is realized in faithful worshipful rule, redemptively restored in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong architectural/spatial lens: Eden read as proto-temple rather than merely idyllic garden.
 - Prioritizes *vocational* (priest-king) over strictly ontological accounts of imago Dei.
 - Connects cultic language to ecological stewardship: care for creation is liturgical service.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on purely substantive (ontological) readings that abstract the image from priestly function.
 - Nuances Waltonian functionalism by retaining theological depth (relational and Christological fulfillment), not reducing imago Dei to mere role-performance.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the metaphor "shadow of the temple" to name Genesis' anticipatory temple logic.
 - Frames sin as "temple desecration" - a helpful diagnostic vocabulary for pastoral and ecological ethics.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in evangelical and Reformed circles as an exegetical corrective that integrates worship, covenant, and vocation.
 - Cited in studies of imago Dei, sacramental anthropology, and creation care; influences preaching and liturgical theology more than systematic dogmatics broadly.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, teachable model linking Genesis exegesis to ecclesial practice.
 - Durable for interdisciplinary work (biblical studies, ethics, liturgy) and for shaping a non-dualistic, vocation-centered anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (tselem / demut)** - McDowell emphasizes functional/relational senses: image as office/vocation (priestly representation), not merely innate property.
- **Eden-as-Sanctuary / Temple motif** - Eden interpreted as a proto-temple; its features correspond to cultic architecture and cultic goods (tree of life, cherubim).
- **Priest-King / Vice-regent** - Adam's dual role: ruling stewardship + cultic service; model for human vocation.
- **Temple Desecration** - Fall as violation of cultic order and failure of stewardship, not only metaphysical corruption.
- **Cosmic-Temple / Axis Mundi** - Tree of life and garden as cultic axis connecting heaven/earth; informs cosmic worship.
- **Functional vs. Substantive Imago** - McDowell sides with functional (role-based) while retaining theological substance via Christic completion.
 - Relation to Walton: shares role-focused reading; differs by stressing Christological and worship implications.
- **Priestly (P) language** - Uses Priestly source motifs to justify temple-reading of Genesis.
- **Sabbath as liturgical consummation** - Sabbath parallels temple rest and liturgy; human vocation culminates in Sabbath-worship.
- **Cherubim / Throne Imagery** - Guarding the garden echoes throne-room motifs and temple guardianship.
- **Christ as True Image** - New Testament fulfillment: Jesus restores and enacts the vocational image (Col 1; Rom 8).
- **Covenant Responsibility** - Imago framed within divine commission and covenantal accountability.
- **Ecological Stewardship as Worship** - Care for creation recast as liturgical duty of temple-keepers.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis through temple-cultic categories and for lectures on imago Dei.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting anthropology, worship, and ethics (esp. creation care), useful in preaching and pastoral formation.
- As a **polemic/resource** against reductive ontological or purely individualistic interpretations of the image of God.
