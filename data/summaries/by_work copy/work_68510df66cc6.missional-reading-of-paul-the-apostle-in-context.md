### TITLE
Missional Reading of Paul: The Apostle in Context - Michael Barram

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary NT scholarship and mission theology conversation (early 21st century).
 - Responds to increased interest in contextual, socio-rhetorical, and missiological readings of Scripture within evangelical and academic circles.
 - Dialogue partner to socio-historical Pauline studies and to the missional church movement.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul must be read first and foremost as a missionary apostle in specific social, cultural, and rhetorical contexts; doing so reshapes key doctrinal readings (e.g., justification, law, ecclesiology).
 - Theological distortions arise when Paul is abstracted into systematic categories divorced from his missionary praxis.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrates Paul's letters as a corpus of missionally situated correspondence rather than detached theological treatises.
 - Traces how Paul's theology emerges from and serves his missionary aims:
 - social location and audience analysis inform theological emphases;
 - rhetoric and paraenetic strategies reveal pastoral-missional priorities;
 - theological loci (justification, covenant, Spirit, law) are functionally oriented toward mission and church formation.
 - Proposes a hermeneutic: read Paul through the lens of mission without collapsing theology into mere pragmatics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages socio-historical Pauline scholars (e.g., Sanders, Dunn, Wright) and contemporary missiologists.
 - Interacts with rhetorical criticism and contextual theology literature.
 - Critiques more abstracted systematic interpreters of Paul (various Reformed and Protestant traditions that treat Paul primarily as doctrinal source).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant and justification** - reinterpreted in light of missionally-driven identity formation.
 - **Christology and soteriology** - emphasized as instruments for sending, proclamation, and reconciliation.
 - **Ecclesiology** - church as missionary agent; formation of communities for the sake of witness.
 - **Spirit and ethics** - pneumatology tied to empowerment for mission; ethics arise from communal identity and missional witness.
 - **Law** - functionally examined in its role for boundary markers and mission strategy rather than only as locus of theological debate.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The theological heart of the book: Paul's theology is best understood as theology-in-service-of-mission - doctrine shaped by apostolic context, aimed at forming and sending communities for God's redemptive purposes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places mission as the primary hermeneutical key for Pauline interpretation.
 - Prioritizes social location, rhetorical situation, and paraenetic intent over abstract doctrinal systems.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that detach Paul from his missionary praxis (both pietistic and purely dogmatic readings).
 - Offers corrective to some "systematic Paulinism" by insisting on function and context before taxonomy.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advocates the term **"missional hermeneutic"** for guiding Pauline exegesis.
 - Uses formulations like **"apostolic correspondence"** and **"theology as sending-logic"** to reframe Pauline texts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Particularly influential in mission studies, seminaries interested in contextual theology, and among scholars promoting praxis-sensitive exegesis.
 - Less adopted in some conservative systematic circles that maintain confessional doctrinal priorities irrespective of context.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating exegesis, theology, and mission practice.
 - Useful corrective to decontextualized readings and a resource for forming mission-shaped curricula and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missional reading** - interpreting texts with mission as the central lens; asks how theology serves sending and witness.
- **Apostle in context** - focus on Paul's concrete role, mobility, and situated interventions rather than abstract doctrinal pronouncements.
- **Missionary correspondence** - letters as communication aimed at establishing, guiding, and sustaining mission communities.
- **Rhetorical situation** - attention to audience, occasion, and persuasive strategies in Pauline texts.
- **Social location** - the social, ethnic, and economic realities that shape Pauline theology and pastoral decisions.
- **Paraenesis** - ethical exhortation as an instrument of community formation and mission.
- **Theology-as-practice** - thesis that doctrine functions to enable and sustain missionary praxis.
- **Covenant identity** - how covenant markers (law, circumcision, table fellowship) function in building mission identity boundaries.
- **Pneumatological mission** - Spirit as empowering agent for witness and community life.
- **Justification-in-mission** - reframes justification as relational and communal status relevant to mission.
- **Ecclesial sending** - church understood principally as sender and sent community, not merely recipient of doctrinal propositions.
- **Contextual hermeneutic** - method that reads Scripture in light of historical, cultural, and missional contexts.
- **Reception-focused exegesis** - emphasis on how early recipients would have heard and acted on Pauline letters.
- **Ethics-as-witness** - ethical instruction evaluated primarily by its role in public witness and reconciliation.

- **How this work is used**
 - As an **exegetical model**: guides reading Paul with attention to context, rhetoric, and mission priorities.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: reframes debates on justification, law, and ecclesiology toward missional concerns.
 - As a **teaching resource**: used in courses that bridge New Testament studies and mission/theology formation.
