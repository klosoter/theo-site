### TITLE
The Word of the Cross: Reading Paul - Jonathan A. Linebaugh

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed theological context attentive to Pauline theology and preaching. Engages both historical-critical Pauline scholarship and confessional readings that foreground proclamation and doctrinal reception.
- **Central thesis**
 - Paul must be read through the **"word of the cross"**: the apostolic kerygma centered on Christ crucified serves as the decisive hermeneutical key for Pauls theology, ethics, and ecclesial formation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegetical readings of core Pauline texts (notably 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Romans) demonstrate that Paul frames Christian identity and doctrine around the cross as paradoxical wisdom.
 - The apostolic proclamation (kerygma) is formative: speech-act theology - the gospel as announcing, constituting, and sustaining the church.
 - The cross subverts worldly wisdom and power, reframing categories such as righteousness, wisdom, law, and eschatology.
 - Practical and doctrinal implications follow: justification, sanctification, and church life must be read as cruciform consequences of the proclamation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (and the rhetorical and Jewish-Gentile contexts of his letters).
 - Secondary interlocutors: classical Reformation and patristic emphases on the cross; contemporary Pauline scholarship including the New Perspective on Paul (implicitly or explicitly contrasted); recent theological readings that prioritize proclamation (kerygmatic theology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (centrality of crucified Christ)
 - **Soteriology** (justification, righteousness of God)
 - **Revelation/Soteriological proclamation** (kerygma as decisive form of divine revelation)
 - **Ecclesiology** (the church shaped by proclaimed cross)
 - **Ethics/Anthropology** (cruciform life as Pauls ethical aim)
 - **Law and Eschatology** (law, fulfillment, and future-oriented remaking of covenant identity)
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - For Linebaugh, the cross is not merely an event to be explained doctrinally but the apostolic word that forms the church, critiques worldly wisdom, and orders doctrine and life around Christ crucified.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the **kerygmatic priority**: Pauls language and theology are first speech-act and proclamation, then systematics.
 - Reading Paul as a rhetorician of paradox: the cross as the interpretive pressure that inverts worldly categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against readings that displace the cross (e.g., sociological or purely ethical readings of Paul, and readings that over-privilege second-century developments or programmatic systematic reductions).
 - Offers a corrective to some strands of the New Perspective by recovering the centrality of cruciform proclamation for Pauls own self-understanding.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a "word of the cross" hermeneutic as methodological tool: treat kerygma as lens rather than merely doctrinal content.
 - Reframes Pauline theology as inherently performative: proclamation creates the covenantal community and its identity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among pastors and theologians seeking an integrated exegetical-theological approach that privileges preaching and formation.
 - Useful in Reformed circles that seek to revive cross-centered preaching; also engages broader evangelical debates on Pauls central concerns.
- **Enduring value**
 - A compact model for reading Paul that marries rigorous exegesis with theological and pastoral priorities; durable for homiletics, systematic theology, and Pauline studies that refuse to separate proclamation from doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of the Cross**
 - Pauls central kerygma; paradoxical proclamation that undoes worldly wisdom and grounds Christian identity.
- **Kerygma / Proclamation**
 - The apostolic speech-act that announces and constitutively forms the church; not merely propositional content but performative event.
- **Cruciformity**
 - The ethical and existential shape of Christian life derived from the cross-centered proclamation.
- **Foolishness / Wisdom (Pauline antithesis)**
 - The rhetorical inversion motif: what the world deems foolish is Godly wisdom in the cross.
- **Justification / Righteousness of God**
 - Read through the lens of proclamation: juridical and covenantal fruit of the crucified Christ as announced in the gospel.
- **Law and Fulfillment**
 - Law displaced and fulfilled by the eschatological reality announced in the crucified and risen Christ.
- **Apostolic Authority**
 - Authority grounded not in social status or rhetoric alone but in the faithful proclamation of the cross that calls and forms covenant community.
- **Eschatological Orientation**
 - The cross as already/not-yet hinge: crucifixion and resurrection frame present ethics and future consummation.
- **Performative Speech-Act**
 - Theological method: emphasis on how proclamation effects ecclesial realities (faith, baptism, church life).
- **Paradoxical Rhetoric**
 - Mode where suffering and weakness are normative for the Christian calling because they reveal divine power.
- **Christological Centering**
 - Every Pauline locus (doctrine, life, worship) interpreted through the person and work of the crucified Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul that privileges kerygma and rhetorical form.
- As a **polemic** against non-cruciform or socio-historical reductive readings of Paul.
- As a **resource for preaching and ecclesiology**, supplying a theology that links proclamation, doctrine, and church formation.
