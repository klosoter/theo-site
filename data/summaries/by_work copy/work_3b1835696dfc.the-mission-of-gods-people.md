### TITLE
The Mission of God's People - Christopher J. H. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical Anglican Old Testament scholar writing in a postcolonial, post-Bosch mission scholarship era. Aimed at churches, mission practitioners, and seminaries seeking a biblically grounded, non-dualistic account of mission (early 21st century global-evangelical milieu).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Mission is not an optional program of the church but the church's participation in the ongoing mission of the triune God (missio Dei) as revealed across the Old and New Testaments. Theological error corrected: reducing mission to individual salvation, church growth techniques, or social action alone.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Maps mission across Scripture with sustained attention to Old Testament foundations (covenant, land, temple, law, election).
 - Shows continuity: Israel was called to be God's missionary people; Jesus fulfills and reorients that vocation; the church inherits and participates in Jesus' mission.
 - Articulates a holistic mission that integrates proclamation, discipleship, worship, justice and creation care as facets of God's saving plan.
 - Applies biblical theology to church life and global mission strategy: mission flows from God's character (justice, mercy, faithfulness) and purposes (kingdom restoration).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Interaction with modern mission theorists (e.g., Lesslie Newbigin, David Bosch), evangelical exegetical tradition, covenant theologians, and global church practice. Heavy use of OT and NT texts as primary sources; critique of narrow pietistic and dualistic mission models.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant, Christology (Jesus as fulfillment of Israel's mission), Trinity (mission rooted in triune life), ecclesiology (church as God's people), soteriology, eschatology (kingdom/renewal), ethics, and missional hermeneutics.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Mission is essentially the church's vocation to participate in God's covenantal, kingdom-restoring work revealed in Christ and carried out by God's people in word and deed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Old Testament centrality for mission:** Unusually sustained treatment of OT as normative for understanding Christian mission; treats Israel's vocation as paradigmatic rather than accidental.
- **Christ as hermeneutical key:** Argues that Jesus fulfills Israel's missionary vocation, so Christian mission must be read through Christ both in OT promise and NT fulfilment (ties to "Christ in OT and NT").
- **Holism without dilution:** Integrates evangelism, social justice, worship and ecology into a single missional framework grounded in God's purposes rather than pragmatic syncretism.
- **People-centric ecclesiology:** Emphasizes mission as the calling of God's people collectively, not merely clergy or mission agencies; mission flows from identity (people of God) more than program.
- **Correctives to predecessors:**
 - Counsels against privatized, individual-centered evangelism and against reducing mission to political or social projects.
 - Pushes back on triumphalistic/colonial missionary patterns by re-framing mission in covenantal and incarnational categories.
- **Terminological/conceptual clarity:** Reclaims missio Dei language while refusing to make mission identical with church survival or institutional expansion.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in evangelical and Anglican mission training; influential for churches seeking biblical-theological grounding for holistic mission; referenced in missiological textbooks and seminary curricula.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a durable, Scripture-centered framework for teaching mission across both Old and New Testament studies and for practical church application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missio Dei:** God's mission; starting point for mission theology - mission belongs first to God, the church participates.
- **Covenant vocation:** Israel's calling as God's instrument; church inherits and fulfills this priestly/missionary role.
- **Kingdom (eschatological and present):** Mission is work of kingdom restoration now and anticipation of consummation.
- **Fulfillment in Christ:** Jesus as the climax of Israel's story and the focus for reading OT mission narratives.
- **People of God:** Identity-based concept - mission issues from who the church is, not primarily what it does.
- **Holistic mission (word and deed):** Integration of proclamation, discipleship, mercy, justice and stewardship.
- **Prophetic witness:** Social and ethical dimensions of mission rooted in covenantal justice and faithfulness.
- **Incarnational ministry:** Presence, contextualization and embodiment of Christ's mission in cultures.
- **Temple/land motifs:** Biblical motifs underpinning stewardship, worship and social order in mission contexts.
- **Mission as formed by worship:** Worship shapes mission priorities; mission flows from doxology and covenant faithfulness.
- **Continuity and distinction (Israel/Church):** Continuity of vocation without collapsing distinct covenant administrations.
- **Missional hermeneutics:** Reading Scripture with an eye to God's mission across canonical narrative.
- **Discipleship and formation:** Long-term vocational shaping of God's people for witness and service.
- **Contextualization and global ethos:** Emphasis on local cultural engagement and critique of imperialist mission forms.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a biblically rooted, holistic doctrine of mission (seminaries, mission agencies).
- As a **polemic** against individualistic, programmatic or colonial approaches to mission.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading OT texts in light of Christ and for deriving ecclesial-missional practices.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula linking biblical theology, ecclesiology and practical mission strategy.
