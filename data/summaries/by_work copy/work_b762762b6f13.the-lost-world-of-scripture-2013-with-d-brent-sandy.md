### TITLE
The Lost World of Scripture (2013, with D. Brent Sandy) - John H. Walton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in 2013 amid intensified evangelical engagement with ancient Near Eastern (ANE) studies, debates over Genesis interpretation, and public disputes between young-earth creationism and mainstream science. Walton, an Old Testament scholar long arguing for ANE-informed readings, here addresses widespread misunderstandings that result from reading Scripture through modern categories.
- **Central thesis:** Genesis 1-11 should be read according to ancient cognitive categories - especially **functional ontology** and **temple cosmology** - so that many perceived conflicts between Scripture and science (and between biblical texts and later theological traditions) are category errors.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Show how ANE literature (e.g., creation myths, temple inauguration texts) evidences a functional, role-oriented way of describing origins.
 - Reinterpret Genesis 1 as *temple inauguration* and *assignment of function* rather than a material origin-science account.
 - Reframe the Fall as a failure to perform assigned roles (loss of function/status) rather than necessarily as the ontological corruption of nature.
 - Apply this hermeneutic to reconciliation of Scripture with scientific data and to pastoral/ethical questions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Ancient Near Eastern texts (Enuma Elish and temple texts), major commentators and theologians (Augustine, Meredith Kline among covenant theologians), contemporary scientists and evangelical critics (young-earth proponents), and recent hermeneutical literature.
 - Explicitly dialogues with **Klinean covenant theology** on creation/covenant motifs and with ethical frameworks that treat human rupture as an "intrusion" into divine domain.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, creation (ontology/teleology), anthropology (image of God), sin and the Fall, covenantal order, and implications for soteriology and ethics.
- **Closing line:** Walton's theological center of gravity: Genesis communicates God's sovereign assignment of function and ordering (a cosmic temple inauguration), so reading it in its native ANE categories reframes debates about the Fall, covenant responsibility, and the relationship of Scripture to science.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Functional ontology** - beings described by what they do and what role they occupy, not by material composition.
 - **Temple cosmology** - creation as God's act of making the world his temple/home and installing functions; Genesis 1 as inauguration liturgy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Contrasts with **concordist** readings that demand Genesis be a proto-scientific account.
 - Engages and revises some readings influenced by **Klinean covenant theology** by relocating emphasis from juridical/ treaty form to cultic/temple form in Genesis.
 - Revises classic Augustinian and some Reformed models of the Fall by interpreting Adam's sin primarily as functional failure (see "The Fall And Its Consequences" engagement).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Moves debates from "material origins" to "functional ordering" and reframes key theological problems (death, sin, image of God) accordingly.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in evangelical circles for providing a robust ANE-informed hermeneutic; used as a bridge between many evangelicals and mainstream science.
 - Criticized by Young-Earth Creationists and some Reformed scholars for perceived underplaying of ontological effects of sin and threats to traditional readings.
- **Enduring value:** Provocative, corrective framework for reading Genesis 1-11 that forces exegetes and theologians to justify their modern categories; indispensable for science-scripture dialogue and for courses on hermeneutics and Genesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Functional ontology:** Being defined by assigned role/function rather than material constitution; central hermeneutical key.
- **Temple cosmology:** The cosmos portrayed as God's temple; creation narrative functions as inauguration rite.
- **Creation as assignment:** God's creative acts are primarily about assigning roles and functions.
- **Image of God (functional reading):** Human dignity tied to functional vocation (representing God, exercising rule), not primarily substance.
- **Fall as functional failure:** Adam's sin construed as failure to perform delegated functions; ethical/covenantal disruption rather than automatic material corruption.
- **Death and antecedent mortality:** Distinguishes functional/deprivational death from physical mortality; allows for some readings that physical death precedes Adam.
- **Concordism (critique):** The project of reading Genesis as modern science; Walton argues this is a category error.
- **ANE parallels:** Use of Enuma Elish and temple texts to illuminate Israelite cognitive categories.
- **Klinean Covenant Theology (engagement):** Walton dialogues with covenantal frameworks that read creation through treaty/kingdom motifs; he redirects emphasis toward cultic/temple forms and functional descriptions.
- **Intrusion ethics (relation):** Walton's account reframes "intrusion" models (human violation of divine domain) as primarily a failure of role performance and covenantal responsibility.
- **Canonical reading:** Emphasizes reading Genesis within its ancient canonical-theological context rather than modern scientistic questions.
- **Hermeneutical pivot:** Moves debate about doctrine and science from empirical compatibility to category alignment.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "functional ontology" and "temple cosmology" in biblical theology curricula.
- As a **polemic** against concordist and young-earth positions that insist Genesis must be a modern material origin account.
- As an **exegetical model** for Genesis 1-11, influencing commentaries and classroom exegesis.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in science-and-scripture conversations, reframing questions toward roles, meaning, and theological function.
