### TITLE
God the Peacemaker: How Atonement Brings Shalom - Graham A. Cole

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical scholarship (21st century). Situated within renewed interest in Trinitarian theology, biblical theology of shalom, and corrective engagements with narrow atonement models.
 - Dialogues with both classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster tradition) and recent atonement conversations (Aulen, Moltmann, N. T. Wright) while defending a broadly covenantal, penal-substitution-friendly frame.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The atonement must be understood primarily as the work of **God the Peacemaker**: Christ's reconciling death and resurrection bring covenantal shalom (personal, social, cosmic). Theologic accounts that reduce atonement to forensic transaction or to single metaphors miss the Trinitarian and soteriological breadth of peace-restoration.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Old Testament shalom motifs and New Testament portrayal of Christ as peace-bringer (e.g., Isaiah, Psalms, Paul, Hebrews, Colossians).
 - Trinitarian framing: Father's reconciling initiative, Son's atoning work, Spirit's role in revealing/applying reconciliation.
 - Theological synthesis: integrates penal-expiatory language (propitiation, forgiveness, substitution) with covenantal and cosmic restoration emphases (Christus Victor, reconciliation, new creation).
 - Practical/ethical implications: atonement mandates peacemaking in church and society; sanctification is participation in realized eschatological shalom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed theologians (Calvinian corpus), Aulen and Moltmann on cosmic/eschatological themes, recent evangelical critics and proponents of penal substitution, and New Testament exegesis literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Atonement (multifaceted), Trinity (economic and immanent relations), Christology (mediatorial work), Pneumatology (Spirit as revealer/applier), Covenant theology, Soteriology (justification and sanctification), Eschatology (new creation), Ecclesiology and ethics (peacemaking).
 - Explicit attention to the **Role of the Holy Spirit in Revelation and Illumination** as essential to applying atonement and enabling the church's participation in shalom.
- **Closing line**
 - Cole centrally locates the atonement within Trinitarian peacemaking: Christ's reconciliatory work, revealed and applied by the Spirit, is the engine of covenantal shalom for individuals, communities, and creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Portrays atonement as inherently *peacemaking* rather than chiefly forensic or merely exemplary; gives equal weight to relational and cosmic dimensions alongside penal language.
 - Systematic insistence on the Spirit's revelatory and applicatory role: the Spirit not only seals justification but illumines the reconciling significance of Christ's work for communal and cosmic peace.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against models that isolate penal substitution from broader biblical motifs (e.g., Christus Victor, reconciliation, new creation).
 - Counters purely moral-exemplar readings by affirming substitutionary and propitiatory elements within a fuller covenantal-historical horizon.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "God the Peacemaker" as a shorthand theological rubric that centers atonement within Trinitarian peacemaking and ties doctrine to public ethics and eschatology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in Reformed-evangelical academic and pastoral circles as a corrective synthesis; useful for preaching, pastoral theology, and courses on atonement and pneumatology.
 - Stimulates interdisciplinary conversations between systematic theology, biblical studies, and peace theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, teachable framework linking atonement doctrine to ecclesial mission and societal reconciliation; valuable for integrating doctrine, exegesis, and ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement** - central redemptive work of Christ conceived as reconciliation/peace-making rather than only juridical accounting.
- **Shalom** - holistic peace: personal, social, structural, and cosmic; telos of atonement.
- **God the Peacemaker** - descriptive title foregrounding divine initiative in restoring relational peace.
- **Penal substitution** - affirmed but embedded within wider biblical motifs; not the sole lens.
- **Propitiation / Expiation** - maintained biblical categories for divine wrath/forgiveness, read covenantally.
- **Christus Victor** - integrated as the victory aspect of Christ's work that contributes to cosmic shalom.
- **Reconciliation** - relational restoration between God and creation; bridging forensic and restorative language.
- **Covenant** - primary narrative frame: atonement as covenantal restoration of God's people and promises.
- **New creation / Eschatological consummation** - shalom realized fully in final reconciliation of all things.
- **Trinity (economic emphasis)** - Father initiates, Son accomplishes, Spirit reveals/applies; all three persons involved in peacemaking.
- **Holy Spirit - Revelation & Illumination** - Spirit's role in disclosing Christ's atoning significance, applying forgiveness, enabling sanctification and peacemaking.
- **Union with Christ** - locus for participation in the benefits of the atonement and for ethical transformation.
- **Peace/Peacemaking (ethical correlate)** - practical outworking of atonement in church life and public witness.
- **Imago Dei** - human vocation implicated in restored relational harmony.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for atonement framed as shalom and Trinitarian peacemaking.
- As a **polemic resource** against reductionist or narrowly forensic accounts of atonement.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading key texts (Isaiah, Paul, Colossians) through a peace-restoration lens.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking systematic soteriology to pneumatology and ethics in teaching and pastoral formation.
