### TITLE
Accommodation and Incarnation: The Divine and Human in Scripture (essays and interviews) 
Peter Enns

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical context; part of ongoing debates over inerrancy, biblical authority, and modern science/criticism. Enns writes from an evangelical background wrestling with historical-critical methods, biological evolution, and ancient Near Eastern parallels.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture must be understood as both fully divine in purpose and profoundly human in form; the doctrine of revelation is best guarded by an **incarnational analogy**-God communicates through culturally conditioned language and thought (accommodation), not by divine dictation. This resolves tension between divine authority and the Bible's human contingency.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Starts with rejection of strict mechanical or verbal dictation models of inspiration.
 - Argues for a parallel: just as Christ is fully God and fully human, Scripture is a divine witness mediated through real human authors, genres, and ancient cultural assumptions.
 - Treats accommodation as both historical (God speaks within ancient frames) and epistemic (God concedes to human cognitive limits).
 - Applies the model to problematic texts: scientific descriptions, ethnocentric passages, and divergent theological emphases within the canon.
 - Recommends a hermeneutic of **canonical and Christocentric reading** that honors divine intention without denying human form and historical situatedness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Dialogue with classical inerrantist defenders (20th-century conservative evangelicalism), appeals to patristic and Reformation concept of accommodatio, affinities with Barthian relational models of Scripture, critique of literalist readings common in popular evangelicalism; draws on biblical studies, history of doctrine, and contemporary theological method.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration, authority of Scripture, hermeneutics, Christology (as analogy), epistemology of theology, sometimes implications for covenant and creation theology.
- **Closing line:** Enns advances an **incarnational-accommodation** model that preserves divine purpose and salvific authority while granting the Bible genuine human contingency-inviting epistemic humility without abandoning theological confidence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uses the incarnation explicitly as an interpretive analogy for Scripture, not merely as illustration.
 - Treats accommodation as normative and theologically constructive rather than merely a concession.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves beyond Warfield-style mechanical inspiration and the popular modern "inerrancy" protocols; contrasts with conservative polemics that equate divine authority with factual inerrancy in every ancient prescientific claim.
 - Differs from radical liberal skepticism by retaining robust theological authority and sacramental/soteriological centrality of Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Incarnational analogy" as systematic hermeneutical category applied to the doctrine of Scripture.
 - Reframing inerrancy debates by shifting focus from factual perfection to **functional authority**-what Scripture intends to accomplish in revelation and redemption.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Provoked controversy among conservative evangelicals; appreciated by many mainline and progressive evangelicals and some Reformed scholars seeking an orthodox but non-fundamentalist account.
 - Influential in conversations about science and faith, biblical criticism in pastoral contexts, and theological education for evangelicals wrestling with historical criticism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear, pastorally sensitive framework to teach the compatibility of historical-critical methods and doctrinal faith.
 - Serves as a bridge text for students moving from inerrantist premises to more nuanced accounts of revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation:** God's intentional condescension in revelation-speaking within human categories and limitations.
 - Contrast: divine dictation vs. accommodative communication.
- **Incarnational analogy:** The model that Scripture is to revelation what the Word becoming flesh is to Christ-fully divine in purpose, fully human in form.
- **Inspiration (reconfigured):** Not mechanical verbal control but God's guiding redemptive purpose enacted through human authorship.
- **Inerrancy (functional vs. factual):** Distinguishes between absolute factual inerrancy and a functional notion of authority sufficient for faith and life.
- **Human contingency of Scripture:** Emphasis that cultural, scientific, and literary limitations shape biblical expression.
- **Canonical hermeneutic:** Reading texts within the whole canon and Christocentric interpretive horizon.
- **Epistemic humility:** A theological posture that acknowledges limits to human knowledge about ancient authors' intents and cultural presuppositions.
- **Theological center of gravity:** The Bible's authority is located in its role as God's instrument for revelation and salvation, not in a forensic factual perfection.
- **Accommodative hermeneutics in practice:** Reading Genesis, prophetic cosmologies, and ethnically bound texts with sensitivity to ancient genres and purposes.
- **Christocentric reading:** Interpreting problematic or diverse texts through the life, teaching, and person of Christ as revelatory center.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for incarnational models of revelation and redefined inspiration in seminars and textbooks.
- As a **polemic** against strict inerrancy and dictation models in evangelical debates.
- As an **exegetical model** informing readings of Genesis, prophetic cosmology, and culturally conditioned texts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in integrating historical-critical scholarship with confessional theology and pastoral formation.
