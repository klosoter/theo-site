### TITLE
Philosophy of Religion (1970) - John Hick

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late-20th-century analytic theology and philosophy of religion; postwar British/Anglo-American discussion of the problem of evil, religious epistemology, and emerging religious pluralism. Hick's program synthesizes analytic rigor with pastoral and comparative concerns; the 1970 edition consolidates his arguments about theodicy already advanced in Evil and the God of Love (1966).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** theodicy and divine justice must be reframed from a retributive/privation account to an Irenaean, development-focused account: God permits suffering and evil as necessary conditions for moral and spiritual growth (the "soul-making" thesis) and ultimately rectifies remaining injustice eschatologically.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Rejects the classical Augustinian privation theory that makes evil a direct product of divine creation or simple privation, and rejects simple appeals to inscrutable divine reasons.
 - Adopts an **Irenaean framework**: humans created immature and placed in a world structured to foster moral development; freedom and real response require the possibility of suffering and moral failure.
 - Distinguishes **moral evil** (result of free agents) from **natural evil** (earthquakes, disease) and treats both as instruments within a providentially ordered "vale of soul-making."
 - Insists on **epistemic distance/Divine hiddenness** so that human responses to God are free and genuine; divine omnipotence is compatible with allowing such conditions.
 - Supplements present-world formation with **eschatological compensation**: ultimate divine justice is restorative and universal rather than narrowly retributive-God will secure final moral completion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Irenaeus (rehabilitated), Augustine (criticized), Hume and Leibniz (problem of evil frameworks), modern analytic theodical writers; engages pastoral concerns and comparative religion in stressing universal aims.
- **Doctrines treated:** providence, creation, human freedom, eschatology, divine hiddenness, the nature of divine justice (rehabilitative vs retributive).
- **Closing line:** Hick locates divine justice not in punitive retribution or metaphysical explanations of evil but in a providentially ordered process of soul-making culminating in eschatological restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Systematic promotion of the **Irenaean "soul-making" theodicy** as more theologically and existentially adequate than Augustinian privation or strictly deductive defenses.
 - Strong articulation of **epistemic distance** as morally necessary for authentic human response to God.
 - Readiness to make **eschatological universalism** (final restoration of all) the endpoint of divine justice.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Augustine/Leibniz style justifications that treat evil as metaphysical privation or as the necessary best of all possible worlds.
 - Opposes purely skeptical-theist moves that assert unknowable higher reasons without ethical or pastoral explanation; Hick seeks intelligible moral purpose in suffering.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recuperates and modernizes **"vale of soul-making"** language into analytic discourse; reframes "theodicy" as developmental rather than justificatory of divine goodness in purely metaphysical terms.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential in liberal, pastoral, and comparative theology; provoked sustained critique from conservative and determinist-leaning theologians who favor Augustinian accounts or penal/forensic frames of divine justice.
 - Catalyzed renewed scholarly interest in Irenaeus and in linking theodicy to soteriology and eschatology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies the moral rationale for permitting evil without lapsing into inscrutability; provides a teachable paradigm for pastoral conversations about suffering and divine justice.
 - Serves as a conceptual bridge between analytic philosophy of religion and constructive theological reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Irenaean theodicy:** God allows evil to enable human moral and spiritual growth; humans created immature to develop into moral likeness.
- **Soul-making / "vale of soul-making":** world seen as formative environment where virtues and genuine moral character can be produced.
- **Augustinian privation theory (contrast):** evil as lack/privation of good; Hick rejects its explanatory sufficiency.
- **Moral evil:** wrongdoing arising from free agents; explained as necessary risk of genuine freedom.
- **Natural evil:** non-agent-caused suffering (disease, disasters); treated as instrument for development and morally significant testing.
- **Epistemic distance / divine hiddenness:** deliberate concealment of God's presence to preserve authentic human freedom and response.
- **Eschatological compensation / universalism:** final restorative justice-God completes the moral education and ultimately reconciles.
- **Divine justice (rehabilitative vs retributive):** Hick privileges rehabilitative, formative justice over punitive, retributive paradigms.
- **Free will and moral responsibility:** genuine freedom is non-coerced and explanatory for moral evil within Hick's schema.
- **Theodicy vs. defence:** Hick offers an explanatory theodicy oriented to meaning and moral pedagogy, not merely a logical defense.
- **Greater-good reasoning (non-skeptical):** appeals to morally intelligible goods that justify the allowance of some evils.
- **Providence:** conceived as purposive ordering toward moral formation rather than micromanaging cosmic control.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for modern Irenaean/soul-making theodicy and for "epistemic distance" in philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic** against Augustinian/privational and strictly retributive accounts of divine justice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology and comparative religion, linking suffering, freedom, and eschatology in constructive reflection.
