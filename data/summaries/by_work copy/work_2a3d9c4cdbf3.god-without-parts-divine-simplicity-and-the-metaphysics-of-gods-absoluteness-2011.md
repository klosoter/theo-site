### TITLE
God without Parts: Divine Simplicity and the Metaphysics of God's Absoluteness (James E. Dolezal, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2011 amid renewed analytic-theological attention to classical theism; responds to late 20th-21st century objections to Divine Simplicity from philosophers of religion and systematic theologians.
 - Situated within a broadly Reformed/classical-theist milieu seeking to recover traditional attributes-language using contemporary metaphysical tools.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defends **Divine Simplicity (DS)** as the best account of God's metaphysical absoluteness: God is not composite; God's attributes are not distinct parts but identical with God's simple essence.
 - Aims to resolve tensions between DS and Christian commitments to **aseity, immutability, impassibility, relationality, and biblical predication** of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies metaphysical assumptions behind critiques of DS (composition, property-instantiation models).
 - Articulates a distinction between **absolute** and **relative** attributes to explain biblical language of divine properties without positing parts.
 - Absolute attributes: intrinsic, aspectual expressions of God's essence (identical to essence).
 - Relative attributes: ways God stands toward creatures (derivative, relational but not constitutive).
 - Shows how identity of attributes with essence preserves aseity and immutability while allowing genuine relationality and personal action.
 - Replies to major objections:
 - The charge that DS makes God impersonal or unintelligible.
 - The claim that simplicity is incompatible with divine relations and the Trinity.
 - Problems about truthmakers and predication (how statements about God are true if attributes are identical).
 - Concludes by tracing theological and biblical consonance: DS affirms God's absoluteness without denying scriptural anthropomorphic/relational language.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: patristic and medieval proponents of simplicity (e.g., Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas) as philosophical-theological antecedents.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: analytic philosophers of religion and systematic theologians who critique or revise DS (engages the analytic literature and contemporary doctrinal concerns).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (absolute vs. relative), **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, providence and action, analogy of predication, and implications for the Trinity and Christology.

- **Closing line**
 - Dolezal locates the theological center of gravity in a robust classical-theist defense: **God's absoluteness (aseity, simplicity) is metaphysically coherent and theologically necessary, and can be reconciled with biblical claims about God's personhood and relations.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic pairing of **simplicity** with a careful **absolute/relative attribute** distinction to safeguard both God's transcendence and relational activity.
 - Insists that identity of attributes with essence is the metaphysical route to preserve **aseity** and **immutability** without reducing God to an abstract property-bundle.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern property-instantiation readings that treat divine attributes as separable components; contrasts with revisionist theisms that soften simplicity to avoid metaphysical puzzles.
 - Pushes back against charges that DS entails divine impassibility or impersonalism by distinguishing ontological simplicity from experiential relationality.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes precise use of **absolute vs. relative attributes** as a hermeneutic and metaphysical tool for reading Scripture and theology together.
 - Emphasizes metaphysical identity (attributes = essence) as opposed to mere conceptual or linguistic reduction.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in Reformed/classical-theist circles as a rigorous contemporary defense of DS; influential in analytic theology debates about attributes.
 - Critics remain unconvinced on problems about mental states, temporality, and Trinity-relationality; book continues to spark sustained back-and-forth in journals and dissertations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students seeking an integrated metaphysical and theological case for DS; serves as a clear model for defending classical theism with analytic rigor while engaging biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity (DS)**: Thesis that God has no metaphysical composition; God's attributes are identical with God's essence.
- **Aseity**: God's self-existence; Dolezal links aseity to simplicity to show God is metaphysically independent.
- **Immutability**: God does not change; argued to follow from simplicity and essential identity of attributes.
- **Impassibility**: God does not suffer; treated so as to be compatible with genuine relational responsiveness (via relative attributes).
- **Absolute attributes**: Intrinsic aspects of God's essence expressed in predicates that are ontologically identical with that essence.
- **Relative attributes**: Predications describing God's relations to creatures (e.g., creator, redeemer); derivative and compatible with simplicity.
- **Analogy of predication**: The hermeneutical principle explaining how talk about God is both true and analogical to creaturely predicates.
- **Metaphysical composition / parts**: The notion DS rejects; Dolezal argues composition would compromise aseity and absoluteness.
- **Identity of essence and attributes**: Central metaphysical claim - attributes are not additional things but the essence itself in different conceptions.
- **Classical theism**: The theological framework Dolezal defends against modern revisions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a primary contemporary defense and definition source for **Divine Simplicity** and its relations to **aseity, immutability, impassibility**.
 - As a polemical and conceptual resource on **Absolute and Relative Attributes** - used to read Scripture and systematic loci without treating attributes as parts.
