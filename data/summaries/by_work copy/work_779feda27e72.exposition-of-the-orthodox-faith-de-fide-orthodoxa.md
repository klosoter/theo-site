### TITLE
**Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (De Fide Orthodoxa)** - John of Damascus (c. 675-749)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 7th / early 8th century Eastern Christian milieu under Islamic rule; John (a Syrian monk and former court official) composes a systematic summary of patristic theology in Greek as part of his larger Fountain of Knowledge. Written amid ongoing controversies about Christology (post-Chalcedon disputes) and shortly before Iconoclasm erupts; addresses Monophysite and Nestorian tendencies then current.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To present and defend the classical (Chalcedonian) articulation of Christian faith: the Trinity and the Incarnation - specifically, how the one divine Person of the Word (Logos) assumes a complete human nature without confusion or division, thereby upholding both full deity and full humanity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Prefatory material: categories and method; appeal to Greek theological vocabulary (ousia, hypostasis, physis, prosopon).
 - Exposition of God (Trinity): relation of Father, Son, Holy Spirit; consubstantiality and properties of persons.
 - Christology: explanation of the Incarnation - the Word takes to himself a rational human nature; exposition of how two natures coexist in one person.
 - Polemic and clarification: refutation of both Nestorian separation of persons and Monophysite mingling/absorption of natures; demonstration of scriptural and patristic support.
 - Pastoral/catechetical conclusions: implications for worship (e.g., Theotokos) and sacramental life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy use of the Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa), Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria, Dionysius the Areopagite; interacts with post-Chalcedonian opponents (Monophysites) and Nestorian formulations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Trinity, Christology (two natures, one person), anthropology (human nature assumed), soteriology implicit in incarnation, ecclesial and liturgical consequences (e.g., Theotokos).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The Exposition insists that in the one hypostasis of the Word the divine and human natures coexist **without confusion, without change, without division, without separation**, securing both full salvation in Christ and orthodox worship of God made visible.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Systematic synthesis of patristic resources:** John organizes scattered patristic teachings into a compact, philosophically disciplined schema usable for disputation and catechesis.
- **Precision in person/nature distinctions:** He clarifies and standardizes technical use of **physis** (nature) and **hypostasis/prosopon** (person/individual reality) to safeguard Chalcedonian teaching.
- **Balanced anti-Nestorian and anti-Monophysite polemic:** Avoids rhetorical extremes; emphasizes the unity of the person of the Word without division and the integrity of both natures without mixture.
- **Use of Hellenic philosophical categories for theology:** Employs metaphysical terminology (ousia, hypostasis) to translate biblical and patristic claims into coherent dogmatic propositions.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Eastern Orthodox: foundational; widely regarded as a clear manual of Chalcedonian faith and later used in doctrinal instruction.
 - Western/Reformed theology: cited as an authoritative patristic witness to Chalcedon and classical Christology, though not as central as Augustine in Western development.
 - Ecumenical significance: serves as a patristic bridge in dialogues about two natures; often cited in modern Christological conversations.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a compact, teachable formulation of Chalcedonian Christology that remains a primary resource for explicating how two natures are united in one person without logical collapse of either nature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Physis (nature):** the ontological principle or essence (divine nature, human nature); John insists on two complete naturae in Christ.
- **Hypostasis / Prosopon (person / subsistence):** the individual reality in which nature is instantiated; one hypostasis of the Word assumes a human nature.
 - John stabilizes hypostasis as the term for the personal subject in which the natures cohere.
- **Ousia (essence):** shared being (e.g., homoousios of the Son with the Father); used to ground consubstantiality.
- **Logos (the Word):** the pre-existent divine Person who becomes incarnate; the personal subject of the Incarnation.
- **Unconfusedly / Unchangeably / Indivisibly / Inseparably:** adverbial phrasing echoing Chalcedon; describes how natures coexist in Christ.
- **Two Natures Doctrine:** affirmation that Christ has both full divinity and full humanity, retained distinctly yet united in one person.
- **Communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties):** ascription of properties of each nature to the single person; John explains how divine and human predicates may be predicated of Christ.
- **Theotokos (God-bearer):** defended as the appropriate title for Mary because the person born is the divine Word made flesh.
- **Incarnation / Assumption:** the Word assumes a rational human nature - not by conversion of divinity into humanity but by personal union.
- **Anti-Nestorian / Anti-Monophysite formulations:** key polemical posture ensuring neither division nor mixture.
- **Patristic synthesis:** method of drawing authority from earlier Fathers to support doctrinal claims.
- **Metaphysical vocabulary in service of doctrine:** using Greek philosophical terms to articulate Christian mysteries.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for interpreting and teaching the Chalcedonian formula and two-natures doctrine.
- As a **polemic model** against Nestorian and Monophysite positions in historical and contemporary theology.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for attributing properties to Christ (communicatio idiomatum) and for catechetical instruction in Trinitarian and Christological loci.
