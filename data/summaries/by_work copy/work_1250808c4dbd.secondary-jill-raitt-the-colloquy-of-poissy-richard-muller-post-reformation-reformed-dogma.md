### TITLE
Theodore Beza - Law/Gospel Distinction (with secondary framing from Jill Raitt, The Colloquy of Poissy; Richard A. Muller, Post‑Reformation Reformed Dogmatics)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid‑ to late‑16th century Reformed theology; Beza (1519-1605) as Calvin's successor in Geneva. Polemical context: controversies with Roman Catholics (e.g., Colloquy of Poissy) and intra‑Reformed debates over justification, works, and covenant language. Muller's modern reconstruction situates Beza within post‑Reformation dogmatic consolidation; Raitt highlights polemical settings (Poissy) where law/gospel contrasts were deployed.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Beza insists on a sharp functional distinction: the Law convicts and prescribes obedience but cannot justify; the Gospel alone declares and imputes Christ's righteousness for sinners. The doctrinal problem is maintaining God's righteousness and human culpability while vindicating sola fide against Catholic works‑based soteriology.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation of the Law's revelatory and condemning role: the Law shows God's will and human sin (no soteriological efficacy).
 - Defense of forensic justification by imputation: Christ's passive and active obedience are imputed to believers; the Gospel pronounces righteousness.
 - Distinction applied to pastoral and covenantal ordering: law as rule of life (sanctification), gospel as instrument of justification; careful delimitation of their spheres to avoid moralism or antinomianism.
 - Polemic against Catholic synergy: rejects merit‑based justification and ecclesial mediation that collapses gospel into law.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** John Calvin (continuity and clarification), Catholic theologians at Poissy and in Trent, Protestant antagonists debating assurance and sanctification. Muller's studies show Beza's sources include scholastic categories (forensic language) adapted to Reformed covenantal thought.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (forensic imputation), Christology (active/passive obedience), covenant (works/grace motifs), law (moral/ceremonial/civil distinctions), sanctification, soteriological antithesis between merit and gift.
- **Closing line:** Beza's theological center of gravity is a rigorous forensic Gospel that secures justification by imputed Christ‑righteousness while preserving the Law's normative and convicting role without conferring soteriological efficacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stronger forensic language than some predecessors: clearer legal categories of imputation and declaration.
 - Emphasis on Christ's active obedience as well as passive suffering for full imputation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Tightens Calvin's occasionally ambiguous formulations on imputation and obedience, making the Law/Gospel antithesis more juridical against Catholic synergism.
 - Against Catholic attempts (visible at Poissy) to fuse law and gospel into a cooperative righteousness, Beza insists on exclusive declarative function of the Gospel.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic application of scholastic‑forensic terms to Reformed soteriology while resisting Roman teleology of merit.
 - Clarifies the tripartite use of the law (civil/moral/ceremonial) in pastoral and doctrinal distinctions.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in later Reformed scholasticism; provided a template for post‑Reformation dogmatists (traced by Muller) emphasizing covenantal‑forensic synthesis.
 - Became a touchstone in Protestant polemics against Trent and in defining Reformed boundaries.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model for teaching distinction of law and gospel without antinomian collapse.
 - Useful resource for explicating imputation, Christ's obedience, and covenantal ordering in systematic theology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law (Lex):** Reveals God's will, convicts sin, prescribes obedience; lacks power to justify.
 - Sub‑term: **Moral law** - perennial rule for sanctification and civil order.
 - Sub‑term: **Ceremonial/civil law** - culturally situated, distinct from moral law.
- **Gospel (Evangelium):** Proclamation of Christ's work; declarative instrument of justification and comfort.
- **Imputation (Adscriptio):** Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to the believer; central to Beza's justification.
- **Forensic justification:** God's declarative act pronouncing sinner righteous on account of Christ.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's positive fulfilling of law; necessary for full imputation of righteousness.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death for expiation of sin; grounds reconciliation.
- **Covenant language:** Beza uses covenants to structure law/gospel economy (works/grace motifs) without endorsing merit.
- **Antithesis (Law vs Gospel):** Functional separation to protect sola fide and maintain moral order.
- **Merit vs Gift:** Rejection of merits intrinsic to human works; salvation described as gratuitous gift.
- **Sanctification:** Fruitful response to Gospel; governed by law as rule but rooted in grace.
- **Declaration vs Infusion:** Distinguishes Protestant declarative justification from Catholic infusion of righteousness.
- **Polemical context (Poissy):** Practical locus where Beza's law/gospel rhetoric is sharpened against Catholic conciliatory moves.
- **Reformed scholastic adaptation:** Use of scholastic categories to systematize Reformed soteriology (Muller's diagnosis).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for imputation and the law/gospel antithesis in Reformed dogmatics.
 - As a **polemic model** against Roman Catholic synergism and Trent formulations (historical theology/polemics).
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for distinguishing law's convicting role from gospel's justificatory proclamation in preaching and catechesis.
