### TITLE
**Tertullian - entry in Theological Dictionary of the Early Church (secondary)** 
Focus: Tertullian's anthropology and his defense of **creationism** of the soul against **traducianism** (site usage: 1 reference; topic: Traducianism vs Creationism).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 3rd century Carthage; Latin apologetic and polemical milieu; Tertullian (c.160-c.230) moving from orthodox apologist to Montanist controversialist.
 - Work surveyed in a modern theological dictionary as a secondary treatment, summarizing Tertullian's arguments and reception in patristic and medieval theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Tertullian insists each human soul is **immediately created by God** (creationism), denying that soul or its spiritual qualities are generated by parental seed (traducianism).
 - The debate addresses how human nature and guilt (original sin) are transmitted and how to preserve the soul's immaterial character.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Exegetical move: appeals to Genesis (God "breathes" life into Adam) and texts that construe the soul as originating from God rather than from human generation.
 - Ontological move: argues soul is immaterial, simple, and not producible by corruptible matter (semen cannot create a spiritual principle).
 - Theological move: emphasizes divine sovereignty and creative will - God alone can be the cause of spiritual substances.
 - Practical/polemical move: uses juridical and moral language to protect personal responsibility and divine agency in salvation and judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture (Genesis, Pauline anthropology implicitly); earlier apologists and contemporary Latin theology; later interlocutors include Jerome and, indirectly, Augustine (whose development of traducianism becomes a major countercurrent).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (soul vs. body), creation (creatio animarum), original sin (peccatum originale) and its transmission, divine agency, and implicit issues for Christology and soteriology (how sin and redemption relate to human nature).
- **Closing line**
 - Tertullian's thesis: the human soul is a direct divine creation; this locates human spiritual origin exclusively in God and thus frames ensuing Western controversies over the transmission of sin and personhood.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong insistence on **immediate divine causation** for spiritual realities; uses vivid Latin juridical idioms to make theological points accessible and polemically forceful.
 - Clear separation between biological generation of the body and divine generation/creation of the soul.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Contrasts with later Augustine (who favored traducianism to explain the transmission of original sin) and with any view that treats the soul as derivable from corporeal seed.
 - Pushes back on naturalistic or semi-materialist accounts of human origin by refusing to let procreation exhaust anthropological explanation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Consolidates the Latin vocabulary for "creatio animarum" and sharp distinctions between generatio (generation) and creatio (creation) in anthropological discourse.
 - Frames the debate in custodial/legal-theological terms (God as ultimate author/producer of spiritual life).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influenced later Latin theologians (e.g., Jerome and some medieval authors) who affirmed creationist positions.
 - Provided a stable pro-creationism pole that medieval scholastics (notably some Thomists) engaged; the West remained divided, and Reformation-era and post-Reformation theologians continued to oscillate between creationism and traducianism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, forceful model of how Scripture, ontology, and pastoral concerns converge in doctrinal formation.
 - Serves as a representative early Latin articulation in debates over human nature, moral responsibility, and the metaphysics of the soul.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creatio animarum (creation of souls)** - each soul is immediately created by God; central Tertullian claim.
- **Traducianism (traductio / generation by parents)** - the opposing thesis that souls are propagated via parental seed; Tertullian argues against this.
 - Contrast: traducianism explains hereditary sin by transmission; creationism preserves divine agency but raises questions about inherited guilt.
- **Generatio vs. Creatio** - technical distinction: bodily generation vs. divine creation of spiritual substance.
- **Anima (soul)** - immaterial, subsistent principle; cannot be product of corruptible matter.
- **Spiritus / mens** - related faculties often distinguished from anima in patristic Latin usage; used to nuance psychological and spiritual capacities.
- **Peccatum originale (original sin)** - key doctrinal problem motivating the debate about transmission of guilt and corruption.
- **Divine agency / auctoritas** - emphasis on God as sole author of spiritual life; undergirds Tertullian's theological anthropology.
- **Infusion / immediate creation** - mechanism proposed for how souls come into existence (direct divine act rather than parental conveyance).
- **Corporeal propagation** - the explanation conceded for the body; Tertullian separates this from soul-origin.
- **Juridical idioms** - legal language used to argue responsibility, authorship, and accountability (e.g., God as "creator" vs. parents as "procreators").

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for creationism in histories of doctrine and anthologies of patristic anthropology.
- As a **polemic exemplar** when opposing traducianism or naturalistic accounts of the soul.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how early Latin theologians read Genesis and Pauline anthropology to ground metaphysical claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of original sin, personhood, and divine agency in medieval, Reformation, and contemporary theological debates.
