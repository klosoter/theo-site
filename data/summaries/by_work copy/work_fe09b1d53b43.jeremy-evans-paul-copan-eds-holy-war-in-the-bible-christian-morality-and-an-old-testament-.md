### TITLE
Jeremy Evans & Paul Copan (eds.), Holy War in the Bible: Christian Morality and an Old Testament Problem - chapter by Heath A. Thomas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical and academic debate (post-9/11 and ongoing) about the moral status of Old Testament "holy war" narratives and divine command ethics.
 - Situated in a multi-author volume seeking to defend, explain, or critique the moral intelligibility of divine violence in Scripture for modern Christians.
 - Engages both scholarly exegesis and systematic-ethical apologetics within broadly Protestant (especially evangelical/Reformed) milieux.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Thomas addresses the tension between Old Testament accounts of divinely sanctioned war (conquest narratives, herem) and the Christian moral claim that God is perfectly good and the gospel ethic is nonviolent in many respects.
 - His working thesis: the moral problem posed by holy war texts requires a careful canonical-theological reading that distinguishes divine prerogative, historical-covenantal context, and normative moral instruction for ordinary Christian life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical groundwork: genre, ancient Near Eastern context, and linguistic markers (e.g., herem, divine imperatives) are analyzed to show particularity of the texts.
 - Covenantal-historical framing: Thomas stresses that many violent commands are tied to specific covenant purposes (judgment, preservation of election) rather than universal prescriptions for Christian behavior.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Distinguishes **God's unique right** to exercise judgment from human rights to use lethal force.
 - Emphasizes **progressive revelation** and the Christ-event as a hermeneutical lens that reinterprets earlier violence typologically/eschatologically.
 - Ethical implications: outlines limits on direct application - calls for caution, recognition of divine sovereignty, and doctrinal resources (just war vocabulary, noncombatant immunity, vocation-based ethics) when Christians engage state violence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary critics of OT violence (e.g., pacifist readings, ethical objections), and conversely defenders who appeal to divine command theory.
 - Dialogues with biblical scholars and theologians across spectrum: interpreters of conquest narratives, Reformed ethicists, and evangelical apologists (implicitly or explicitly against extreme literalists and militant theologies).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics (canonical reading, progressive revelation)
 - Covenant theology (particularity of Israel's vocation)
 - Divine sovereignty and holiness (divine prerogative in judgment)
 - Christology and ethics (Christ as final lens for interpreting OT violence)
 - Moral theology (divine command, just war elements, noncombatant protection)

- **Closing line**
 - Thomas locates the theological center of gravity in a **Christocentric, covenantal reading** that preserves divine holiness and justice while restraining simplistic transfer of ancient holy war commands into universal Christian moral norms.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on canonical and covenantal contexts as decisive for moral assessment of violence passages.
 - Careful partitioning between **what God does as God** and **what God commands humans to do**, with ethical consequences drawn from that partition.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both caricatures: rejects sacramentalized violence (using OT to justify modern aggression) and wholesale dismissal of OT moral complexity by critics who treat narratives as immoral without theological framing.
 - Clarifies that progressive revelation does not simply negate earlier texts but recasts them under Christ's fulfillment.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Emphasizes terms like **divine prerogative** and **covenantal particularity** as analytic tools to mediate between exegetical data and ethical application.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative/Reformed teaching as a measured, scholarly corrective to both evangelical militarism and anti-OT critique.
 - Used in pastoral and academic settings to equip sermons, ethics classes, and apologetic responses regarding biblical violence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches durable hermeneutical methods: genre-sensitivity, covenantal theology, and Christ-centered canonical reading that remain useful across debates on biblical ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy war** - descriptive label for ancient Israelite wars framed as divinely sanctioned; Thomas stresses careful contextualization.
- **Herem (the ban)** - treated as a genre-specific, theologically loaded command tied to judgment and contamination concerns.
- **Divine prerogative** - God's unique authority to execute judgment; central to distinguishing divine act from human imitation.
- **Covenantal particularity** - the notion that many violent commands are bound to Israel's covenant role and not universal moral norms.
- **Progressive revelation** - interpretive principle that later revelation (culminating in Christ) recasts earlier texts.
- **Typology / Christocentric hermeneutic** - reading conquest and judgment as foreshadowing eschatological realities fulfilled in Christ.
- **Divine command ethics** - invoked but qualified: Thomas resists simplistic applications and argues for nuanced moral reasoning.
- **Just war vocabulary** - used as a boundary language when considering legitimate human use of force (authority, just cause, right intention).
- **Noncombatant immunity** - moral constraint emphasized for contemporary application.
- **Canonical reading** - reading texts within the whole Scripture's narrative and theological trajectory.
- **Eschatological fulfillment** - the idea that Christ's victory reframes OT violence toward ultimate consummation, not ongoing prescription.
- **Genre sensitivity** - attention to narrative, law, prophecy as distinct interpretive categories.
- **Moral imagination** - role of the church in cultivating ethical responses that honor both divine holiness and human dignity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for framing what "holy war" means theologically within OT studies.
- As a **polemic resource** against both anti-OT critics and uncritical appropriation of conquest texts for modern violence.
- As an **exegetical-model** in preaching and classroom discussion emphasizing canonical, covenantal, and Christological reading strategies.
