### TITLE
Synopsis Purioris Theologiae (contributor: Petrus van Mastricht)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 17th-century Reformed scholastic milieu; the Synopsis functioned as a concise, systematic textbook synthesizing Puritan/Reformed dogmatics for universities and provincial synods. Mastricht wrote as a representative orthodox scholastic, engaging both Calvinist tradition and contemporary controversies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To set the doctrine of salvation within a coherently federal (covenantal) framework: the eternal pactum salutis (covenant of redemption) among the Trinity secures Christ's appointment as federal head and the imputation of his obedience and satisfaction to the elect.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Grounding: God's eternal decree and intra-Trinitarian counsel provide the basis for covenantal agreements.
 - Pactum salutis: an eternal agreement between Father and Son by which the Son undertakes a mediatorial work for a definite people.
 - Christ as federal head: Christ's person and offices (prophet, priest, king) function in virtue of a covenantal representation; his active and passive obedience are imputed to believers.
 - Application: union with Christ effects justification, new-creation sanctification, and final glorification for the elect according to the covenant promises.
 - Polemic moves: argues against prevenient-universalist readings and any loosening of particular redemption or definitive headship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (especially Pauline and covenantal texts), classical Reformed writers (Calvinite corpus), contemporaries in Dutch scholasticism; explicit polemics aim at **Amyrautian** (hypothetical universalism) tendencies and Arminian objections to particular redemption.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (pactum salutis, covenant of works and grace), Christology (federal headship, hypostatic union applied to representational office), soteriology (election, atonement, imputation, justification), divine decree and Trinitarian relations.
- **Closing line:** The Synopsis, following Mastricht's contribution, centers Reformed dogmatics on an **eternal, intra‑Trinitarian covenant** that establishes Christ as the appointed federal head whose obedience and satisfaction secure salvation for the elect.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Emphasizes the *pactum salutis* as an ontologically real, eternal convention within the Trinity rather than merely a logical order of decrees.
 - Treats Christ's headship as both ontic (personally constituted in the hypostatic union) and legal (representative covenant party) - ensuring a tight union of Christology and federal representation.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on **Amyrautian hypothetical universalism** by defending particular redemption anchored in an eternal intra‑Trinitarian pact.
 - Corrects more juridical-only models of representation by insisting on the personal and mediatorial identity of Christ (not a mere moral exemplar).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Robust pairing of **pactum salutis** language with classical scholastic categories (causa, promissio, pactio) to bridge covenant‑theory and legal-scholastic reasoning.
 - Clarifies distinctions between *covenant as pact* (intra‑Trinitarian agreement) and *covenant as administration* (economic covenant with creatures).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - The Synopsis (with Mastrichtian coloring) became a standard reference in Reformed seminaries; influenced later Reformed scholasticism and conservative covenantalists.
 - Used by subsequent orthodox and confessional parties to rebut Amyraldian and Arminian revisions; later Pietist and revival contexts selectively appropriated its experiential applications.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact, systematic exemplar of classical federal theology tying Trinitarian doctrine to practical soteriology; valuable for students tracing how covenantal concepts are disciplined by scholastic precision.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum salutis (covenant of redemption):** Eternal agreement between Father and Son for the salvation of the elect; foundational for Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Covenant of works:** Pre-fall covenant with Adam; serves as contrast to the covenant of grace in exposition of law and obligation.
- **Covenant of grace:** God's promissory arrangement with the elect, mediated by Christ, applied in time.
- **Federal headship (Christ as head):** Christ represents elect as their covenant party; his obedience and suffering are imputed to believers.
- **Active and passive obedience:** Christ's fulfilling of law (active) and suffering death (passive) both required and imputed for justification.
- **Imputation:** Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness and sinners' guilt across the federal relation.
- **Election and decree:** Divine eternal choice ordered to the pactum salutis and effectuated in Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Hypostatic union:** Christ's personal union undergirds his fitness to be federal head - both divine and human obedience efficacious.
- **Particular redemption:** The doctrine that Christ's atonement is efficacious and definite for the elect, defended against universalist formulations.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity:** Distinguishes God's external covenantal actions with creation (economic) from intra‑Trinitarian agreements (immanent pact).
- **Satisfaction theory (reformed form):** Atonement understood as Christ's satisfaction of God's justice within the covenantal order.
- **Representative solidarity:** Not merely legal fiction but real covenantal solidarity between Christ and his people.
- **Pactio vs. promissio:** Technical nuance: pact as bilateral agreement within the Godhead; promissio as unilateral divine promise to creatures.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for pactum salutis and federal headship in dogmatic summaries.
- As a **polemic reference** against Amyraldian and Arminian revisions of atonement and election.
- As an **exegetical-model** for readings of Pauline covenant texts (Romans, Galatians) linking Christology and imputation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching how Trinitarian doctrine grounds Reformed soteriology and sacramental theology.
