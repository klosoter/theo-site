### TITLE
The Vocation of Anglicanism - Paul Avis

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Anglican theological renewal; post-ecumenical era grappling with identity after Vatican II and broad Anglican pluralism. Written within Anglican studies and practical ecclesiology, responding to pressures of secularization, internal diversity, and ecumenical opportunity.
- **Central thesis:** Anglicanism is best understood not as a mere compromise between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism but as a distinct *vocation* - a corporate calling to live out an ordered, sacramental, historically grounded catholicity shaped by reception, liturgy, and episcopal order.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary confusion about Anglican identity results from caricatures (either Romanizing or purely Protestant) and loss of ordered ecclesial imagination.
 - Retrieval: recovers resources in doctrine, liturgy, and ministry - especially Hookerian and via media traditions reinterpreted as lived ecclesial calling.
 - Constructive proposal: defines Anglican identity through practices (common prayer, episcopacy, sacramental life), patterns of authority (reception and consensus), and vocation (mission in public and ecumenical contexts).
 - Practical implications: implications for ministry, ecumenism, formation, and public theology - Anglicanism as bridge and witness, not mere middle ground.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Richard Hooker, the English Reformers, 19th-century Anglicanism (including the Oxford Movement), contemporary Anglican theologians; engages Roman Catholic and Protestant critics; dialogues with ecumenical documents and Anglican formularies.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (central), sacramentology (Eucharist, baptism), ministry and ordination (episcopacy), authority (Scripture, tradition, reason; concept of reception), ecclesial identity and unity, public theology and mission.
- **Closing line:** Anglicanism is a corporate vocation to embody ordered catholicity - expressed in liturgical worship, sacramental life, and episcopal ordering - serving as a distinctive Christian witness and ecumenical resource.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Frames Anglican identity primarily as *vocation* (a calling to embodied ecclesial practice) rather than merely doctrinal position or institutional label.
 - Stresses **reception** as normative for doctrinal authority - living consensus in the church as decisive over abstract formularies.
 - Advances the notion of **ordered catholicity**: catholic in continuity and sacramental life, ordered in episcopal structure and communal discernment.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects simplistic "via media" readings that reduce Anglicanism to compromise; instead presents it as constructive vocation.
 - Opposes both papal centralism and congregational individualism - argues neither captures Anglican communal ordering or sacramental imagination.
 - Rereads Hooker and the Reformers not as apologetic intermediaries but as formative theologians of ecclesial practice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Elevates *vocation* and *reception* as key analytic categories for ecclesiology.
 - Articulates *normative plurality* - a structured diversity held within communion and ordered governance.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Anglican theological education and ecclesiological reflection; influential in ecumenical conversations as a constructive account of Anglican distinctiveness.
 - Received positively where Anglican identity is contested; critiqued by those who press for sharper doctrinal definitions or stronger confessional stances.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a practicable model linking worship, ministry, and identity.
 - Serves as a bridge between historical theology and contemporary ecclesial praxis; durable resource for teaching ecclesiology, formation, and ecumenical engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Vocation of Anglicanism:** Anglicanism as corporate calling to particular ecclesial practices and witness.
- **Ordered catholicity:** Catholic continuity expressed through ordered structures (esp. episcopacy) and sacramental life.
- **Reception:** The process by which doctrine and practice become authoritative through communal acceptance and use.
 - Contrasts with top-down magisterial authority or purely individual assent.
- **Via media:** Reinterpreted as a vocation-shaped modus vivendi, not simple compromise.
- **Ecclesial identity:** Identity grounded in liturgical practice, sacrament, ministry, and historical continuity.
- **Episcopacy / episcopal order:** Seen as servant ordered ministry necessary for catholicity and communal discernment.
- **Sacramental principle:** The Eucharist and baptism as constitutive loci of Anglican identity and unity.
- **Normative plurality:** Structured diversity tolerated within communion and disciplined by common worship and order.
- **Authority (Scripture, tradition, reason):** Triadic framework reframed by reception and communal judgment.
- **Common Prayer / liturgy:** Liturgy as primary locus where identity is enacted and transmitted.
- **Public theology / mission:** Anglican calling to public witness, cultural engagement, and ecumenical hospitality.
- **Communion:** Real relational bond; unity maintained through shared worship, episcopal order, and mutual recognition.
- **Ministry (ordained and lay):** Ministry conceived corporately - ordered ministries enable communal vocation and mission.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary Anglican identity in theology courses and denominational statements.
- As a **polemic** against reductive portrayals (both Romanizing and congregationalist) in ecclesiological debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading formularies and historical sources through the lens of reception and practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical dialogues, helping articulate a distinctively Anglican contribution to unity.
