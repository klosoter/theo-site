### TITLE
**The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context** - Robert Letham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting and publication context**
 - The Assembly (1643-1652) met amid the English Civil War, within mature Reformed orthodoxy after Dort.
 - Letham writes as a contemporary Reformed theologian-historian, retrieving the Assembly as a catholic, patristically informed project rather than a narrow proof-text manual.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Westminster standards must be read within their historical, patristic, scholastic, and polemical contexts. They articulate a richly Trinitarian, Christocentric, covenantal theology that is Augustinian in anthropology and soteriology, and ecclesially ordered.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Re-situates Westminster in the stream of Christian tradition (Scripture-Fathers-medieval-Reformation-orthodoxy).
 - Tracks loci across the Confession and Catechisms: God and attributes; Trinity and eternal generation; Christology; covenant theology; sin and imputation; union with Christ by the Spirit; church and sacraments; worship and Sabbath; assurance and perseverance.
 - Highlights internal diversity and consensus-forming dynamics among Presbyterians, Independents, and Erastians; shows how exegesis, patristic retrieval, and scholastic method converged.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Assembly divines: Twisse, Tuckney, Gillespie, Rutherford, Goodwin, Burroughs.
 - Sources: Scripture; Augustine; Athanasius and the Cappadocians; Calvin, Bucer; medievals (Aquinas) as mediated by Reformed scholastics (Polanus, Ames, Turretin).
 - Interlocutors/opponents: Roman Catholic scholasticism, Socinianism, Arminianism, Antinomianism; English Erastianism; separatist congregationalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theology proper:** simplicity, aseity, eternal generation; absolute and relative attributes; inseparable operations.
 - **Christology:** eternal Sonship, incarnation, two natures and one person; covenant mediation.
 - **Anthropology and sin:** Adamic headship, original sin, total inability; Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials rejected.
 - **Soteriology:** union with Christ by the Spirit through faith; imputation of Christ's righteousness; effectual calling; assurance not of faith's essence.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments:** visible/invisible church distinction; ministry and discipline; baptism (including infants); Lord's Supper as spiritual feeding on Christ.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity is a Triune, Christ-centered, Spirit-applied salvation, covenantally administered in the church, undergirded by Augustinian anthropology and classical theism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong retrieval of the Fathers: eternal generation and consubstantial Sonship are non-negotiable and shape Christology and worship.
 - Union with Christ as the integrating soteriological category; the Spirit is the bond of union and the personal agent of application.
 - Confessional catholicity: Westminster as deeply traditional yet contextually sharpened by 17th-century controversies.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on caricatures of Westminster as merely rationalist or biblicist; shows a robust classical theism and patristic grammar.
 - Nuances the claim that ordo salutis eclipses union; demonstrates textual space for union-first logic alongside benefit-ordering.
 - Clarifies that Westminster is Augustinian over against Pelagian/semi-Pelagian and Arminian tendencies; compatibilist freedom affirmed.
 - Distinguishes eternal Sonship from the temporal economy: the incarnate obedience is not read back as an eternal subordination in the immanent Trinity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-reads absolute/relative attributes within divine simplicity and inseparable operations.
 - Tightens federal theology by placing imputation within Christological and pneumatological union rather than a bare legalism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Positions the Standards as a normative, ecumenically conversant Reformed confession; informs Presbyterian, Reformed Baptist, and global Reformed retrievals.
 - Shapes contemporary debates on Trinity, Christology, assurance, and sacramental practice by recovering original intentions.
- **Enduring value**
 - A reliable guide for reading Westminster holistically: doctrinal synthesis, historical sensitivity, and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute and relative attributes**
 - Absolute name what God is in himself; relative express relations (e.g., paternity, filiation). Under simplicity, these are not parts of God.
- **Divine simplicity and aseity**
 - God is not composite and depends on no other; anchors immutability and faithfulness in covenant.
- **Inseparable operations**
 - The external works of the Trinity are undivided; economically ordered without implying ontological subordination.
- **Eternal generation and Sonship**
 - The Son is eternally begotten, consubstantial with the Father; guards against Arianism and modern EFS claims.
- **Incarnation**
 - The eternal Son assumes a true human nature in time; one person, two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Covenant of works and covenant of grace**
 - Adam as federal head under a probationary arrangement; Christ as second Adam securing life for the elect.
- **Original sin**
 - Guilt and corruption from Adam to his posterity; total inability apart from grace.
- **Imputation**
 - Adam's guilt reckoned to all; Christ's righteousness reckoned to believers; framed within union with Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The Spirit unites believers to the risen Christ; fountain of justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance.
- **Effectual calling**
 - The Spirit's sovereign summons creates faith, overcoming inability without violating creaturely will.
- **Free will and compatibilism**
 - Post-Fall will is not morally free toward God; Westminster affirms liberty of spontaneity under sovereign decree.
- **Visible and invisible church**
 - Visible: professing believers and children under Word, sacraments, discipline; invisible: the elect united to Christ across time.
- **Sacraments as means of grace**
 - Baptism and the Supper instrumentally communicate Christ by the Spirit to faith; no ex opere operato.
- **Assurance**
 - Not of faith's essence; ordinarily attainable by promises, evidences of grace, and Spirit's testimony.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a historical-theological control for interpreting Westminster on Trinity, Christology, sin, and soteriology.
 - As a definition source for confessional terms across loci, especially union with Christ and imputation.
 - As a polemical and retrieval resource against Pelagianism, Socinianism, and modern trinitarian missteps.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking classical theism with covenantal and ecclesial practice.
