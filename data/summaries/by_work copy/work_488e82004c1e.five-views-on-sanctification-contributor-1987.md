### TITLE
**Anthony A. Hoekema, Reformed Sanctification in Five Views on Sanctification (1987)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late-1980s evangelical dialogue testing sanctification claims across traditions (Reformed, Wesleyan, Keswick, Pentecostal, Dispensational). Charismatic renewal and debates over perfectionism and second blessing form the milieu.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Sanctification is **both definitive and progressive** in union with Christ. It is a Spirit-wrought, churchly, covenantal work grounded in justification, expressed in faith and repentance, producing necessary but non-meritorious good works, and secured by perseverance.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Defines sanctification as consecration to God in Christ: a once-for-all transfer of lordship (definitive) and a lifelong growth in holiness (progressive).
 - Exegetes key texts (Rom 6; 1 Cor 1:2; Heb 10:10; Gal 5; Phil 2:12-13) to show a decisive break with sin alongside ongoing mortification and vivification.
 - Frames sanctification within **union with Christ** and the **means of grace** (Word, sacraments, prayer) in the covenant community.
 - Clarifies the law's **third use**, good works, reward without merit, and the inseparable yet non-identical relation of justification and sanctification.
 - Addresses **faith and repentance** as ongoing graces; ties **assurance and perseverance** to God's preserving action and evidences of renewal.
 - Engages **spiritual gifts** as edifying but not measures of holiness; rejects second-blessing crises as normative.
 - Anthropological and hamartiological clarifications: rejects **trichotomy**, affirms **original sin and imputation**, insists sanctification presupposes fallenness.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Scripture; Calvin, Westminster Standards, Bavinck, Berkhof; John Murray on definitive sanctification; interlocutors include Wesleyan (Dieter), Keswick (McQuilkin), Pentecostal (Horton), Dispensational (Walvoord).
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (sanctification, justification, faith/repentance, perseverance), Pneumatology (Spirit's indwelling and gifts), Anthropology and Creation (image, dichotomy), Sin (original sin, indwelling sin), Theology Proper and Eschatology (divine initiative; already/not yet), Covenant of grace.
- **Center of gravity:** Life in Christ by the Spirit, through Word and sacrament, under the covenant of grace, moving from definitive holiness to progressive conformity until glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** 
 - **Definitive sanctification** as a discrete biblical category alongside progress.
 - **Union with Christ** as the fountainhead; sanctification as participation, not self-improvement.
 - **Churchly means** of grace; holiness is communal and sacramental, not merely crisis-experiential.
 - **Third use of the law** guiding grateful obedience; **good works necessary** as fruit, not merit.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Rejects **Wesleyan perfectionism** (entire sanctification) and **Keswick crisis-passivity**; denies **Pentecostal second blessing** as normative for holiness.
 - Disputes **Dispensational two-tier** Christian schemas and any antinomian reduction of obedience.
 - Maintains forensic-then-transformative order over Roman Catholic conflation.
- **Conceptual contributions:**
 - Consolidates **definitive vs progressive** framework; sharp distinction of **merit vs reward**; integrates **already/not yet** into sanctification.
 - Anthropological **dichotomy** used to resist spiritualized compartmentalization.
- **Reception / influence:**
 - A standard Reformed primer in sanctification debates; frequently assigned in seminary courses as the Reformed representative.
 - Cited in discussions on gifts-holiness relations and on assurance-perseverance pedagogy.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exegetically anchored clarity; pastoral traction for preaching holiness without perfectionism; coherent across loci (covenant, law/gospel, ecclesiology).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification: definitive and progressive**: Once-for-all break with sin in Christ (Rom 6) and ongoing growth by the Spirit.
- **Union with Christ**: The redemptive context that grounds both justification and sanctification; participation frames holiness.
- **Faith and repentance**: Continual graces by which believers appropriate Christ and turn from sin; repentance is lifelong.
- **Good works and merit (covenant of grace)**: Works are necessary fruits and evidences, lacking condign merit; God graciously rewards.
- **Means of grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer as principal instruments of the Spirit for growth in holiness.
- **Mortification and vivification**: Spirit-empowered putting sin to death and walking in newness of life.
- **Original sin and imputation**: Adamic guilt and corruption necessitate sanctification; justification's imputation preserves grace-alone.
- **Assurance and perseverance**: Assurance grounded in Christ's work and the Spirit's testimony; saints persevere because God preserves.
- **Spiritual gifts and sanctification**: Gifts serve edification; neither evidence of a second blessing nor a holiness metric; love is the more excellent way.
- **Law's third use**: The moral law as guide for grateful obedience, distinct from justification yet integral to sanctification.
- **Already/not yet**: Real holiness now with eschatological completion at glorification.
- **Dichotomy vs trichotomy**: Human person as body-soul (or body-spirit) unity; avoids sanctification schemes that partition the self.
- **If Adam had not sinned**: Growth in righteousness would not be sanctification; sanctification presupposes sin and redemption under the covenant of grace.
- **Spirit baptism**: Identified with incorporation into Christ, not a post-conversion crisis; sanctification flows from this incorporation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for decisive and progressive sanctification tied to union with Christ.
 - As a **polemic foil** against perfectionism, crisis sanctification, and second-blessing models.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Rom 6, Phil 2:12-13, Gal 5 on holiness.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting covenant, law/gospel, ecclesiology, and the Spirit's ordinary means.
