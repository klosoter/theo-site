### TITLE
**Lex, Rex (1644) - Samuel Rutherford**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1644 amid the English Civil War and Scottish Covenanter ascendancy; written from a Scottish Presbyterian, covenantal standpoint and circulated against royalist and Filmerian arguments for absolute monarchy.
 - Part of broader 17th-century debates on sovereignty, resistance, and the relation of magistracy to divine law.

- **Central thesis**
 - **The law (lex) rules the king (rex).** Civil government is subordinate to God's law and to covenanted obligations; kings are not absolute, and lawful resistance or removal of tyrants is permitted within covenantal and legal bounds.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Negative polemic: refutes Robert Filmer's Patriarcha and emergent royalist theories that locate sovereignty in the king by divine right.
 - Positive construct: develops a covenantal-contract theory of kingship in which magistrates hold delegated authority under divine and popular covenant.
 - Establishes that magistrates swear oaths and govern under God's law, not above it.
 - Argues Romans 13 and related texts do not imply absolute, unchecked power; their obedience is conditioned by the magistrate's upholding of justice and God's ordinances.
 - Affirms a right, and in some cases a duty, of subordinate magistrates and people to resist usurpation and tyranny.
 - Applies ecclesiastical principles to civil order: insists on the mutuality of covenants and the continuity between church discipline and public accountability.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Direct antagonists: Robert Filmer (Patriarcha), royalist apologists for divine-right monarchy, and some interpreters of New Testament passages on authority (e.g., Hobbesian materialists implicitly).
 - Sources: Scripture (extensive), patristic and medieval precedents cited to show limitations on power, Scottish Covenanter documents, Reformed confessional and juridical traditions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant theology** (use of covenantal categories to ground political obligations; connects to broader debates including the Covenant of Redemption insofar as divine covenants undergird human covenanting).
 - Ecclesiology and discipline (presbyterian structures, offices, and the obligation of church and state to uphold covenantal order) - see Church Government: Presbyterian Polity, Offices, Discipline.
 - Authority and magistracy; law, oath, and resistance; biblical hermeneutics on governing texts (e.g., Romans 13).

- **Closing line**
 - Lex, Rex locates political authority within a covenantal legal framework: magistrates rule as ministers of the law and covenant, and sovereignty is limited by divine ordinance and communal obligation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places the king squarely under divine law and covenant rather than above it; fuses biblical covenant theology with constitutional/legal argumentation.
 - Treats political oaths as theological and juridical instruments binding rulers to God and people.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to Filmerian patriarchalism and later absolutist rhetoric; differs from Hobbes by insisting on moral/teleological limits to sovereignty rather than an absolute sovereign to prevent disorder.
 - Contrasts with Anglican high-church royalism by subordinating civil authority to covenantal accountability and churchly discipline.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Uses covenantal-contract language to ground constitutionalism and resistance theory prior to Lockean social-contract formulations.
 - Integrates ecclesiastical sanctions and presbyterian disciplinary categories into political theology - a distinctive Scottish-Reformed synthesis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Banned in England; influential among Covenanters and later British and North American Whig thinkers. Provided theological vocabulary for constrained government and justified popular or magisterial resistance in Reformed circles.
 - Enduring influence on Presbyterian political self-understanding and on later constitutional and republican thought.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for studying the intersection of covenant theology and political theory; a primary-source exemplar of Reformed resistance theory and of how ecclesiology shapes political doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lex, Rex** - motto: the law governs the king; shorthand for rule-of-law over absolutism.
- **Covenant** - political and ecclesial covenants bind rulers and subjects; authority is delegated within covenantal terms.
 - Relation to **Covenant Of Redemption**: Rutherford's theology presupposes a robust covenantal economy; while Lex, Rex addresses civil covenanting, it sits within his larger covenantal framework that includes redemptive covenants.
- **Magistracy** - office of civil government as a divine ordinance but delegated and limited by law and covenant.
- **Oath / coronation oath** - a binding juridical-theological instrument that fixes royal duties and supplies grounds for accountability.
- **Resistance / deposition** - lawful resistance, including removal of tyrants, when magistrates violate covenant and law.
- **Presbyterian polity** - ecclesial structure informing civil expectations; church discipline models public accountability (see Church Government: Presbyterian Polity, Offices, Discipline).
- **Discipline** - ecclesiastical censures and ordered correction linked to civil justice; Rutherford fuses church discipline with civic enforcement.
- **Divine law** - normative standard superior to civil enactments; magistrates must administer according to it.
- **Natural law** - used alongside Scripture to constrain rulers and justify resistance.
- **Contractual kingship** - king's authority conceived as delegated under a contract-like covenant.
- **Patriarcha (Filmer)** - chief foil; term used to denote Filmer's patriarchal absolutism which Rutherford dismantles.
- **Romans 13 exegesis** - reinterprets as conditional obedience, not a warrant for absolutism.
- **Delegated authority** - power entrusted to rulers, reversible where covenant breached.
- **Common good** - standard by which magistrates are judged; failure legitimizes corrective action.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition source: articulates a covenantal constitutionalism tying oaths, law, and public office to Reformed doctrine.
 - As polemic: primary Reformed rebuttal to divine-right monarchy and Filmerian claims.
 - As ecclesiological-political model: cited in discussions of Presbyterian polity, the role of discipline, and the mutual accountability of church and state.
