### TITLE
**The Oxford Disputation on the Eucharist (1549) - Peter Martyr Vermigli**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-Tudor England (1549) amid the English Reformation; Vermigli as Italian Reformer resident in Oxford by invitation of Thomas Cranmer.
 - Disputation occurs in a milieu debating Eucharistic presence after the 1549 Book of Common Prayer; draws on patristic, scholastic and Protestant sources.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To define how Christ is truly present in the Lord's Supper and to prescribe proper fencing and admission: rejecting Roman transubstantiation and mere memorialism while insisting on a real, spiritual presence apprehended by faith.
 - (See topics: **Lords Supper Presence Of Christ Fencing And Admission**.)
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture is primary criterion: interpretive exegesis of John 6, 1 Corinthians 11, and sacramental texts.
 - Patristic retrieval (notably Augustine) to rebut both Roman corporeal presence and Zwinglian bare memorialism.
 - Philosophical clarification: distinguishes sign from thing signified; argues presence is by the Spirit to the believer, not by local/physical ubiquity of Christ's human nature.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial move: theological conclusion grounds discipline - the Lord's table must be fenced and ministers must examine communicants.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine, later scholastics, contemporary Catholics (implicit targets: scholastic transubstantiation), and Protestant interlocutors (Zwinglians and Lutherans by implication).
 - English reformers (e.g., Cranmer) as collaborators in applying these conclusions to church order.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (union of natures and implications for presence), Pneumatology (Spirit as instrumental to sacramental benefit), Sacramentology (sign/seal, real spiritual presence), Ecclesiology (authority of ministers, fencing of Table), Covenant theology (sacramental participation as covenantal sign).
 - Also touches speculative theology on original righteousness and hypothetical obedience (see topic: **What If Adam Had Not Sinned**).
- **Closing line**
 - Vermigli centers Eucharistic theology on the believer's union with Christ effected by the Spirit: a real, non-corporeal presence that requires faith and ecclesial discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear insistence on **real spiritual presence**: not a mere memorial, not a physical local presence of Christ's human nature, but an effectual presence given by the Spirit to faith.
 - Integration of sacramental theology with pastoral fencing: theological truth immediately drives admission practice.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrections to Romanism: repudiates transubstantiation and corporeal ubiquity of Christ.
 - Corrections to radical memorialism: argues Zwingli's account fails to do justice to promises and union with Christ.
 - Sits nearer to Calvinian formulation while preserving distinct emphases from Lutheran sacramental union.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the Spirit as the instrumental agent of sacramental benefit and frames Christ's presence in relational-union language rather than metaphysical presence alone.
 - Uses covenantal categories to tie baptism and Eucharist to admission and efficacy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant influence on English Reformed sacramental practice and on later Reformed theology; contributed to the theological shape of Anglican sacramental rubrics and the broader Reformed consensus about spiritual presence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models close exegetical-scholastic engagement with pastoral consequences; valuable for teaching sacramental theology, ecclesial discipline, and covenantal readings of the rites.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper** - sacrament instituted by Christ; focal liturgical act analyzed for presence and admission.
- **Real spiritual presence** - Christ is truly present by the operation of the Holy Spirit to the believer, distinct from physical presence.
- **Fencing the Table** - ecclesial practice of restricting communion to properly examined, repentant persons; defended theologically as necessary.
- **Admission / Examination** - ministerial responsibility to examine communicants; authority derives from Scripture and covenantal stewardship.
- **Sign and thing signified** - classic sacramental distinction preserved: bread/wine signify and seal Christ's benefits without undergoing ontological change.
- **Union with Christ** - central soteriological category used to explain how believers receive Christ in the sacrament.
- **Pneumatological instrumentality** - the Spirit is the means by which the sacrament conveys Christ's benefits to faith.
- **Infant baptism / covenantal baptism** - defended as consistent with covenant and promise; opposes radical believer-only models (see topic: **Baptism Mode Infant vs Believers Efficacy**).
 - Sub-contrast: baptism as sign/seal, not automatic regeneration (rejected ex opere operato).
- **Hypothetical Adam** - engagement with the theological question of Adam's possible obedience or state had he not sinned (see topic: **What If Adam Had Not Sinned**); used to clarify original righteousness and divine promises.
- **Transubstantiation** - rejected as metaphysical explanation incompatible with Scripture and patristic nuance.
- **Memorialism** - rejected as theologically insufficient.
- **Ministerial authority** - tied to ecclesiology and sacramental administration.
- **Covenant** - interpretive frame linking baptism and Eucharist to covenant signs and communal membership.
- **Ex opere operato** - implicitly rejected; Vermigli stresses faith and Spirit for sacramental efficacy.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for **Reformed Eucharistic theology** (real spiritual presence; Spirit-instrumental model).
- As polemic material against both Roman sacramental metaphysics and bare memorialism.
- As an exegetical model tying biblical exegesis to sacramental and pastoral practice.
- As a conceptual pivot connecting **sacramentology, ecclesial discipline, baptismal theology,** and speculative anthropology (e.g., hypothetical Adam).
