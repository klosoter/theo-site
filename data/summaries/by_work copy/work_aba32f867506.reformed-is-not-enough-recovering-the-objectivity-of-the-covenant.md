### TITLE
Reformed Is Not Enough: Recovering the Objectivity of the Covenant - Douglas Wilson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid late-20th / early-21st century debates in conservative Reformed circles seeking recovery of patristic and covenantal emphases.
 - Emerged alongside the cluster of discussions and controversies labelled the **Federal Vision** movement; interacts with broader concerns about nominalism, pietism, and privatized faith in North American Presbyterian and Reformed contexts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Main claim: contemporary Reformed theology has undercut the *objectivity* of the covenant by over-individualizing salvation; a recover y of covenant objectivity (corporate standing, real sacramental benefits) is necessary for biblical, ecclesial faithfulness.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern Reformed piety often reduces covenant to subjective promises and individual conversion; sacraments and corporate status become merely symbolic.
 - Recovery: present covenant as a real, objective corporate relationship established by God, marked and mediated by sign and seal (esp. baptism).
 - Implications: baptism, church membership, and corporate union with Christ convey real status and obligations; assurance and justification must be understood within this objective covenantal framework.
 - Method: biblical exegesis of covenant texts, historical retrieval (Reformation and patristic witnesses), polemical engagement with contemporary Reformed formulations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical interlocutors: Calvin, the Westminster tradition, Kuyper and Bavinck are both appealed to and critiqued.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: other Federal Vision proponents and critics; book functions partly as internal corrective within Reformed circles.
 - Opponents addressed implicitly: those who emphasize forensic imputation as primary at the expense of sacramental covenantal realities.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (unity and objectivity), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church), sacraments (baptismal efficacy), justification (relation to covenant status), union with Christ, election and perseverance.
- **Closing line**
 - The book's theological center: insistence that covenant is an objective, corporate reality mediated through the church and its sacraments - a corrective to privatized Reformed piety and a pivot toward ecclesial, covenantal ontology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, sustained insistence on the *objectivity* of covenantal membership (not merely a promise to believers but a real status conveyed in community).
 - Emphasizes baptism as more than sign/seal rhetoric - a real participation in covenant standing.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges strains of Reformed theology that elevate forensic imputation and individual faith to the exclusion of covenantal corporate realities.
 - Contrasts with an individualistic reading of assurance and membership; seeks to re-anchor assurance in covenantal signs and communal life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Moves the language of covenantal "objectivity" into sharper prominence within contemporary Reformed discussion.
 - Reorients traditional "sign and seal" language toward a more robust talk of participatory status.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provocative: helped catalyze sharper debate around the Federal Vision, especially on monocovenantal readings and the doctrine of justification.
 - Received with enthusiasm by some ecclesiologically-minded pastors and with suspicion or rejection by many confessional Reformed theologians who feared erosions of sola fide and imputation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a corrective reminder of the church's corporate ontology and the ecclesial shape of salvation; valuable for courses on covenant theology, sacramental theology, and contemporary Reformed controversies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant objectivity**
 - Covenant conceived as an objective, real status established by God, not merely a promise applied subjectively.
- **Visible church / Invisible church**
 - Emphasizes the formative and normative role of the visible, covenant-marked community.
- **Baptism: sign, seal, means**
 - Argued as instrumentally efficacious for covenantal standing (distinct from sacramentalism that implies automatic salvation).
- **Union with Christ**
 - Treated corporately: believers participate in Christ as members of the covenant body.
- **Imputation (status vs. forensic only)**
 - Reframed within covenantal participation; forensic language remains but is not the only category.
- **Monocovenantalism**
 - Affinity with views stressing a single covenant of grace across redemptive history (see: Federal Vision Monocovenantalism).
- **Justification by faith**
 - Engages the classic Reformation doctrine while arguing for its being understood within covenantal, ecclesial parameters (see: Federal Vision And Justification By Faith).
- **Sacramental efficacy**
 - Emphasizes real effectivity of sacraments in mediating covenant status.
- **Covenantal promise vs. personal faith**
 - Stresses promise-embedded corporate promise as determinative for membership and expectation.
- **Corporate election**
 - Election considered in corporate-covenantal terms, not merely atomized individualism.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in covenantal signs and communal evidences as well as personal faith.
- **Covenant administration**
 - Distinguishes between covenant substance and its varied historical administrations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against overly individualistic Reformed piety and privatized assurance.
 - As an **exegetical and ecclesiological model** for rereading covenant texts and sacramental practice within a corporate framework.
 - As a **reference point** in Federal Vision debates, especially on monocovenantal readings and the relationship between covenantal status and justification by faith.
