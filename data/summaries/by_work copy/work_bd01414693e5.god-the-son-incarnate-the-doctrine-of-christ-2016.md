### TITLE
**God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ (Stephen Wellum, 2016)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical context (Crossway/2016); part of a renewed interest in classical Christology within conservative Protestant seminaries.
 - Responds to modern trends (kenotic models, some revisionist readings of Philippians 2, and imprecise usage of Chalcedonian categories) while integrating systematic, biblical, and historical theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate a robust, classical Christology: the eternal Son is fully God and truly man in one person without loss or confusion of natures; the incarnation does not imply the relinquishment of divine attributes (antikenotic posture).
 - To show how this Christology coheres with covenantal mediation and redemptive history.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: sustained exegesis of key New Testament Christological passages (John, Philippians 2, Hebrews, synoptics) to establish personal identity and the frame of the incarnation.
 - Historical-theological narrative: tracing patristic, Chalcedonian, medieval, and Reformation formulations to defend orthodox categories (hypostatic union, dyophysitism, dyothelitism).
 - Systematic correlation: describes the person-nature relation (real distinction without separation), communicatio idiomatum, and implications for mediation, atonement, and soteriology.
 - Polemical engagement: critiques kenotic theories and contemporary departures from Chalcedonian clarity; interfaces with covenant theology debates about Christ's role as covenant head.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic and conciliar authorities (Athanasius, Chalcedon, Cyril, Gregory of Nazianzus), Reformers, and modern theologians across conservative and critical streams.
 - Direct interlocution with contemporary kenotic proponents and with thinkers in covenant theology streams (including critical interaction with Klinean emphases where they touch Christ's mediatorial action and covenant intrusion ethics).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), revelation, soteriology/atonement, covenant (Christ as covenant head), ecclesiology and pastoral implications.

- **Closing line**
 - A disciplined, Chalcedonian defense of the eternal Son's full deity and genuine humanity, arguing the incarnation preserves divine attributes while effecting true human solidarity and covenantal mediation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the eternal Son's personal identity and continuity of divine attributes in the incarnation; clear antikenotic commitment.
 - Integrates covenantal frames: Christology is articulated not merely metaphysically but as intrinsic to covenant mediation and historical redemption.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern kenotic readings that portray the incarnation as a relinquishing of divine attributes or essential deity.
 - Contrasts with some pietistic or functional Christologies that prioritize moral example or adoption narratives over ontological union.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced presentation of the person-nature relation emphasizing both the real distinction of natures and the uncompromised unity of the person, framed with contemporary philosophical clarity without abandoning classic language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a recent, accessible treatment of biblical and systematic Christology.
 - Cited in debates on kenosis and in treatments of Christ's mediatorial role in covenant theology; influences evangelical curricula and pastoral formation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a balanced bridge between rigorous exegesis, patristic fidelity, and contemporary systematic concerns; serves both as a corrective to heterodox trends and as a teaching resource for pastors and advanced students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - The personal union of two distinct natures (divine and human) in the one person of the Son; central explanatory category.
- **Chalcedonian formula** - The authoritative dyophysite standard: two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Eternal Son** - Emphasizes personal, eternal generation and continuity of identity across incarnation.
- **Incarnation** - The act by which the eternal Son assumes human nature; treated as becoming truly human while retaining divine attributes.
- **Kenosis** - Theories proposing the Son emptied himself of divine attributes; Wellum mounts a sustained critique of reductionist kenotic models.
 - Relation: uses Philippians 2 exegetically to deny that "emptying" implies loss of deity.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - The communication of properties between divine and human natures in the one person; employed to explain how predicates like "suffered" and "is Lord" attach to Christ.
- **Dyothelitism (two wills)** - Affirmation that Christ possesses both a divine and a human will; crucial for orthodox soteriology and freedom.
- **Mediatorial office / Covenant headship** - Christ's role as covenant representative and head; links Christology to covenant ethics and redemptive history.
- **Intrusion ethics (Klinean)** - Kline's notion of prophetic intrusion and covenantal ethics; Wellum engages aspects where Kline's covenant dynamics affect understandings of Christ's mediatorial action.
 - Relation: used to clarify how Christ's incarnation functions as covenantal intrusion into human plight without compromising divine identity.
- **Person-nature relation** - Contemporary philosophical clarifications of classical categories; stresses real distinction without separation.
- **Atonement and substitution** - Treated as contingent on the person who suffers (the God-man), not merely on functional or representative roles.
- **Scriptural locus method** - Model integrating exegesis, history, and systematics; used throughout the work.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary **definition source** for conservative, Chalcedonian Christology in courses and syllabi.
- As a **polemic/exegetical model** against kenotic theories and loose uses of Philippians 2.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in covenant theology discussions linking Christ's person to his mediatorial covenant headship and ethical implications.
