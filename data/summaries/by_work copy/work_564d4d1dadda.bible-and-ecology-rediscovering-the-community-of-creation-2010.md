### TITLE
Bible and Ecology: Rediscovering the Community of Creation (Richard Bauckham, 2010)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2010 amid rising interest in Christian ecological ethics, post-Lynn White debates, and renewed evangelical engagement with creation care.
 - Theological milieu: evangelical, canonical New Testament scholarship interacting with systematic and ecological theology; constructive response to dualistic or escapist eschatologies.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible presents creation as a sustained, relational community whose destiny is not annihilation but participation in God's renewed world; Christian theology must therefore recover a biblically grounded ecological vision that unites Christology, eschatology, and ethics.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful reading of biblical texts (especially prophetic, Pauline, and Johannine literature) to show continuity between God's creational purposes and final renewal.
 - Theological synthesis: argues for ontology of "community of creation" - creatures as relational subjects within God's covenantal purpose, not mere resources.
 - Ethical implication: stewardship and worship follow from the intrinsic value and covenantal status of nonhuman creation.
 - Moves:
 - Diagnosis: modern theology and culture have fragmented human/creation relations (e.g., dualism, utilitarian dominion).
 - Retrieval: biblical motifs (God as Creator-Redeemer, groaning creation, cosmic Christ) reframe creation's status.
 - Application: ecclesial and ethical practices to re-form Christian engagement with environment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical canon broadly; dialogues with modern figures: Lynn White (critique of Christianity and ecology), Jürgen Moltmann (eschatology of hope), and contemporary eco-theologians.
 - Uses canonical and systematic lenses rather than primarily scientific ecology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, eschatology (including New Heavens and New Earth), Christology (cosmic scope), covenant, providence, and implicit Trinitarian relationality.
 - Ethics flows from theological anthropology and ontology of creatures.
- **Site usages for this entry**
 - **New Heavens And New Earth** - Bauckham insists on continuity: the renewal is renovative rather than replacement; the New Heavens and New Earth include re-created, transformed creation rather than mere spiritualized human destiny.
 - **Realized vs Future Eschatology** - Bauckham emphasizes both dimensions: present participations (e.g., "already" in Christ) do not erase genuine future consummation; creation's redemption is inaugurated now but awaiting fullness.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: Scripture demands a robust, incarnational ecological theology in which creation is a covenantal community destined for redeemed participation in God's eschatological renewal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Community language:** treats nonhuman creatures as members of a relational, covenantal community, not passive objects.
 - **Canonical Christo-centrism:** ties ecological hope directly to the person and work of Christ - cosmic Christ as agent of creation's restoration.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges both secular critiques (Lynn White's indictment) and theological escapisms that locate salvation solely in an otherworldly afterlife.
 - Corrects strands of environmental theology that either romanticize nature or reduce scriptural ethics to human-centered stewardship only.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasting dominion as **service and stewardship** within community language; reframing eschatology as **transformative continuity** rather than ontological replacement.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical circles as a careful, biblically rooted corrective to indifferent or anti-creation tendencies; influential across Reformed and broader Anglican/Evangelical theology for ecological ethics and theological anthropology.
 - Adopted by seminaries and churches seeking an orthodox groundwork for creation care.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful exemplar of exegetical-theological integration; durable framework for teaching, preaching, and policy formation on Christian environmental responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Community of Creation** - creatures as relational members under God's covenant; central heuristic for ethics.
- **Continuity of Creation** - the New Heavens and New Earth are transformed continuity, not annihilation.
- **Cosmic Christ** - Christ's lordship extends over redeemed creation; agent of renewal.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology** - the kingdom is present in Christ but awaits consummation; undergirds Bauckham's "already/not-yet" balance.
 - Related: **Realized vs Future Eschatology** - both are affirmed: present participation does not obviate future consummation.
- **Covenantal Ontology** - creation's status is defined by God's covenantal relation, not mere utility.
- **Dominion-as-Service** - reinterprets Genesis dominion as responsible stewardship within the created community.
- **Groaning Creation** - biblical motif (Romans 8) read as corporate, physical longing for renewal, not merely symbolic.
- **Eschatological Renewal** - renewal is transformative and bodily; grounds environmental hope and obligation.
- **Theocentric Stewardship** - stewardship rooted in worship and covenantal fidelity to God.
- **Anti-dualism** - rejection of sharp spirit/matter split that devalues the material world.
- **Canonical Reading** - method: reading Scripture as a unified narrative that shapes doctrine and practice.
- **Practical Ecclesiology** - church practices (worship, liturgy, polity) as formative for creation care.
- **Ethical Implication** - environmental ethics flows from ontology and eschatology, not pragmatic secular arguments.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar for reading Scripture to derive ecological doctrine.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: supplies the "community of creation" vocabulary for theological ethics and policy formation.
 - As a **polemic resource**: counters both secular critiques and theological escapisms on the fate and value of creation.
