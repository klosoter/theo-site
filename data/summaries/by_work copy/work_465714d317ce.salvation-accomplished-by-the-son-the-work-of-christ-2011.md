### TITLE
Salvation Accomplished by the Son: The Work of Christ (2011) - Robert A. Peterson 
(Selected notes focused with attention to the topic of **Adoption**)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2011 within contemporary Reformed systematic theology; part of renewed interest in articulating the Son's distinctive role in Trinitarian soteriology.
 - Responds to tendencies that diffuse Christ's work across the Trinity or domesticate the Son's work into generic "divine action"; situated against both liberal reductions and some popular evangelical oversimplifications.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Son's unique work - his person, obedience, suffering, and exaltation - is the decisive center of salvation. All benefits (including adoption) flow from the Son's representative and vicarious work within the covenantal order of God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: The person of the Son - eternal generation, incarnation, union of natures; grounds for representation.
 - Part II: The Son's active and passive obedience - covenantal headship and penal substitution as the basis for justification and relational reconciliation.
 - Part III: The offices and teleology of the Son - prophet, priest, king; accomplishment and application of salvation (including adoption, sanctification, glorification).
 - Part IV: The Son in the economy of salvation - how Father, Son, and Spirit relate in accomplishing and applying redemption without collapsing distinctions.
- **Major moves**
 - Reaffirmation of federal representation: Christ as covenant head whose obedience/penal suffering is imputed to believers.
 - Integration of Christus Victor, satisfaction/penal substitution, and the active obedience motif under the primacy of the Son.
 - Application: justification (forensic), adoption (relational), sanctification (transformative) - all grounded in union with Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primarily draws on classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Owen) and contemporary Reformed theologians; engages modern critics who relativize substitutionary models (some forms of the New Perspective and liberation readings), and popular evangelical emphases on "relationship" apart from covenantal and forensic categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology, Trinity (economic and immanent relations), atonement theories (penal substitution, satisfaction), covenant theology, justification, adoption, sanctification, eschatology, the threefold office.
- **Closing line**
 - The book locates the axis of salvation squarely in the Son: in his person, obedience, suffering, and exaltation the divine plan of making believers both legally righteous and relationally sons is accomplished.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic foregrounding of the Son (not merely "the work of God" generically) as the personal ground of every soteriological benefit; clear insistence that adoption is a fruit of the Son's representative work.
 - Tight integration of forensic and relational dimensions: justification and adoption are distinct but inseparable consequences of Christ's work.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects trends that either privatize adoption as purely experiential or that secularize the atonement into ethical exemplarism. Challenges approaches that detach adoption from the Son's substitutionary work.
 - Pushes back against theological moves that diffuse soteriological credit to the Father or Spirit in ways that undermine the Son's representative role.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Articulates a clear functional taxonomy: accomplishment (what the Son did) vs application (how benefits are received), with adoption placed as immediate application rooted in forensic ground of justification.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in conservative Reformed circles as a succinct, orthodox restatement of Christocentric soteriology; used in seminary courses on Christology and soteriology.
 - Cited in debates about the relation of justification and adoption, and in defenses of penal substitution within covenantal frameworks.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for reclaiming a historic Reformed balance: robust Christology that secures both legal standing and covenantal sonship; useful for pastors teaching the riches of union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Son (the Son of God)** - personal center of the economy of salvation; eternal and incarnate subject of accomplishment.
- **Accomplishment vs Application** - distinction between what Christ achieved (active/passive obedience, satisfaction) and how believers receive benefits (union, imputation, adoption).
- **Active obedience** - Christ's perfect law-keeping credited to believers as part of their righteousness.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering and death as penal substitution, satisfying divine justice.
- **Representation / federal headship** - Christ acts as the covenantal representative of his people; his acts count legally and relationally for them.
- **Penal substitution** - primary account of atonement in the work of the Son; grounds for justification and reconciliation.
- **Justification** - forensic declaration of righteousness grounded in the Son's obedience and suffering.
- **Adoption** - relational reception into the Father's family; a direct application of salvation tied to the Son's representative work and believers' union with him.
 - Emphasized as both present status and future inheritance; distinct from but inseparable to justification.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological and relational bond that mediates every benefit (imputation, adoption, sanctification).
- **Threefold office (prophet, priest, king)** - roles by which the Son accomplishes and orders salvation; priestly work central for atonement and adoption.
- **Exaltation** - Christ's resurrection and enthronement as consummating act that secures application (Spirit sent, adoption sealed).
- **Covenant theology** - interpretive framework: Son as covenant head, covenant of redemption and grace operative.
- **Imputation** - forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness and the transfer of believers' sins to Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Christ-centered soteriology (clarifying active/passive obedience and representation).
- As a **polemic** resource defending penal substitution and the Son's primacy against reductionist or diffusive accounts.
- As an **exegetical-model** for linking Pauline themes (union, imputation, adoption) in systematic theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses treating the intersection of Christology and practical pastoral categories like adoption.
