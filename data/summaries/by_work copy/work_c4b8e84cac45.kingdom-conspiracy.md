### TITLE
Kingdom Conspiracy - Scot McKnight

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/missional moment: reaction to consumer-driven, programmatic church models and to purely individualistic pieties.
 - Situated at the intersection of New Testament scholarship (renewed interest in Jesus' kingdom sayings, inaugurated eschatology) and practical theology of the local church.
 - Engages a broad evangelical readership-pastors, church planters, and informed laity-seeking a biblically rooted, missional reorientation.

- **Central thesis**
 - The heart of Christian faith is the announcement and enactment of the **kingdom of God**; the local church exists to be a conspiratorial, countercultural community that embodies and advances Jesus' kingdom mission rather than merely perpetuating consumer-driven programs or privatized spirituality.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: contemporary churches have often reduced the Gospel to individual conversion and church success metrics, losing sight of the kingdom as social, ethical and communal reality.
 - Biblical retrieval: Jesus' ministry and the New Testament present the kingdom as both present and coming-an inaugurated eschatology requiring communal discipleship, repentance, and justice-oriented practice.
 - Ecclesial prescription: the local church should reorder priorities around kingdom practices-worship that forms disciples, communal life that resists consumerism, mission that witnesses to Jesus' lordship in word and deed.
 - Practical outworking: offers theological rationale and pastoral guidance for reorienting preaching, worship, small groups, outreach, and social engagement around the kingdom motif.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws heavily on canonical Gospels and Pauline corpus for exegetical support.
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with contemporary missional theologians (e.g., Lesslie Newbigin, N. T. Wright), and critiques forms of American evangelical church practice (seeker-sensitive models, church-growth pragmatism).
 - Converses with ethical theologians and communal ecclesiologies (past and present) without aligning to a single confessional tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: Jesus as king whose person and work inaugurate the kingdom.
 - **Eschatology**: inaugurated/now-and-not-yet kingdom framework.
 - **Ecclesiology**: local church as primary agent of kingdom conspiracy.
 - **Soteriology**: salvation framed more corporately and participatory (entrance into kingdom life) than purely forensic.
 - **Ethics and social theology**: kingdom practices implicate social, economic, and political life.
 - **Revelation and Scripture**: Scripture as normative for understanding kingdom mission.

- **Closing line**
 - Kingdom Conspiracy calls the church to abandon privatized, programmatic religion and to become a disciplined, communal witness to the present and coming reign of King Jesus.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames the church's mission as a deliberate, countercultural "conspiracy"-positive, communal resistance to dominant cultural values.
 - Prioritizes **kingdom language** as the hermeneutical key for preaching, worship, and mission rather than focusing primarily on individual assurance or institutional maintenance.
 - Stresses practices (worship, communal life, discipleship) as formative, not merely instrumental.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects what McKnight sees as the reductionism of seeker-sensitive and growth-oriented models that measure success by attendance and program metrics.
 - Contrasts with privatized evangelical piety by insisting on the public, social, and ethical implications of kingdom proclamation.
 - Offers a corrective to both triumphalistic Christendom and privatizing pietism by emphasizing humble, incarnational witness.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims "conspiracy" as constructive theological rhetoric: a disciplined collective fidelity to Jesus' mission that undermines prevailing cultural assumptions.
 - Reinforces "kingdom gospel" over a narrowed "personal salvation" gospel without denying individual conversion.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical missional networks and pastoral formation contexts as a corrective to consumer church practices.
 - Respected by New Testament-informed pastors and scholars; critiqued by some who worry about underplaying doctrines like justification or ecclesial tradition.
 - Influential in conversations about ecclesial practices, community formation, and the ethics of mission.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a practical-theological bridge between New Testament scholarship and parish ministry.
 - Durable resource for rethinking ecclesiology around mission and discipleship rather than maintenance and market-driven models.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God/Kingdom of Heaven**
 - Central theological lens: both present (in Jesus' ministry and the church's witness) and future consummation.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - "Now-and-not-yet" framework shaping mission and ethics.
- **Missio Dei**
 - God's mission that the church participates in; church is not mission-owner but mission-agent.
- **Local church**
 - Primary locus for kingdom enactment; not an optional instrument but the conspiratorial community.
- **Discipleship**
 - Formation into kingdom life through practices and communal accountability.
- **Conspiracy**
 - Positive rhetorical term for collective, disciplined fidelity to Jesus' countercultural mission.
- **Kingdom gospel**
 - Gospel framed as kingship and reign, not only individual justification.
- **Practice-theology**
 - Theology grounded in communal habits: worship, hospitality, justice, proclamation.
- **Witness/testimony**
 - Both verbal proclamation and concrete ethical action as evidences of the kingdom.
- **Community / ekklesia**
 - Church as visible, socially formative body embodying kingdom values.
- **Ethics / social implications**
 - Kingdom entails justice, mercy, and public engagement; not merely private morality.
- **Presence and mission**
 - The church's presence in society is constitutive of its mission, not secondary.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a kingdom-centered ecclesiology in pastoral training.
 - As a **polemic** against seeker-sensitive and program-driven church models.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Jesus' kingdom sayings into congregational practice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for reorienting preaching, worship, and mission around communal formation.
