### TITLE
He That Is Spiritual (1918) - Lewis Sperry Chafer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1918 amid the rise of early-20th-century American evangelical movements: dispensational premillennialism institutionalized at Dallas Theological Seminary, concurrent responses to Keswick holiness teaching and emergent Pentecostalism.
 - Written for pastors and lay leaders shaping a practical, doctrinally conservative spirituality within the new dispensational academy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Chafer argues that true Christian spirituality is the Spirit-produced, progressive outworking of the believer's positional standing in Christ; it is definable, observable, and governed by biblical truth rather than emotional experience or mystical attainment.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of what it means to be "spiritual" in New Testament usage (contrast with "carnal").
 - The Holy Spirit as the sanctifying agent who effects growth through appropriation of God-given resources (Word, prayer, obedience).
 - Practical markers of spirituality: victory over sin, doctrinal discernment, and fruit-bearing in Christian conduct.
 - Warnings against two errors: minimizing inner obedience in favor of mere profession, and elevating subjective experiences above scriptural norms.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary engagement with Scripture (notably Pauline passages such as 1 Corinthians and Romans).
 - Implied critique of contemporary Keswick-type sanctification models and Pentecostal separations of Spirit baptism from conversion.
 - In conversation with dispensational peers at DTS; less direct dialogue with classical Reformed or Catholic mysticism but implicitly contrasted.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (positional vs progressive)
 - Holy Spirit (indwelling and sanctifying work)
 - Soteriology (relation of conversion to ongoing holiness)
 - Anthropology (old nature vs new nature; flesh vs spirit)
 - Practical theology (discipline, church life, separation)

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Spirituality for Chafer = the Spirit-governed practical outworking of the believer's secure position in Christ, measured by obedience, discernment, and moral transformation rather than by ecstatic experience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between the believer's positional standing (what Christ has secured) and experiential sanctification (what the Spirit progressively accomplishes).
 - Spirituality is framed as doctrinally informed obedience; knowledge and truth are necessary conditions of true spiritual life.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects Keswick-style paradigms that posit a single crisis "victory" separate from conversion by insisting on the Spirit's indwelling at conversion and on progressive growth.
 - Opposes Pentecostal formulations that locate Spirit baptism as a subsequent, normative experience for all believers; Chafer insists on the sufficiency of the Spirit's indwelling and ordinary means of grace.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on "spiritual" as a measurable Christian category (not mystical) - useful for pastoral diagnostics.
 - Reiteration and systematization of a dispositional vocabulary: "position" vs "practice"; "flesh" vs "spirit" deployed as clinical theological categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in dispensational and conservative evangelical circles; used in pastoral training at Dallas Theological Seminary and allied institutions.
 - Less uptake in mainstream Reformed scholarship, which often frames sanctification within covenantal paradigms differently; however, appreciated for clarity and pastoral utility.
 - Cited in debates over Spirit-baptism, holiness movements, and pastoral standards of maturity.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Clear, pastoral exposition of sanctification rooted in Scripture and suitable for discipling contexts.
 - Serves as a concise manual for distinguishing authentic spiritual life from emotionalism or nominal Christianity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spiritual / He that is spiritual**
 - Biblically based category denoting the believer governed by the Holy Spirit in thought, word, and deed.

- **Carnal / Flesh**
 - The opposite category: nominal Christians still dominated by sinful tendencies and worldly conformity.

- **Positional Sanctification**
 - The believer's standing in Christ (objective, instantaneous at conversion).

- **Experimental/Progressive Sanctification**
 - The Spirit-mediated, gradual moral and spiritual growth appropriated by faith and obedience.

- **Indwelling Holy Spirit**
 - The Spirit's abiding presence from conversion; the primary agent of sanctification (contra subsequent-baptism models).

- **Yieldedness / Obedience**
 - Practical disposition necessary for sanctification; spiritual life is enacted through yielded will.

- **Discernment / Knowledge of Truth**
 - Intellectual assimilation of Scripture; Chafer stresses doctrinal understanding as precondition for spiritual maturity.

- **Fruit of the Spirit / Victory over Sin**
 - Practical evidences used to assess spirituality: moral victory and Christlike character.

- **Old Nature / New Nature**
 - Anthropological schema for explaining internal conflict and the believer's resources for holiness.

- **Means of Grace**
 - Word, prayer, obedience seen as ordinary channels through which the Spirit sanctifies.

- **Separation**
 - Ethical implication of spirituality: removal from worldly conformity and error.

- **Churchly Application**
 - Spirituality evaluated both personally and corporately in discipline and teaching.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical understandings of "spiritual" life (practical, non-mystical).
- As a **polemic** against Keswick "crisis" sanctification and Pentecostal subsequent-experience claims.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline distinctions between "flesh" and "spirit" in pastoral ministry.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in dispensational pedagogy linking soteriology and sanctification in training pastors and laity.
