### TITLE
**Richard A. Muller, Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology** (Baker, 1985; rev. printings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century retrieval of Reformed orthodox and Protestant scholastic sources. Written against caricatures of scholasticism as rationalist, offering a historically disciplined lexicon to read 16th-18th c. texts in situ.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Precision of historical terminology is indispensable for interpreting Protestant scholastic theology; misunderstandings often arise from anachronistic translation or collapsed distinctions.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Alphabetical entries with Latin/Greek lemmas, English glosses, semantic ranges, and fine-grained distinctions.
 - Cross-references that map terms across loci (e.g., principia in Bibliology and Theological Method; ad intra/ad extra in Trinity and attributes).
 - Usage notes and sample citations from representative scholastics; occasional contrasts among Reformed, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic deployments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Junius, Polanus, Perkins, Wollebius, Turretin, Voetius, Mastricht, Owen; patristic and medieval roots (Aquinas, Lombard; occasional Suarez); classical metaphysics (Aristotle). Interlocutors include Socinians, Remonstrants, and Cartesian/early modern shifts.
- **Doctrines treated:** Method and principia; Scripture and knowledge of God; divine names and attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility; absolute/relative); Trinity (eternal generation and spiration); sin and freedom; covenant theology; ordo vs historia salutis; Christological communications; ecclesial and sacramental terms.
- **Closing line:** The dictionary furnishes the grammar of Protestant scholastic dogmatics so that theology may be read as its authors intended: catholic in scope, Reformed in confession, and rigorously methodical.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Systematic treatment of **archetypal/ectypal** distinction and **principia** for theology as a scientia.
 - Careful alignment of **ad intra/ad extra** and **viae** in naming God with attributes discourse.
 - Integration of covenantal and soteriological idiom (foedera; ordo vs historia salutis) with methodological terms.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Counters the degeneration thesis by distinguishing scholastic method from rationalism.
 - Rectifies misreadings from lexicon flattening (e.g., collapsing habitus and actus; confusing principium essendi with cognoscendi).
 - Supplements and corrects earlier secondary syntheses (e.g., Heppe) by returning to primary terminology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not new doctrine; rather a curated crosswalk of technical terms with standardized English glosses and confessional nuance.
 - Distinguishes overlapping families of terms and marks their locus-specific valences.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Standard seminary and graduate reference for reading Reformed orthodox sources.
 - Cited across loci, especially in Theological Method, Theology Proper, Trinity, Sin/Free Will, and Soteriology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Prevents anachronism; enables accurate exegesis of scholastic texts.
 - Serves as a bridge for contemporary dogmatics to retrieve classical distinctions responsibly.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principium essendi / principium cognoscendi:** God as the ground of theology's being; Scripture (externum) and Spirit (internum) as grounds of knowing.
 - Externum/internum specify objective text and subjective illumination.
- **Archetypal / ectypal theology:** God's self-knowledge vs creaturely participation; frames theological humility and method.
- **Scientia theologiae; habitus/actus:** Theology as a science and habitus; acts of knowing (lectio, meditatio, disputatio) flow from a formed habit.
- **Locus; methodus; analytica/synthetica:** Organizing principles and modes of exposition within systems.
- **Viae in divinis (negationis, eminentiae, causalitatis):** Classical ways of naming God that regulate attributes discourse.
- **Attributa absoluta/relativa; ad intra/ad extra:** Absolute perfections vs relations of origin; internal processions vs external works.
- **Simplicitas; aseitas; immutabilitas; impassibilitas:** Core divine perfections articulated with careful metaphysical entailments.
- **Generatio aeterna; processio/spiratio:** Son's generation; Spirit's procession; specifies personal properties without division of essence.
- **Duplex cognitio Dei (naturalis/supernaturalis):** Knowledge of God by nature and by revelation; ties to principia and Scripture.
- **Liberum arbitrium; servitus peccati; concursus:** Faculty language for will; bondage under sin post lapsum; divine concurrence with secondary causes.
- **Peccatum originale; concupiscentia; habitus peccati:** Original sin as guilt and corruption; concupiscence as disordered inclination.
- **Foedus operum; foedus gratiae; pactum salutis:** Covenantal architecture relating creation, redemption, and intra-Trinitarian counsel.
- **Ordo salutis vs historia salutis:** Application to individuals vs accomplishment in redemptive history; coordinate, not competing, frames.
- **Autopistia Scripturae; testimonium Spiritus internum; analogia fidei/scripturae:** Scripture's self-authentication, Spirit's witness, and canonical rule of faith.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Definition source to fix technical vocabulary before engaging primary texts or modern debates.
 - Conceptual pivot for method (principia, scientia) and Theology Proper (viae, attributes).
 - Polemical clarifier in discussions of freedom, divine action, and Trinitarian processions.
 - Teaching aid that maps cross-loci connections (e.g., ad intra/ad extra from Trinity to providence and soteriology).
