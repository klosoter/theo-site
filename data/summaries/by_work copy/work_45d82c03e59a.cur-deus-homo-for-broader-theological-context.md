### TITLE
**Cur Deus Homo** (Why God Became Man) - Anselm of Canterbury

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - c. 1095-1098; Latin West, early scholastic monastic milieu (Bec/Canterbury).
 - Written as a rational dialogue with Boso to explain the necessity and fittingness of the Incarnation and Passion to unbelievers and believers.
 - Presupposes Nicene-Chalcedonian orthodoxy and Western trinitarian assumptions (filioque context) without polemics [Filioque And Ecumenical Creeds].
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Why did God become man? Because only a **God-man** could render the satisfaction requisite to restore God's honor and the moral order breached by sin.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Book I: The problem of sin as an infinite offense against divine honor; either punishment or satisfaction must follow lest God's governance be irrational; humans owe perfect obedience and cannot repay the debt.
 - The required agent must be both God (infinite worth) and man (owing the debt on behalf of humanity) [Hypostatic Union].
 - Book II: The God-man's sinless, voluntary death is not owed; its superabundant worth constitutes satisfaction and merits a treasury of grace for many; this is fitting rather than absolutely compelled necessity [Atonement Necessity Extent And Theories].
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Dialogue partner: Boso. Background: Augustine; contrasts with ransom-to-Satan motifs in earlier Fathers.
 - Scripture appealed to sparingly; leans on reason, moral order, and juridical-honor analogies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - God: justice, mercy, wisdom, immutability.
 - Anthropology: sin as debt, inability, need for grace.
 - Christology: Incarnation, two natures in one person, sinlessness, voluntariness of death [Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine].
 - Soteriology: satisfaction, merit, grace, the scope of Christ's saving work.
- **Closing line**
 - The work's center of gravity: only the sinless God-man, freely offering a superabundant satisfaction, reconciles divine justice and mercy in saving humanity [Impeccability Of Christ].

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Satisfaction as restoration of **divine honor** and moral order, not a commercial payoff to the devil.
 - Rational demonstration by fitting necessity; minimal proof-texting; faith seeking understanding.
 - Voluntariness of Christ's death as essential to its merit; the gift is not owed.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects ransom-to-Satan account; recasts atonement in Godward terms.
 - Distinguishes satisfaction from punishment: either punishment of the sinner or satisfaction by another; God does not forgive by mere fiat that would dishonor justice.
 - Assumes, rather than argues, Chalcedon's one person in two natures as the only adequate soteriological framework.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Debt (debitum) and honor (honor Dei) as moral-juridical lenses; supererogatory merit; necessity as consequent or fitting, not absolute compulsion.
 - The God-man logic: only one person possessing divine dignity and human obligation can effect satisfaction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply formative for medieval and Reformed soteriology; Aquinas refines; Reformers appropriate and reframe toward penal categories.
 - Persistent critiques: feudal honor framework; questions about biblical idiom and divine freedom; ecumenical retrievals often integrate biblical-ritual motifs.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies why Incarnation is soteriologically necessary and why Christ must be sinless and voluntary in death.
 - A conceptual map bridging Christology and atonement for teaching and analytic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Satisfaction (satisfactio)**: Restorative offering that honors God and rectifies disorder; alternative to punishment.
- **Honor of God (honor Dei)**: Moral-juridical order grounded in God's governance; sin is an affront diminishing due honor.
- **Debt (debitum)**: Obligation of total obedience; sin incurs an unpayable deficit for fallen humans.
- **Necessity (necessitas)**: Not absolute compulsion; a fitting or consequent necessity given God's wisdom, justice, and purposes.
- **God-man (Deus-homo)**: Single person who is both God and man, the only adequate mediator to render infinite-worth satisfaction.
- **Voluntariness of Christ's death**: Because sinless, death was not owed; thus His death has meritorious value.
- **Impeccability / sinlessness**: Christ has no personal guilt or debt; condition for making satisfaction for others.
- **Merit / supererogation**: Christ's act possesses surplus worth, applicable to the many by grace.
- **Justice and mercy**: In God they are harmonious; satisfaction upholds justice while effecting merciful salvation.
- **Rejection of ransom theory**: No payment to Satan; the transaction is Godward.
- **Hypostatic union**: One person, two natures; grounds both the worth (divine) and relevance (human) of the satisfaction.
- **Two natures, one person**: Chalcedonian guardrails ensuring the mediator's acts are theandric and soteriologically effective.
- **Punishment vs satisfaction**: A structuring disjunction; forgiveness without either would undermine moral order.
- **Extent of atonement**: Merit is superabundant in worth; text does not specify distributional limits.

- **How the work is used**
 - As a classic source for defining satisfaction within atonement models [Atonement Necessity Extent And Theories].
 - As a conceptual bridge in teaching the Incarnation's soteriological necessity [Hypostatic Union].
 - As a Christological witness presupposing Chalcedon's formula for doctrinal coherence [Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine].
 - As a resource for articulating Christ's sinlessness and the voluntariness of His death [Impeccability Of Christ].
