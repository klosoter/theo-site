### TITLE
**Soteriology: Union with Christ and Ordo Salutis** - William B. Evans, in Reformed Thought: A Christian Worldview (2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** situated within early 21st-century Reformed renewal; addresses persistent scholarly debates about the place of union with Christ in systematic soteriology and the integrity of the ordo salutis schema. Interacts with confessional Reformed commitments and contemporary pastoral-theological concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** **Union with Christ is the central, formative category for Reformed soteriology**; the ordo salutis must be reinterpreted as a descriptive ordering of particular benefits within a single, Spirit-wrought union rather than as a series of isolated, causally independent events.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnoses a common problem: schematic ordo salutis treatments fragment salvation into discrete acts (calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification) and marginalize union.
 - Advances a corrective: reads Pauline and Reformed texts to show the **Spirit as the instrumental and personal bond** that effects and sustains union - union precedes and grounds forensic and experiential benefits.
 - Reconstructs ordo salutis as **organic participation**: topical ordering is retained for pedagogical clarity, but ontologically all soterial benefits flow from being "in Christ."
 - Considers pastoral and catechetical implications: assurance, revival of sacramental theology, and evangelistic proclamation centered on covenantal participation rather than merely legal imputation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** classic Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster standards), major Puritan and Reformed theologians (John Owen, B. B. Warfield), and contemporary treatments of union and ordo salutis (modern Reformed soteriologists and biblical theologians). Frequent appeal to Pauline exegesis (Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians) and pneumatological tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** soteriology (ordo salutis), Christology (headship and representation), pneumatology (Spirit as union-bond), covenant theology (covenant of grace and participation), justification and imputation, sanctification, adoption, and ecclesiology/sacramental theology.
- **Closing line:** Evans insists that **the Holy Spirit unites believers to Christ as the ontological ground of salvation**, and that a truly Reformed ordo salutis must be read through the prism of this union.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **ontological union** (participation in Christ) over strictly forensic schemas; treats the Spirit as both efficient cause and personal subject of union.
 - Frames the ordo salutis as a **theological index** of the manifold benefits of union rather than a mechanical causal series.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects overly schematic Westminster-derived presentations that risk presenting regeneration, justification, and sanctification as disconnected events.
 - Pushes back on pietistic or experiential reductions of union that ignore forensic and covenantal dimensions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses language of **"organic participation"** and **"Spirit-mediated representation"** to stress continuity between Christ's headship and believers' experiential appropriation.
 - Distinguishes between **ontological priority** (union as the ground) and **logical/pedagogical ordering** (ordo salutis as explanatory sequence).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valuable to Reformed pastors and theologians seeking a more integrated soteriology; cited in discussions emphasizing pneumatological dimensions of union and in critiques of fragmented ordo frameworks.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable corrective for teaching and preaching by restoring union with Christ to the structural center of Reformed soteriology and by showing practical implications for assurance, sacraments, and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** The believer's real, Spirit-wrought participation in Christ; the ontological ground of all soterial benefits.
- **Ordo salutis:** The traditional ordering of salvation's benefits; reinterpreted as a pedagogical index rather than a strict causal chain.
- **Holy Spirit:** Personal agent who effects, maintains, and actualizes union; both bond and guarantor of participation.
- **Regeneration:** Fruit of union; described as derivative of being in Christ rather than the first isolated causal step.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration grounded in union and Christ's representative obedience; not in conflict with participation but dependent on it.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive realization of union's moral fruit; simultaneous with and flowing from union rather than wholly subsequent.
- **Covenant of grace:** The relational framework that situates union as covenantal participation in Christ's benefits.
- **Representation / Headship:** Christ as federal head whose life, death, and resurrection are shared with believers through union.
- **Imputation (active/passive):** Doctrinal correlates of representation and union - Christ's righteousness credited to believers, sin imputed to Christ - read through participatory language.
- **Instrumental vs. organic categories:** Distinction used to counter mechanistic readings of ordo salutis; Spirit is both instrument and organic bond.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral outworking of union; confidence grounded in objective union and the Spirit's testimony.
- **Mystical/ethical union:** Differentiates mystical (ontological) union from ethical conformity, while showing their inseparability in Reformed thought.
- **Exegesis (Pauline focus):** Methodological reliance on Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians to substantiate union as the center of Pauline soteriology.
- **Participation (koinonia):** Terminology underscoring sharing in Christ's benefits, life, and resurrection.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for union-centered Reformed soteriology and pneumatology.
 - As a **polemic** against mechanistic ordo salutis charts that sever benefits from union.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts through pneumatological and participatory categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral and sacramental theology to reorient assurance and discipleship around union with Christ.
