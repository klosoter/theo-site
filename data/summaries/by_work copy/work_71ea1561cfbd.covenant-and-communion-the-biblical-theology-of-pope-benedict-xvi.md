### TITLE
Covenant and Communion: The Biblical Theology of Pope Benedict XVI - Scott Hahn (study notes)
- Work: Covenant and Communion
- Author: Scott Hahn
- Focus: Biblical Covenants examined through the theological lens of Joseph Ratzinger / Pope Benedict XVI

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Catholic biblical theology; part of a post-Vatican II ressourcement that re-emphasizes patristic exegesis and liturgical theology.
 - Engages Benedict XVI's (Ratzinger's) lectures, essays, and magisterial emphases developed across late 20th - early 21st century.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Benedict's biblical theology grounds salvation history in a single, personal covenantal economy: God's self-communication culminates in Christ and is actualized sacramentally in the Church-especially the Eucharist.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Benedict's reading of Scripture: unity of Testaments via typology and promise-fulfillment.
 - Reframing covenant not as juridical contract but as personal, historical communion between God and humanity.
 - Christ as the decisive covenant act (new covenant in his blood), with the Eucharist as the continuing presence and seal of that covenant.
 - Liturgy and sacraments are the form in which covenantal communion is realized and transmitted.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Joseph Ratzinger / Pope Benedict XVI (biblical commentaries, homilies, Spe Salvi, Jesus of Nazareth series).
 - Secondary echoes: Augustine, Aquinas, patristic tradition, Vatican II sources (Sacrosanctum Concilium, Dei Verbum).
 - Implicit interlocutors: modern biblical criticism, theological liberalism, and some Protestant covenant-theology formulations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word and sacrament), Covenant (old/new), Christology (incarnation as covenantal self-giving), Eucharist (real presence; anamnesis), Ecclesiology (Church as sacrament/communion), Sacramentology, Typology, Eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Benedict's theological center of gravity: God's self-giving covenant becomes historical communion in Christ and is perpetuated sacramentally-Scripture, liturgy, and Church are integrally covenantal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on **covenant as personal communion** rather than mere legal transaction; covenant language is existential and ontological.
 - Integration of **typological exegesis** with liturgical theology-typology is not merely rhetorical but sacramental.
 - Eucharist as the **ontological continuation** of Christ's covenantal self-offering: not symbolic only, but constitutive of the Church's identity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Moves against reductive Enlightenment/legal models of covenant that privatize religion or make God an abstract guarantor of law.
 - Contrasts with some Reformed emphases on discontinuity between covenants by underscoring **fulfillment and continuity** (though Benedict allows typological differentiation).
 - Pushes back on purely historical-critical detachment: Scripture's unity must be read within ecclesial and liturgical life.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Calls attention to the triadic interplay: **Scripture-Liturgy-Church** as mutually interpreting loci of covenantal reality.
 - Reframes sacrament as the **mean of covenantal encounter** (not merely sign + grace formulaic).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in contemporary Catholic biblical theology and liturgical renewal; used in ecumenical dialogues as a conciliatory model.
 - Reformed responses vary: appreciation for biblical continuity, guarded critique about sacramental ontology and ecclesial mediation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how covenant theology can be both biblical and sacramental; valuable for ecclesiology, homiletics, sacramental theology, and ecumenical conversations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - personal, relational pact of self-giving between God and people; ontological more than merely juridical.
- **Communion** - the lived reality of covenant; interpersonal sharing grounded in God's self-gift.
- **New Covenant** - Christ's definitive covenantal act; sealed and made present in his blood and the Eucharist.
- **Eucharist / Sacrament** - the real, sacramental continuation and manifestation of Christ's covenantal presence.
- **Typology** - reading OT persons/events as prefigurations fulfilled in Christ and actualized in liturgy.
- **Scripture-Liturgy-Church triad** - mutual hermeneutical and ontological ordering: Scriptures interpreted in liturgical/communal life; liturgy shaped by Scripture; Church as sacramental subject.
- **Anamnesis** - liturgical memory that makes the covenantal act present and efficacious.
- **Revelation (Word and Sacrament)** - God's self-disclosure is both written Word and sacramental presence; neither pole is autonomous.
- **Sacramental economy** - the economy of salvation ordered through sacraments as covenantal mediations.
- **Personalism of God** - stresses God as personal actor, inviting relationship, not merely legislator.
- **Typological continuity** - continuity of covenant history with rules for transformation, not simple repetition or replacement.
- **Ecclesial ontology** - Church as the sacrament/organ of communal covenantal existence.
- **Covenant fidelity / law** - law interpreted as the life-form of covenant fidelity, read christologically.
- **Eschatological fulfillment** - covenantal life oriented toward consummation in God's eternal communion.
- **Hermeneutic of continuity** - Benedict's favored reading posture: reform within continuity.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a sacramental, covenantal Catholic biblical theology.
- As an **exegetical model** promoting typology coupled with liturgical-sacramental reading.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical discussion to bridge covenantal continuity with sacramental ecclesiology.
