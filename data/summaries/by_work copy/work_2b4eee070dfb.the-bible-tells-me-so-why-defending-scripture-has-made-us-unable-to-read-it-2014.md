### TITLE
The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It - Peter Enns (2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2014 amid ongoing evangelical debates over inerrancy, evolution, and hermeneutics.
 - Follows Enns's earlier work (Inspiration and Incarnation) and his controversial departure from Westminster Theological Seminary; addresses both academic and pastoral audiences within evangelicalism.
 - Milieu: late 20th-early 21st-century evangelicalism negotiating science, historical criticism, and confessional commitments.

- **Central thesis**
 - The modern defensive posture of "defending" the Bible (primarily through inerrancy arguments) has distorted reading practices; a proper reading recognizes Scripture's ancient contexts and God's accommodation to human thought and genre.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary defenders of Scripture import modern assumptions (scientific, historiographical, linguistic) into texts that inhabit ancient Near Eastern categories.
 - Positive alternative: read Biblical texts on their own terms-genre, ancient cosmology, and theological intent-and view inspiration analogically to the incarnation (God uses human thought-forms to convey divine truth).
 - Practical application: case studies-Genesis 1-11, psalms, and other passages where modern readers force scientific or literalist readings that generate unnecessary conflict with science and history.
 - Pastoral stakes: defensive stances produce cognitive dissonance for educated believers and damage the church's witness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: defenders of verbal inerrancy and literalist readings in conservative evangelicalism (implicit engagement with confessional statements like the Chicago Statement).
 - Scholarly resources: ancient Near Eastern literature, historical-critical scholarship, biblical theology, and contemporary authors wrestling with science-faith (e.g., discussions about Genesis and Darwinian evolution).
 - Implicit contrasts with both fundamentalist literalists and liberal deniers of historicity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (reinterpreted via accommodation/incarnation analogy).
 - Inerrancy and authority of Scripture (critiqued).
 - Biblical hermeneutics and theology (canonical reading, genre sensitivity).
 - Indirectly touches on creation, providence, and pastoral theology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Enns urges evangelical fidelity to Scripture that relinquishes modern defensive strategies in favor of a reading shaped by the Bible's ancient contexts and a theological model of divine accommodation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prominent use of the **incarnational analogy**: just as Christ took on human nature, revelation took on ancient human thought-forms; thus divine truth can be communicated through culturally conditioned, nonmodern categories.
 - Strong insistence on **genre and ANE context** as first principles for interpretation, not afterthoughts to preserve doctrine.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges conservative inerrantist paradigms that read Genesis 1-11 as modern scientific historiography.
 - Contrasts with liberal skepticism by retaining robust theological authority-Enns does not abandon the Bible's truth claims but reframes what those claims look like when freed from modern categories.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "inspiration" away from mechanical dictation and toward a relational, incarnational model that preserves divine intent without requiring modern factual precision in every human expression.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Polarizing: criticized by many conservative evangelicals as undermining doctrinal certainty; welcomed by some evangelicals and mainline scholars as a way to integrate critical scholarship with confessional faith.
 - Stimulated pastoral and educational conversations about Genesis, evolution, and catechesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - A clear, teachable corrective for pastors, students, and laypeople negotiating science-scripture tensions and the pastoral consequences of literalist defenses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation**
 - God communicates in forms intelligible to ancient hearers; not every statement carries modern factual intent.
- **Incarnational analogy**
 - Primary hermeneutical trope: revelation behaves like the incarnation-divine truth embodied in limited human forms.
- **Inerrancy (critique)**
 - Enns critiques rigid formulations that demand modern factual precision; preserves authority but not modernist factualism.
- **Inspiration (reframed)**
 - Inspiration as relational/communicative rather than mechanical dictation.
- **Genre sensitivity**
 - Reading Genesis, Psalms, and prophecy according to genre prevents category mistakes (e.g., reading poetic cosmology as scientific report).
- **Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context**
 - Comparative data used to show shared imagery and different epistemic aims between ANE texts and modern science.
- **Genesis 1-11 (case study)**
 - Treated as theological and covenantal narrative using ANE motifs; resists modern scientific reading (see: Science And Scripture - Genesis 1 11).
- **Authority vs. factualism**
 - Distinguishes the Bible's theological authority from claims that every statement must align with modern empirical facts.
- **Hermeneutic of trust**
 - Encourages reading that assumes Scripture's theological reliability while honoring its human forms.
- **Phenomenological language**
 - Recognizes ordinary descriptive speech (e.g., "sun rises") in Scripture without claiming scientific error.
- **Canon and theological trajectory**
 - Emphasizes the canonical shape of revelation and how later texts reinterpret earlier ones.
- **Pastoral hermeneutics**
 - Focus on how reading practices form faith and handle cognitive challenges for believers.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition/source** for the accommodation/incarnational model of inspiration.
 - As a **polemic** against inerrantist defenses that read Scripture as modern scientific/historical literature (especially applied to Genesis 1-11 and science-faith conversations).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading problematic texts within ANE context and genre-awareness; used in teaching pastoral hermeneutics.
