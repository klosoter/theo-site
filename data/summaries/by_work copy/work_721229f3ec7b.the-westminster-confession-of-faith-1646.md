### TITLE
**The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)** - The doctrinal standard of classic Reformed orthodoxy, produced by the Westminster Assembly and paired with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - 1643-1649 Westminster Assembly under the English Parliament during the Civil Wars; Puritan-Reformed consolidation post-Dort and against Laudian Anglicanism.
 - Theological milieu: Reformed scholasticism (Ames, Perkins), continental confessions (Second Helvetic, Heidelberg), Irish Articles (1615), anti-Roman, anti-Arminian, anti-Socinian apologetic.
- **Central thesis / problem**
 - To codify a full-orbed, Scripture-sufficient, covenantal, Trinitarian account of Christian faith and practice for the church's doctrine, worship, and discipline.
- **Core argument / structure (33 chapters)**
 - 1-5: **Revelation and God** - Scripture's authority/sufficiency; God and the Holy Trinity; decree; creation; providence.
 - 6-8: **Sin and covenant** - Fall and original sin; covenant of works and grace; Christ the Mediator.
 - 9-18: **Ordo salutis** - Free will; effectual calling; justification, adoption, sanctification; saving faith, repentance; good works; perseverance; assurance.
 - 19-24: **Law and liberty, public ethics** - Law's abiding use; Christian liberty and conscience; worship and Sabbath; oaths/vows; civil magistrate; marriage/divorce.
 - 25-31: **Church and means of grace** - Church; communion of saints; sacraments; baptism; Lord's Supper; censures; synods/councils.
 - 32-33: **Eschatology** - Intermediate state and resurrection; last judgment.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Authorities: Holy Scripture; reception and refinement of Reformed confessional consensus.
 - Interlocutors: Trent (justification/sacraments), Remonstrants (grace/election), Socinians (Trinity/atonement), Anabaptists (church/sacraments), Laudians (worship/episcopacy).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, canon, hermeneutics; Trinity; decrees; creation/providence; hamartiology; covenant theology; Christology; soteriology (election, calling, justification, sanctification, perseverance, assurance); law/gospel; worship and Sabbath; ecclesiology, sacraments, discipline; church-state; death, resurrection, judgment.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **The glory of the triune God in the covenant of grace, through Christ the Mediator, by the Spirit, according to Scripture, ordering church and life.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Chapter 1 on **Scripture** leads the Confession; high doctrine of inspiration, sufficiency, and perspicuity.
 - **Covenant of works/grace** structure; federal headship of Adam and Christ.
 - Precise **ordo salutis** with robust doctrines of assurance and perseverance.
 - **Regulative principle of worship**; Sabbath as moral and perpetual, transposed to the Lord's Day.
 - Two **sacraments** only; spiritual (real) presence in the Supper; infant baptism.
 - Clear **threefold division** and uses of the law.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **Trent**: imputed righteousness, faith alone, two sacraments, rejection of transubstantiation and sacerdotalism.
 - Against **Arminianism**: unconditional election, effectual calling, definite perseverance.
 - Against **Socinianism**: Nicene/Chalcedonian Christology; penal substitutionary atonement.
 - Against **Antinomianism**: abiding normativity of the moral law for believers.
 - Against **Anabaptism**: church-covenant continuity and infant baptism.
 - Against **Laudian episcopacy/ceremonialism**: presbyterian polity and worship simplicity.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Confessional codification of **federal theology**; programmatic placement of bibliology; tightly ordered soteriology; carefully articulated conscience and Christian liberty.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Scotland (1647); modified in American Presbyterianism (esp. magistrate/church powers); adapted by the **Savoy Declaration** (1658) and **Second London Baptist Confession** (1689).
 - Continues as a global Reformed standard for doctrine, discipline, and catechesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Doctrinal clarity with exegetical economy; pedagogical utility; catholic Reformed breadth with pastoral sensitivity on assurance and liberty.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura / sufficiency**: Scripture contains all things necessary for God's glory, salvation, faith, and life.
- **Perspicuity**: Essentials of salvation are clear in Scripture in ordinary means.
- **Canon / Apocrypha**: Canonical books listed; Apocrypha not inspired nor authoritative.
- **Decree / Providence**: God's eternal plan infallibly ordains whatsoever comes to pass; providence governs all things.
- **Covenant of Works / Grace**:
 - Works: life upon perfect, personal, perpetual obedience in Adam.
 - Grace: salvation freely offered in Christ to the elect.
- **Federal Headship**: Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; imputation grounded here.
- **Mediator (three offices)**: Christ as Prophet, Priest, King; two natures, one person.
- **Imputation**: Adam's guilt to us; our sin to Christ; Christ's righteousness to believers.
- **Effectual Calling**: Spirit's sovereign, inward work, making the elect willing and able.
- **Justification by faith alone**: Forensic pardon and acceptance on Christ's righteousness alone.
- **Sanctification and Perseverance**: Real, imperfect renewal; certain perseverance of the saints.
- **Assurance**: Ordinary possibility and pastoral means; not of the essence of faith.
- **Law of God**: Moral, ceremonial, judicial; moral law perpetually binding; three uses.
- **Regulative Principle of Worship**: God wills to be worshiped only as he commands.
- **Sabbath / Lord's Day**: One-in-seven principle; Christian Sabbath on the first day.
- **Sacraments (signs and seals)**: Two ordinances instituted by Christ; grace signified and sealed, not mechanically conveyed.
- **Baptism (including infants)**: Covenant sign for believers and their children.
- **Spiritual Presence in the Supper**: Real, spiritual feeding on Christ; rejection of transubstantiation.
- **Keys of the Kingdom / Censures**: Ministerial authority for Word, sacraments, discipline.
- **Civil Magistrate**: Distinct from church; ordained by God for justice; original text assigns limited religious care (varied by later revisions).

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **doctrinal baseline** defining Reformed positions across loci.
 - As a **polemical standard** against Roman, Arminian, Socinian, and Anabaptist errors.
 - As an **exegetical model** organizing biblical data into covenantal and ordo salutis frameworks.
