### TITLE
**Revelation and Inspiration** - B. B. Warfield (Old Princeton; essays collected posthumously, 1927; Works of Warfield, vol. 1)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Old Princeton, amid higher criticism, the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy, and debates on biblical authority.
 - Engagement with historical-critical method, Roman Catholic two-source theory, and emerging liberal Protestant doctrines of religious experience.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **God reveals** himself in deeds and words culminating in Christ; **Scripture is the God-breathed inscription** of this revelation through the Spirit's **organic, concursive** action, yielding an inerrant, authoritative canon in the autographs.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Distinguishes **revelation** (divine self-disclosure) from **inspiration** (the mode by which revelation is inscripturated).
 - Exegetical case: 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:21; Jesus' and apostles' doctrine of Scripture (e.g., John 10:35; It is written).
 - Positive doctrine: **verbal-plenary** and **organic** inspiration via divine-human concursus; rejects dictation caricature.
 - Truthfulness: inerrancy grounded in **divine veracity**; error would impugn God who speaks.
 - Canon and closure: apostolicity and propheticity under providence; cessation of inscripturating revelation.
 - Replies to objections: accommodation, historical criticism, textual variants; autographic inerrancy with ordinary means of textual criticism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Allies: Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodox; A. A. Hodge; L. Gaussen.
 - Interlocutors/opponents: Wellhausen, Ritschlian and liberal views, Roman Catholic tradition-development models, Charles A. Briggs; kenotic Christologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology: revelation, inspiration, inerrancy, canon, sufficiency, perspicuity.
 - Pneumatology: distinct works of the Spirit in revelation, inspiration, illumination.
 - Theology Proper: divine truthfulness; God speaking.
 - Christology: Christ's view of Scripture; theanthropic analogy for Scripture's dual authorship.
 - Covenant/redemptive history: progressive revelation across the covenants culminating in Christ.
 - Eschatology: prophetic fulfillment; finality of apostolic revelation before consummation.
- **Closing line**
 - The Bible, as **theopneustos**, is the Spirit's theanthropic product, wholly trustworthy in all it affirms, given to serve the saving revelation of God in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Concursus** and **organic inspiration**: full divine superintendence with unviolated human faculties.
 - **Autographic inerrancy**: truthfulness attaches to what the biblical writers wrote; copies are normed to that text.
 - **Theanthropic character of Scripture**: analogy to Christ's person, without collapsing the analogy.
 - Tight exegetical grounding in the Bible's own self-witness and Christ's testimony.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **dictation caricature** and **dynamic/partial inspiration** theories; insists on verbal-plenary scope.
 - Counters **Ritschlian/experience-based** accounts and **Roman two-source** tradition claims; affirms sufficiency and finality.
 - Clarifies **accommodation** as condescension in mode, not concession to error; resists kenotic appeals that diminish Jesus' attestation of Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Stabilizes English-language use of **verbal-plenary**, **inerrancy**, **autopistic** self-attestation, and **concursus** in Reformed scholastic idiom.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical for Old Princeton and later evangelicalism; foundational for mid-20th-century inerrancy debates and the Chicago Statement.
 - Received appreciatively yet critiqued by neo-orthodoxy (event-not-text) and by presuppositionalists on method, while retaining doctrinal influence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable definitions, careful exegesis, and principled engagement with criticism; a standard for teaching Bibliology and for integrating Scripture's authority with redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation**: God's self-disclosure in acts and words; culminates in Christ; broader than Scripture.
- **Inspiration**: The Spirit's work ensuring that what is written is **God-breathed**; applies to the text of Scripture.
- **Theopneustos**: Predicate of graphe (2 Tim 3:16); grounds authority and truthfulness.
- **Verbal-Plenary**: Extent (plenary) and depth (verbal) of inspiration encompass all words of Scripture.
- **Organic Inspiration**: Divine superintendence through, not despite, human personalities and contexts.
- **Concursus**: Concurrent divine and human operation producing one infallible outcome.
- **Inerrancy**: Scripture tells the truth in all it affirms; located in the autographs; coherent with ordinary language, genre, and phenomena.
- **Autographs/Autographic Inerrancy**: The original writings are inerrant; textual criticism aims to approximate their wording.
- **Accommodation**: God's condescension to human capacity without endorsing falsehood.
- **Illumination**: The Spirit's work in readers to understand and receive Scripture; distinct from inspiration.
- **Self-attestation (Autopistia)**: Scripture bears its own divine marks; recognized by the Spirit and confirmed by fitting evidences.
- **Canon**: Providentially recognized corpus of prophetic-apostolic writings; closed with the apostolic age.
- **Sufficiency and Perspicuity**: Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and is clear in essentials.
- **Theanthropic Analogy**: Scripture as fully divine and fully human in origin and character, analogically like the incarnate Word.
- **Miracle and Prophecy as Attestation**: External evidences corroborating the divine mission of revelatory agents.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Bibliology: baseline definitions of inspiration, inerrancy, canon; exegetical prooftexts and method.
 - Pneumatology: taxonomy of the Spirit's operations (revelation, inspiration, illumination).
 - Covenant Theology and Eschatology: model of progressive revelation and promise-fulfillment grounding typology and prophetic certainty.
 - Christology and Theology Proper: Christ's doctrine of Scripture and divine veracity as foundations for authority claims.
