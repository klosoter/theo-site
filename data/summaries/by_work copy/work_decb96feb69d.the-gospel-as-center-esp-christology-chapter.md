### TITLE
**The Gospel as Center (esp. Christology chapter)** - D. A. Carson & Timothy Keller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Produced in the late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical-Reformed milieu that sought to re-center pastoral ministry and doctrine on the gospel amid cultural secularization, moralism, and competing "social gospel" emphases.
 - Emerged alongside the rise of Gospel Coalition networks, renewed expository preaching movements, and renewed interest in classical doctrines (justification, penal substitution, union with Christ).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel (the person and work of Christ) must function as the controlling center of theology and ministry; Christology is the decisive theological hinge that shapes doctrine, worship, mission, and pastoral practice.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary ministry and piety fragment the gospel into moralism, therapeutic religion, or social activism detached from Christ's finished work.
 - Christological groundwork: careful exposition of the person (incarnation, deity, humanity) and work (atonement, resurrection, ascension, lordship) of Christ as the interpretive key for Scripture and life.
 - Theological application: show how a gospel-centered Christology recalibrates doctrines (justification, sanctification, union with Christ, Trinity) and concrete ministry (preaching, evangelism, discipleship, social concern).
 - Pastoral outworking: offers models for preaching, pastoral care, and mission that begin and end with Christ rather than moral exhortation or programmatic solutions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical Reformers (Calvin), evangelical expositors (e.g., Lloyd-Jones, B. B. Warfield via lineage), contemporary interlocutors (critics of penal substitution, proponents of broader social gospel, New Perspective on Paul).
 - Scriptural exegesis (Pauline and Johannine Christology) is primary; selective engagement with modern theologians (Barth, Kuyperian social theology) to contrast emphases.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (person and work), Trinity (as background), atonement (penal substitution emphasized), justification by faith, union with Christ, sanctification, ecclesiology, mission, preaching theory.
- **Closing line**
 - The book argues that only when Christology governs our reading of Scripture and our ministry practices does doctrine cohere and the church recover its gospel power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insists on the **gospel as the hermeneutical and practical center** - not merely one doctrine among many but the organizing axis for theology and ministry.
 - Elevates **union with Christ** as the structural category linking justification, sanctification, and final glorification.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects moralistic, program-driven ministry that sidelines substitutionary atonement and justification.
 - Pushes back against extremes of the social-gospel-only approach while affirming legitimate social implications that flow from the gospel (subordinate but necessary).
 - Engages New Perspective debates by reasserting traditional forensic language without ignoring corporate and covenantal dimensions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the phrase **"gospel-centered ministry"** as a concise programmatic slogan with theological teeth.
 - Frames Christology as both **objective (what Christ has done)** and **subjective (our union and participation)** in a single pastoral-anthropological axis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative and Reformed-leaning evangelical circles; shaped training in seminaries and churches, especially for preaching and pastoral care.
 - Criticized by some social-theologians and proponents of alternative atonement models for insufficient attention to structural justice and non-forensic metaphors.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable corrective to fragmentation in ministry and theology; a clear primer for integrating high doctrine with pastoral practice and public ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel** - the good news centering on Christ's person and redemptive work; used as hermeneutical and pastoral center.
- **Christology** - decisive discipline; focuses on incarnation, deity, humanity, and work as interpretive key.
- **Penal substitution** - affirmed as the primary atonement framework for explaining justification and propitiation.
- **Union with Christ** - structuring concept linking justification, sanctification, adoption, and final glorification.
- **Justification by faith** - forensic declaration grounded in Christ's work; central to soteriology and pastoral assurance.
- **Sanctification** - understood as gospel-driven growth, not mere moralism; flows from union with Christ.
- **Incarnation** - anchors both Christ's uniqueness and pastoral implications for embodiment and mission.
- **Resurrection & ascension** - guarantees of lordship, vindication, and present/practical authority for mission.
- **Lordship of Christ** - Christ's reign governs ethics, church order, and mission priorities.
- **Expository preaching** - recommended method to keep Christ central in ministry; Scripture read through Christ.
- **Gospel-centered ministry** - applied programmatic term for practices that begin with Christ's person/work and flow into worship, evangelism, care, and social concern.
- **Forensic language** - retained and re-emphasized against tendencies to spiritualize justification.
- **Social implications** - social justice and mercy are endorsed but circumscribed and derived from gospel priorities.
- **New Perspective dialogue** - engaged as a corrective locus where gospel centrality clarifies Pauline theology.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "gospel-centered ministry" in preaching and pastoral training.
 - As a **polemic** against moralism, therapeutic religion, and social-gospel-only approaches.
 - As an **exegetical model** emphasizing Christocentric reading of Scripture (esp. Pauline/Johannine texts).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating doctrinal theology (Christology, atonement, justification) with practical ministry design.
