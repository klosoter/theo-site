### TITLE
He Who Gives Life: The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit (2007) - Graham A. Cole

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2007 in a broadly Reformed-evangelical milieu; aimed at scholarly and pastoral readers.
 - Responds to renewed interest in pneumatology from Pentecostal/charismatic movements, constructive systematic theology, and post‑liberal debates about the Spirit.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is the personal, Trinitarian agent who gives spiritual and eschatological life - grounding union with Christ, the church's worship and mission, and the Christian's sanctification - and must be understood biblically, historically, and doctrinally against both reductionist and sensational readings.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical theology: careful exegesis of Old and New Testament witness to the Spirit (Spirit in creation, prophets, Christ, and the church).
 - Historical theology: trajectory from patristic to Reformed readings emphasizing continuity and corrections (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics).
 - Systematic construction: integrates the Spirit into Trinity, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, sacramentology, and eschatology.
 - Practical application: implications for worship, spiritual gifts, pastoral ministry, assurance, and mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture as primary authority; dialogues with Augustine, Calvin, Jonathan Edwards.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include Karl Barth, J. Moltmann, J. D. G. Dunn, and recent Pentecostal/charismatic theologians and evangelical systematicians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economy and immanent relations), Christology (Spirit and the person/office of Christ), pneumatology (personhood, procession, work), regeneration, sanctification, assurance, charismatic gifts, sacraments and Word, ecclesiology, and eschatology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Spirit, as He Who gives life, is the Trinitarian agent that unites believers to the saving work of the Son, renews creation toward consummation, and equips the church for faithful witness - an account grounded in Scripture and shaped by Reformed theological conviction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on a **Christocentric** and **Trinitarian** pneumatology: the Spirit always points to and effects union with Christ rather than operating as an independent locus of religious authority.
 - Attention to the Spirit as the giver of both present sanctifying life and future eschatological life.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against two extremes:
 - sensational, individualistic charismaticism that severs Spirit-work from Word, sacraments, and ecclesial norms;
 - reductionist, pietistic or rationalist accounts that minimize the Spirit's personal agency and charismatic gifting.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes language of **"life"** (bio/logos motifs) to frame pneumatological activity across creation, redemption, and consummation.
 - Reframes debates on gifts by anchoring charismatic phenomena within covenantal and sacramental structures.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminary courses as a clear, conservative pneumatology.
 - Received as a corrective voice in conversations between charismatics and cessationists; commended for historical breadth and pastoral clarity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to integrate biblical exegesis, historical theology, and systematic construction; valuable for pastors, seminarians, and scholars seeking a balanced, Trinitarian pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
