### TITLE
Deviant Calvinism (Oliver D. Crisp) - secondary treatment of Hugo Grotius and the governmental account of the atonement; focused on debates over **necessity** and **extent** of the atonement.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-Reformed conversation (early 21st century); Crisp seeks to widen the acceptable theological options within Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Engages historical alternatives (e.g., Grotius) as resources for modern atonement-model pluralism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The book challenges narrow definitions of "Calvinism" that exclude historical non-penal accounts (such as Grotius' governmental theory) and defends broadening the Reformed canon on atonement necessity and extent.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: dominant Reformed allegiance to penal substitution and particular redemption unduly narrows permissible atonement theories.
 - Historical-theological retrieval: presents Grotius as a coherent, theologically respectable alternative (governmental theory) with implications for extent and necessity.
 - Constructive proposal: argues that accommodating certain Grotius-like emphases (universal provision, Christ as public demonstration of divine justice) preserves core soteriological commitments while avoiding metaphysical puzzles about payment and double jeopardy.
 - Polemical engagement: responds to objections that governmentalism undermines propitiation, penal language, and the seriousness of sin.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Hugo Grotius (governmental theory).
 - Main Reformed interlocutors: defenders of classical penal substitution and limited atonement (e.g., traditional Calvinist systematicians), and later neo-Grotians or hypothetical universalists.
 - Secondary sources: patristic and scholastic treatments of satisfaction and penal models, contemporary analytic literature on necessity and metaphysics of atonement.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Atonement (central) - nature, necessity, and extent.
 - Christology (sufficiency of Christ's work as representative and demonstrative).
 - Divine justice and theodicy (relation of atonement to moral governance).
 - Soteriology more widely (application of redemption, election, and universal provision).
- **Closing line**
 - Crisp advances the thesis that a properly reformed theological horizon can accommodate Grotius-style governmental logic without abandoning core doctrines, reframing debates about the atonement's necessity and extent in service of doctrinal breadth and analytic clarity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats Grotius not as heterodox anomaly but as a systematic and defensible alternative that clarifies the conceptual space between unlimited universalism and strict particularism.
 - Emphasizes the **governing** role of divine justice (maintenance of moral order) rather than metaphysical penal satisfaction as the explanatory center of atonement.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges the presumption that penal substitution is the only coherent way to account for propitiation and expiation; argues that governmentalism can account for these while avoiding problematic metaphysics about transferred guilt/payment.
 - Contrasts with strict limited atonement by offering a model that allows universal provision without collapsing into indifferent universalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "necessity" of the atonement in pragmatic/governing terms: necessary for the vindication and demonstration of divine justice (and thus for moral governance), not necessarily as metaphysical payment required to satisfy infinite penalty.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked renewed engagement with pre-modern alternatives among analytic Reformed theologians; used as a stimulus to reconsider exclusionary boundaries of Reformed identity.
 - Met with resistance from defenders of classical penal substitution and particular redemption who see Crisp's widening as risking doctrinal dilution.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies conceptual options and consequences for atonement extent debates; valuable for teaching historical-theological alternatives and for training students to map disagreements without caricature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Governmental theory**
 - Grotius' account: Christ's death as a public demonstration upholding the moral order and deterring sin; substitutionary in representation but not in judicial payment sense.
- **Penal substitution**
 - Classical Reformed model: Christ suffers the penalty of sin as the legally required satisfaction of divine justice.
- **Necessity of the atonement**
 - Two readings: metaphysical necessity (must be paid) vs. moral/governing necessity (required to uphold divine justice and moral governance).
- **Extent of the atonement**
 - Particular (limited) vs. universal (provision vs. application); Crisp highlights models that separate provision (universal) from application (particular).
- **Propitiation**
 - Removal or turning away of divine wrath; Crisp shows both penal and governmental accounts claim to secure propitiation but differ in mechanism.
- **Satisfaction**
 - Satisfaction theory (Anselmian): Christ renders satisfaction to honor/justice; governmentalism reframes satisfaction as demonstration rather than literal payment.
- **Representative substitution**
 - Christ acting as representative of humanity; accepts representation but disputes the necessity of penalty-bearing in a payment sense.
- **Hypothetical universalism**
 - Variant allowing universal atonement in intent or provision but particular application by decree; Crisp situates Grotius-like views near this category.
- **Divine justice (retributive vs. governmental)**
 - Retributive: exact retributive payment; Governmental: maintenance of moral order and deterrence.
- **Application of redemption**
 - Distinction between the objective accomplishment (Christ's work) and subjective application (grace, election).
- **Moral demonstration**
 - Key Grotius/Crisp term: the atonement as demonstration of God's abhorrence of sin and commitment to moral law.
- **Double jeopardy objection**
 - Objection to penal substitution that Crisp uses to motivate non-penal options: problematic if Christ and the sinner both incur the same penalty.
- **Sufficiency vs. efficiency**
 - Sufficiency: Christ's death sufficient for many/all; Efficiency: for whom it is efficacious (elect only vs. potentially all).
- **Public vindication**
 - Idea that atonement publicly vindicates God's governance and discourages contempt for divine law.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in soteriology classrooms to open debate beyond penal-substitution-only paradigms.
- As a **polemic** against strict confessional readings that exclude governmental/hypothetical-universal options.
- As a **historical-theological resource** to retrieve Grotius sympathetically for contemporary discussions of atonement extent and necessity.
