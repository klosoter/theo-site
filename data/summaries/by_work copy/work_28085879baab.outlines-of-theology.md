### TITLE
Outlines of Theology - A. A. Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century American Reformed context (Princeton theology). Lectures and systematic sketches produced within the conservative, confessional Presbyterian milieu reacting to Arminian influence, revival excesses, rationalism, and emergent higher criticism. Pedagogical work aimed at seminary instruction and pastoral formation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To set forth a concise, coherent, confessional Reformed systematic theology that defends the sovereignty of God in creation, sin, and salvation - especially the doctrines of human sinfulness (total depravity) and the necessity of sovereign grace (total inability to save oneself).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Begins with authority of Scripture and the nature of theological method.
 - Treats God (existence, attributes, Trinity), providence, creation, angels.
 - Advances to anthropology and sin (original sin, total depravity), then Christology and atonement.
 - Proceeds through Ordo Salutis: vocation, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, perseverance.
 - Concludes with sacraments, church, and eschatology.
 - Method: exegetical appeal to Scripture + historical appeal to confessions (Westminster) + analytic theological definitions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary resources: Scripture and the Westminster standards.
 - Interlocutors: Calvin, the English and Scottish divines, contemporary Princeton figures (notably Charles Hodge), opponents in Arminianism, Pelagian tendencies, and Enlightenment-influenced skeptics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, God and Trinity, decrees and providence, creation, human nature and original sin, **total depravity**, **total inability**, Christology (atonement as substitutionary), redemption (effectual calling, regeneration), covenant theology, sacraments, church, and last things.
- **Closing line:** A compact, confessional defense of classical Reformed theology that centers on divine sovereignty in salvation and insists that human sinfulness requires sovereign, effectual grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precision in distinguishing **total depravity** (the pervasive corruption of human nature) from **total inability** (the consequent incapacity of the unregenerate to seek God).
 - Pedagogical clarity: outlines and definitions designed for classroom transmission rather than speculative system-building.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Arminian appeals to human ability by insisting inability is moral and principled, not merely circumstantial.
 - Opposes a sentimental or revivalist optimism about human religious capacity without divine regeneration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic rearticulation of classical terms in concise, accessible definitions for seminarians; sharper delineation of moral inability vs. physical inability and voluntary sin vs. necessitated guilt.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used in conservative Presbyterian and Reformed seminaries as a compact textbook and lecture aid.
 - Influential for late 19th- and early 20th-century American Calvinism; served as a bridge between older confessionalism and modern systematic manuals.
 - Criticized by liberal and some modern evangelical currents for rationalist method and lack of engagement with newer biblical criticism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary for teaching Reformed soteriology and the logic connecting human corruption to divine grace.
 - Durable as a concise reference for pastoral instruction, catechesis, and polemical clarity on sin and grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity:** Human nature totally affected by sin; every faculty corrupted such that no purely unregenerate act merits salvation.
- **Total Inability:** The unregenerate cannot, by their own power or will, come to God; salvation is impossible apart from divine intervention.
 - Contrast: moral inability (incapacity to do spiritual good) vs. physical inability (lack of physical power).
- **Original Sin:** Transmission of Adam's corrupt nature and guilt affecting all descendants.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam as representative; Christ as federal head of redeemed humanity - framework for culpability and covenantal remedy.
- **Regeneration:** Spirit-wrought quickening that precedes and enables saving faith; effectual and sovereign.
- **Effectual Calling:** A particular, efficacious divine summons that results in faith and repentance.
- **Compatibilist Free Will:** Human choices are real and morally responsible, yet under divine sovereignty and bondage of sin prior to regeneration.
- **Substitutionary Atonement:** Christ's death as penal substitution securing justification for the elect.
- **Sovereignty of God:** Divine control over salvation, providence, and human history; anchor for doctrines of grace.
- **Moral Ability vs. Natural Ability:** Distinguishes ethical capacity (can one rightly will God?) from bare physical or intellectual capacity.
- **Confessional Authority:** Reliance on Westminster standards as interpretive-loci for doctrines.
- **Sanctification & Perseverance:** Progressive renewal following regeneration grounded in divine preserving grace.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed soteriology (clear statement of terms like total depravity and inability).
 - As a **polemic tool** against Arminian and revivalist claims about unaided human ability to repent.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading texts on human will, depravity, and divine calling within a confessional framework.
 - As a **pedagogical pivot** in seminary courses to introduce students to classic Reformed systematic logic.
