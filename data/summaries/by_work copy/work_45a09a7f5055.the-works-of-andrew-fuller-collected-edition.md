### TITLE
The Works of Andrew Fuller (Collected Edition) - selected focus: **Good Works and Merit in the Covenant of Grace**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 18th to early 19th century; Particular Baptist / Evangelical Calvinist milieu in England.
 - Reaction to internal Baptist debates: hyper‑Calvinism (passive evangelism, denial of moral duties) and antinomian tendencies; also polemics with Arminian and Socinian views.
 - Fuller active as pastor, theologian, and missionary advocate (supporter of the Baptist Missionary Society), shaping practical as well as doctrinal priorities.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Good works are the necessary fruit and evidence of genuine faith within the **covenant of grace**, but they are not meritorious for justification; Christ alone secures righteousness. Good works have moral worth, are the believer's duty, and are grounds of divine reward, not of acceptance.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Biblical exegesis: sustained appeal to Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, Ephesians) balanced with pastoral texts (James, Hebrews) to show continuity between justification and sanctification.
 - Covenant theology: situates good works within the covenant of grace-obedience as covenantal duty and fruit rather than a parallel claim for merit.
 - Polemic moves:
 - Against hyper‑Calvinists: insists on moral obligations (preaching, prayer, duty of sinners to believe).
 - Against antinomians: defends necessity and moral value of obedience.
 - Against works‑righteousness/Arminian merit: denies that human works can procure justification.
 - Pastoral application: assurance, discipline, Christian holiness, and missionary zeal flow from a right understanding of works and merit.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed scholastic categories (imputation, merit), contemporary Baptists, and opponents in the wider evangelical world (Arminians, Socinians, hyper‑Calvinists).
 - Dialogues implicitly with Reformed authorities (Calvin/Lutheran categories) while addressing Baptist pastoral practice and missionary concerns.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (law and grace), justification by faith, imputation of Christ's righteousness, sanctification, assurance of faith, divine reward vs. human merit, the moral government of God.

- **Closing line**
 - Fuller's center of gravity: a balanced evangelical Calvinism-**good works are indispensable evidence and reward‑bearing fruit of salvation within the covenant of grace, yet never the ground of acceptance before God.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong covenantal framing: locates the ethical life within the covenant of grace rather than a revived law‑merit schema.
 - Pastoral moderation: robust concern for both the duty of sinners and the assurance of believers; practical as well as doctrinal emphasis.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects hyper‑Calvinist tendencies (which minimized duty and evangelistic obligation).
 - Opposes Arminian/works‑righteous positions that make works contributory to justification.
 - Refutes antinomian readings that separate faith from moral sanctification.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of merit/reward language: distinguishes Christ's congruent/condign merit from the believer's non‑meritorious but remunerable obedience.
 - Emphasizes the covenantal obligation to obey as intrinsic to faith, not an appended legal requirement.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among Particular Baptists and 19th‑century evangelicals; instrumental in legitimizing missionary zeal among Calvinists.
 - Used as a corrective model in later Reformed and Baptist discussions on assurance, duty, and evangelism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a pastoral theology that preserves doctrinal purity while energizing evangelistic and ethical life.
 - Serves as a compact demonstration of how covenant theology can mediate controversies over works and merit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace** - The framework within which salvation and obedience are related; good works are covenantal fruits, not grounds of acceptance.
- **Good Works** - Necessary fruits and evidences of faith; morally valuable and rewarded, but not meritorious for justification.
- **Merit** - Carefully qualified: Christ's merit is the ground of justification; human merit is denied as procuring acceptance.
 - **Condign merit** - Properly ascribed to Christ (strict, justice‑compatible merit).
 - **Congruent merit** - A nuanced Reformed phrase Fuller uses to explain reward without implying justification.
- **Justification** - By faith alone through imputation of Christ's righteousness; excludes human works as causes.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive renewal; the arena where good works have intrinsic worth and moral obligation.
- **Imputation** - Christ's righteousness imputed to the believer; central to denying human merit.
- **Reward** - Post‑justificatory divine recompense for obedience; distinguishes reward from acceptance.
- **Duty of Sinners** - Fuller's insistence that commands to repent and believe are real moral obligations, even for unregenerate hearers.
- **Assurance** - Grounded in covenant promises and observable fruit; assurance and duty are held in tension.
- **Evangelical Calvinism** - Fuller's blend of strict doctrines of grace with pastoral duty and missionary activism.
- **Antinomianism** - Rejected; Fuller defends moral obligation as essential to the Christian life.
- **Hyper‑Calvinism** - Corrected by Fuller's emphasis on obligation and mission.
- **Works‑Righteousness** - Rejected; Fuller counters any view that makes human obedience a ground of salvation.
- **Evidence of Faith** - Good works serve as confirmatory signs of genuine faith.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Particular Baptist evangelical Calvinism (clarifies terms like merit, covenant, reward).
 - As a **polemic** against hyper‑Calvinism, antinomianism, and works‑righteousness.
