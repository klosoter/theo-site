### TITLE
**A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte (1573)** 
Author: **Thomas Cartwright** 
Genre: Elizabethan polemical pamphlet on ecclesiology and polity; part of the 1570s Puritan controversy over church government.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published amid the Elizabethan settlement (post-1560s) when the Church of England's episcopal structure and liturgy were under Puritan critique. Cartwright was a leading Puritan academic advocating reform toward a Presbyterian model; John Whitgift represented the established episcopal apologetic. The pamphlet responds directly to Whitgift's defense of bishops and the existing order.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The church must be governed by scripturally warranted presbyteries (plural elderships and assemblies), not by bishops with hierarchical, monarchical jurisdiction. Episcopal office and its powers are unscriptural and injurious to true discipline and purity.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Scriptural warrant: appeals to New Testament practices (apostolic churches, plurality of elders, local assemblies) as normative for church order. 
 - Critique of episcopacy: argues bishops are medieval innovations, incompatible with Scripture and the early church's practice. 
 - On discipline and offices: defends ecclesiastical censures, communal oversight, and the distribution of ministry among elders and deacons. 
 - Limits of civil magistrate: contends against absolute lay or civil control of day-to-day church discipline and governance. 
 - Practical consequences: episcopacy centralizes power, weakens preaching and discipline, and promotes conformity over purity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary interlocutor: **John Whitgift** (later Archbishop), whose Answer defended bishops. Cartwright counters with Scripture, patristic citations selectively read, and Reformed precedents (Geneva, Calvinist practice) as exemplars. Occasional appeals to canonical and historical witnesses used to show episcopacy as a later development.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Ecclesiology** (nature and constitution of the church), **Church Government/Polity**, **Offices** (elders, ministers, deacons, bishops), **Discipline** (excommunication, censures), and secondary implications for **church-state relations**.
- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** 
 - The church's order must be restored to the New Testament model of shared eldership and accountable assemblies, because only that structure secures faithful preaching and disciplined holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on the plurality and parity of presbyteral elderships as normative; emphasis on local and regional assemblies (consistories/presbyteries/synods) as organic and necessary for discipline.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Direct polemic against Whitgift's appeal to tradition and royal prerogative; Cartwright reframes tradition as subordinate to explicit scriptural prescription and early church practice. Contrasts English episcopal centralization with Reformed consociational models.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Systematic transfer of Continental Presbyterian vocabulary into an English polemical context (e.g., "presbytery," "assembly," "eldership") and argument for their institutionalization in an episcopal polity environment.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Immediate effect: increased polarization; contributed to Cartwright's marginalization by ecclesiastical authorities but galvanized Puritan networks. Long-term: formative for English Presbyterian thought, influential on the polity of later Puritan emigrants (New England) and English dissenting traditions; served as a staple reference in debates over church governance.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Excellent case study in Elizabethan ecclesial controversy, clarifying how Reformed ecclesiology was argued against episcopacy; useful for courses on church polity, Puritan theology, and church-state relations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbytery:** local/regional governing assembly of elders; Cartwright advocates this as the proper aggregated unit of church authority. 
- **Eldership (presbyterate):** plurality of ministers and ruling elders exercising oversight; contrasted with singular hierarchical bishops. 
- **Episcopacy:** government by bishops; characterized as a post-apostolic innovation and the primary object of Cartwright's critique. 
- **Bishopric / Metropolitan:** offices whose jurisdictional claims Cartwright rejects as unscriptural centralization. 
- **Consistory:** local disciplinary court composed of ministers and elders; Cartwright uses the term/function to argue for organized discipline. 
- **Discipline (ecclesiastical):** exercise of censures, admonition, and excommunication administered by presbyteries; presented as essential to church purity. 
- **Ordination:** public setting apart by the church's elders rather than by hierarchical appointment; emphasis on communal validation of ministry. 
- **Congregational oversight:** the role of the gathered church and its elders in correcting sin and approving ministers; differs from lay-dominated or bishop-led models. 
- **Synod / Assembly:** broader judicatory for doctrine and practice beyond the local church; Cartwright contends for regular meetings of delegated presbyteries. 
- **Spiritual jurisdiction:** the church's internal authority in matters of doctrine and discipline, which Cartwright seeks to protect from secular interference. 
- **Parish system critique:** Cartwright critiques imposed parish/clerical structures that undermine ministerial plurality and discipline.
- **Scriptural normativity:** supremacy of New Testament patterns over later ecclesial customs.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **polemic** exemplar against episcopacy in historical-theology courses. 
 - As a **definition source** for early English Presbyterian polity in ecclesiology studies and sermons on church government. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** demonstrating the transfer of Continental Reformed polity vocabulary into English Puritanism and its later institutional legacies.
