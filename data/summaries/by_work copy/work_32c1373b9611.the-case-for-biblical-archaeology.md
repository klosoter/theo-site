### TITLE
The Case for Biblical Archaeology - John D. Currid

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th / early-21st century evangelical scholarship addressing rising biblical skepticism. Positioned within conservative, historically-oriented OT studies and popular apologetics; aimed at pastors, students, and informed laity seeking an accessible survey of archaeological data that bears on the Bible's reliability.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Archaeological discovery and scholarship provide substantive corroboration for the historical claims of the Bible and furnish context that clarifies difficult texts; archaeology strengthens confidence in Scripture without replacing sound exegesis.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Methodological preface: defines biblical archaeology, cautions against sensationalism and simplistic "proof-texting" of finds.
 - Survey of regions and periods: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Canaan, Iron Age Israel - presenting inscriptions, stratigraphy, material culture, and significant sites.
 - Case studies: names and places validated by inscriptions (e.g., Tel Dan, Mesha stela), daily-life parallels for cultic and legal customs, and synchronisms for chronology.
 - Polemical move: challenges to minimalists and skeptics by showing the cumulative force of archaeological corroboration for the Bible's historicity.
 - Theological payoff: archaeology as an aid to interpretation, not a rival to revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Positive interlocutors: mainstream archaeologists and epigraphers (Albrightian legacy), excavation reports, primary inscriptions.
 - Critics addressed implicitly or explicitly: biblical minimalists and radical-critical historians who argue for limited historical value of biblical narratives.
 - Scriptural text is treated as primary datum for interpretation; archaeology functions as confirming and illuminating evidence.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration (as foundation for trusting biblical narrative), historicity and covenant history; peripheral engagement with anthropological issues (human origins treated descriptively). Notably, the book does **not** attempt to resolve theological controversies such as **traducianism vs. creationism** - archaeological data is treated as insufficient to adjudicate soul-origin debates.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Archaeology, when cautiously and responsibly used, corroborates the Bible's historical claims and enriches biblical theology while leaving core doctrinal judgments to exegetical and theological methods.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Careful balance between apologetic utility and scholarly restraint: Currid emphasizes contextual reading of finds rather than grandiose "archaeology proves the Bible" slogans.
 - Strong use of inscriptions and onomastics to demonstrate the plausibility of biblical names, titles, and administrative practices.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against radical minimalism: demonstrates that archaeological synchronisms and epigraphic evidence complicate the minimalist rejection of Israelite history.
 - Counterpoint to overstated Evangelical apologetics: Currid avoids uncritical verificationism, urging methodological prudence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Advocacy for a working definition of biblical archaeology as interdisciplinary: combining stratigraphy, epigraphy, and literary exegesis rather than treating artifacts as stand-alone "proofs."
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries and by pastors as a reliable, readable introduction; regarded favorably within Reformed circles for its conservative epistemic posture.
 - Limited traction in critical academic circles that prioritize literary and sociological models over site-level corroboration.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a durable bridge text between archaeological scholarship and theological classrooms, modeling responsible use of material culture to inform exegesis and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical archaeology:** Interdisciplinary study linking material remains to the biblical text; Currid stresses it as auxiliary to exegesis rather than independent proof.
- **Historicity:** The historical reliability of biblical narratives; central evaluative category in Currid's argument.
- **Epigraphy / Inscriptions:** Stone and pottery texts used to corroborate names, titles, events (e.g., Tel Dan, Mesha stela).
- **Onomastics:** Study of names; used to show continuity between biblical anthroponymy and regional naming practices.
- **Stratigraphy:** Archaeological layering method; employed to establish chronological context for finds relevant to biblical periods.
- **Tel / Tell:** Excavated mound sites in the Levant; frequent loci for the book's case studies.
- **Synchronisms:** Cross-cultural chronological anchors (Egyptian, Mesopotamian) that help date Israelite contexts.
- **Minimalists vs. Maximalists:** Scholarly pole of contention about the Bible's historicity; Currid writes against minimalist reductionism while avoiding naïve maximalism.
- **Corroboration (cumulative case):** Emphasis on the cumulative weight of diverse finds rather than single "smoking gun" artifacts.
- **Exegesis and contextualization:** Use of material culture to illumine laws, cultic practices, and social institutions found in the text.
- **Revelation / Inspiration:** Theological presuppositions for taking the text seriously; archaeology supports but does not replace theological commitments.
- **Traducianism:** The doctrine that the soul is generated by parents; noted in this work as a theological question outside archaeology's decisive scope.
- **Creationism (soul origin):** The doctrine that each soul is created by God; likewise left to theological exegesis rather than archaeological settlement data.
- **Polemic use:** Currid's work is often cited to rebut biblical minimalism and to support courses on biblical reliability.
- **Exegetical model:** Employed as a model showing how archaeological data can clarify cultural background for biblical interpretation.
- **Conceptual pivot:** Used by teachers to pivot from historical corroboration to theological claims while acknowledging archaeology's limits (for questions like traducianism vs. creationism).
