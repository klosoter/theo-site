### TITLE
The Creation of Self: A Case for the Soul - Joshua R. Farris

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-theological interlocution: a 21st-century intervention addressing debates in philosophy of mind, Christian anthropology, and systematic theology.
 - Engages scientific findings in neuroscience and psychology while arguing from metaphysics and biblical-theological resources; aimed at both philosophers and theologians uneasy with reductive materialism.

- **Central thesis**
 - Human persons are properly understood as **created selves (souls)**: ontologically distinct centers of experience and agency that are not reducible to neural processes. God directly creates the soul (creationism), which grounds personal identity, moral responsibility, and eschatological continuity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of reductive physicalism
 - Considers scientific claims about brain correlates of consciousness but argues these do not entail metaphysical reduction or elimination of the self.
 - Targets contemporary eliminative and reductive accounts (Dennett-style, neuroscientific reductionism) for failing to account for first-person subjectivity, normative agency, and diachronic identity.
 - Metaphysical proposal
 - Articulates an account of the soul as a simple or noncomposite metaphysical subject (variously defended via substance or substance-like talk) that is neither Cartesian ghost nor mere emergent epiphenomenon.
 - Seeks middle ground between classical Cartesian dualism and reductive materialism, preserving intimate embodiment while insisting on real ontological distinction.
 - Biblical + historical-theological engagement
 - Reads key biblical passages and patristic/medieval tradition to show warrant for a created, incorruptible aspect of human nature.
 - Reconsiders historical options (traducianism vs. creationism) in light of philosophical concerns about identity and divine agency.
 - Practical and doctrinal consequences
 - Connects the soul-account to ethics (moral responsibility), soteriology (what is redeemed), and eschatology (resurrection and persistence of personhood).

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Contemporary philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists (representative physicalists and emergentists).
 - Historical theologians (Aquinas / Aristotelian hylomorphism, patristic insight) and various strands of Reformation debate.
 - Scriptural exegesis framed as corrective to philosophical excesses.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christian anthropology (soul, body, imago Dei), creation (creatio ex nihilo and creation of the soul), eschatology (resurrection, persistence), Christology insofar as incarnation informs the unity of person, and moral theology (agency and responsibility).

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically and philosophically, the work argues that a robust doctrine of a created soul is the most coherent way to safeguard personal identity, normative agency, and Christian hope against reductive materialist pressures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames the debate as "the creation of self" rather than merely "the existence of the soul," stressing divine origination and ongoing dependence of personal subjectivity.
 - Marries contemporary analytic metaphysics with classical theological concerns rather than retreating to purely doctrinal assertion.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Opposes both eliminative materialism (which denies a genuine self) and simplistic Cartesian dualism (which severs embodied unity).
 - Critiques emergentist accounts for failing to provide a non-derivative ontological ground for moral responsibility and persistence.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "self" as a theological-ontological term that names created subjecthood: distinct from folk uses of self and from purely psychological descriptions.
 - Uses creationist language to reconceptualize debates often framed as hylomorphic vs. dualist, offering an alternative taxonomy focused on divine generation of subjectivity.

- **Reception & influence**
 - Found traction among conservative and confessional theologians seeking resources against materialism; taken up in courses on theological anthropology.
 - Provoked critical engagement from materialist philosophers and some renewal theologians favoring narrative- or relational-centered anthropology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a modern, philosophically-informed defense of classical soul-claims; useful pedagogically for showing how metaphysics, biblical exegesis, and doctrine can interact.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Soul / self**
 - The created ontological subject that grounds first-person experience, agency, and personal identity; not a mere function of brain states.
- **Creationism (of souls)**
 - The doctrine that God directly creates each soul at or near beginning of life; used to vindicate divine authorship of personal subjectivity.
- **Traducianism**
 - The rival view that souls are generated via parental transmission; treated as historically important but philosophically problematic for continuity of personhood in Farris's assessment.
- **Reductive physicalism**
 - The metaphysical view reducing mental states to neurophysiological states; critiqued for explanatory insufficiency regarding subjectivity and normativity.
- **Eliminative materialism**
 - The stronger contention that folk-psychological selves do not exist; opposed as incompatible with moral responsibility.
- **Emergentism**
 - The account that personhood emerges from complex biological organization; engaged and criticized for failing to secure non-derivative agency.
- **Hylomorphism**
 - Aristotelian framework (form-matter) discussed as auxiliary resource; Farris draws selectively but emphasizes created subject over simply formalist accounts.
- **Substance (mental/immaterial)**
 - Metaphysical category used to mark the soul as a bearer of properties; defended in a qualified way to avoid Cartesian isolation.
- **First-person subjectivity**
 - The irreducible inner perspective that serves as a core datum motivating the soul thesis.
- **Personal identity / diachronic continuity**
 - The problem of what makes a person the same over time; the soul-account is offered as the most direct solution.
- **Moral agency / responsibility**
 - Ethical implications: a created self secures genuine agency and blameworthiness/praiseworthiness.
- **Resurrection / eschatological hope**
 - Theology of afterlife tied to persistence of self; the soul provides the locus of eschatological continuity.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Grounding anthropological dignity; used to argue for ontological depth to human persons beyond biological systems.
- **Incarnation (Christology)**
 - Invoked as a theological model for unity of body and distinct personhood; supports the possibility of united embodied souls.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional resource** for a creationist model of personal ontology in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductive physicalism in philosophy of religion and ethics.
 - As an **exegetical-conceptual model** for reconciling biblical anthropology with contemporary metaphysics.
