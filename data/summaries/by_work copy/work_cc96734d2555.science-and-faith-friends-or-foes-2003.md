### TITLE
Science and Faith: Friends or Foes? (2003) - C. John Collins

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2003 amid renewed evangelical engagement with evolution, intelligent design, and debates over Genesis; Collins writes as an evangelical Old Testament scholar seeking a middle way between Young-Earth Creationism and uncritical theistic evolution.
 - Theological milieu: conservative Protestant commitment to biblical authority and inerrancy, coupled with openness to disciplined scientific method.

- **Central thesis**
 - Science and historic Christian faith need not be enemies; conflict arises from category mistakes (reading science as scripture or scripture as science). A careful hermeneutic and epistemological clarity reconcile credible science with theological commitments.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguish domains: the *scope* and *method* of empirical science (methodological naturalism) vs. the *scope* and *purpose* of biblical revelation (theological, covenantal, and moral truths).
 - Analyze Genesis 1-11 as theological narrative/genre rather than scientific textbook; interpret creation texts with attention to literary form and authorial intent.
 - Evaluate specific scientific claims (evolutionary biology, age of universe) for their metaphysical vs. methodological import; accept methodological naturalism without conceding metaphysical naturalism.
 - Offer pastoral and apologetic strategies: honesty about scientific evidence, humility on unsettled questions, insistence on theological non-negotiables (e.g., God as Creator, the reality of the Fall).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Young-Earth Creationist literature (e.g., Whitcomb & Morris), popular theistic-evolution proponents, philosophers of science (issues surrounding methodological naturalism), and evangelical exegetes addressing Genesis.
 - Draws on biblical scholarship for genre and hermeneutics and on contemporary science reporting for empirical challenges.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inerrancy (reframed with genre sensitivity).
 - Creation and providence.
 - The Fall, original sin, and the imago Dei.
 - Indirectly touches covenant theology through implications of Adam as representative.

- **Treatment of the three specified topics**
 - **Historicity and federal headship of Adam:** Collins defends the theological necessity of Adam as a historical representative (federal head) for key doctrines (original sin, covenant), while urging careful engagement with genetics and population biology rather than naïve literalism.
 - **Days of Creation:** He argues against naive concordism (forcing 24-hour days onto Genesis) and favors readings that respect literary genre (e.g., analogical or framework readings) while retaining Creator-centered ontology.
 - **Science and Scripture (Genesis 1-11):** Presents Genesis 1-11 as theologically saturated narrative that communicates covenantal and creational truths without making detailed scientific claims; recommends exegetical humility and methodological clarity.

- **Closing line**
 - Collins's center of gravity: defend core theological claims (Creator, Fall, covenantal frameworks) while permitting legitimate scientific conclusions, achieved by disciplined hermeneutics and a refusal to conflate scientific method with metaphysical naturalism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp insistence on *genre-sensitive* interpretation of Genesis combined with evangelical fidelity to theological doctrines such as the imago Dei and original sin.
 - Clear demarcation between methodological naturalism (scientific practice) and metaphysical naturalism (worldview).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Young-Earth Creationist concordism that reads Genesis as scientific reportage.
 - Also challenges overly accommodationist theistic evolutionists who evacuate theological distinctives (e.g., Adam as federal head).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - While not inventing new terms, Collins advances practical language for negotiating "scope" and "levels of description" between biblical theology and empirical science-useful heuristics for pastors and scholars.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received among moderate evangelicals and Reformed seminarians as a measured resource; influential in curricula addressing science-faith integration.
 - Criticized by strict YEC proponents and by some evolutionary naturalists for maintaining theological non-negotiables.

- **Enduring value**
 - A model of disciplined evangelical engagement: combines exegetical care, theological conviction, and scientific literacy; valuable for teaching, pastoral counseling, and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Methodological naturalism** - science's rulebook: seek natural explanations; Collins defends using it without converting it into metaphysical naturalism.
- **Metaphysical naturalism** - worldview that denies supernatural reality; Collins warns against conflating this with scientific method.
- **Concordism** - attempt to align scripture line-by-line with current science; Collins critiques naive forms of this approach.
- **Conflict thesis** - idea that science and religion are inherently opposed; Collins rejects this as historically and philosophically simplistic.
- **Genre-sensitive hermeneutic** - interpretive approach that reads Genesis according to literary form and intent rather than modern scientific categories.
- **Framework/analogical days** - interpretive options Collins treats sympathetically for Genesis 1's "days" while guarding theological content.
- **Historicity of Adam** - Collins affirms the need for a historical Adam for doctrines like original sin but calls for nuanced interaction with genetics/population evidence.
- **Federal headship** - theological category (Adam as representative) that Collins treats as doctrinally central and non-negotiable.
- **Imago Dei** - foundational anthropological doctrine retained as the biblical center regardless of cosmological models.
- **Scope of Scripture** - concept emphasizing the Bible's theological aims rather than scientific exposition.
- **Inerrancy (reframed)** - Collins defends inerrancy while insisting it must be read through genre and authorial intent.
- **Levels of description** - heuristic to distinguish theological description from scientific description.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical non-concordist approaches to Genesis and the "scope" distinction between science and Scripture.
- As a **polemic** against rigid Young-Earth Creationism and against simplistic accommodation to naturalistic explanations.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-11 that preserves theological orthodoxy while engaging scientific data.
