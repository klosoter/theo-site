### TITLE
**Christian Apologetics** (1976), Cornelius Van Til - a mature Westminster synthesis of presuppositional, Trinitarian, covenantal apologetics aimed at grounding knowledge, ethics, and history in the self-attesting God of Scripture.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context:** Late 20th-century Reformed theology at Westminster Theological Seminary; post-Kuyper/Bavinck neo-Calvinism; responding to modern philosophy (Hume, Kant, idealism), neo-orthodoxy (Barth/Brunner), and evangelical evidentialism/classical theism (Aquinas, Butler, Warfield as read by evidentialists).
- **Central thesis:** Only Christian theism, grounded in the self-attesting Triune God revealed in Scripture, provides the preconditions for intelligibility; apologetics must be presuppositional, exposing the impossibility of the contrary rather than conceding neutrality.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Start from the **Creator-creature distinction** and **analogical knowledge**: God is absolute, we are dependent interpreters.
 - Establish **revelation** (general and special) as the authoritative source and environment of all knowledge; Scripture is self-authenticating.
 - Deploy the **transcendental argument**: show that logic, science, morality, persons, and history presuppose the Triune God.
 - Critique rival epistemologies as oscillating between **rationalism** (autonomous universals) and **irrationalism** (brute particulars).
 - Articulate the **antithesis** (noetic effects of sin) and the **point of contact** (image of God, common grace, suppressed knowledge, Rom 1).
 - Affirm the **Holy Spirit** as the decisive apologist who grants repentance and epistemic renewal.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Calvin (sensus divinitatis), Augustine, Aquinas and Thomism (criticized), Butler, Warfield (cherished yet corrected), Kuyper, Bavinck, Dooyeweerd/Vollenhoven (allies), Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Barth, Brunner, Gordon Clark (analogical vs univocal knowledge).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (self-attestation, inerrancy), Trinity (equal ultimacy of one and many), creation and providence (no brute facts), anthropology (imago Dei, noetic effects), sin and common grace, Christology (mediator of knowledge and redemption), soteriology (regeneration as epistemic renewal), ecclesiology (churchs witness), pneumatology (illumination), eschatology (teleology of history under Christs lordship).
- **Closing line:** The Triune God of Scripture is both the epistemic starting point and the redemptive end; apologetics is obedient reasoning under Christs lordship, proving by the impossibility of the contrary.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** 
 - **No neutrality;** all thought is covenantal and ethically charged.
 - **Self-attesting Scripture** as ultimate authority; unavoidable ultimate circularity is virtuous when grounded in Gods revelation.
 - **Transcendental method**: preconditions of intelligibility; denial of **brute facts.**
 - **Trinitarian solution** to the one-and-many problem; equal ultimacy of unity and diversity.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against **Thomistic natural theology** and **evidentialism**: rejects autonomous probabilism and neutral facts.
 - Against **neo-orthodoxy**: revelation is not dialectical encounter apart from propositional truth.
 - Against **rationalism/univocism** (e.g., Clark): insists on **analogical** creaturely knowledge.
- **Conceptual innovations:** **Antithesis** and **point of contact** held together; **impossibility of the contrary**; **epistemological self-consciousness**; the **Christian theistic proof** (transcendental rather than cumulative-probabilistic).
- **Reception / influence:** Canonical in Reformed apologetics; developed by Bahnsen, Frame, Oliphint; debated by classical apologists (Sproul, Geisler) and analytic theists; shaped evangelical discussions on method, Scripture, and culture.
- **Enduring value:** Integrates apologetics with Theology Proper and Bibliology; safeguards doctrinal integrity in method; equips the church to reason missionally with confidence and humility under the Spirit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism:** Method starting from the authority of Gods revelation rather than autonomous reason.
- **Transcendental argument:** Shows that the possibility of knowledge, logic, and ethics presupposes the God of Scripture.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture:** The Bible bears divine authority intrinsically; Spirit authenticates to the believer.
- **Creator-creature distinction:** Absolute ontological gap; our knowledge is dependent and analogical.
- **Analogical knowledge:** True yet non-univocal correspondence to Gods knowledge.
- **Antithesis:** Ethical-epistemic opposition between belief and unbelief due to sin.
- **Point of contact:** Image of God, general revelation, and common grace enabling engagement without conceding neutrality.
- **Noetic effects of sin:** Cognitive corruption that suppresses truth (Rom 1).
- **Impossibility of the contrary:** Strategy of reductio; rival worldviews self-destruct.
- **Brute facts (denied):** Facts are always God-interpreted and covenantally situated.
- **Equal ultimacy of one and many:** Trinitarian ground for unity/diversity in reality and knowledge.
- **Common grace:** Preserves shared rational life; explains partial agreement without surrendering antithesis.
- **Christian theistic proof:** Van Til's name for a transcendental, not merely evidential, argument.
- **Epistemological self-consciousness:** The mature recognition of ones presuppositions under Christs lordship.
- **Autonomy (rejected):** Pretended independence of human reason from God.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** Normative account of self-attesting, inerrant Scripture and interpretive authority.
 - **Theology Proper:** Trinitarian metaphysic as precondition for intelligibility; one-and-many.
 - **Soteriology/Pneumatology:** Regeneration and the Spirits illumination as the ground of saving knowledge.
 - **Ecclesiology/Eschatology:** Shapes corporate witness and frames history as teleological under Christ, resisting secular historicisms.
