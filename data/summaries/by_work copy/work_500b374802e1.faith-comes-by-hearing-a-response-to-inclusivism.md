### TITLE
Faith Comes by Hearing: A Response to Inclusivism - Christopher W. Morgan & Robert A. Peterson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century, evangelical-Reformed response to renewed theological interest in inclusivism and religious pluralism.
 - Written amid debates sparked by Roman Catholic and liberal Protestant formulations (e.g., Rahnerian "anonymous Christians," pluralist proposals) and by some evangelical attempts to reconcile God's love with apparent non-believer salvation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel must be heard for saving faith to arise; inclusivist proposals that posit salvific value apart from explicit faith in Christ are biblically and theologically defective.
 - The problem addressed: can God save apart from explicit Christ-faith, and on what biblical/theological basis do we deny or allow such a possibility?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical insistence on texts that tie salvation to hearing/receiving the proclaimed Christ (esp. Romans 10:14-17; John 14; Acts passages; Matthew 28).
 - Theological dismantling of inclusivist constructs:
 - Critique of "anonymous Christian" and similar constructs as non-biblical theological inventions.
 - Defense of the necessity of special revelation and the normative role of the church/gospel proclamation.
 - Pastoral and missiological implications: inclusivism undermines missionary urgency and distorts biblical evangelism.
 - Systematic integration: soteriology (necessity of faith/repentance), revelation (primacy of special revelation), and ecclesiology (mission and proclamation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Major interlocutors: inclusivist and pluralist voices broadly (e.g., Rahnerian proposals, John Hick-style pluralism), contemporary evangelical pluralists/inclusivists.
 - Uses canonical exegesis, classical Reformation theology (Scripture-alone emphases), and appeals to confessional Reformed categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs special), soteriology (faith, justification, necessity of Christ), Christology (uniqueness of Christ as Savior), missiology (mandate to preach), ecclesiology (means of grace as proclamation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The theological center: salvation is mediated through the proclaimed Christ; true faith arises from hearing the gospel, and inclusivist deviations threaten biblical fidelity and missionary life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, repeated appeal to Romans 10:14-17 as theological hinge: "faith comes by hearing" functions both exegetically and programmatically.
 - Integration of rigorous biblical exegesis with pastoral concern for mission urgency.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Rahner-like and pluralist moves by insisting they read theology into the text rather than let the text define salvific economy.
 - Contrasts with more tentative evangelical inclusivists by refusing to accommodate implicit faith models that disconnect salvation from explicit Christ-centered proclamation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the distinction between "implicit" and "explicit" faith and places normative weight on explicit, gospel-mediated faith.
 - Recasts "exclusivism" not as narrow parochialism but as a biblically mandated commitment to Christ's unique salvific role.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a concise polemic against inclusivism; used in seminary courses on soteriology and missions.
 - Cited in broader evangelical discussions as a clear, biblically grounded corrective to theological pluralism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a compact model of how to marry exegesis and systematic concern for mission; enduring as a teaching and polemical resource defending the necessity of proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inclusivism**
 - The view that Christ's atonement saves beyond explicit Christian confession; often allows salvific response to general revelation.
- **Exclusivism (biblical form)**
 - The claim that salvation is in Christ alone and normally requires explicit faith produced by hearing the gospel.
- **Anonymous Christian**
 - Rahnerian category critiqued as non-biblical and theologically problematic.
- **Special revelation**
 - The propositional, redemptive revelation centered in Christ and Scripture emphasized as decisive for salvation.
- **General revelation**
 - Natural knowledge of God; acknowledged as insufficient for salvific faith without the gospel.
- **Hearing / Proclamation (Romans 10:14-17)**
 - Central soteriological mechanism: faith is causally linked to hearing the gospel through preaching.
- **Explicit vs implicit faith**
 - Explicit: conscious, articulated trust in Christ arising from hearing the gospel.
 - Implicit: unspecified trust or response not tied to gospel hearing - treated skeptically.
- **Mission / Evangelism imperative**
 - The theological and pastoral corollary: inclusivism weakens mission; the book insists proclamation remains essential.
- **Atonement scope**
 - Treated in relation to who benefits from Christ's work; the authors defend a Christ-centered, textually grounded understanding that resists speculative widening.
- **Revelation-soteriology nexus**
 - Key motif: revelation (gospel) is the ordained instrument by which saving faith comes.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitional resource for evangelicals clarifying "inclusivism" and "exclusivism."
 - As a polemical/textual model in missiology and soteriology courses to argue for the necessity of proclamation.
 - As an exegetical template around Romans 9-10 for teaching on faith, hearing, and mission.
