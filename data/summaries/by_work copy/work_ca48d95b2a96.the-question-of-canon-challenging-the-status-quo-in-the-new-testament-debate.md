### TITLE
The Question of Canon: Challenging the Status Quo in the New Testament Debate - Michael J. Kruger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century within an evangelical-Reformed apologetic milieu responding to a wave of critical scholarship that emphasizes contingency and late fixation of the New Testament canon.
 - Engages both popular skeptical critique (e.g., Bart Ehrman) and specialized academic literature that treats canon as a sociological product.
- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament canon is not a late, arbitrary ecclesiastical invention but the product of early, recognizable apostolic authority and communal reception; traditional criteria (apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, and reception) reliably explain canonical formation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: recent scholarly "status quo" privileges contingency, social construction, and late fixation models that undercut claims of early apostolic attestation.
 - Historical case: marshals patristic evidence, early canonical lists (e.g., Muratorian fragment), and the pattern of citation/use among early churches to show broad, early agreement about core books.
 - Theological defense: argues for the coherence of apostolicity as a theological criterion - Scripture's authority is grounded in apostolic witness and divine endorsement.
 - Methodological insistence: combines historical evidence with theological commitments; rejects methodological naturalism that excludes theological explanations a priori.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Directly engages contemporary critical voices who emphasize contingency (popularly represented by Ehrman) and academic proponents of social-memory/sociological models.
 - Uses patristic authors (Irenaeus, Clement, Tertullian, Origen), canonical lists, and manuscript citation patterns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (how apostolic witness functions as divine revelation).
 - Ecclesiology (role of the church in reception and recognition).
 - Authority and apostolicity (criteria for canonicity).
 - Brief interface with Christology and orthodoxy insofar as "orthodox content" is a canonical marker.
- **Closing line**
 - Kruger insists the question of canon is ultimately both historical and theological: the New Testament canon coheres around apostolic witness and early ecclesial recognition, sustaining confident claims about Scripture's normative authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of theological conviction with historical methodology - treats theological claims (apostolicity, inspiration) as legitimate explanatory factors in historical reconstruction.
 - Emphasis on *reception history* as decisive: canonical books are those the church recognized because they embodied apostolic witness.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against narratives that reduce canon formation to power politics or late ecclesiastical imposition.
 - Challenges scholarship that treats canon as wholly contingent by restoring the explanatory weight of apostolic origin and early widespread attestation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refinement of "reception" and "recognition" language to underscore a two-way relation: texts manifest apostolic authority, communities recognize it.
 - Clear delineation between "fixation" (when a closed list is formalized) and "recognition" (prior widespread consensus).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among evangelical and Reformed scholars and seminarians as a contemporary apologetic and teaching resource.
 - Criticized in some critical circles for privileging theological categories and for underestimating sociological dynamics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, historically informed defense of traditional canonicity useful for church instruction, apologetics, and seminary curricula.
 - Models a way to do historically responsible theology without conceding theological commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon**
 - The collection of books recognized as Scripture; Kruger defends early recognition rather than late invention.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Central criterion: connection to the apostles (direct authorship, eyewitness testimony, or apostolic endorsement).
- **Reception (ecclesial reception)**
 - The process by which communities recognize a text's authority; for Kruger, decisive evidence for canonicity.
- **Fixation**
 - The moment a closed list becomes normative; may come after widespread recognition.
- **Muratorian Fragment**
 - Early canonical list Kruger uses as evidence for early core agreement.
- **Patristic attestation**
 - Citations and use by church fathers demonstrating early acceptance and authoritative use.
- **Rule of Faith**
 - Early summary of apostolic teaching by which writings were judged; a proxy for orthodoxy and apostolic conformity.
- **Orthodoxy**
 - Conformity to apostolic teaching; used as a filter for assessing texts.
- **Self-authentication (of Scripture)**
 - The idea that apostolic witness in the text bears its own authority; Kruger treats this as compatible with historical recognition.
- **Contingency (in canon studies)**
 - The thesis Kruger opposes: that canon formation was accidental or purely sociological.
- **Marcion**
 - Example of heretical pressure that prompted clearer recognition of orthodox writings.
- **Citation pattern / textual tradition**
 - Empirical data Kruger uses to map early use and acceptance.
- **Sociological models**
 - Approaches Kruger critiques when they exclude theological explanation.
- **Reception history**
 - Methodological emphasis on how texts functioned in communities over time.
- **Criteria of canonicity**
 - Short list: apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity (widespread use), and reception.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for conservative/scholarly definitions of canon and canonicity criteria.
 - As a **polemic** against skeptical and sociological accounts that deny early apostolic consensus.
 - As a **pedagogical/ exegetical model** for integrating patristic and textual data in canonical theology.
