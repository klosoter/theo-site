### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation** - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th c. Dutch Neo-Calvinism (Kuyperian milieu); first ed. 1901, revised ed. 1911; English trans. 2008.
 - Engages modern theology (Kant, Schleiermacher, Ritschl), Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, Anabaptism, Pietism, and revivalism while retrieving classic Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The **Holy Spirit** applies the once-for-all work of Christ to form the **church** as the firstfruits of the **new creation**, integrating ordo salutis with historia salutis and nature with grace unto cosmic consummation in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Pneumatology**: Person and work of the Spirit; revelation and inspiration presupposed; Spirit as bond uniting believers to Christ.
 - **Union with Christ and ordo salutis**: Calling, regeneration, conversion, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance; forensic and renovative graces held together in the duplex gratia.
 - **Ecclesiology**:
 - Nature and attributes; **one, holy, catholic, apostolic**; visible/invisible distinction; marks (pure Word, right sacraments, discipline).
 - **Church and kingdom**; **church as organism and as institute**; catholicity across time and space.
 - **Offices and polity**: minister, elder, deacon; discipline; mission.
 - **Means of grace**: preaching as primary; sacraments as Word made visible.
 - **Sacraments**:
 - **Baptism**: sign and seal of the covenant of grace; inclusion of children; efficacy tied to promise, not ex opere operato.
 - **Lord s Supper**: real spiritual presence; communion with the risen Christ by the Spirit; rejection of both transubstantiation and bare memorialism.
 - **Eschatology**:
 - Death and intermediate state; return of Christ, resurrection, judgment.
 - Critique of chiliasm; no earthly interim theocracy; **new heavens and new earth** as consummation.
 - Continuity-in-discontinuity of creation and redemption; beatific vision in a renewed cosmos.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture read canonically; Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin; Reformed scholastics (e.g., Turretin, Voetius); Kuyper; engagement with Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Anabaptists, Arminians, Pietists, modern liberals, and chiliasts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (Spirit), revelation and means of grace, covenant of grace and new covenant, union with Christ, justification and sanctification, church and sacraments, offices and discipline, mission, last things.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **The Spirit unites to Christ, gathers and sanctifies the church, and renews creation to the glory of the triune God.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Organic motif**: creation-fall-redemption-consummation as one divine work; church as seed of new humanity.
 - **Integration**: ordo salutis within historia salutis; forensic and renewal inseparable in Christ.
 - **Church/kingdom** distinction without separation; church as instrument and firstfruits of the kingdom.
 - **Covenantal catholicity**: inclusion of believers and their children; unity across ages and cultures.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against Roman **ex opere operato** and transubstantiation; against Lutheran ubiquity; against Anabaptist memorialism.
 - Against Arminian synergism and perfectionism; critiques Pietist individualism and revivalist reduction of church and means.
 - Rejects chiliastic millennial schemes and liberal moralization of eschatology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Church as organism and institute**; robust use of **means of grace**; finely grained account of **unio mystica** within covenant.
 - Clarifies **common vs special grace** in relation to culture and ecclesial life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational in contemporary Reformed pneumatology, ecclesiology, sacramentology, and eschatology; widely used post-translation across confessional and evangelical settings.
- **Enduring value**
 - Balanced sacramental realism, pastoral clarity on ordo salutis and assurance, principled ecclesiology, and a rich, cosmic eschatology fitted for doctrine, preaching, and mission.
