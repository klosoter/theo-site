### TITLE
**The Coming of the Kingdom (Het Komst van het Koninkrijk)** - Herman Ridderbos 
Site use: focus on **Christ's Messianic Consciousness and Kingdom**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Dutch Reformed New Testament scholarship; post‑war engagement with historical Jesus research, form criticism, and existentialist/demythologizing trends (Bultmann, Schweitzer debates).
 - Ridderbos writes from a confessional Reformed perspective with strong OT-NT biblical‑theological method.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus possessed a genuine messianic and eschatological self‑consciousness: the "coming of the kingdom" is the decisive eschatological event inaugurated in Jesus' person and work, combining present reign and future consummation.
 - Problem addressed: how to account historically and theologically for Jesus' claims (or self‑understanding) as Messiah without collapsing into purely apocalyptic imminence or mere social/ethical reinterpretation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical‑exegetical demonstration that Jesus spoke and acted as one who realized the eschatological promises of Israel.
 - The kingdom as both a present, decisive inbreaking of God's rule and a future consummation (inaugurated eschatology).
 - Emphasis on covenantal continuity: Jesus fulfills OT messianic expectations (prophetic, priestly, kingly motifs) while reconfiguring their temporal horizon.
 - Distinguishes between Jesus' eschatological expectation of final judgment/parousia and the concrete, realized elements of the kingdom present in his word and deeds.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Synoptic Gospels (primarily), Old Testament prophetic texts, and patristic/early church christology.
 - Interacts with Schweitzer (apocalyptic/eschatological reconstruction), Bultmann (demythologizing), and liberal Jesus-scholarship that downplays messianic self‑consciousness.
 - Dialogues implicitly with Reformed traditions and theologians emphasizing covenantal fulfillment.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (messianic consciousness; offices of Christ), eschatology (inauguration vs consummation), revelation (fulfillment of OT promises), kingdom theology, covenant theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Ridderbos centers the Christian proclamation on Jesus as the eschatological coming of God's kingdom: a historic, covenantal arrival that inaugurates God's reign now while still pointing to the completed eschaton.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly argues for a balanced **inaugurated eschatology**: Jesus' work is both present rule and future hope, not mere imminence nor merely symbolic.
 - Treats messianic consciousness as historically attestable and theologically normative for Christology.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects Schweitzer's portrayal of Jesus as purely apocalyptic Esperantist by showing a nuanced, covenantal expectation rather than naïve imminence.
 - Pushes back against Bultmannian reductionism that strips Jesus' speech of eschatological historicity; affirms the real historical foundation of Jesus' messianic claims.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the meaning of "coming" (komst) as an event centered in the person of Jesus - both realized and expectant - rather than a mere future occurrence.
 - Refines "messianic consciousness" as a historically grounded self‑awareness shaped by OT covenantal promise.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and continental biblical theology; contributed to formation of late‑20th‑century inaugurated eschatology debates.
 - Used widely in seminary exegesis and in discussions of the historical Jesus within confessional contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust model for integrating historical Jesus research with confessional Christology and covenant theology - valuable for preaching, systematics, and NT theology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven**
 - Central event: God's reign now present in Jesus' ministry and to be consummated in the future.

- **Coming (Komst)**
 - Event-category: the arrival of divine rule embodied in Christ; both inaugurated and eschatologically oriented.

- **Messianic consciousness**
 - Jesus' self‑understanding as the one who fulfills Israel's messianic hope; historically real and theologically decisive.

- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The thesis that eschatological realities are already present in Jesus, yet await final fulfillment.

- **Son of Man**
 - Key self‑designation expressing both servant/suffering and eschatological judge roles; central to Ridderbos' reading of Jesus' self‑awareness.

- **Fulfillment (vulling / vervulling)**
 - OT promises realized in Christ; covenantal continuity rather than abrupt rupture.

- **Eschaton / Consummation**
 - The future completion of God's kingdom distinct from its present inauguration.

- **Prophetic / Priestly / Kingly motifs**
 - Offices combined in Jesus' messianic role; Ridderbos stresses unity of function in kingdom arrival.

- **Signs and wonders**
 - Empirical indicators of kingdom presence - exorcisms, healings as kingdom‑signs rather than mere parables.

- **Parousia**
 - Future aspect of the coming; to be held in tension with present reign.

- **Apocalyptic expectation**
 - Ridderbos acknowledges apocalyptic elements in Jesus but reframes them within covenantal fulfillment, not mere world‑endism.

- **Covenant‑fulfillment hermeneutic**
 - Interprets Jesus' words and acts as fulfillment of Israel's covenantal promises.

- **Historical‑theological method**
 - Combines careful exegesis with doctrinal synthesis; resists purely literary or existential reductions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Jesus' sayings and deeds as historically eschatological and covenantal.
 - As a **polemic** against both radical apocalyptic readings and demythologizing secularizations of Jesus.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology for articulating inaugurated eschatology and Christ's messianic offices.
