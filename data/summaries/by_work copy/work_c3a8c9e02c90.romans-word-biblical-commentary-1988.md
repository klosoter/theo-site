### TITLE
Romans (Word Biblical Commentary, 1988) - James D. G. Dunn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 1980s, emergence and consolidation of the New Perspective on Paul. Dunn integrates Second Temple Jewish sources and challenges Lutheran-Reformed readings of Paul.
 - WBC format: detailed exegesis, textual notes, form and structure, explanation, and bibliography.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Romans unfolds how **Gods righteousness** is revealed in Messiah Jesus to create a single, Spirit-indwelt, Jew-Gentile people. Justification is a status of covenant membership, not a transfer of moral substance.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - 1:18-3:20: Universal sin under the power of Sin; Law diagnoses but cannot liberate.
 - 3:21-4:25: Justification by faith apart from works of the law; Abraham as father of a multiethnic family defined by faith.
 - 5:1-8:39: New realm in Christ and the Spirit; from Adamic solidarity to Messianic life; baptismal incorporation; Spirit-empowered fulfillment of the law.
 - 9-11: Gods faithfulness to Israel and the mystery of Gentile inclusion.
 - 12-16: Embodied ethics of the new community; mutual welcome as the practical outworking of the gospel.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - E. P. Sanders, K. Stendahl, E. Kasemann, C. E. B. Cranfield; Qumran and broader Second Temple literature; classic Protestant interpreters (Luther, Calvin) as foils.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Justification**, sin and law, covenant and election, **pneumatology** and sanctification, ecclesiology, Christology, eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Gods covenant faithfulness in Christ, realized by the Spirit, creates one reconciled family in which the law is fulfilled by love.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Works of the law** as ethnic boundary markers; justification defines covenant membership apart from such markers.
 - **Dikaiosyne theou** as Gods covenant faithfulness rather than an infused or transferred habit of righteousness.
 - **Participation via Spirit and baptism** over against metaphysical union language; concrete incorporation into the Christ-people.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - **Imputation critique:** rejects the notion of Christs righteousness being imputed as a transferable substance; reads logizomai as reckoning faith unto status, not transferring moral capital (Dunn, Romans WBC 38A, on Rom 4:1-8).
 - **Sanctification as realm-transfer:** from Adam to Christ; life in the Spirit rather than moralism.
 - **Law-fulfillment:** ethical life arises from the Spirit, not Torah observance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the **boundary markers** lens; frames justification as **membership declaration**; links **Abrahamic promise** to Gentile inclusion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed NPP debates; warmly received in many evangelical and ecumenical circles for Jewish-context exegesis; critically engaged by Reformed interlocutors wary of de-centering imputation and individual guilt.
- **Enduring value**
 - A gold-standard exegetical resource on Romans; model for reading Paul within Judaism; rich on Spirit, baptism, and ecclesial implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Righteousness of God**: Gods covenant fidelity savingly revealed in the gospel; grounds justification and Israel-Gentile unity.
- **Justification**: Forensic declaration of right standing and community membership; not moral infusion or substance transfer.
- **Imputation**: Dunn critiques the transfer model; emphasizes **reckoning** of faith as righteousness in covenantal terms.
- **Logizomai**: Accounting language in Rom 4; signals status reckoning tied to faith and promise, not merit.
- **Works of the law**: Ethnic boundary practices marking Jewish identity; cannot define the covenant people post-Christ.
- **Faith of/in Christ**: Faith in Christ as the human response that aligns with Gods saving action in Christ.
- **Participation in Christ**: Corporate incorporation into the Christ-realm; explicated through baptismal union (Dunn, Romans WBC 38A, on Rom 6:1-11).
- **Baptism into Christ**: Rite of transfer from Adamic realm to Christs life; ethical implications flow from new identity.
- **Flesh vs Spirit**: Two spheres of power; flesh under Sin and Death, Spirit as eschatological life-giver.
- **Indwelling Spirit**: The defining mark of belonging and the agent of life, resurrection, and law-fulfillment (Dunn, Romans WBC 38A, on Rom 8:9-11).
- **Law of the Spirit of life**: New governing order in Christ that achieves what the Mosaic law could not.
- **Abrahamic promise**: Scriptural anchor for a multiethnic family justified by faith.
- **Second Adam**: Christ as head of the new humanity; solidarity rather than moral transfer explains salvation dynamics.
- **Covenant**: The narrative frame within which justification, election, and inclusion operate.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Exegetical model** for Romans in courses and sermon series, especially on justification and Spirit.
 - **Definition source** for works of the law and righteousness of God in doctrinal loci.
 - **Polemical dialogue partner** for evaluating imputation and NPP proposals.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking justification, ecclesiology, and sanctification through participation and Spirit.
