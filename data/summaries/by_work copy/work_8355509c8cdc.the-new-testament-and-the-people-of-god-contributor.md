### TITLE
The New Testament and the People of God - contributor: **Christopher J. H. Wright** 
(original major study by N. T. Wright; part of the series Christian Origins and the Question of God; 1992). 

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s anglophone NT scholarship re-evaluating first‑century Judaism, Jesus and Paul in their Jewish matrix; engagement with the "New Perspective on Paul" and Second Temple studies.
 - Part of a multi‑volume project that reconstructs Christian origins with a strong historical‑narrative emphasis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament must be read as the continuation and transformation of Israel's story: Jesus and the early church are the renewed **People of God**, fulfilling Israel's covenantal destiny and inaugurating eschatological restoration rather than merely replacing Israel.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstruct the Jewish world of Jesus and Paul (social, religious, eschatological background).
 - Read Jesus as Israel's Messiah who embodies and fulfills covenantal promises (temple, land, kingship).
 - Situate Paul and the early church as participants in the reconstituted people of God - corporate identity, not individualistic soteriology.
 - Explain Christian origins as theological reinterpretation of Israel's narrative under the authority of Jesus' death, resurrection, and vindication.
 - Emphasize inaugurated eschatology: kingdom present and coming; continuity of God's promises with transformed realization in Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Second Temple scholarship and figures such as E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, Martin Hengel; dialogues with Bultmannian and classical liberal readings; interacts with rabbinic materials, apocalyptic texts, and early Jewish literature.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant and covenantal identity, Christology (Messiahship), soteriology (corporate justification and new identity), eschatology (inauguration vs consummation), ecclesiology (church as renewed Israel), Torah and law, temple theology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The New Testament narrates God's continued covenantal action: in Jesus Israel's vocation is fulfilled and the people of God are renewed, inaugurating the eschatological future without abolishing the historic bonds that shaped Israel's self‑understanding.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **corporate, covenantal identity** over individualistic portraits of salvation; reads NT theology as Jewish narrative fulfillment.
 - Strong linkage of Messiah, temple, land, and people - not just isolated doctrines.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that marginalize Judaism or treat Paul as anti‑Jewish; disputes supersessionist accounts that erase continuity.
 - Revises existential (Bultmannian) and ahistorical readings by insisting on concrete historical and covenantal contexts.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates the phrase **"people of God"** as the key theological category to bridge Israel, Jesus, and the church.
 - Systematizes **inaugurated eschatology** within a covenantal narrative rather than abstract metaphysical scheme.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential across evangelical, Reformed, and academic circles; helped reshape debates on Paul, covenant theology, and mission.
 - Sparked pushback from those who find the "New Perspective" implications problematic for traditional formulations of justification and imputed righteousness.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust hermeneutic for reading NT texts within Jewish history; valuable for preaching, mission theology, and rethinking covenantal continuity in systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **People of God** - central corporate identity; church as renewed Israel.
- **Covenant** - ongoing framework: promises to Israel receive fulfillment in Christ.
- **Messiah / Christ** - Israel's king who embodies covenant faithfulness and inaugurates restoration.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - kingdom is already instituted in Jesus yet awaits consummation.
- **Kingdom of God** - realized messianic rule tied to covenant renewal, people, and worship.
- **Temple / Worship** - reinterpreted in Christ: presence and locus of God's action moved to the community and the resurrected Lord.
- **Law / Torah** - retains covenantal role; reinterpreted in light of Jesus' fulfillment, not abolished.
- **Justification** - treated corporately (status of the covenant people) with careful interface with individual soteriology.
- **Second Temple Judaism** - historical matrix for understanding Jesus, Paul, and early Christianity.
- **Covenantal nomism** - descriptive category used to contrast older Protestant schemas and clarify Judaism's self‑understanding.
- **Narrative theology** - reading doctrine within the story of Israel rather than abstract propositions.
- **Resurrection** - vindication and eschatological sign central to defining the renewed people of God.
- **New Perspective on Paul** - background interpretive movement engaged and partially adopted; reframes works/faith debates.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for historically grounded NT interpretation emphasizing Jewish context.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theology for rethinking covenant, ecclesiology, and mission (useful in systematic and practical theology).
 - As a **polemic** or corrective to supersessionism and ahistorical readings of Paul and Jesus.
