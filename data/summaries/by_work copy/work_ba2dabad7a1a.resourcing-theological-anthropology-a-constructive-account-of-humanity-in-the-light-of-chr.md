### TITLE
ReSourcing Theological Anthropology: A Constructive Account of Humanity in the Light of Christ - Marc Cortez

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed theological environment (early 21st century). Responds to fragmentation between systematic loci (Christology, anthropology, ecclesiology) and to secular/scientific reduction of human identity.
 - Engages constructive constructive-reformational method: retrieval of classical resources (Scripture, reformers, patristic and modern theologians) plus critical interaction with contemporary philosophy and social science.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Anthropology must be *re-sourced* from Christ: human identity, vocation, and telos cannot be adequately grasped apart from Christology and the Trinitarian economy. Traditional naturalistic, functional, or merely Biblical-descriptive accounts leave anthropological ontology impoverished.
 - Core problem: how to account for human personhood, creatureliness, sin, and flourishing in a way that is both scriptural and coherent with historic theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary accounts (scientific, secular humanism, some evangelical reductions) fragment human nature and detach it from salvation-history.
 - The Christological turn:
 - Christ as ontological and soteriological source - not merely exemplar - for what it means to be human (union with Christ grounds human identity).
 - Trinitarian life and incarnation shape a theological anthropology that is relational, embodied, and vocationally oriented.
 - Re-sourcing implications across traditional loci:
 - Imago Dei reframed in light of incarnational presence and participation in Christ.
 - Sin and its effects understood in relation to Christ's restorative economy (union, reconciliation).
 - Ecclesial and sacramental practices as formative loci for human formation and flourishing.
 - Constructive proposals: theological categories (person, body, agency, vocation, telos) redefined through Christic lens and ecclesial praxis.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture as primary; dialogues with tradition: Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, and moderns (Barth).
 - Contemporary interlocutors include theologians who emphasize Trinitarian/Christological anthropology (e.g., John Zizioulas, N. T. Wright, Miroslav Volf) and critics such as secular philosophers of mind and reductionist social scientists.
 - Interaction with pastoral and ethical voices (Hauerwasian emphasis on formation, sacramental theologians).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), Trinity (relational ontology), Imago Dei, sin/hamartiology, soteriology (union with Christ), ecclesiology, sacramentology, eschatology, creaturehood and providence, vocation/ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - Cortez argues that only a Christ-centered, Trinitarian, and ecclesially-shaped theology gives a robust, normative account of what it means to be human - both creaturely and called to participate in the life of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Christ as ontological source**: Christ not merely redeems human nature but is the normative source for defining human being.
 - **Formation over description**: anthropology is primarily ecclesial and vocational - persons are formed into humanity in and through communal, sacramental life.
 - **Integrative posture**: brings together classical doctrinal loci with practical formation, resisting privatized or individualistic accounts.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects naturalistic and functional models that ground human identity in capacities, roles, or biological facts alone.
 - Challenges views that treat imago Dei as merely relational or functional without rooting it in Christ's person and work.
 - Offers an alternative to purely existentialist or autonomy-focused anthropologies (both secular liberal and some contemporary theological strains).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses language of **re-sourcing**, **Christoformational anthropology**, and **ecclesial ontology** to reframe standard terms.
 - Moves from "image as capacity" to "image as participatory status in Christ."

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed/evangelical circles seeking robustly doctrinal yet pastoral anthropology.
 - Used in theological curricula addressing contemporary ethical and bioethical questions; cited by scholars working at intersection of Christology and human identity.
 - Engages broader ecumenical conversations about personhood and social bonds.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a systematic, teachable framework linking doctrine to pastoral formation.
 - Useful corrective to secular reductionism and for interdisciplinary dialogue (theology with bioethics, philosophy, social science).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Re-sourcing**
 - The methodological move to root anthropology in Christ and the economy of salvation rather than in autonomous natural theology or secular accounts.
- **Christoformational anthropology**
 - Human identity is formed into the shape of Christ through union, sanctification, and ecclesial practices.
- **Imago Dei (participatory model)**
 - The image is a status realized in relational participation in the Trinitarian life and in Christ, not only a set of capacities.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological and soteriological nexus by which human identity is reconstituted and secured.
- **Ecclesial ontology**
 - The church as the primary locus where human formation into true humanity occurs.
- **Embodiment / creatureliness**
 - Emphasizes bodily existence and creaturely finitude as normative; resists spiritualist denials of embodiment.
- **Vocation / telos**
 - Human calling is toward participation in God's life and kingdom; ethics flows from this eschatological orientation.
- **Trinitarian relationality**
 - Personhood is fundamentally relational, patterned on intra-Trinitarian life.
- **Sin and restorative soteriology**
 - Sin understood as distortion of creaturely vocation; Christ's work restores proper human relations.
- **Sacramental formation**
 - Baptism, Eucharist, and other practices are formative means for Christoformational identity.
- **Narrative / teleological framing**
 - Human identity is embedded in salvation-history narrative culminating in eschatological consummation.
- **Ontological priority of Christ**
 - Christ is primary ground for human ontology, not merely a moral exemplar.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological anthropology courses (centering Christology in definitions).
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist/secular accounts and certain functional imago Dei models.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for interpreting Pauline union language and shaping ecclesial formation practices.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, ecclesiology, ethics, and sacrament in constructive theology.
