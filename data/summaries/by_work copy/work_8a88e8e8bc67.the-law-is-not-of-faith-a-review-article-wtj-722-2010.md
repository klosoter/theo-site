### TITLE
"The Law is Not of Faith: A Review Article" - T. David Gordon, Westminster Theological Journal 72:2 (2010)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in WTJ (2010), within a contemporary Reformed academic milieu reacting to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) debates and renewed attention to Pauline exegesis.
 - A review-article form: interacts with recent monographs and articles on Paul, justification, and the meaning of "law" in Pauline theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gordon contends that recent reinterpretations of "law" in Pauline texts (especially readings that collapse law into covenantal boundary markers or that posit a "law of faith") fail to recover the traditional Pauline contrast between law and faith regarding justification. The central problem: what is the nature and role of "the law" when Paul speaks of faith, works, and justification?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of contemporary literature: assesses representative NPP and anti-NPP positions, noting methodological strengths and failures.
 - Lexical and grammatical exegesis: examines key Pauline loci (notably Romans) to argue for a reading where "law" retains ethical/nomistic and forensic significance rather than being simply covenant identity language.
 - Theological retrieval: defends a classical Reformed/Protestant construal of justification as forensic and by faith alone, arguing this best fits the Pauline rhetoric and theology.
 - Polemical evaluation: demonstrates where recent authors blur categories (law/gospel, covenant/justification) and warns against undercutting forensic imputation and grace language.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: proponents of the New Perspective (e.g., E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright) and recent exegetical critics sympathetic to covenantal readings.
 - Secondary interlocutors: classical voices in Pauline studies (Luther, Calvin), and modern Reformed scholars who defend traditional readings.
 - Frequent appeal to Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians), patristic and reformational comment for historical-theological contrast.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic and imputed righteousness)
 - The Mosaic law (role and function)
 - Covenant (covenantal nomism vs covenant as redemptive-historical framework)
 - Faith vs works distinction; grace, merit, and righteousness

- **Closing line**
 - Gordon's theological center of gravity: a robust defense of the Pauline distinction between law and faith that preserves forensic justification and the Reformation insight that salvation is by faith alone, not by the law.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp insistence on grammatical-historical exegesis as corrective to sociological or purely covenantal re-readings.
 - Emphasis on retaining the doctrinal integrity of forensic imputation against interpretive models that domesticate Paul into covenant membership talk.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects NPP tendencies that read "law" primarily as ethnically boundary-setting; reasserts law's soteriological and accusatory function in Pauline argument.
 - Contrasts with readings that minimize "works-righteousness" as Paul's chief target.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not so much invention as reassertion: clarifies "law of faith" language to protect the distinction between legalism and faith-based righteousness.
 - Reframes certain NPP claims as category confusions (e.g., social identity vs forensic status).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Read primarily within conservative Reformed circles as a helpful corrective and synthetic review of recent debates.
 - Cited as a concise resource for those teaching and defending classic Protestant readings against NPP reinterpretations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful pedagogically for seminarians learning the intersection of exegesis and doctrine.
 - Serves as a compact model of how to review contested scholarship while defending confessional commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The law**
 - Treated as both ethical/nomistic and accusatory in Paul; not reducible to mere ethnic or boundary marker.

- **Law of faith**
 - Discussed as a contested phrase; Gordon resists readings that equate the law with faith itself, preserving a distinction that upholds forensic justification.

- **Law of works**
 - The foil to the doctrine of justification by faith; Gordon affirms Paul's polemic against merit-based righteousness.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic, declarative acquittal grounded in imputed righteousness; central to Gordon's corrective.

- **Covenantal nomism**
 - NPP descriptive category (Sanders); Gordon critiques its adequacy to explain Pauline soteriology.

- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - The constellation of recent proposals Gordon reviews and critiques for underplaying forensic/legal language.

- **Forensic / imputation**
 - Key Reformed categories Gordon defends as indispensable for reading Paul.

- **Works-righteousness**
 - The model opposed to justification by faith; Gordon insists this remains Paul's concern.

- **Covenant**
 - A theological category that must be held in tension with, not replace, soteriological/legal categories.

- **Pauline rhetoric**
 - Methodological focus: grammar, syntax, and rhetorical contours used to argue against sociological reductions.

- **Righteousness (dikaiosyne)**
 - Theological term requiring both ethical and forensic sensitivity in exegesis.

- **Boundary markers vs soteriology**
 - Gordon treats this contrast as a central hermeneutical fault-line in recent scholarship.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** resource in debates with the New Perspective: concise critique of covenantal-only readings.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans with attention to grammar and doctrinal categories.
- As a **definition/source** for sustaining Reformed doctrines of forensic justification and imputation in contemporary scholarship.
