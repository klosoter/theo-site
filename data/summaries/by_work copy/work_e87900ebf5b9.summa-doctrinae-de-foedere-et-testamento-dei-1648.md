### TITLE
Summa Doctrinae de Foedere et Testamento Dei (1648) - Johannes Cocceius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1648 amid Dutch Reformed theological disputes; part of the emergent **Cocceian school** that reoriented covenant theology toward a redemptive-historical framework.
 - Reaction to more scholastic, static treatments of law and covenant by Voetian and scholastic federalists in the Netherlands.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical economy must be read as a single, unfolding **federal (covenantal) economy** centered on Christ; the pactum salutis (covenant of redemption) is the intra‑Trinitarian ground and blueprint for covenant history.
 - Seeks to account for continuity and discontinuity between Old and New Covenants while preserving Christ's role as federal head.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic delineation of covenant categories (foedus/testamentum) and historical stages: prelapsarian and postlapsarian arrangements, the **pactum salutis** as antecedent intra‑Trinitarian agreement, and the external administration of covenants in redemptive history.
 - Emphasis on **Christ as covenant head** who executes the terms of the pactum and secures promise-fulfillment through incarnation, obedience, and atonement.
 - Uses exegesis of covenantal texts, typology, and Trinitarian dogmatics to tie Christology and soteriology to covenantal structure.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with Scripture and Reformed confessions; polemical posture toward Voetian scholastics and deterministic/individualistic readings of law and covenant.
 - Draws on earlier Reformed covenantal language but reconfigures it with redemptive-historical emphases.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics), covenant (foedus/testamentum), Trinity (intra‑divine pact), Christology (mediator and federal head), soteriology (pactum basis), sacraments (signs/seals of covenant), ecclesiology and eschatology as covenantal consummation.

- **Site usage (three topical references to the Summa)**
 - Summa Doctrinae (1648) - treatment of **Pactum Salutis and Christ as Covenant Head** (core doctrinal exposition connecting intra‑Trinitarian pact with Christ's federal work).
 - Summa Doctrinae (1648) - extended argument on the **Covenant of Redemption** as pre‑temporal agreement grounding all covenants.
 - Summa Doctrinae (1648) - discussion of **Confessional Formulations of Covenant**, relating Reformed creeds and catechisms to Cocceian covenant schema.

- **Closing line**
 - Cocceius's Summa places the covenantal pact and Christ's federal headship at the center of a dynamic, historical reading of Scripture: covenant theology as a Trinitarian, promise‑fulfillment economy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong redemptive‑historical hermeneutic: the covenant is primarily an unfolding **salvation-history** rather than a static juridical contract.
 - Explicitly **intra‑Trinitarian**: the pactum salutis is an agreement within the Godhead, not merely a human‑divine treaty.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves away from abstract scholastic formulations (legalistic covenant categories) toward a historical narrative linking types and antitypes.
 - Reframes the covenant of works/covenant of grace debate by subordinating them to the pre‑existent pactum salutis as the source of redemptive economy.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic elevation of the **pactum salutis** as foundational and explanatory for all covenantal administrations.
 - Precision in distinguishing **foedus** (covenant as relational economy) from **testamentum** (legal testamentary aspects), while integrating both under redemptive history.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Core text for the Dutch Cocceian school; provoked sustained controversy with Voetian opponents in the 17th century.
 - Long‑term influence on later Reformed covenant theology and modern redemptive‑historical movements; served as a reference point for debates about federal headship and Trinitarian covenant doctrine.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, systematic model of the **Covenant of Redemption** and Christ's federal role - indispensable for teaching on pactal theology and for scholars tracing the historical development of covenant thought.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis** - the pre‑temporal covenant of salvation among the Trinity that establishes the plan of redemption; theoretical and practical basis for pactal readings.
- **Foedus** - covenant as relational and administrative reality in history (contrast: testamentum).
- **Testamentum** - testamentary/legal dimension; used to highlight will/dispensation aspects of covenant.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - same as pactum salutis; emphasis on intra‑divine agreement securing Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Christ as Federal Head** - Christ represents elect humanity, fulfilling covenant obligations and securing promised blessings.
- **Redemptive‑historical hermeneutic** - method stressing progressive revelation, typology, and fulfillment in Christ.
- **Promise and Fulfillment** - organizing principle: promises given in earlier administrations find antitype in Christ and the New Covenant.
- **Typology / Antitype** - sacramental and historical signs point forward to Christ; typology governs Old‑New covenant relations.
- **Sacramentum (signum / seal)** - sacraments as covenant signs and seals that confirm promise and union with Christ.
- **Federalism (federal headship)** - political/legal metaphor applied to representation and covenant obligations.
- **Trinitarian economy (intra‑divine pact)** - God's internal agreement as the root of external covenantal orders.
- **Confessional formulations** - how Reformed creeds and catechisms express covenantal structure; Cocceius reads them through the pactum lens.
- **Ordo Salutis (ordered salvation)** - not merely mechanical steps but covenantal stages realized in Christ's work.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for the pactum salutis and a model of Christ's federal headship in dogmatic treatments.
 - As a **polemic and corrective** against scholastic legalism and Voetian static covenantal schemas.
 - As an **exegetical model** for redemptive‑historical readings of Old Testament covenants and for relating confessional statements to biblical covenant structure.
