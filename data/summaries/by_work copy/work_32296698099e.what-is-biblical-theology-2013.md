### TITLE
What Is Biblical Theology? (2013) - James M. Hamilton Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2013 within contemporary evangelical, Reformed academic conversation seeking to recover canonical, Christ-centered readings of Scripture.
 - Responds to both historical-critical fragmentation and ahistorical thematic or moralistic readings; works in continuity with the redemptive-historical and canonical movements (Vosian and Goldsworthy lines).
- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical theology is the disciplined description and exposition of the Bible's progressive, unified revelation of God in Christ; it locates doctrines within the Bible's historical, covenantal storyline so that the gospel of Christ governs reading and interpretation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes biblical theology from systematic theology and historical theology by emphasis and method: biblical theology attends to the Bible's own unfolding plot and promise-fulfillment structure; systematic arranges doctrine across loci; historical traces reception.
 - Argues for a canonical, Christ-centered hermeneutic:
 - The Old Testament is read as promise, typology, and preparation for Christ.
 - The New Testament is read as fulfillment, reinterpretation, and consummation.
 - Typology and promise-fulfillment are legitimate and normative interpretive categories when anchored in canonical exegesis.
 - Stresses exegetical rigor: Christ-centered reading must be philologically and historically responsible, not eisegetical.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages tradition of Geerhardus Vos and the Reformed redemptive-historical school; dialogues with contemporary scholars in evangelical biblical theology (e.g., G. Goldsworthy, G. K. Beale, D. A. Carson) and with critiques from historical-critical approaches.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant, Christology (Christ as telos), typology, salvation-history, Spirit-work (regeneration and indwelling), ecclesiology in canonical perspective.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Biblical theology commits the reader to Scripture as a coherent, Christ-centered story of promise and fulfillment in which Christ is the interpretive key and the Spirit applies the saving word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear insistence that Christ is the *telos* of the entire canon, not merely a New Testament phenomenon; every part finds meaning in his person and work without collapsing historical particularity.
 - Strong insistence that biblical theology must be exegetical and canonical rather than programmatic or merely synthetic.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against reductionist exemplars of biblical theology that either (a) turn the Bible into a disconnected anthology of moral themes, or (b) treat typology as arbitrary allegory. Promotes disciplined, textually accountable typology.
 - Clarifies differences from systematic theology: biblical theology describes the Bible's own theological development; it does not replace systematic construction but supplies its historical and canonical matrix.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines use of "promise-fulfillment" language as the governing motif, coupled with canonical-historical criteria for legitimate typology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a concise, teaching-oriented manifesto for canonical, Christological reading; used in seminary courses and preaching workshops.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, methodologically careful primer linking exegetical responsibility with theological unity; valuable for pastors, students, and teachers seeking to read the Bible as a gospel-centered whole.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology** - Study of Scripture's progressive revelation and redemptive-historical unity; oriented to the canon's own storyline.
- **Canon / canonical hermeneutic** - Reading texts within the final form and ordering of Scripture; appreciates intertextual fulfillment.
- **Christ as telos** - Christ is the goal and interpretive key of the whole Bible; Old and New Testament point forward/back to him.
- **Promise-fulfillment** - Core motif: God promises (covenant) and fulfills in Christ; a hermeneutical grid for interpreting typology and promise texts.
- **Typology** - Historical foreshadowing or correspondence operative within God's redemptive plan; legitimate when rooted in biblical witness, not speculative allegory.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - Attention to salvation history (history of redemption) as the backbone of theological description.
- **Exegesis vs. eisegesis** - Emphasis that Christ-centered readings must arise from careful exegesis, avoiding implanting external themes into the text.
- **Covenant theology (functional role)** - Used as structural scaffolding: covenants (creation, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, new covenant) chart God's progressive dealings culminating in Christ.
- **Regeneration / indwelling** - Framed as new-covenant realities:
 - Regeneration described as Spirit-produced new life within the believer tied to the new-covenant promises (Ezekiel 36 / Jeremiah 31 pattern) and union with Christ.
 - Indwelling of the Spirit is presented as the means by which the promise is applied and the believer participates in the inaugurated fulfillment.
- **Typological continuity** - Emphasizes continuity between covenantal types (e.g., temple, sacrifice, king) and Christ's fulfillment.
- **Narrative unity** - The Bible read as a coherent story rather than disconnected doctrinal fragments.
- **Hermeneutical humility** - Methodological call for careful, text-centered interpretation.
- **Use as definition source** - Frequently cited to define contemporary evangelical biblical theology.
- **Use as exegetical model** - Models disciplined Christ-centered exegesis for sermon and classroom.
- **Use as conceptual pivot** - Serves to reorient systematic or topical studies into canonical, redemptive-historical context.
