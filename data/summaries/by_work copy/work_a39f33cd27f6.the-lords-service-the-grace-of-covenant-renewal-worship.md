### TITLE
The Lord's Service: The Grace of Covenant Renewal Worship - Jeffrey J. Meyers

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed liturgical renewal (late 20th-early 21st century), responding to both mainline liturgical recovery and charismatic/consumer models of worship.
 - Situated within confessional Reformed and Presbyterian circles seeking a coherent theology of public worship rooted in covenant theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Public worship is properly understood as **covenant renewal**: God graciously re-establishes and confirms his covenant with his people through Word and sacrament in a structured, communal liturgy that centers Christ and his promises.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Worship is not primarily human self-expression or a programmatic achievement but a gracious **divine action** that renovates the covenant bond between God and covenant people.
 - Major moves:
 - Exegesis of biblical worship texts to establish covenantal patterns (call, covenant demand, confession, assurance, proclamation, sacrament, benediction).
 - Theological synthesis using Reformed confessional resources: sacraments as signs and seals that ratify covenant promises.
 - Practical liturgical proposals showing how covenant theology shapes order and elements of corporate worship.
 - Emphasizes the **Word-Sacrament nexus**: preaching and the sacraments are the principal means by which covenant renewal occurs.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages the Reformed confessional tradition and early modern Reformed liturgies (Puritans and Calvin broadly construed).
 - Dialogues with contemporary liturgical critics and proponents (those who emphasize spontaneity, entertainment, or purely emotive worship).
 - Draws on systematic and pastoral theology concerning covenant, grace, and ecclesial identity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (central)
 - Doctrine of Word and sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper as signs and seals)
 - Ecclesiology (visible/invisible church; corporate worship)
 - Grace, justification in public proclamation, Christ as covenant mediator
 - Secondary: liturgy, pastoral theology, sanctification as covenant life

- **Closing line**
 - The work argues that liturgy ordered by covenant theology best safeguards gospel grace: worship is where God, by Word and sacrament, graciously renews his people in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats worship primarily as **God-initiated covenant action** rather than primarily as human response or aesthetic experience.
 - Strong insistence on liturgical order derived from covenant structure (law, gospel, promise, seal).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters consumer-driven, entertainment-oriented worship models by recentering corporate worship on divine initiative and covenant promises.
 - Challenges purely experiential/spontaneous models that minimize ordained, repeated forms and sacraments.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes and sharpens the phrase **"covenant renewal worship"** as a programmatic hermeneutic and liturgical framework within conservative Reformed practice.
 - Frames the elements of worship as stages in a covenant transaction (not merely elements to be checked off).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in many Reformed and Presbyterian contexts as a constructive resource for liturgical revision and pastorally driven worship reform.
 - Cited by pastors and theologians working to recover confessional worship patterns; less visible in mainline liturgical studies but influential within confessional renewal networks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides theological rigor and pastoral concreteness for churches seeking a theologically faithful, pastorally sensitive pattern of public worship.
 - Serves as both an apologetic for ordered liturgy and a practical template for liturgical structure.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant renewal** - Worship as the occasion in which God renews and confirms the covenant relationship with his people.
- **Word-Sacrament nexus** - The theological claim that preaching and the sacraments together enact covenant renewal.
- **Signs and seals** - Reformed vocabulary for sacraments as both visible signs and assurance-sealing promises.
- **Call to worship** - Opening that summons the covenant people to recognize God's presence and claim.
- **Confession & assurance** - Liturgical moments that articulate covenant demand and divine pardon as preconditions for receiving promises.
- **Proclamation/preaching** - Central instrument by which covenant promises are applied; pastoral and declarative in function.
- **Lord's Supper** - Covenant meal that both proclaims and seals Christ's covenantal benefits.
- **Baptism** - Entrance sign into the covenant community; initiatory seal of promise.
- **Benediction/send** - The covenantal sending that dispatches the congregation under God's blessing into covenant life.
- **Law-Gospel order** - Structural principle safeguarding both covenant demand and covenant promise in worship.
- **Grace (in worship)** - The emphasis that worship is an act of divine grace, not human merit.
- **Ecclesial formation** - Worship as formative for covenant community life and identity.
- **Liturgical order** - Recurrent, formative patterns that embody covenant structure.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "covenant renewal worship" in Reformed liturgical reform.
 - As a **polemic** against consumeristic and purely experiential worship models.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for structuring services that integrate preaching and sacraments to effect covenantal formation.
