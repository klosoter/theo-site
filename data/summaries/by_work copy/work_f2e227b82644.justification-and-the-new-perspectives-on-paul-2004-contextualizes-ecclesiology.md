### TITLE
Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul (2004) - Guy Prentiss Waters 
Contextual emphasis: defenders of classical Reformed forensic imputation in dialogue with the New Perspective; implications for covenantal ecclesiology and church order.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed reaction to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) as advanced by E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and N. T. Wright.
 - Written within conservative Reformed circles concerned that NPP revisions threaten traditional doctrines of justification and thereby church practice (e.g., offices, sacraments, discipline; see Church Government Presbyterian Polity Offices Discipline).
- **Central thesis**
 - The NPP misreads key Pauline categories and undercuts the classical forensic doctrine of justification; preserving forensic imputation is both exegetically warranted and necessary for faithful covenantal ecclesiology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical critique: re-evaluates "works of the law," justification, and faith-language in Paul to defend the traditional reading against NPP claims.
 - Systematic retrieval: situates justification within a covenantal, union-with-Christ framework that retains forensic imputation and forensic language as normative.
 - Ecclesiological implications: argues that denial or attenuation of forensic imputation fosters monocovenantal tendencies (see Federal Vision Monocovenantalism) and affects sacramental and disciplinary practices.
 - Polemical extension: engages Federal Vision proponents on how covenantal ontology and forensic justification intersect (see Federal Vision And Justification By Faith).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Sanders, Dunn, Wright (NPP); interacts with Reformation sources (Luther, Calvin) and modern Reformed critics of NPP and Federal Vision.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic imputation), soteriology, covenant theology (bicovenantal vs. monocovenantal tensions), sacraments, union with Christ, ecclesiology (offices, discipline), justification by faith.
- **Closing line**
 - Waters insists that a properly exegeted, forensic doctrine of justification is the linchpin for orthodox covenantal theology and a disciplined, ordered Reformed church life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Marries close Pauline exegesis with confessional Reformed commitments; emphasizes the practical ecclesial consequences of doctrinal revision.
 - Strong linkage between **forensic imputation** and concrete items of church polity: offices, discipline, and sacramental identity.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges NPP reading that reduces "works of law" to boundary markers only; contends NPP underplays forensic language and judicial metaphors in Paul.
 - Opposes Federal Vision's monocovenantal tendencies by defending a contrast between covenantal promise/faith and works-oriented covenantal readings (see Federal Vision Monocovenantalism).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions between **imputation** and **impartation** in service of ecclesial practice; reframes justification as both forensic declaration and covenantal union with Christ in ways aimed at informing discipline.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among conservative Reformed pastors and scholars as a rebuttal to NPP and as a resource in Federal Vision controversies.
 - Cited in discussions of Presbyterian polity where justification doctrine is argued to bear on the legitimacy of offices and disciplinary procedures (see Church Government Presbyterian Polity Offices Discipline).
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact bridge between exegetical debate and ecclesial application; valuable for teaching on how soteriology shapes church order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification** - forensic declaration of righteousness; central contested term against NPP and Federal Vision.
- **Forensic imputation** - Christ's righteousness legally credited to believers; defended as scriptural and ecclesially necessary (see Justification Forensic Imputation Npp Critiques).
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - scholarly movement reinterpreting Paul, especially "works of the law"; primary object of Waters' critique.
- **Works of the law** - Waters argues these include covenantal boundary-keeping but cannot displace forensic categories.
- **Imputation vs. impartation** - distinction emphasized to oppose synergistic or merely transformative accounts of justification.
- **Covenant theology** - Waters defends a covenantal framework that safeguards forensic concepts and resists monocovenantal collapse.
 - **Monocovenantalism** - critiqued as characteristic of some Federal Vision proposals that collapse Israel-Church distinctions (see Federal Vision Monocovenantalism).
- **Union with Christ** - integrated into justification account without eliminating forensic declaration.
- **Justification by faith** - retained as primary soteriological principle; used to assess Federal Vision claims (see Federal Vision And Justification By Faith).
- **Sacraments / visible church** - treated as means that presuppose and express forensic justification in covenant community.
- **Ecclesiology: offices & discipline** - doctrine of justification argued to have operational effects on polity, ordination, and discipline (see Church Government Presbyterian Polity Offices Discipline).
- **Federal Vision** - engaged as a contemporary theological interlocutor especially on covenant and justification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed formulations of forensic imputation and covenantal order.
- As a **polemic** against NPP and aspects of the Federal Vision that threaten classical doctrines.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline forensic language in service of ecclesial practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking soteriology directly to church government, sacraments, and discipline.
