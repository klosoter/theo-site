### TITLE
Tradition: Old and New (F. F. Bruce, 1970)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1970 amid post-Vatican II ecumenical debates and renewed Protestant‑Catholic exchanges about authority, revelation, and the role of the church.
 - Bruce writes as an evangelical New Testament scholar addressing both popular and ecclesial concerns about the relation of Scripture and Tradition.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Scripture is the final norm for Christian belief; tradition is necessary and valuable but must be tested and directed by Scripture.**
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Surveys historical phenomena labelled "tradition" in the early church: apostolic preaching, oral transmission, creeds, liturgy, and patristic exegesis.
 - Distinguishes types of tradition: authentic apostolic deposit vs local customs and later innovations.
 - Assesses the Roman Catholic claim of Tradition (with capital T) as a co‑equal source of revelation; argues for the primacy of written apostolic witness embodied in the canon.
 - Shows how creeds and councils function as interpretive aids that summarize apostolic teaching rather than add new revelation.
 - Concludes with practical implications for authority, doctrinal development, and ecumenical conversation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Early church fathers and councils (as witnesses to how tradition operated).
 - Contemporary Roman Catholic formulations (post‑Vatican II) asserting Tradition as authoritative.
 - Evangelical and Protestant positions on sola scriptura and the role of creeds.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and the transmission of revelation (oral and written).
 - Canon and scriptural authority.
 - Development of doctrine, creeds, and ecclesial authority.
 - Indirectly touches on hermeneutics, ecclesiology, and apostolicity.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The living tradition of the church is indispensable for continuity and interpretation, but **it must be normed by the apostolic Scripture**, which remains the decisive criterion for doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced evangelical posture**
 - Affirms the indispensability of historic church tradition (creeds, liturgy, patristic insight) without conceding co‑equal revelatory status to Tradition.
- **Historical sensitivity with theological restraint**
 - Uses historical-critical awareness of the early church to show how oral and written transmission complemented one another, avoiding polemical caricature of either side.
- **Clear typology of traditions**
 - Distinguishes *apostolic tradition* (authoritative content traceable to the apostles) from *ecclesiastical tradition* (local rites, usages, later developments).
- **Corrective to extremes**
 - Counters Catholic absolutization of Tradition as extra‑biblical source and Protestant dismissals that disregard the church's formative role in safeguarding and articulating doctrine.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among Reformed and broader evangelical readers as a concise, scholarly defence of sola scriptura refined by historically attuned appreciation of tradition.
 - Used in ecumenical conversations as a temperate restatement of Protestant concerns post‑Vatican II.
- **Enduring value**
 - Presents a teachable model for undergraduates and church leaders: **Scripture as norming norm; tradition as normative but normed** - useful for hermeneutics, catechesis, and ecumenical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tradition (lowercase)** - practices, liturgies, teachings transmitted within local churches; may be authoritative insofar as they reflect apostolic teaching.
- **Tradition (capital T)** - Roman Catholic theological claim of an extra‑scriptural, co‑authoritative deposit; Bruce critiques this as theologically problematic.
- **Scripture / Canon** - the written apostolic witness; for Bruce the decisive and final court of doctrinal appeal.
- **Apostolic Tradition** - content of teaching directly traceable to the apostles; the normative core of both Scripture and authentically preserved tradition.
- **Oral Tradition** - the non‑written transmission that preceded or accompanied the New Testament writings; important but subordinate to the written text as the church's normative record.
- **Creeds** - concise summaries (e.g., Apostles', Nicene) that operationalize apostolic teaching; treated as interpretive, not additional, revelation.
- **Development of Doctrine** - legitimate doctrinal growth that explicates apostolic teaching; must be distinguished from alteration or accretion.
- **Ecclesial Authority** - the church's role in custodianship and interpretation of the apostolic deposit; important but accountable to Scripture.
- **Magisterium** - Catholic teaching office implied in discussions; Bruce argues against its claiming of independent revelatory authority.
- **Hermeneutics** - the interpretive method aligning tradition and Scripture; Bruce advocates historically informed but Scripture‑normed exegesis.
- **Revelation (public)** - the content once for all delivered to the saints; Bruce insists it is the ground of both Scripture and legitimate tradition.
- **Patristic Witness** - used as evidence of how early Christians received and applied apostolic teaching; valuable but evaluated against Scripture.
- **Norma normans vs. norma normata (summary)** - implicit Protestant formulation: Scripture as the norm that norms tradition; tradition is normed by Scripture.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source**: clear evangelical articulation of the relation between Scripture and tradition for courses on authority and canon.
- As a **polemic resource**: often cited in Protestant critiques of Roman Catholic claims about Tradition and magisterial infallibility.
- As an **exegetical / historical model**: exemplifies how to weigh patristic and oral evidence without surrendering the primacy of the canonical text.
