### TITLE
Entering into Rest: Ethics as Theology, Volume 3 - Oliver O'Donovan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-20th / early-21st century Anglican-Reformed theological milieu; contribution to systematic political theology and moral theology that insists theological doctrine must shape ethical and public reasoning.
 - Part of O'Donovan's Ethics as Theology project which opposes separating moral theology from doctrinal theology and reacts against secular moral philosophy and reductive political sociology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian ethics must be read as theology: moral life issues from God's saving acts (creation, covenant, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection) and is ordered by the eschatological reality of God's reign.
 - In relation to church and state: political order exists under God's sovereignty; the church's vocation is neither to seize temporal power nor to withdraw into private pietism but to witness to the rule of God, enabling a distinctively Christian way of "entering into rest."

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Theology first: doctrinal expositions of creation, covenant, Christ and eschatology ground moral vision.
 - Social ontology: human social ordering is fragile and sinful; law, institutions, and polity are necessary yet provisional custodians of justice.
 - Church/state relation: the church has a prophetic and formative role; the state has limited but real authority to secure temporal goods and order.
 - Ethical practice: Christian virtues and ecclesial practices prepare people for the eschatological rest that reorients political aspirations.
 - Practical implication: critique of secular liberalism and legal positivism; call for Christian public engagement that respects institutional autonomy while witnessing to covenantal norms.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Augustine (on ordering loves and rest), the Reformation (covenantal and ecclesial distinctives), Thomas Aquinas (natural law motifs), Karl Barth (Christocentric theology), and engages modern thinkers on law and politics (liberal contract theorists, legal positivists).
 - Dialogues with contemporary political theology and Christian ethics debates over church/state separation and public reason.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence (basis for common good)
 - Covenant (social and political ordering)
 - Christology and eschatology (grounding moral hope and 'rest')
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments (formative practices)
 - Doctrine of law and conscience (relation of divine law, natural law, civil law)

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the church's ethical life is an enactment of God's saving reign that disciplines political imagination toward a Godward "rest" rather than merely reorganizing temporal power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence that ethics is properly done as theology: moral norms derive their identity and authority from Trinitarian and Christological truth, not from autonomous moral reason.
 - The motif of "entering into rest" reframes political hope: politics is a limited means to secure peace but not the ultimate telos.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects privatized pietism that abdicates public responsibility and rejects the modern liberal claim that political ethics can be neutral or purely secular.
 - Corrects both secular legal positivism (which severs law from moral truth) and naive establishmentarianism (which collapses church into state).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Treats political order as a theological category shaped by covenantal anthropology and eschatological hope rather than as a mere sociological fact.
 - Reframes subsidiarity and common good within a covenantal narrative instead of purely institutional theory.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative and constructive strands of Reformed and Anglican political theology; often cited in debates about Christian public engagement and law.
 - Criticized by some for insufficient attention to pluralist democratic procedures and for privileging ecclesial norms in public discourse.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous doctrinal grounding for public ethics; supplies resources for churches wrestling with civic vocation and for theologians resisting fragmented secular moral theory.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Entering into rest"**
 - Theologically denotes trusting God's eschatological reign; politically warns against millenarian political solutions and overinvestment in temporal reform.
- **Ethics as theology**
 - Principle that moral norms must be read out of doctrinal claims about God, Christ, and covenant.
- **Covenant**
 - Social and political ordering grounded in God's saving promises; frames communal obligations and public justice.
- **Common good**
 - Not a neutral aggregation of interests but a theological concept shaped by creation and covenant.
- **Prophetic witness**
 - Church's public role to proclaim divine law and judgment, shaping conscience without usurping political office.
- **Law (divine, natural, civil)**
 - Interrelated tiers: divine law grounds moral truths; natural law makes them intelligible in common reason; civil law orders social life provisionally.
- **Secularization / secular liberalism**
 - Diagnosed as an impoverishment of moral imagination when political order is cut off from theological grounding.
- **Subsidiarity**
 - Reinterpreted covenantally: smaller communities should shape goods and meanings, with higher authority preserving order.
- **Conscience**
 - Formed ecclesially and doctrinally, not merely individualistic; locus of moral responsibility in public contexts.
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Eschatological horizon that orients political ethics toward restoration, not domination.
- **Ecclesial practices**
 - Worship and sacraments as formative for public virtue and civic character.
- **Political order as provisional**
 - Recognizes state authority as necessary but non-absolute under God's sovereignty.
- **Prophetic vs. sacerdotal models**
 - Prefers prophetic witness (calling to repentance and justice) over clerical governance of the state.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological accounts of church/state relations and the limits of political theology.
 - As a **polemic** against secular liberalism and legal positivism in ethics and law.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating doctrinal theology (covenant, eschatology) with public ethics and legal theory.
