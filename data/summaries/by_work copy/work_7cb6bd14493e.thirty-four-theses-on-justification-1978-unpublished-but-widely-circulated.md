### TITLE
**Thirty-four Theses on Justification (1978)** - Norman Shepherd (unpublished, widely circulated)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1970s Reformed academic milieu; produced while Shepherd taught at Westminster Theological Seminary. Unpublished document distributed among students and colleagues; later became a focal point in controversy (1980s) over the doctrine of justification in Reformed circles.
 - Anticipates themes later associated with the Federal Vision debates (see "Federal Vision And Justification By Faith" and "Federal Vision Monocovenantalism").

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Re-articulates justification within a robust covenantal framework: justification is the divine act that regards persons as covenantally related to Christ and so vindicates them within the covenant community. Emphasis on the faith that justifies being intrinsically covenantal and accompanied by works of obedience.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Justification must be understood in the life of the covenant people, not as an isolated forensic transaction divorced from union with Christ.
 - Faith is presented as the covenantal instrument that includes a life of faithful obedience; therefore, the boundary between justification and sanctification is reframed.
 - Rejection of a stark separation between declarative forensic imputation and the believer's covenantal faithfulness. The theses develop 34 concise propositions unpacking scriptural, confessional, and pastoral implications.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis (Pauline and covenantal narratives) and Reformed confessional materials are primary interlocutors.
 - Classical Reformed emphases (imputation, sola fide) are engaged and critiqued from within a covenantal interpretive grid.
 - Later debates and readers frequently link Shepherd's work to the Federal Vision movement and to arguments labeled as monocovenantalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (center), covenant theology, faith and assurance, union with Christ, sanctification, imputation and merit, sacraments implicitly by covenantal reference, ecclesiology (covenant community).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Thirty-four Theses place justification firmly inside covenantal membership: justification is God's covenantal verdict on those united to Christ, and the faith that receives that verdict is inseparable from covenantal fidelity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong covenantal reorientation: justification is primarily assessed in terms of covenant relationship and communal membership rather than a narrowly forensic legal fiction.
 - Emphasis that justifying faith is a faith-that-works (not as meritorious works, but as covenantal obedience integral to faith).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Challenges classical formulations that strictly separate forensic imputation from the believer's sanctified life (a sharp forensic/sanctification dichotomy).
 - Does not simply deny sola fide but reframes what "faith" is and how it functions in justification - leading critics to allege erosion of sola fide.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "justification" language in covenantal-ecclesial terms; treats justification as a corporate-covenantal verdict as well as an individual standing.
 - Uses covenant membership and covenant fidelity as primary categories for understanding justification.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly controversial in Reformed institutions; prompted investigations and extensive critique in the 1980s. Influential as a precursor to or catalyst for later Federal Vision debates.
 - Adopted sympathetically by some covenantal reformers; treated as a warning or foil by defenders of classical forensic imputation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes re-examination of the covenantal contours of justification, presses confessional traditions to articulate the relation between union with Christ, faith, and works, and serves as a catalyst for clarifying forensic and covenantal language in contemporary theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - Shepherd: a covenantal verdict declaring those united to Christ as rightly related to covenant blessings; not merely a forensic declaration abstracted from covenant life.

- **Covenant / Covenant membership**
 - Primary category for locating justification; ecclesial and communal emphasis.

- **Faith (covenantal faith)**
 - Not mere assent; a faith intrinsically characterized by covenantal fidelity and obedience.

- **Imputation**
 - Treated with caution; Shepherd reframes imputation within covenantal union rather than as an isolated forensic crediting.

- **Forensic / Declarative language**
 - Retained but reinterpreted through covenantal categories; critics argue the forensic element is subordinated.

- **Sanctification**
 - Presented as inseparably linked to justification in lived covenantal faith; boundary with justification rethought.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological-covenantal ground that makes justification coherent as a communal verdict.

- **Works / Obedience**
 - Not meritorious in a justification-by-works sense; nevertheless integral as the fruital condition of covenantal faith that the theses insist upon.

- **Assurance**
 - Tied to covenantal participation and persevering faith; assurance is located in the faithful life of the covenant community.

- **Federal Vision (reference point)**
 - Shepherd's theses anticipated and influenced themes in later Federal Vision discussions regarding the relation of covenant, sacrament, and justification.

- **Monocovenantalism (reference point)**
 - The theses' stress on covenant continuity and communal standing intersects with debates labeled monocovenantalism (one covenantal economy across law and gospel).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and case study: commonly cited in debates defending classical forensic imputation or criticizing covenantal construals that collapse justification and sanctification.
- As a **conceptual pivot/exegetical model**: used by scholars who aim to reinterpret justification through covenantal and ecclesial categories, and as a foil for clarifying confessional formulations.
