### TITLE
**On the Lord's Supper (1526) - Huldrych Zwingli**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Zurich, Swiss Reformation, 1520s; part of Zwingli's systematic efforts to reform worship and doctrine after the 1523 Eucharistic controversies.
 - Moves against the medieval mass and emerging Lutheran sacramental claims; shaped by humanist exegesis and emphasis on Scripture as norm.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Lord's Supper is a **signal, covenantal, commemorative meal**: the bread and wine are visible signs that point believers to Christ; Christ is not bodily present in the elements. (See topics: **Presence of Christ; Fencing and Admission**.)

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: primary appeal to 1 Corinthians 11 and Gospel narratives; stresses the verbality and context of "do this in remembrance" (anamnesis).
 - Christological constraint: because Christ is ascended and at the Father's right hand, he cannot be physically or locally present in the elements.
 - Sacramental definition: sacraments are signs and seals, not intrinsic conveyors of grace apart from faith.
 - Pastoral application: discipline in admission ("fencing the table") to prevent profane reception and to preserve visible covenant order.
 - Polemic conclusion: rejects the mass as sacrifice and condemns doctrines that locate Christ's body in bread/wafer.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Directly polemical with **Roman Catholic** doctrine (transubstantiation, sacrificium) and anticipatory conflict with **Luther** (sacramental union).
 - Uses Scripture, patristic citations selectively, and humanist exegetical method; influences and dialogues with Swiss colleagues (Oecolampadius, Bullinger).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (ascension, corporeality), sacramental theology (nature and efficacy of sacraments), covenant theology (church membership, visible sign of covenant), ecclesiology (table admission and discipline), soteriology (faith as instrument receiving benefits).

- **Closing line**
 - Zwingli centers the Lord's Supper as a **covenantal, commemorative sign that presupposes and strengthens faith and requires orderly admission**, rejecting any understanding that makes the elements corporeally or automatically efficacious.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong formulation of the Eucharist as **memorial/visible word**: the sacrament functions primarily to call believers to remembrance and thanksgiving.
 - Emphasis on **ecclesial discipline**: a prescriptive model for admitting communicants and guarding the table (fencing) against unworthy reception.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects **transubstantiation** and the mass-as-sacrifice; opposes Luther's idea that Christ is present "in, with, and under" the elements (sacramental union).
 - Challenges any sacramental doctrine that detaches the efficacy of signs from the faith of the receiver.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies language of sacraments as **signs and seals** (precursor to later Reformed formulations), and treats the sacrament as a **visible proclamation** rather than a material conferral of Christ's body.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Swiss Reformed practice (Bucer, Bullinger); set the agenda for Reformed Eucharistic thought though later Reformed theologians (notably Calvin) diverged on the nature of spiritual presence.
 - Became a principal polemical text in Protestant debates; informed confessional distinctions between Lutheran and Reformed camps.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for studies in sacramental theology, pastoral discipline (communion admission), and the relation of Word and sacrament; remains a concise statement of memorialist/covenantal Eucharistic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament** - a visible sign instituted by Christ; for Zwingli a sign and testimony, not an automatic conveyer of grace.
- **Sign / Visible Word** - the bread and wine are the external proclamation of Christ's benefits; the sacrament is a preached, visible promise.
- **Memorial / Remembrance (Anamnesis)** - central function: to recall Christ's death and to stir faith and thanksgiving.
- **Real presence** - Zwingli denies the corporeal local presence of Christ in the elements; insists on a spiritual/representative presence to believers.
 - Contrast: rejects transubstantiation and opposes Lutheran sacramental union.
- **Spiritual presence** - Christ is present to believers by the Spirit and by faith, not by bodily identification with the bread/wine.
- **Transubstantiation** - explicitly rejected as philosophically and scripturally untenable.
- **Fencing the table / Admission** - procedural discipline requiring visible evidence of faith and order; protects the sacrament from profanation (topic: **Fencing And Admission**).
- **Unworthy reception / Judgment** - drawing on 1 Cor 11, improper communion leads to divine judgment rather than sacramental blessing.
- **Covenant** - the Supper as a sign of the covenant community; membership and public profession are prerequisites.
- **Means of grace** - Zwingli: sacraments are means inasmuch as they confirm and nourish faith but they are not automatic channels of grace apart from faith (topic: **Sacraments As Means Of Grace**).
- **Word-Sacrament relation** - emphasis that the Word (preaching/Scripture) governs and interprets the sacrament; sacrament without Word is ineffective.
- **Eucharistic thanksgiving** - the liturgical and devotional end of the Supper: praise and remembrance rather than sacrificial rite.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed memorialist sacramental theology.
 - As **polemic** in debates with Roman Catholic and Lutheran positions on presence and the mass.
 - As a **pastoral/disciplinary model** for communion admission and guarding the table.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians 11 and the Lord's command ("do this in remembrance").
