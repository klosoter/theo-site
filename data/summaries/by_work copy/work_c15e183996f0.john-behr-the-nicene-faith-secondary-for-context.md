### TITLE
Gregory of Nazianzus - Trinitarian Theology (as read through John Behr, The Nicene Faith)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 4th century Cappadocian milieu (Orations/Theological Orations, ca. 379-381). Response to Arianism, Eunomianism, semi-Arian compromises; part of Cappadocian recovery of Nicene language.
 - Behr frames Gregory within the post-Nicene consolidation that reinterprets "substance/ousia" and "hypostasis/person" (Behr, The Nicene Faith, vol. 1).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to confess one God while affirming real, eternal distinction of Father, Son, and Spirit without subordinating the Son and Spirit or collapsing persons into modes.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirm monarchy of the Father as single principle while insisting on genuine personal distinctions.
 - Reclaim "generation" and "spiration" as eternal, non-temporal relations that secure both unity (one divinity) and distinction (three hypostases).
 - Use patristic exegesis and rhetorical theology to expose the logical and pastoral failures of Arian/Eunomian thought.
 - Major moves:
 - Distinguish ontological relations within the Godhead from economic operations in history.
 - Define hypostasis as concrete personal reality (not mere nominal individuator).
 - Read Scripture and Cappadocian tradition to justify eternal generation and procession.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary need to repel Arius and Eunomius; dialogue with Basil and Gregory of Nyssa; engagement with Scripture (Joh 1; 15; Matt 28) and earlier Nicene formulations.
 - Behr highlights Gregory's reliance on rhetorical theology and philosophical vocabulary repurposed for dogma.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (implications for Son's divinity), revelation (Scripture as vehicle), ontology of personhood (hypostasis), eternal relations (generation/spiration), economy of salvation.
- **Closing line**
 - Gregory secures a Trinitarian grammar that preserves divine unity and personal plurality by making eternal relations (generation, spiration) central to the inner life of God while keeping economic revelation subordinate to this ontological pattern.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stress on **real personal being (hypostasis)** as the locus of relationality: persons are not mere modes or roles but concrete realities whose relations are eternal.
 - Rhetorical-poetic theology: theological argument expressed in oratorical form-precision of language married to pastoral force.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Arian reduction of the Son to created non-being; opposes Eunomian insistence that essence fully determines relation (thus denying real relation).
 - Unlike some Western tendencies that blur ontological/economic lines, Gregory insists on the priority of ontological relations but refuses to isolate them from the economy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rearticulation of ousia/hypostasis: ousia as common divine reality; hypostasis as **real subsistent relationalities**.
 - Clarifies the difference between **ontological Trinity** (the inner life) and **economic Trinity** (God's action in history), while showing their coherence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Eastern Orthodox Trinitarian theology; formative for later Cappadocians and Eastern synthesis.
 - In Reformed and Western theology, Gregory's insistence on personal distinctions and eternal relations has been taken seriously for orthodox metaphysical accounts of Trinity, though Western procedural debates (e.g., filioque) read him differently.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for affirming eternal generation and procession without subordinationism.
 - Rich exegetical-theological method: shows how doctrine grows from Scripture, pastoral concerns, and conceptual correction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ousia** - common divine essence or being; shared reality of Father, Son, Spirit.
- **Hypostasis** - personal subsistence; Gregory's term for the real, relational persons of the Godhead.
 - Distinct from later Western "person" (emphasis on relationality and subsistence).
- **Monarchy of the Father** - principle that Father is source within Trinity; not a subordination of Son/Spirit but a theological ordering.
- **Eternal Generation** - Son is eternally begotten of the Father; not temporal origin but an eternal relational mode securing Son's deity.
 - Gregory defends generation as an **ontological relation**, not merely economic.
- **Eternal Spiration (Procession)** - Spirit proceeds from the Father (Gregory emphasizes procession from the Father; later debates over filioque diverge).
 - Treated as eternal relation analogous to generation; secures Spirit's divinity and personhood.
- **Ontological Trinity** - the inner life and eternal relations of Father, Son, Spirit; primary for Gregory's theology.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history (creation, redemption); subordinate to but consistent with ontological relations.
- **Relation (pros hen, prosopon)** - relational predicates that distinguish persons without breaking unity of ousia.
- **Begotten/begottenness** - technical language used to exclude creatureliness and assert eternal derivation within God.
- **Substance vs. Person problem** - Gregory reframes it: unity in substance, plurality in persons by eternal relations.
- **Rhetorical theology** - method: oratorical persuasion grounded in dogmatic correction.
- **Anti-Arian polemic** - doctrinal driver: every metaphor or philosophical category aimed at preserving Son's full divinity.
- **Scriptural exegesis** - central warrant for claims (e.g., John 1 used to ground eternal generation).
- **Hypostatic relationality** - short-hand for Gregory's model where persons are relations that are genuine and eternal.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for eternal relations (generation/spiration) in Trinitarian dogmatics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates separating ontological vs economic Trinity - a model for integrating inner life with salvific action.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Johannine and Pauline texts to support eternal sonship and Spirit procession.
