### TITLE
Biblical Doctrine: A Systematic Summary of Bible Truth (John F. MacArthur; with Richard Mayhue, 2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary conservative evangelical context (2017). MacArthur, long-standing pastor and teacher within Reformed-evangelical, conservative Protestantism, produces a compact, accessible systematic survey against modern theological novelties (e.g., liberal theology, some charismatic claims) while standing within historic Protestant orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** A biblically grounded, systematic summary of Christian doctrine emphasizing the primacy and sufficiency of Scripture, God's sovereignty, penal substitutionary atonement, and robust moral/theological orthodoxy. The book aims to present clear, pastorally usable summaries rather than exhaustive academic debate.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Organizes classic loci (Scripture, God, Trinity, creation, anthropology, sin, Christ, salvation, sanctification, church, last things, angels/demons) with exegetical and pastoral emphasis.
 - Affirms inerrancy and clarity of Scripture as the final norm; theological claims are tethered to biblical texts.
 - Moves from God (doctrine of God and Trinity) to human fallenness, Christ's work and benefits, application (sanctification, church life), and consummation (eschatology).
 - Frequently concludes doctrinal entries with practical implications for ministry and Christian living.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Frequent appeal to Scripture and precedent of Reformation and conservative evangelical interpreters. Conversant with classical figures (Augustine, Calvin) and modern systematicians; critiques contemporary charismatic theology, theological liberalism, and speculative anthropology such as trichotomy advocates.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, God and the Trinity, creation, humanity (anthropology), sin (hamartiology), Christology, soteriology (including justification, adoption, sanctification), ecclesiology, sacraments/ordinances, eschatology, angelology/demonology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** A pastoral, Scripture-centric systematic summary that insists theology must be clear, biblical, and doctrinally orthodox, serving both pulpit and classroom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **biblical clarity and pastoral applicability**-doctrine must lead to godly living and worship.
 - Clear, unapologetic defense of **penal substitutionary atonement** and the necessity of substitutionary objective atonement for justification.
 - Consistent **cessationist tendencies** in gifts and a conservative reading of charismatic claims.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against theological liberalism and experientialism; corrects perceived excesses in charismatic theology and speculative anthropology (e.g., trichotomy).
 - Reasserts classical Protestant categories over newer evangelical innovations that lack clear exegetical warrant.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:** Not so much neologisms as tight, pastorally-oriented rearticulation of classic terms for twenty-first-century ministry contexts.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries and churches as a compact reference; praised for clarity and pastoral utility, critiqued by some for polemical tone toward charismatic and progressive camps.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a concise, Scripture-focused primer for pastors, elders, and students seeking orthodox, usable summaries of key doctrines.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture (Sola Scriptura):** Bible as final, inerrant authority; basis for all doctrinal claims and church practice.
- **Trinity:** Classic orthodox formulation (one God in three persons); emphasis on relational distinctions and unity of essence.
- **Christology:** Emphasis on full deity and humanity of Christ; penal substitutionary atonement and resurrection central.
- **Soteriology:** Justification by faith alone, union with Christ, imputed righteousness, sanctification as progressive but non-meritorious.
- **Anthropology (Dichotomy):** **Affirms dichotomy** - human composition as body + immaterial soul/spirit (interchangeable terms in Scripture); rejects popular forms of trichotomy that sharply separate soul and spirit into distinct ontological parts.
 - Contrast: **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy** - MacArthur argues texts use "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably and that trichotomy often rests on extra-biblical speculation.
- **Sin (Total Depravity):** Human helplessness without divine regeneration; sin affects all faculties.
- **Ecclesiology:** Church as covenantal, local and universal realities; ordinances (Lord's Supper, baptism) as symbolic/means of grace in a Protestant register.
- **Eschatology:** Conservative, premillennial tendencies coupled with biblical emphasis on Christ's return, final judgment, and new creation.
- **Scriptural Exegesis:** Prioritizes straightforward grammatical-historical method; resists speculative metaphysical additions.
- **Cessationism:** Skeptical of ongoing charismatic sign gifts as normative; calls for careful testing of claimed supernatural phenomena.
- **Pastoral Theology:** Doctrine linked to ministry practice - preaching, discipleship, church governance.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **concise definition source** for key doctrines in pulpit and classroom.
- As a **polemic resource** against theological liberalism, experientialism, and speculative anthropologies (notably trichotomy).
- As an **exegetical-model exemplar**: succinct proof-texting and application rather than exhaustive academic debate.
