### TITLE
Psalms by the Day: A New Devotional Translation - Alec Motyer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical Anglican scholarship; Motyer (1930-2016) known for pastoral scholarship and conservative biblical theology.
 - Responds to both academic fragmentation of the Psalter (form-criticism, Sitz im Leben approaches) and to informal paraphrase devotionals; intended for daily, liturgical devotion and congregational use.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Psalms are God-directed prayer-speech that form the people of God; they point forward to and find their fulfilment in Christ. A translation can be both faithful to Hebrew poetry and immediately usable as prayer.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents the Psalms arranged for daily use with a translation that prioritizes:
 - **address** - preserving the vocative and prayerful tone (the Psalms as spoken prayers).
 - **poetic shape** - respecting Hebrew parallelism and cadence for devotional reading.
 - **canonical Christology** - explicit attention to how NT usage and the messianic trajectory illumine the Psalms.
 - Moves from translation to brief devotional comment where necessary (orienting the reader to theological and pastoral implications).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit engagement with modern critical scholarship (Gunkel, form criticism) by corrective emphasis on canonical and theological reading.
 - Resonant with conservative/evangelical commentators (e.g., Kidner, Kidner-style sensitivity to genre) and indebted to historic Christian readings of the Psalms.
 - Dialogues with NT uses of the Psalms - Paul, Hebrews, the Gospels and the apostles - to ground Christ-centred interpretation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (psalms as God-speaking to his people)
 - **Covenant** and corporate identity of Israel / Church
 - **Christology** (typology and fulfillment; messianic readings)
 - **Worship and Prayer** (psalms as pattern for prayer and liturgy)
 - **Sin, repentance, forgiveness, and eschatology** (including handling of imprecatory material)
- **Closing line**
 - Aims to recover the Psalms as God-given prayer that forms the church's life and points to Christ, rendered in language that can be prayed daily.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the Psalms primarily as prayers to be prayed, not merely texts to be analyzed; translation choices favor vocative immediacy and liturgical usability.
 - Firm, consistent **Christ-in-OT** posture: Psalms are read through their fulfillment in Christ and through NT appropriation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects modern fragmentary/form-critical readings by reasserting the Psalms' function within the covenant community and canonical context.
 - Contrasts with loose paraphrase devotionals by keeping closer to Hebrew structure and theological intent while remaining readable.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Presents the Psalter as a **daily liturgical curriculum** - a translation organized to shape a day's prayer life.
 - Emphasizes the Psalms as **God's speech** rather than merely human speech about God.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Favorably received in evangelical and Reformed circles as a usable devotional tool and example of theologically informed translation.
 - Adopted by pastors and laity for daily prayer, preaching aids, and as a bridge between scholarship and devotional practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating responsible exegesis, canonical theology, and devotional formation; useful in preaching, pastoral care, and teaching Christ-centered biblical theology.
