### TITLE
The Canon of Scripture (1988) - F. F. Bruce

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical scholarship; Bruce writing as an established Biblical historian and apologist. Meets post-Enlightenment critical scholarship with conservative conclusions. Part of an ongoing evangelical recovery of historical-critical methods applied to canonical questions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian canon is historically grounded, ecclesially received, and can be shown to be both the product of recognitive ecclesial judgment and the locus of divine revelation; claims for arbitrary or late invention of the canon are historically unsustainable.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of evidence from Jewish and early Christian sources tracing development of authoritative writings.
 - Shows continuity and divergence between the Jewish canon (Tanakh/Masoretic tradition) and Christian use of the Septuagint.
 - Lays out criteria used by early communities: **apostolicity**, **orthodoxy** (conformity to the rule of faith), **antiquity**, and **catholicity** (widespread use).
 - Examines key historical moments and documents (Marcion, Muratorian Fragment, Eusebius, Athanasius, Jerome, Councils of Hippo/Carthage) to show recognition rather than invention of the canon.
 - Concludes with implications for the authority and sufficiency of Scripture in church life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages ancient sources: Septuagint, Philo, Josephus, Marcion, Muratorian Fragment, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, Jerome; councils (Hippo, Carthage).
 - Interacts with modern critics who posit late or arbitrary canonical formation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (implicit and explicit), ecclesial authority, tradition vs. Scripture, principles of textual transmission, implications for doctrine and practice.
- **Closing line**
 - Bruce argues that the canon is best understood as the church's recognitive act upon writings that already functioned as authoritative, thereby preserving both historical accountability and theological authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the *recognition* model: the church identified inspired writings rather than constituting them by decree.
 - Balances historical-critical evidence with a conservative affirmation of a closed canon.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects skeptical reconstructions that treat the canon as arbitrary or purely late ecclesiastical invention.
 - Moderates overly confessional or dogmatic claims that ignore the contingent historical processes by which texts achieved reception.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operationalization of classical canonical criteria in historically demonstrable terms; tight distinction between use, acceptance, and formal closure of the canon.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and conservative academic circles as a concise, historically informed defense of the canon.
 - Used in ecumenical conversations for its fair handling of the Apocrypha and Septuagint while defending Protestant canonical boundaries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined historical theology: careful primary-source work combined with theological sensitivity; remains a standard introductory treatment for students and pastors.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon**
 - The list of books acknowledged as authoritative Scripture; Bruce emphasizes *recognition* by the church.
- **Closed canon**
 - The position that no further writings are to be admitted as Scripture; Bruce argues closure was effectively achieved in early centuries.
- **Septuagint (LXX)**
 - Greek OT used by earliest Christians; central to understanding divergences between Jewish and Christian canons.
- **Masoretic Text**
 - The Hebrew text tradition that later became normative in Judaism and influenced Protestant OT boundaries.
- **Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical books**
 - Books in LXX but not in the Hebrew canon; Bruce treats their varied reception and the pragmatic use by early Christians.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Criterion of connection to the apostles or apostolic circle; a prime determinant for New Testament acceptance.
- **Orthodoxy (Rule of Faith)**
 - Conformity to the church's received teaching; texts contrary to the rule were excluded.
- **Catholicity (universality)**
 - Wide and sustained use across diverse Christian communities; weighty in recognition.
- **Antiquity**
 - Early date and provenance constitute evidential weight for authenticity and authority.
- **Patristic attestation**
 - Testimony of the Church Fathers as primary evidence for canonical recognition.
- **Muratorian Fragment**
 - Early list of NT books; used by Bruce to show partial canonization by late 2nd century.
- **Marcion**
 - His truncated canon and theology prompted clarifying responses that sharpened canonical identity.
- **Councils of Hippo/Carthage & Athanasius' 39th Festal Letter**
 - Key nodes showing ecclesial acknowledgment of New Testament corpus.
- **Recognition vs. Creation**
 - Bruce's central analytic distinction: the church recognizes inspired texts rather than creates them by vote.
- **Inspiration (operational)**
 - Treated historically: texts functioned as inspired in usage and attestation before formal lists.

- How this work is used:
 - As a concise historical survey and definition source on canonical formation for classrooms and pastors.
 - As a polemical resource against radical skepticism about the antiquity or authority of Scripture.
 - As a model exegetical-historical approach when arguing for the church's role in recognizing, not inventing, Scriptural authority.
