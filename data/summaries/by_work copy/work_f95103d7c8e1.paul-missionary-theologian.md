### TITLE
Paul: Missionary Theologian - Robert L. Reymond

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century conservative Reformed milieu; reaction to both liberal historical-critical and some revisionist "new perspective" Paul scholarship.
 - Written for seminary-level readers who require integration of exegetical detail and systematic theology with mission praxis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul must be read first as a **missionary theologian**: his theology is not an abstract system but arises from apostolic proclamation and missionary praxis. Theology and mission are reciprocal-doctrine grounds mission and mission tests doctrine.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory: situates Paul within first-century Jewish-Gentile tensions and missionary contexts.
 - Exegetical core: detailed readings of key Pauline texts (e.g., Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians, Acts episodes) showing theology formed in proclamation.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Gospel kerygma as the hermeneutical key for Pauline theology.
 - Soteriology (justification, union with Christ) read in missionary terms: proclamation effects conversion and forms congregations.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments tied to apostolic mission.
 - Eschatology furnishes urgency and shape for missionary enterprise.
 - Systematic implications: reconciliation of Pauline emphases with Reformed doctrines (notably **divine decrees, election and reprobation**, and anthropology).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary Pauline scholarship broadly (historians and theologians), critics who separate theology from praxis, and Reformed systematicians.
 - Implicit and explicit dialogue with proponents of the New Perspective on Paul, liberal-critical historians, and classical Reformed writers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant theology, Trinity (as background), Christology and union with Christ, soteriology (justification), election and reprobation, anthropology (discusses **trichotomy vs dichotomy**), ecclesiology, sacraments, mission, and eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - Reymond's center of gravity: **Paulian theology is missionary theology-doctrine is baptismal and missional in origin and must be read from the pulpit of proclamation into the world.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Labels Paul explicitly as a "missionary theologian," insisting that mission is constitutive for theological method.
 - Prioritizes kerygmatic proclamation over abstract doctrinal schemata in reconstructing Pauline theology.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back against approaches that abstract Paul's theology from his missionary context (both liberal historicists and some systematicians).
 - Offers a corrective to versions of the New Perspective that underplay traditional Reformed emphases (notably God's decrees and particular election).

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Treats "missionary theology" as a methodological category: theology that is normative because it issues from apostolic proclamation and forms congregational life.
 - Reframes soteriological loci (justification, union with Christ) in terms of missionary efficacy and proclamation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminary settings as a corrective integration of mission and doctrine.
 - Used as a counterbalance in debates with revisionist Pauline scholarship; less influential in broader critical academic Paul studies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable exegetical model demonstrating how apostolic speech-acts generate theological content.
 - Valuable for pastors and missionaries who need theology rooted in proclamation and praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missionary theology** - theology whose content and method derive from apostolic proclamation and missionary context.
- **Kerygma / apostolic proclamation** - the preached gospel as the primary source for theological reflection.
- **Gospel kerygma** - the core proclamation (Christ crucified, risen, Lord) that structures Paul's theology.
- **Justification by faith** - central Pauline soteriological doctrine read as a missionary proclamation effecting reconciliation.
- **Union with Christ** - relational locus for soteriology and ecclesiology; grounds sanctification and corporate identity.
- **Divine decrees / Election and Reprobation** - Reymond defends classical Reformed readings, arguing Paul's letters presuppose God's salvific counsel and particular election.
 - Uses Pauline texts to affirm divine sovereignty in election without excusing human responsibility.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy** - treats anthropological language in Paul; Reymond reads Pauline anthropology in service of ecclesial and soteriological claims, aligning with a functional dichotomy (body and soul/spirit intimately united) rather than speculative tripartite ontologies.
- **Covenant theology** - Paul's theological vocabulary integrated into covenantal narratives and corporate election.
- **Ecclesiology / Church as missional** - church constituted by mission and sacraments; mission is intrinsic to church identity.
- **Eschatology** - future hope that supplies missionary urgency and defines the scope of proclamation.
- **Soteriological primacy of proclamation** - the idea that soteriology emerges from proclamation, not from abstract metaphysical systems.
- **Proclamation-constituted congregation** - congregations are the practical outworking of apostolic kerygma.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for integrating mission and doctrine in homiletics and missiology courses.
 - As a **polemic** resource against reductionist readings of Paul (both liberal historicist and New Perspective extremes).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts with priority to proclamation and congregational formation.
