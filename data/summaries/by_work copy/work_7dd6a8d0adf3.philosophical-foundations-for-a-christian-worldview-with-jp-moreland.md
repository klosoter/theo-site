### TITLE
Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview (eds. J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig) - notes on William Lane Craig's contributions: chapters treating **Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, and the Problem of Evil** and the philosophical defense of **Existence and Knowability of God** (notably the Kalam cosmological argument and epistemic claims about God's knowability).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century analytic evangelical project (IVP Academic milieu). A sustained attempt to bring analytic philosophy tools to bear on core Christian doctrines for apologetics and systematic theology.
 - Intersects contemporary metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and natural theology amid debates with naturalism, Open Theism, and process theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Provide rigorous philosophical grounding for classical Christian theism: show God exists and is epistemically accessible; reconcile divine omniscience and providential sovereignty with genuine creaturely freedom and the reality of evil.

- **Core argument / structure (Craig's major moves)**
 - Existence and knowability of God
 - Defense of the Kalam cosmological argument: (1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause; (2) the universe began to exist; (3) therefore the universe has a cause - identified with a personal, transcendent Creator.
 - Arguments against actual infinities in temporal regress and appeal to contemporary cosmology (Big Bang) to ground premise (2).
 - Epistemic claim: metaphysical arguments together with cumulative case (cosmology, fine-tuning, morality) render God reasonably knowable by natural theology and rational inquiry.
 - Divine foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil
 - Endorses **Molinism (middle knowledge)**: God knows, prior to divine willing, what free creatures would do in any possible circumstance (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom); God actualizes a world in light of these truths.
 - Uses middle knowledge to reconcile **libertarian freedom** with exhaustive divine foreknowledge and to provide resources for a robust providence (God can providentially order events without causal coercion).
 - Applies Molinism to theodicy: God's world-actualization can explain why gratuitous-appearing evils are instrumentally necessary for greater goods that require free choices.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Molina, Plantinga (free will defense and transworld depravity debate), contemporary defenders of Open Theism, Humean skeptics, and scientific literature on cosmology.
 - Places analytic logic, modal philosophy (counterfactuals), and contemporary metaphysics at the service of classical Christian commitments.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes: omniscience, omnipotence, aseity.
 - Providence, predestination vs. human freedom, creation (beginning), natural theology, and theodicy.
 - Epistemology of religious belief (rational justification for belief in God).

- **Closing line**
 - Craig's contributions aim to integrate rigorous analytic proofs of God's existence with a Molinist account of providence that preserves libertarian freedom - a programmatic defense of a philosophically respectable, theologically orthodox Christian theism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Synthesis of scientific cosmology with classical apologetic arguments (Kalam) and strong commitment to middle knowledge as the best route to reconcile foreknowledge with libertarian freedom.
 - Prioritizes modal and counterfactual analysis (middle knowledge) over compatibilist or Open Theist solutions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Open Theism (which limits divine foreknowledge) and against deterministic compatibilism by retaining genuine libertarian freedom.
 - Challenges atheistic appeals to actual infinities and steady-state cosmologies; disputes simple causal or randomistic readings of cosmic origins.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Technical deployment of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCF)** as the core explanatory device for providence.
 - Systematic linking of world-actualization choice (God's free creative decision) with middle knowledge to explain providential ordering.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence in evangelical analytic theology and apologetics; widely taught as a model of philosophical theology.
 - Criticized by Open Theists, some Reformed critics (concerns about divine sovereignty and metaphysical priority of God's will), and by philosophers skeptical of counterfactual grounding.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a paradigmatic exemplar of analytic theistic argumentation and a sustained attempt to render doctrines of providence and divine knowledge philosophically coherent and pedagogically useful.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kalam cosmological argument** - defense that the universe began to exist and therefore has a cause; used to ground God's existence.
- **Actual infinity** - Craig argues against the coherence of actual infinities in temporal series.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism)** - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any circumstance; central to Craig's providence solution.
 - **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCF)** - the specific propositions known in middle knowledge that ground God's providential choices.
- **Libertarian freedom** - free will incompatible with determinism; preserved by Molinism in Craig's account.
- **Divine foreknowledge** - exhaustive knowledge of future free actions; reconciled with freedom via middle knowledge.
- **Providence** - God's ordering of contingencies without coercion; explained through world-actualization informed by middle knowledge.
- **Problem of evil / theodicy** - assessed with Molinist resources to show plausibility of greater-good explanations relying on free agents.
- **Knowability of God** - claim that God is accessible to rational inquiry via cumulative case (cosmological, teleological, moral arguments).
- **World-actualization** - God's choice of which feasible world to actualize, made with middle knowledge in view.
- **Transworld depravity** - relevant Plantinga concept in the libertarian debate; Craig engages it indirectly in defending middle knowledge.
- **Explanatory priority** - debate over whether God's knowledge or will has metaphysical priority; Craig leans toward a model where middle knowledge informs divine choice.
- **Natural theology** - use of philosophic arguments and science to make God reasonably knowable.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and argument source** for Kalam cosmological argument and defenses of Molinism.
- As a **polemic** against Open Theism, process theology, and naturalistic objections to divine attributes.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on divine attributes, providence, and analytic theodicy - model case for integrating metaphysics, modal logic, and apologetics.
