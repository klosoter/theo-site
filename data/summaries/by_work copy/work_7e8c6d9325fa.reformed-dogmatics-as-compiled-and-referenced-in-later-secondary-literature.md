### TITLE
Francis Turretin, Reformed Dogmatics (Institutes of Elenctic Theology as received in later secondary literature)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism at Geneva (Turretin, 1623-1687). Mature post-Reformation orthodoxy after Dort, engaging Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Socinian, and Remonstrant opponents. Scholastic quaestio method; later consolidated under the rubric Reformed Dogmatics in secondary literature.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To articulate and defend classical Reformed orthodoxy by rigorous distinctions under Scripture's principium, securing God's glory and the church's assurance in salvation by grace alone through Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Prolegomena:** Nature of theology; principia; Scripture's authority, inspiration, canon, clarity; faith's certainty.
 - **Theology Proper:** Divine being and attributes (simplicity, immutability), will and decree (providence, concurrence).
 - **Trinity:** One essence, three persons; personal properties; processions; filioque; ad intra/ad extra.
 - **Creation & Providence:** First and second causes; contingency and necessity; compatibilist freedom.
 - **Anthropology & Sin:** Image of God; covenant of works; original sin; immediate imputation of Adam's guilt and propagation of corruption.
 - **Christology:** Person of the Mediator; two natures; states; offices; rejection of ubiquity; extra Calvinisticum.
 - **Soteriology:** Covenant of grace; calling, regeneration, faith, repentance; justification (forensic; imputed active and passive obedience), adoption, sanctification, perseverance; definite atonement.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** Nature and marks of the church; Baptism and Lord's Supper as signs and seals; spiritual presence; against transubstantiation and consubstantiation.
 - **Ethics & Civil Polity:** Law and Gospel; third use; magistrate's bounded role; against papal supremacy.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Augustine, Aquinas, Lombard; Reformed predecessors (Calvin, Beza, Junius, Ames); councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon, Trent); opponents (Bellarmine, Socinians, Arminians/Remonstrants, Lutherans on communicatio idiomatum).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; God and decree; Trinity; creation and providence; anthropology; sin; covenants; Christology; atonement; ordo salutis; ecclesiology; sacraments; eschatological hope.
- **Center of gravity:** **God's glory in the covenantal economy of grace, secured by Christ's satisfaction and imputed righteousness, as normed by Scripture and clarified through precise distinctions.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Elenctic method:** Systematic refutation joined to positive exposition; careful thesis/antithesis and objection/reply structure.
- **Principial clarity:** Scripture as **autopistos** and principal external norm; the Spirit as internal principle of certainty.
- **Covenantal federalism:** Strong doctrine of **covenant of works** (Adam as federal head) and **covenant of grace** (Christ as second Adam).
- **Forensic soteriology:** **Justification by imputation** of Christ's active and passive obedience; faith as **instrument**, not material or formal cause.
- **Atonement:** Penal satisfaction; definite atonement with classic sufficiency/efficiency distinction.
- **Trinitarian orthodoxy:** **Simplicity** safeguarded with real personal distinctions; filioque; indivisible external works with fitting appropriations.
- **Christological precision:** Rejection of Lutheran **ubiquity**; communication of properties is personal, not natural; extra Calvinisticum maintained.
- **Freedom and providence:** Compatibilist human freedom; strong doctrine of **concurrence** and secondary causes.
- **Scripture doctrine:** Verbal-plenary inspiration, inerrancy, perspicuity; use of internal/external arguments without collapsing authority into proofs.
- **Sacramental efficacy:** Efficacy by the Spirit through the Word; spiritual real presence; infant baptism on covenantal grounds.
- **Reception and influence:** Standard-bearer for Reformed orthodoxy; formative for Princeton (Hodge, Warfield), Old School Presbyterianism, Bavinck's refinements; a go-to in secondary literature as a definition-rich, polemically alert dogmatics.
- **Enduring value:** Dense conceptual toolkit and distinctions that stabilize doctrinal formulations and pedagogy across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elenctic theology:** Dogmatics by refutation; clarifies truth via tested distinctions.
- **Principium cognoscendi (externum/internum):** Scripture's authority and the Spirit's testimony as grounds of theological knowledge.
- **Autopistia Scripturae:** Scripture's self-authentication; grounds faith's certainty without circularity collapse.
- **Archetypal vs. ectypal theology:** God's self-knowledge vs. our finite, revealed participation (via Junius).
- **Divine simplicity:** God is not composed; safeguards immutability and aseity.
- **Ad intra vs. ad extra; opera indivisa:** Internal Trinitarian processions vs. undivided external works with fitting appropriations.
- **Decree (efficacious/permissive):** One simple decree distinguished by effects; permits evil without authoring it.
- **Concurrence and secondary causes:** God's universal causality sustains real creaturely agency; compatibilism.
- **Covenant of works / grace:** Federal heads (Adam/Christ); law and gospel properly distinguished yet harmonized.
- **Original sin and imputation:** Immediate imputation of Adam's guilt; propagation of corruption by generation.
- **Active and passive obedience of Christ:** Whole-life law-keeping and penal suffering imputed to believers.
- **Justification (forensic; instrumental faith):** Righteousness imputed as formal cause; faith alone as instrument; excludes infusion and faith formed by love.
- **Satisfaction and definite atonement:** Penal substitution with sufficiency/efficiency distinction.
- **Communicatio idiomatum (personal):** Predication to the person; denies natural communication and ubiquity of the human nature.
- **Filioque and personal properties:** Paternity, filiation, spiration; Spirit proceeds from Father and Son.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals:** Spiritual presence; efficacy tied to Word and Spirit, not ex opere operato.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed distinctions and causes.
 - As a **polemical touchstone** against Roman, Socinian, Remonstrant, and Lutheran positions.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** integrating Scripture with scholastic precision.
 - As a **system-wide scaffold** for soteriology, sin, Trinity, Christology, pneumatology, and theology proper.
