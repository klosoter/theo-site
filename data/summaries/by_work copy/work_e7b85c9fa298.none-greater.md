### TITLE
None Greater: The Undomesticated Attributes of God - Matthew Barrett

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical-Reformed moment (early 21st century). Written for a churchgoing, theologically literate audience concerned that popular piety has softened classical talk about God. Situated within the broader recovery of classical theism and pastoral theology against therapeutic and consumerist distortions of doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God must not be domesticated to fit human tastes or therapeutic religion. A biblical and ecclesial recovery of God's attributes-especially his otherness, holiness, and sovereignty-reorients worship, assurance, and Christian life.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of key divine attributes presented as "undomesticated" (incommunicable and communicable).
 - Exegetical-theological defense of each attribute, emphasizing biblical texts and classical confessions.
 - Pastoral implications: how right doctrine of God shapes prayer, worship, evangelism, and pastoral care.
 - Polemic: correction of contemporary distortions that sentimentalize, domesticate, or marginalize certain attributes (e.g., wrath, transcendence).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy appeal to Scripture and historic Reformed resources (Calvin, Augustine, Aquinas selectively, Owen, Edwards, confessions). Dialogues with contemporary evangelical theologians and popular piety; implicit or explicit contrasts with process theology, open theism, prosperity teaching, and consumerized Christianity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Theology proper (divine attributes broadly), revelation, providence, holiness, sovereignty, wrath and love, immutability, simplicity, aseity, transcendence/immanence, worship and prayer.
- **Closing line:** Barrett insists that a robust, undomesticated doctrine of God-biblically rooted and pastorally applied-is indispensable for true worship, faithful theology, and gospel-shaped Christian life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uses the language of "undomesticated attributes" to capture tension between God's accessibility and God's otherness.
 - Marries classical metaphysical categories (simplicity, immutability) with pastoral concerns, not merely abstract speculation.
- **Corrections or contrasts:** 
 - Counters sentimental and pragmatic renderings of God common in popular Christianity by insisting that love, grace, and mercy must be read alongside wrath, holiness, and sovereignty.
 - Pushes back against theological trends that over-accommodate human experience (e.g., open theism, process thought) by reaffirming divine transcendence and providential control.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - "Undomesticated" as a pedagogical term to describe attributes that resist domestication and require doctrinal discipline to preserve.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles for combining rigorous doctrine with pastoral application; used in seminary classrooms and pastoral training.
 - Appreciated as a corrective in contexts where experiential or therapeutic religion has shaped congregational expectations of God.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Durable resource for teaching theology proper and for forming worshipers who can hold biblical tensions without reducing God to a construct of human preference.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Undomesticated attributes:** Attributes of God that resist being tamed by human preference; central framing device.
- **Incommunicable attributes:** Divine properties not shared with creatures (aseity, immutability, simplicity, omnipresence, eternity).
- **Communicable attributes:** Attributes shared analogically with creatures (love, wisdom, holiness in a creaturely sense).
- **Sovereignty:** God's lordship over creation and history; emphasized to ground providence and comfort amid suffering.
- **Holiness:** God's moral otherness; anchor for worship, repentance, and ecclesial purity.
- **Wrath and love (tension):** Affirmed as co-constitutive of biblical revelation of God-love does not negate righteous anger, nor does wrath cancel grace.
- **Immutability & simplicity:** Classical metaphysical claims defended as essential to biblical theism and trustworthiness of God.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; used pastorally to guard against idolatrous dependency on creaturely explanations.
- **Transcendence vs. Immanence:** Balanced recovery-God is supremely other yet present and active in providence and redemption.
- **Revelation:** Scripture as primary medium to know God's attributes; hermeneutic emphasis throughout.
- **Providence:** Practical outworking of sovereignty; frames pastoral assurance and prayer.
- **Domestication (as critique):** The process Barrett diagnoses where human desires reshape deity; used polemically.
- **Pastoral application:** How doctrine informs worship, preaching, assurance, and pastoral care.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for teaching theology proper in seminary or catechesis-concise, pastorally-inflected definitions of attributes.
 - As a **polemic** against domesticated/therapeutic conceptions of God in contemporary evangelical practice.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading attribute-passage texts (e.g., Psalms, prophetic oracle, New Testament doxologies) with both doctrinal and pastoral sensitivity.
