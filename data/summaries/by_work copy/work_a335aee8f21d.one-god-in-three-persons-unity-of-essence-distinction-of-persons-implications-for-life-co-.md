### TITLE
One God in Three Persons: Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons, Implications for Life (co-edited with John Starke, 2015) - Bruce Ware & John Starke

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑2010s evangelical theological milieu amid heightened debate over Trinitarian language and the role of the Son vis-a-vis the Father.
 - Edited volume format addressing both systematic and pastoral concerns; intersects debates about complementarianism and the doctrine of the Trinity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reaffirm classical Trinitarian convictions: there is one divine essence and three distinct persons whose personal relations have significance for doctrine and life.
 - Primary contested point: whether there is an **eternal relational ordering** (authority/submission) within the Godhead that is consistent with ontological equality.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical retrieval: patristic and medieval affirmations of unity and distinction (Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine).
 - Biblical exegesis: close readings of Johannine, Pauline, and synoptic texts that speak to intra‑Trinitarian relations (e.g., John 5-17; Phil 2; Matt 28).
 - Theological construction: careful distinction between **ontological equality** (essence, attributes) and **relational order** (personal relations of origin, authority, mission).
 - Practical implications: how Trinitarian relations inform worship, church polity, and gender/household ethics without lapsing into ontological subordinationism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical church fathers and major systematicians; engagement with contemporary evangelical interlocutors on both sides of the Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) debate.
 - Implicit and explicit critiques of modern social‑Trinitarian analogies and of readings that erase substantive personal relations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (incarnation and Son's role), revelation (Scripture's Trinitarian witness), ecclesiology and ethics (implications for authority and submission).
- **Closing line**
 - The volume argues that a robust Trinitarian theology must hold the unity of essence and the real, eternal distinction of persons together - including a permanent relational ordering - and that this theological balance has direct consequences for doctrine, worship, and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Firm insistence on maintaining **ontological equality** while arguing for **eternal relational ordering** (authority/submission) between Father and Son as genuinely personal, not merely economic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against social/constitutional models that collapse personal distinctions into sociological analogies.
 - Rejection of egalitarian or anti‑EFS readings that claim any eternal ordering implies inferiority of essence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precision in language distinguishing **ontological** (being/attributes) and **relational/functional** (role/authority) categories to avoid historic subordinationist heresy while allowing functional distinctions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative evangelical and complementarian circles as a theological foundation for arguments about gender roles and church authority.
 - Criticized by some theologians and egalitarians who see the EFS formulation as vulnerable to subtler forms of subordinationism or as importing cultural gender norms into doctrine.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, accessible bridge from historical Trinitarian theology to contemporary ecclesial controversies; valuable for pastors and teachers needing biblico‑theological resources linking doctrine to practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Unity of essence** - the one divine ousia shared by Father, Son, Spirit; affirms divine simplicity and attribute unity.
- **Persons (hypostases)** - three real, distinct subsistences; relations of origin (begetting/spirating) mark personal distinction.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - the claim that the Son eternally submits to the Father in role/authority while remaining ontologically equal.
 - Distinguished from ontological subordination (rejected).
- **Ontological equality** - equality of nature, attributes, and divinity; non‑negotiable to avoid heresy.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity** - distinction between God's internal life (immanent) and God's actions in history (economic); work argues continuity between the two.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling)** - relational unity of persons; used to defend both equality and personal distinction without fusion.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - classical claim of Father as source/origin among persons; reinterpreted in light of relational ordering debates.
- **Relational order** - the ordered personal relations (authority, submission, mission) within the Trinity.
- **Submission (eternal, relational)** - defined as a voluntary, personal relation within the Godhead, not a lack of being or worth.
- **Authority (intra‑Trinitarian)** - relational governance that the work locates as eternal and personal, correlating to church/family structures.
- **Subordinationism (ontological vs. functional)** - critical categories; the work rejects ontological but accepts a functional category with careful safeguards.
- **Biblical loci** - Johannine and Pauline passages treated as primary exegetical anchors for intra‑Trinitarian relations.
- **Practical implications** - applied to ecclesiology, household order, and pastoral theology as downstream effects of Trinitarian ordering.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** and theological justification for EFS in complementarian ethics.
 - As a **polemic** against readings that deny eternal relational distinctions or that equate submission with ontological inferiority.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Johannine and Pauline texts in Trinitarian key.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in conservative evangelical teaching linking doctrine (Trinity) to church practice and gender roles.
