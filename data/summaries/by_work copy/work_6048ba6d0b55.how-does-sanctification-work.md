### TITLE
How Does Sanctification Work? - David Powlison

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed pastoral-theological milieu (late 20th-early 21st century). Emerges from the biblical counseling movement (CCEF influence) and pastoral care praxis, seeking to integrate traditional Reformed doctrine with counseling practice and critiques of secular psychology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Sanctification is the Spirit-wrought, gospel-mediated renewal of the heart that issues in progressive conformity to Christ; understanding its mechanisms corrects both moralistic attempts at self-improvement and purely forensic accounts that neglect experiential change.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Biblical-theological foundation: sanctification grounded in union with Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit; Scripture supplies both the warrant and the means.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: interplay of **positional** (what Christ has done) and **progressive** (what God does in us over time) aspects; sanctification is neither purely instantaneous nor merely gradual moralism.
 - Practical/pastoral outworking: gospel-centered diagnosis and care (identify heart idols, reshape desires), the role of means of grace (Word, Spirit, prayer, community) and faithful disciplines, and the importance of pastoral patience and accountability.
 - Counseling implications: theological categories should inform psychological diagnosis-sin is primarily heart-level idolatry, not only behavior; counseling must address beliefs, desires, and the power of the gospel to reorient motives.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** draws on Reformed and Puritan emphases (e.g., Calvinian union with Christ, Puritan attention to affections and heart), engages contemporary counseling trends and critiques secular psychotherapy and simplistic behaviorist models.
- **Doctrines treated:** sanctification, justification/positional union with Christ, the Holy Spirit, conversion, repentance, faith, means of grace, ecclesiology (church as context), anthropology (sinful heart, affections).
- **Closing line:** Sanctification works because God, through the Spirit and by the power of the gospel applied in means of grace, progressively reshapes believers' hearts and lives-faithful pastoral care must aim to bring gospel truth to bear on the inner dynamics (beliefs, desires, idols) that produce observable change.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Gospel-centeredness as mechanism:** Powlison insists the gospel itself is the principal instrument of change, not merely the initial declaration; this gospel reorients motives, not just legal standing.
- **Heart/affectional emphasis:** Moves beyond external behavior-change approaches to focus on internal desires and idols as the causal center of sin and sanctification.
- **Integration of theology and counseling:** Uses theological categories to frame counseling diagnostics-sin as narrative/idolatry, need for renewed affections-rather than adopting secular diagnostic frameworks uncritically.
- **Corrective to rivals:**
 - Against moralism: rejects methods that make sanctification a program of self-effort and law-keeping apart from gospel reliance.
 - Against therapeutic secularization: resists reducing sanctification to psychological adjustment or techniques without theological content.
 - Against purely forensic views: supplements positional justification with robust attention to sanctifying change and means.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Emphasizes the language of "idols of the heart" as diagnostic tools and the notion that gospel application is both declarative and formative.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly influential in the biblical counseling movement and Reformed pastoral training; used widely in counseling curricula, pastoral seminars, and church-based discipleship as a model for gospel-driven care.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a compact, pastorally oriented theology of sanctification that connects doctrinal precision with practical diagnostic and remedial steps for shepherding change.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification:** Progressive renewal of the believer in holiness by the Spirit; involves both positional realities and practical growth.
- **Positional justification:** The legal, once-for-all standing believers have in Christ; foundational but distinct from progressive sanctification.
- **Progressive sanctification:** The ongoing process of becoming like Christ; involves means and requires gospel application.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological ground for all benefits (including sanctification); union explains why the gospel effects actual heart change.
- **Holy Spirit:** The agent who applies Christ to the believer and effects transformation through the Word and means.
- **Gospel-centered care/application:** The practice of using gospel truths not only to declare forgiveness but to reframe desires, reshape motives, and motivate obedience.
- **Means of grace:** Primary instruments (Word, prayer, sacraments, community) through which the Spirit ordinarily works sanctification.
- **Heart/affections:** The inner life (desires, loves) identified as the primary locus of sin and target of sanctification.
- **Idols of the heart:** False loves or substitutes for God that drive sin; diagnostic category for pastoral counseling.
- **Repentance and faith:** Twin responses that are both gifts and duties; repentance reorients the will, faith trusts Christ-both are means of growth.
- **Diagnostic theology:** The method of identifying underlying theological/affections-based causes for symptomatic behavior.
- **Behavior vs. root:** Distinction between observable actions (symptoms) and underlying heart motivations (root causes).
- **Gospel as instrumental, not merely declarative:** The claim that gospel truth forms and sustains holy affections, not merely pronounces status.
- **Pastoral patience/means-centeredness:** Emphasis on long obedience in small means rather than quick fixes.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for gospel-centered sanctification in pastoral and counseling curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against moralistic and secular therapeutic models of change.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** for pastors: diagnostic categories (idols/affections) and means-oriented remedies for discipleship and counseling.
