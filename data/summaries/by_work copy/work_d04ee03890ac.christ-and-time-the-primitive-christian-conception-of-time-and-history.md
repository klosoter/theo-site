### TITLE
**Christ and Time: The Primitive Christian Conception of Time and History** 
Oscar Cullmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - First published 1946 (German), rev. eds. 1951, 1962, amid the postwar Biblical Theology movement.
 - Written against cyclical or timeless conceptions of reality (Hellenistic, idealist) and against existential demythologizing (Bultmann) and fully realized eschatology (C. H. Dodd).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Primitive Christianity understands revelation as linear **Heilsgeschichte** (salvation history). The decisive midpoint is the **Christ-event** (incarnation, cross, resurrection, exaltation), which inaugurates the end but leaves a real future consummation at the **Parousia**. Christian time is neither cyclical nor timeless but historical, teleological, and Christocentric.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical time: from creation toward the goal; contrast with Greek timelessness and cyclical myths.
 - OT line to NT fulfillment: prophetic-apocalyptic horizon clarifies the NT sense of the nearness of the kingdom.
 - The Christ-event as center: victory achieved, death and powers decisively broken; yet enemies not finally removed.
 - Classic image: **D-Day vs V-Day** to explain the interval and the apparent **delay of the Parousia**.
 - **Two ages** schema: this age vs the age to come, now overlapped in the church s existence; sacraments as **proleptic** signs.
 - **Realized vs future eschatology**: inaugurated, not exhausted; corrects both over-realization (Dodd) and pure futurism (Schweitzer).
 - **Christ s messianic consciousness and kingdom**: Jesus knows himself as Messiah and inaugurator of the kingdom; no reduction to community projection.
 - **Individual and cosmic eschatology**: personal resurrection bound to the cosmic **new heavens and new earth**; critiques Greek **immortality of the soul** in favor of **resurrection of the dead** (eschatological anthropology).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages NT corpora (Synoptics, Paul, John, Hebrews), Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic, early church; debates Bultmann, Dodd, Schweitzer; in conversation with the Biblical Theology movement and history-of-religions scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and history; Trinity and providence implicitly; **Christology** (kingdom, messianic identity); **Eschatology** (Parousia, resurrection, two ages); **Soteriology** as **historia salutis** over against individualized **ordo salutis**; **Anthropology/Creation** (time, death, creation s renewal).
- **Center of gravity**
 - Christ as Lord of time: the church lives between decisive victory and final consummation, ordered to hope, mission, and patient endurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Linear, Christ-centered temporality; primacy of event over idea. 
 - D-Day/V-Day analogy clarifying inaugurated eschatology and the **delay of the Parousia**. 
 - Sacraments and church life as historical foretastes of the end.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Dodd s realized eschatology: insists on robust futurity and final judgment/renewal. 
 - Against Bultmann s demythologizing: revelation is in history, not only existential decision. 
 - Against Greek timelessness and soul-immortality: affirms bodily resurrection and the goodness of history and creation. 
 - Rebalances emphasis from **ordo salutis** to **historia salutis**, resisting over-individualization.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Programmatic use of **Heilsgeschichte** and the mid-point timeline with cross/resurrection at the center. 
 - Clarified use of **kairos** (decisive time) within linear **chronos** (historical sequence). 
 - Integration of **individual and cosmic eschatology** under the two-ages framework.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped Reformed and evangelical biblical theology (e.g., Vos, Ridderbos; echoed by G. E. Ladd on inaugurated eschatology). 
 - Stimulated debates with Pannenberg and Moltmann on history and prolepsis; widely cited in NT eschatology. 
 - Critiqued for sharp Judaism/Hellenism contrasts and schematic linearity but remains a standard reference.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear map for teaching redemptive history; durable categories for exegesis of eschatological texts; pastoral framing of hope, mission, and patience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heilsgeschichte (salvation history)**: The linear, event-structured narrative of God s acts, climaxing in Christ.
- **Christ-event**: Incarnation-cross-resurrection-exaltation as one decisive historical complex.
- **Two ages**: This age vs the age to come; now overlap yields tension of already/not yet.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: Kingdom begun in Christ yet awaits consummation; mediates realized vs future eschatology.
- **Delay of the Parousia**: The interval for mission and sanctification; not failure but divine timetable.
- **D-Day / V-Day analogy**: Decisive victory vs final victory; interprets present conflict and hope.
- **Parousia**: Future return of Christ to consummate salvation and judgment; anchor of Christian futurity.
- **Kairos vs chronos**: Decisive moment within linear time; Christ is the fullness of time.
- **Historia salutis vs ordo salutis**: Objective-redemptive events prioritized over subjective application, though the latter flows from the former.
- **Christ s messianic consciousness and kingdom**: Jesus self-understanding as Messiah; kingdom both present and future.
- **Realized vs future eschatology**: Cullmann s balance against Dodd (over-realized) and Schweitzer (exclusive futurity).
- **Individual and cosmic eschatology**: Personal resurrection bound to cosmic renewal; the church s hope is corporate and creational.
- **Eschatological anthropology**: Rejects immortal soul as alien; affirms resurrection life through union with the risen Christ.
- **New heavens and new earth**: Final, creational renewal, not escape from history.
- **Sacramental prolepsis**: Baptism and Eucharist as anticipations of the eschaton within time.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for inaugurated eschatology and the two-ages schema in eschatology and NT theology. 
 - As a polemical resource against realized eschatology, demythologizing, and soul-immortality in anthropology. 
 - As an exegetical model for reading Scripture as salvation history centered on Christ. 
 - As a conceptual pivot shifting soteriology and ecclesiology toward mission in the interim before the Parousia.
