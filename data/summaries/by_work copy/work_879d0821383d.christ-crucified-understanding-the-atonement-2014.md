### TITLE
Christ Crucified: Understanding the Atonement (2014) - Donald Macleod

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical milieu (early 21st century). Macleod, a Scottish Reformed theologian, writes for pastors, students, and scholars amid renewed public debate over atonement (New Perspective on Paul, Christus Victor revival, popular denial of penal substitution).
 - Intended as a corrective and synthesis: rigorous exegesis plus systematic theology to recover classical Protestant accounts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The atonement is the incarnate, substitutionary, priestly work of the Son accomplishing divine justice and reconciliation. Penal substitution is biblically central but must be integrated with other biblical motifs (victory, satisfaction, exemplarism) and anchored in a robust Christology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis of key texts (Isaiah 53, Romans, Hebrews, 1 Peter, Gospel passion narratives) → theological synthesis.
 - Distinguishes and defends **penal substitution** as the primary explanation for how sin is dealt with, while showing compatibility with sacrificial/penitential and Christus Victor motifs.
 - Develops the relation between **Christ's person** (incarnation, impeccability, active/passive obedience) and his saving work.
 - Articulates the atonement within covenantal and Trinitarian frames (covenant of redemption, intra-Trinitarian sending).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Traditional patristic and medieval (Athanasius, Anselm, Augustine), Reformation (Calvin), modern defenders (B. B. Warfield) and critics (Gustaf Aulen, liberal theological trajectories, N. T. Wright).
 - Appeals to confessional Reformed texts and contemporary evangelical scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and work), soteriology (expiation, propitiation, justification), covenant theology, priesthood of Christ (munus triplex emphasis), Trinitarian relations, active and passive obedience, resurrection and victory.

- **Closing line**
 - Macleod places the cross at the theological center: the incarnate Son, by his obedient life and penal death, secures divine justice and reconciliation - a penal-substitutionary core integrated within priestly and kingly motifs.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that **penal substitution is not a crude forensic scheme** but a theologically rich, covenantal, Trinitarian act that unites objective satisfaction and subjective appropriation.
 - Strong linkage of **Christ's impeccability** with genuine temptation and real human solidarity-Christ could not sin, yet suffered fully.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both liberal reductions that deny penal or substitutionary elements and pietistic or moral-influence-only accounts that downplay objective atonement.
 - Challenges exclusive appeals to Christus Victor as replacement for penal substitution; instead, integrates victory over powers as consequence and aspect of the atonement.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a balanced taxonomy: **active obedience** (fulfillment of law) and **passive obedience** (bearing penalty) as mutually necessary for justification and covenant faithfulness.
 - Recasts **munus triplex** as an interpretive grid for locating different biblical atonement motifs without collapsing them.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and evangelical courses as a clear, pastoral yet scholarly defense of classical atonement theology.
 - Cited in polemics against the New Perspective and in works seeking a multi-faceted but orthodox account of atonement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a dependable exegetical and systematic resource that helps pastors and teachers hold together substitution, satisfaction, victory, and priestly mediation in preaching and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Penal substitution**
 - The sinner's penalty borne by Christ; for Macleod, the central biblical motif-covenantal, forensic, and sacrificial aspects unified.
- **Satisfaction**
 - Christ renders satisfaction to divine justice; connected to penal substitution and priestly mediation.
- **Substitution**
 - Christ as federal/head substitute; active/passive obedience both subsumed under substitutionary work.
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's life of law-fulfillment credited to believers.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death bearing the penalty of sin.
- **Impeccability of Christ**
 - Christ could not sin (ontological/volitional nuance emphasized) yet experienced authentic temptation and tested obedience; used to secure the moral and redemptive integrity of his work.
- **Munus triplex (prophet, priest, king)**
 - Framework to read atonement motifs:
 - **Priest** - sacrificial, mediatorial, propitiatory work.
 - **King** - victory over powers (Christus Victor dimension).
 - **Prophet** - revelation of God's righteousness and covenant summons.
- **Christus Victor**
 - Presented as complementary: the cross effects victory over evil, not an alternative to substitution.
- **Expiation vs. Propitiation**
 - Distinguishes removal of sin (expiation) and turning away God's wrath (propitiation); both attributed to Christ's work.
- **Covenant of redemption**
 - Trinitarian pact grounding substitutionary sending and passion.
- **Federal headship**
 - Adam/Christ typology; Christ as representative head securing justification for his people.
- **Objective vs. Subjective aspects**
 - Objective accomplishment (what Christ did) vs appropriation (faith, union with Christ).

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** and concise defense for penal substitution in systematic and pastoral theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** employing munus triplex to teach integrated atonement motifs (homiletics and Christology).
 - As an **exegetical model** for readings of Isaiah 53, Romans, Hebrews that seek to ground substitutionary language in covenantal and Trinitarian terms.
