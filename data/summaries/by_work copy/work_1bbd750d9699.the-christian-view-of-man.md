### TITLE
**The Christian View of Man** - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 1930s addresses amid the fundamentalist-modernist controversy; Westminster Seminary and OPC milieu; response to naturalistic psychology, evolutionary optimism, and liberal Protestantism that redefined sin and salvation in ethical-cultural terms.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture presents man as created in God's image yet fallen in Adam, morally unable to save himself; modern views (liberal, Pelagian, naturalistic) misconstrue man and therefore misconstrue the Gospel.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Revelation and authority:** Knowledge of man must be taken from Scripture, not from autonomous reason or cultural sentiment; tradition is valued yet normed by the canon.
 - **Creation and image:** Personhood, rationality, morality, and relationality flow from the imago Dei; human dignity is real but derivative.
 - **The fall and original sin:** Historical Adam and federal headship; guilt and corruption explain universal sinfulness; contrast with Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian moralism.
 - **Bondage and grace:** True freedom is not native but given in regeneration; salvation rests on Christ's work, received through **faith and repentance** produced by the Spirit.
 - **Christian life and society:** The church's spiritual mission stands distinct from the state's civil task; liberty of conscience and limits on ecclesiastical and civil authority.
 - **Hope and restoration:** Resurrection and consummation complete the renewal of human nature; eschatology grounds present ethics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine vs. Pelagius; Paul (Romans 1-5), Jesus' teaching; Reformers (Luther, Calvin); Old Princeton (Warfield); critics include Rousseau, Kant, Ritschl, Harnack, evolutionary/naturalistic psychology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and canon; creation and imago; original sin and federalism; effectual calling, regeneration, faith and repentance; sanctification; church and state; eschatological hope.
- **Closing line:** Machen's center of gravity is an Augustinian-Reformed anthropology in which the dignity of the image and the depth of the fall converge to demand sovereign grace in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uncompromising appeal to the Bible's authority for anthropology and ethics.
 - Moral realism: sin as guilt and power, not merely maladjustment or ignorance.
 - Humanism-through-grace: only the Gospel preserves genuine dignity and freedom.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**: denies native moral ability; insists on monergistic grace.
 - Against liberal Protestantism: rejects reduction of Christianity to ethics or culture; insists on historical fall and resurrection.
 - Against naturalism/psychologism: maintains irreducible spirit-personhood and conscience.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tight linkage of anthropology to Christology and soteriology: doctrine of man is unintelligible apart from cross and regeneration.
 - Clear distinction between church's spiritual mission and state's civil competence, safeguarding liberty of conscience.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Standard Reformed resource for 20th-century anthropology; cited in OPC/Presbyterian catechesis and Westminster curricula.
 - Used apologetically against modern humanistic and therapeutic accounts of the self.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarity on imago, fall, and grace; accessible yet rigorous.
 - Integrates doctrinal loci: Scripture, sin, salvation, ecclesiology, and public theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (Image of God):** Constitutes human dignity, rationality, morality, and relational capacity; marred, not erased, by sin.
- **Original Sin:** Adamic guilt and corruption conveyed to all humanity; explanatory key for universal evil and death.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam as covenant representative; Christ as second Adam who restores and surpasses.
- **Total Depravity:** Not maximal evil, but pervasive corruption affecting mind, will, and affections; grounds need for grace.
- **Regeneration (New Birth):** Sovereign Spirit-wrought renewal that precedes and enables saving response.
- **Faith and Repentance:** Twin graces receiving Christ and turning from sin; faith as knowledge, assent, and trust; repentance inseparable yet distinct. [Faith And Repentance]
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism / Augustinianism:** Competing accounts of human ability and grace; Machen sides with classic Augustinian monergism. [Pelagianism Semi Pelagianism And Augustinianism]
 - Pelagianism: denies original sin and asserts native moral ability.
 - Semi-Pelagianism: cooperation begins with unaided human will.
 - Augustinianism: grace initiates and accomplishes salvation.
- **Revelation and Canon:** Scripture as normative source for anthropology; tradition honored but subordinate, correcting cultural projections. [Canon And Tradition]
- **Naturalism:** Explains man by impersonal causes; rejected as reductionist and ethically corrosive.
- **Liberalism:** Religious-ethical program that evacuates sin and substitutionary grace; a different religion in anthropological dress.
- **Conscience:** God-given moral awareness; needs re-formation by the Word and Spirit.
- **Common Grace:** Preserves culture and restrains evil without saving; explains civic goods amid depravity.
- **Liberty of Conscience and Church-State Distinction:** Church's authority is ministerial; state's competence is civil; neither may usurp the other. [Church And State Relations]
- **Resurrection of the Body:** Eschatological restoration of human nature; anchors hope and ethics.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a polemic and analytic baseline for hamartiology and grace, especially against Pelagian trajectories.
 - As a concise source for defining faith, repentance, regeneration, and their relations.
 - As a principled account of Scripture's authority over tradition in constructing anthropology.
 - As a guide to ecclesial spirituality and civil limits in church-state discussions.
