### TITLE
The Progress of Redemption: The Story of Salvation from Creation to the New Jerusalem - Willem van Gemeren

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical Reformed biblical theology; written as a systematic biblical-theological textbook for seminary and church use. Integrates Reformed covenantal commitments with a redemptive-historical (promise-fulfillment) method.
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture tells one coherent, progressive story of redemption from creation to new creation centered on Christ: redemptive history advances by covenantal promises that find fulfillment in Christ and consummation in the New Jerusalem.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of salvation history in canonical sequence:
 - Creation and covenantal ordering of creation.
 - Fall and promise of redemption.
 - Covenantal developments: Noah, Abraham, Mosaic, Davidic.
 - Israel's history as preparation and typological training for Christ.
 - The coming of Christ as the hinge; fulfillment of the promises.
 - Church as witness and sacramental community in the already/not-yet kingdom.
 - Eschatological consummation: new heavens, new earth, New Jerusalem.
 - Method: canonical biblical theology combined with classic Reformed covenant theology - pattern of promise-fulfillment, typology, and progressive revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws implicitly on and dialogues with Geerhardus Vos (biblical theology), Reformed covenant theologians (Calvin, Warfield, Bavinck), and contemporary redemptive-historical interpreters; sets itself in contrast to dispensational frameworks.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (progressive, covenantal), covenant (including Covenant of Grace), Christology (Christ as fulfillment and center), atonement, kingdom theology, ecclesiology, sacraments/signs, eschatology (new creation).
- **Closing line**
 - A Reformed, redemptive-historical synthesis that frames all biblical instruction as the progressive unfolding of one covenantal plan of redemption that climaxes in Christ and the New Jerusalem.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **promise-fulfillment** as the hermeneutical key: types, institutions, and events in Israel are meaningful only as pointers to Christ and consummation.
 - Integrates canonical reading with systematic covenant categories without collapsing typology into allegory.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensational separations of Israel and Church by stressing covenantal continuity (see: **Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition**).
 - Refines older covenantal schemas that over-systematize by emphasizing narrative progression and redemptive-historical particulars.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Articulates a clear, teachable sequence of redemptive acts and covenants as a pedagogical model for both preaching and theology; vocabulary stresses **progress**, **fulfillment**, and **continuity in diversity**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical Reformed seminaries as a textbook; valued for clarity and pastorally oriented scholarship. Influenced campus-level biblical theology curricula and preaching series.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a concise, accessible redemptive-historical framework that models how to read the Bible Christocentrically while retaining rigorous covenantal categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemption / Progress of Redemption**
 - The unfolding rescue narrative from fall to new creation; central organizing motif.
- **Progressive Revelation**
 - God's truth disclosed incrementally in history; later revelation clarifies earlier promises.
- **Promise-Fulfillment Pattern**
 - Recurrent biblical pattern: divine promise → typological anticipation → Christ's fulfillment.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The governing covenantal structure by which God administers salvation post-fall (see: **Covenant Of Grace**).
- **Covenant Theology**
 - The theological grid that interprets Scripture as a unified covenantal economy (see: **Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition**).
- **Typology**
 - Persons/events/institutions in Israel as divinely ordained foreshadows of Christ and consummation.
- **Kingdom / Mediatorial Kingdom**
 - The rule of Christ inaugurated in the incarnation, present in the church, consummated eschatologically.
- **Already / Not-Yet**
 - Tension describing inaugurated kingdom realities present now and consummated later.
- **New Creation / New Jerusalem**
 - Eschatological climax: redeemed cosmos and the final dwelling of God with humanity.
- **Canonical Theology**
 - Emphasis on the final form of Scripture as interpretive guide; resists dissection that isolates texts from redemptive flow.
- **Christ-centered hermeneutic**
 - Reading Scripture with Christ as the interpretive center and telos.
- **Typus / Antitypus**
 - Classical distinction used to analyze prefigurements and their fulfillment in Christ.
- **Sacramental signs**
 - Covenantal rites (e.g., circumcision, baptism) as signs that fit into the larger promise-fulfillment narrative.

How this work is used:
- As a compact, systematic **definition source** for the Covenant of Grace and Reformed redemptive-historical method.
- As an **exegetical model** and pedagogical textbook for preaching and teaching Scripture in canonical, covenantal sequence.
- As a **polemic resource** against dispensationalist separations and theological atomization of biblical texts.
