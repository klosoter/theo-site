### TITLE
Finally Alive: What Happens When We Are Born Again? (2009) - John Piper

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published within the resurgence of conservative Reformed evangelicalism in the 2000s; issued under the Desiring God/solid Reformed pastoral-apologetic milieu. Aimed at pastors, church members, and evangelists seeking an accessible but theologically robust account of regeneration.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Regeneration (the new birth) is a sovereign, immediate work of God by the Holy Spirit that renders spiritually dead people alive to God, producing new desires, faith, and repentance; it is distinct from, prior to, and causal for faith rather than derivative from human decision or moral reform.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition and biblical warrant for "born again" (John 3; Titus 3; Ephesians 2): spiritual death and divine quickening.
 - Negative polemic: rejects views that identify regeneration with mere intellectual assent, moral improvement, or a human-initiated decision (e.g., easy-believism, decisionism, or some Arminian formulations).
 - Positive account: monergistic act of the Spirit creating new affections and enabling faith/repentance; union with Christ follows and secures justification and sanctification.
 - Practical implications: assurance, pastoral care, evangelism, and the necessity of preaching as the ordinary means of effectual calling.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit and explicit debts to classical Reformed theology (Augustine, Calvin, Owen), modern Reformed interlocutors, and contemporary evangelical debates with Arminian/Wesleyans and decision-theology proponents.
- **Doctrines treated:** Regeneration, effectual calling, Holy Spirit, union with Christ, conversion (faith and repentance), justification, sanctification, assurance, total depravity, divine sovereignty in salvation.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** The heart of regeneration is God's sovereign gift of new life that reorders affections toward Christ so that true faith, repentance, and sanctifying fruit flow from a fundamentally transformed inner nature.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that regeneration is primarily about renewed affections - "made alive" to relish God - aligning with Piper's pastoral emphasis on Christian Hedonism.
 - Clear pastoral framing: regeneration is not merely doctrinal but existential and experiential; it changes what people love.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Contrasts with "decision-first" models and with any scheme that presents faith as purely human-initiated choice; pushes back on forms of Arminian prevenient-grace theology that make human will decisive.
 - Clarifies difference between external calling (preaching/Word) and effectual calling (the inner, enlivening work of the Spirit).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No novel technical vocabulary, but a notable rhetorical move: linking regeneration explicitly to the concept of "being finally alive" as the defining experiential mark - life as delight and reorientation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received and disseminated in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles for clear pastoral clarity; used extensively in church teaching, small groups, and evangelism training.
 - Criticized by Reformed skeptics who caution against overly instantaneous models of sanctification and by Arminian/Wesleyan critics who defend prevenient grace or synergistic accounts.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Durable as a concise, pastoral exposition of regeneration that connects doctrine to experience and discipleship; valuable for pastors teaching soteriology or counseling to discern genuine conversion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regeneration (new birth):** The Spirit's sovereign work that imparts spiritual life to the dead; the decisive internal change that makes faith and repentance possible.
- **Effectual calling:** The inward calling by the Spirit that accomplishes what the external proclamation of the Word intends; it effectively brings the elect to life.
- **Monergism:** Emphasized theological stance that God alone effects regeneration; human will does not initiate new birth.
- **New desires / reoriented affections:** Core experiential marker-regeneration produces delight in God and a transformed hierarchy of loves.
- **Union with Christ:** The relational consequence and framework in which justification and sanctification are experienced post-regeneration.
- **Conversion (faith + repentance):** Portrayed as the fruit or concomitant of regeneration, not its efficient cause; faith and repentance flow from new life.
- **Assurance:** Grounded in the reality of new life and observable fruit, aided by the Spirit's witness and the believer's union with Christ.
- **Preaching/Word as means:** The ordinary instrument through which effectual calling commonly comes, though efficacy depends on the Spirit.
- **Total depravity:** Background presupposition that justifies monergistic necessity; unregenerate persons are spiritually dead.
- **Fruit of regeneration:** Good works, perseverance, and sanctification as evidences, not prerequisites, of new birth.
- **Sovereignty of God in salvation:** Central theological axiom shaping the whole account.
- **Christian Hedonism (affectional frame):** Regeneration as awakening to the supreme joy in God; instrumental to Piper's pastoral voice.
- **Contrast - Prevenient grace:** Treated implicitly as insufficient if conceived to make the will neutral; contrasted with effectual, enlivening grace.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a concise definitional and pastoral source for teaching regeneration and effectual calling.
 - As a polemic resource against decision-theology and synergistic accounts of new birth.
 - As an exegetical and homiletical model for preaching John 3, Titus 3, and Ephesians 2 on the new birth and spiritual quickening.
