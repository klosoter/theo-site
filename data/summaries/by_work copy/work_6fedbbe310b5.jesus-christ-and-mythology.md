### TITLE
**Jesus Christ and Mythology** - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Lectures delivered in the United States (Yale and Vanderbilt, 1951); published in English 1958.
 - Post-war crisis of meaning; rise of existential philosophy (Heidegger), form criticism, and dialectical theology.
 - Programmatic sequel to Bultmanns 1941 essay New Testament and Mythology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament proclaims saving truth in mythic forms. To speak truthfully to modern people, the church must **demythologize**: interpret myth existentially so the **kerygma** confronts hearers with a call to faith and authentic existence before God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Myth diagnosis:** NT language presupposes a three-decker cosmos, supernatural agencies, and miracle as objective interventions. Moderns cannot credibly inhabit this world-picture.
 - **Hermeneutic proposal:** Demythologizing is not subtracting miracles; it is interpreting myth to uncover its existential claim. The Word is an **event** that addresses and reconstitutes the self.
 - **Christology and kerygma:** Jesus Christ is the eschatological event-of-God-for-us, encountered in proclamation. The **resurrection** is not a datable miracle in Historie but the decisive **Geschichte** whereby the crucified is disclosed as Lord in the preaching that evokes faith.
 - **Faith and salvation:** Salvation occurs as **decision** (Entscheidung) from inauthentic to authentic existence, grounded in Gods grace. Luthers justification is rendered as an existential, not forensic, transformation.
 - **Scripture and criticism:** Form criticism helps distinguish kerygmatic core from mythic casing. Scripture is authoritative as **Word-event**, not as an inerrant report of facts.
 - **Church and rites:** Church is the community gathered by proclamation. Sacraments signify the kerygma; any magical or causal view is demythologized.
 - **Eschatology:** The end is not a timetable but an existential now; the crisis and gift of God confront the hearer in the present.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Major debts: Heidegger (existential analysis), Luther (law/gospel, justification), form critics.
 - Interlocutors/foils: liberal historicism (Schleiermacher), confessional supernaturalism, salvation-historical proposals (Cullmann), later critiques by Barth, Pannenberg, and students (Kasemanns New Quest).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture, Christology, Soteriology, Eschatology, Ecclesiology and Sacraments; covenant categories are relativized to proclamation.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: the **kerygma of the crucified-and-proclaimed Lord** as Gods present address summoning faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Demythologizing as hermeneutical, not merely subtractive.
 - Word as event: revelation happens in the act of preaching.
 - Existential construal of eschatology and justification.
 - Distinction between Historie (empirical history) and Geschichte (history-as-meaningful-event).

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against fundamentalist literalism: rejects objectifying miracles and inerrancy claims.
 - Against classic liberalism: refuses reduction to moral or religious feeling; insists on scandal/offense of the cross.
 - Against salvation-history schools: resists treating redemption as a chain of public, datable divine interventions.
 - In tension with Barth: shares Word-centeredness but diverges on the mode of the resurrection and objectivity of revelation.

- **Innovations**
 - Terminological: **demythologizing**, **Word-event**, **decision**, **pre-understanding**.
 - Methodological: form-critical exegesis coordinated with existential ontology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed the New Quest for the historical Jesus; influenced the New Hermeneutic (Ebeling, Fuchs).
 - In Reformed circles: often a foil prompting robust accounts of Scripture, resurrection, and sacrament; yet valued for hermeneutical candor and preaching focus.
 - Persistent debate partner in Christology, Bibliology, and Eschatology syllabi.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies what myth is and why interpretation is required.
 - Forces precision about how the gospel addresses contemporary hearers.
 - Serves as a testing ground for integrating criticism, proclamation, and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologizing (Entmythologisierung):** Interpretive practice uncovering existential claim beneath mythic forms.
- **Myth/Weltbild:** Ancient cosmological language that objectifies transcendence; vehicle, not essence, of the message.
- **Kerygma:** Proclaimed message through which Christ encounters the hearer.
- **Word-event (Wortgeschehen):** Revelation as event in proclamation rather than a static deposit.
- **Existential interpretation:** Reading Scripture in terms of human self-understanding before God.
- **Decision (Entscheidung):** Crisis of faith wherein one moves from inauthentic to authentic existence.
- **Authentic/inauthentic existence:** Heideggerian categories reframed theologically.
- **Historie vs Geschichte:** Empirical past vs event of saving significance; key for resurrection claims.
- **Resurrection-faith:** The risen Christ is known in proclamation creating faith, not via historical proof.
- **Form criticism:** Method to identify Sitz im Leben and kerygmatic layers within tradition.
- **Eschatological now:** The ends arrival as present address rather than future calendar.
- **Justification by faith:** Interpreted as existential deliverance from self-reliance to trust.
- **Offense (skandalon):** Non-domesticated challenge of the cross, preserved through demythologizing.
- **Pre-understanding (Vorverstandnis):** Inevitable horizon the interpreter brings to the text.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Bibliology: as a hermeneutical model or foil for defining revelation and Scripture.
 - Christology and Soteriology: to articulate kerygma-centered, existential accounts (often critically).
 - Eschatology: as the paradigm of realized, existential eschatology to be appropriated or resisted.
 - Ecclesiology/Sacraments: to frame proclamation-centric ministry and demythologized sacramental theology.
