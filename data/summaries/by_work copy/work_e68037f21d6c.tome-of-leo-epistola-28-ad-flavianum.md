### TITLE
Tome of Leo (Epistola 28 ad Flavianum) - Leo I (the Great), mid-5th century

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Composed c. 449 as a formal episcopal letter to Flavian of Constantinople amid post-Ephesine Christological turmoil; became decisive text at the Council of Chalcedon (451).
 - Theological milieu: conflict between Nestorian (over-separation of natures/person) and Eutychian/Monophysite (confusion/mixture of natures) positions; Roman episcopal assertion of doctrinal authority.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Affirmation that the eternal Word is truly God and truly man in **one single Person (hypostasis/persona)**, constituted by the union of **two complete natures** without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical base: Scriptural testimonies to both divine and human actions in Christ (e.g., divine works and human experiences) require recognition of both natures.
 - Logical-theological move: Distinguish **nature (natura/ousia)** from **person (hypostasis/persona)** so that two natures may subsist in one person without mixture or multiplicity of subjects.
 - Soteriological claim: Redemption depends upon the Word assuming complete humanity; therefore the human nature must be real and unconfused with divinity.
 - Polemical thrust: Demonstrates errors of Nestorius (dividing Christ into two persons) and Eutyches (mixing natures into a single altered nature).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural appeals (Gospels, Pauline texts) as primary warrant.
 - Patristic interlocutors: Cyril of Alexandria (conceptual affinities), Augustine (Latin theological language), opponents Nestorius and Eutyches.
 - Ecclesiastical-politico context: Flavian of Constantinople; later Councils (Chalcedon) adopt the Tome's language.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central): relation of Word and flesh, properties of divinity and humanity, communicatio idiomatum.
 - Trinitarian implications implicit in asserting the personal identity of the Son.
 - Soteriology: necessity of real human/divine complex for atonement and mediation.
- **Closing line**
 - The Tome's theological center of gravity: precise articulation of the **hypostatic union** - two complete natures, one unanalyzed person - as the hermeneutical and soteriological key for orthodox Christology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Forceful Latin precision: clear differentiation of **natura** (what Christ is) and **persona/hypostasis** (who Christ is).
 - Legal-pastoral register: authoritative episcopal tone combined with analytical argumentation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Nestorian tendency to separate the person (avoids two subjects in Christ).
 - Rejects Eutychian/Monophysite tendency to confuse or mix natures (avoids fusion into a third nature).
 - Aligns with Cyril's aim (unity of the Person) but sharpens the ontological categories in Latin vocabulary.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of Latin ontological terms to frame what became the Chalcedonian formula; helped fix the four adverbs (unconfused, unchangeable, indivisible, inseparable) in western reception.
 - Clarifies a rule for property attribution that anticipates later formulations of the communicatio idiomatum.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediately authoritative at Chalcedon (451); foundational for Chalcedonian Christology in East and West.
 - Rejected by Oriental Orthodox (Miaphysite) traditions; source of long-standing schism.
 - Reformation and classical Protestant theology adopt Chalcedonian categories; Leo's Letter often cited as an important source for orthodox Christological definition.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, juridically effective statement for teaching Christological orthodoxy.
 - Provides a model for balancing metaphysical precision with pastoral concern; invaluable for advanced study of person-nature distinctions and property attribution.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tome of Leo (Epistola 28 ad Flavianum)** - the letter itself; primary document read at Chalcedon.
- **Hypostatic Union** - Leo's core claim: the personal union of two complete natures in one hypostasis/person.
- **Two Natures Doctrine** - affirmation that Christ has both full divinity and full humanity, distinct yet united.
 - Directly undergirds the Chalcedonian Definition; counters both Nestorian and Eutychian distortions.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - the council formula that echoes Leo's distinctions; Tome provided textual authority and conceptual scaffolding.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - principle by which properties of both natures are ascribed to the one Person; Leo articulates safeguards for correct attribution.
- **Persona / Hypostasis (Latin vs Greek usage)** - Leo's careful use of Latin "persona" to secure the claim of one subjecthood.
- **Natura / Ousia** - nature/essence distinctions used to separate what Christ is from who Christ is.
- **Nestorianism** - interlocutor criticized for dual-person tendency; Leo refutes any division that would make two subjects.
- **Eutychianism / Monophysitism** - interlocutor criticized for confusing natures into one altered nature.
- **Adscriptio / Ascription of properties** - method Leo uses to show how divine or human predicates apply to Christ without category collapse.
- **Soteriological necessity** - argument that true redemption requires genuine human nature assumed by the Word.
- **Ecclesial authority** - Leo's epistolary tone contributes to papal claims of doctrinal weight.
- **Patristic continuity** - Leo frames his claims as a continuation of Cyril and Augustine, but in Latin precision.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an authoritative **source for the Chalcedonian Definition** (historical and doctrinal reference).
- As a **polemic text** against Nestorian and Monophysite positions in later heresiological literature.
- As an **exegetical-conceptual model** for adjudicating communicatio idiomatum and teaching the hypostatic union in systematic theology and soteriology.
