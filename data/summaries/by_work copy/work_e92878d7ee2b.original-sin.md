### TITLE
**Original Sin** (Jonathan Edwards, 1758) - The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-Awakening New England, high Calvinist milieu. Published posthumously in 1758. A sustained reply to John Taylor of Norwich (latitudinarian, semi-Pelagian tendencies) amid 18th-century debates on human nature, liberty, and moral government.
- **Central thesis:** Humanity is united to Adam by **divine constitution**, such that the guilt of his first sin is **imputed** to all, and a **depraved disposition** is universally propagated, rendering humans in a state of **total depravity** and **moral inability**, yet without excusing responsibility.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Empirical-moral argument: the **universality and early emergence of vice**, the history of nations, universal misery, and death signal a native corruption inconsistent with mere bad examples.
 - Biblical case: exegesis of **Romans 5** (Adam-Christ parallel), **Ephesians 2**, **1 Corinthians 15**, Genesis 3, Psalms, Job; infants and the reign of death as evidence of guilt.
 - Federal-covenantal rationale: Adam as **public head** in a **covenant of works**; by God's righteous **constitution**, his act is truly ours, analogously to believers' union with the **Second Adam**, Christ.
 - Philosophical defense: distinction between **natural ability** and **moral inability**; affirmation of **moral necessity** and divine **foreknowledge/providence** without making God the author of sin; compatibilist account of **free will**.
 - Justice theodicy: answers to the charge of divine injustice in imputation and decrees; sin is permitted and ordered for wise ends under providence while blame remains wholly creaturely.
 - What if Adam had not sinned: righteousness and life would have been propagated to posterity; the federal structure is symmetric with the order of redemption in Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Opposes **John Taylor**; engages Augustine, Reformed scholastics, common-sense moralists; interacts with **Locke** on identity and personal union; cites Scripture extensively.
- **Doctrines treated:** Doctrine of sin (nature, origin, imputation, depravity, inability), **Theology proper** (providence, decrees, justice, foreknowledge), anthropology, covenant theology, soteriology (union with Christ, atonement logic).
- **Closing line:** Edwards locates the human predicament under a just divine government where representation in Adam reveals our plight and representation in Christ supplies the only remedy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The **divine constitution** of a real, moral union with Adam as the ground of imputation.
 - Strong account of **dispositional corruption**: original sin is not mere privation but a contrary **propensity** of heart.
 - The celebrated **natural vs moral ability** distinction safeguarding responsibility amid inability.
 - A broad evidential case from **universal history**, not only exegesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Pelagian/Arminian** claims that sin arises solely from imitation or environment.
 - Nuances against purely **mediate imputation** schemes by stressing a true legal-moral union, while maintaining the reality of derived depravity.
 - Rejects libertarian freedom as incoherent with moral government and Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Moral necessity** as the settled inclination of the will in accord with strongest motive, distinct from coercion.
 - **Public person** and **constitution** language to explicate federal headship.
 - Habit/disposition ontology for moral character formation and transmission.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in Reformed theology; mined by Princeton (e.g., Hodge) and analytic Reformed apologetics.
 - Shaped New England Theology (sometimes modifying his account of habits and imputation).
 - Critiqued by Wesleyans and later anti-federal thinkers; appreciated by Niebuhr for realism about sin.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Hermeneutical model for Romans 5 and Adam-Christ typology.
 - Conceptual tools for teaching **total depravity**, **inability**, and compatibilist **freedom**.
 - A robust theodicy framework relating sin to **providence** and **decrees** without fatalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin:** The state of humanity consisting in imputed guilt from Adam and an inherent depraved disposition.
- **Imputation:** Divine reckoning of Adam's first sin to all his posterity by reason of covenantal union.
- **Divine constitution:** God's righteous appointment establishing Adam as representative head united to his posterity.
- **Federal headship / Public person:** Adam (and Christ) act for those they represent; their acts are legally and morally ours.
- **Covenant of works:** Prelapsarian arrangement whereby Adam's obedience would secure life for his seed; his failure brings death.
- **Total depravity:** Comprehensive corruption of all faculties; not maximal evil but pervasive disorder.
- **Moral inability vs natural ability:** We retain natural powers to choose, but lack the moral disposition to choose the good without grace.
- **Moral necessity:** The will's certainty according to strongest motive and settled disposition, without external compulsion.
- **Propensity / habit:** Dispositional bent of the heart toward self-love against God, transmitted to all.
- **Death and universal misery:** Empirical and biblical sign of guilt, including the death of infants.
- **Infants and guilt:** The reign of death over infants evidences original guilt prior to personal transgression.
- **Providence and permission of evil:** God orders and permits sin for wise ends without being its author.
- **Divine decrees, election, reprobation:** God's eternal purpose encompasses the fall and redemption; representation frames justice and mercy.
- **Free will (compatibilism):** Freedom as acting from one's own motives and character; compatible with certainty and sovereignty.
- **Second Adam, union with Christ:** Redemptive counterpart to Adam; righteousness imputed and new disposition imparted.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for imputation, depravity, and inability in the doctrine of sin.
 - As a **polemic** against Pelagian and Arminian accounts of freedom and moral origins.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Romans 5 and Adam-Christ typology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology to providence, decrees, and theodicy.
