### TITLE
The Nature of Human Persons: Metaphysics and Bioethics - Joshua R. Farris

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-theological engagement (21st century) bridging analytic metaphysics and applied Christian ethical concerns.
 - Responds to late 20th-early 21st century debates in philosophy of personhood and biomedical ethics (embryo moral status, brain death, euthanasia, enhancement).
- **Central thesis**
 - A robust metaphysical account of what a human person is (ontological ground, persistence, unity) is necessary to settle contested bioethical claims; without metaphysical clarity, normative debate defaults to emotive or pragmatic stances.
 - Farris contends that an integrated metaphysic-rooted in classical Christian anthropology reworked with analytic tools-best secures the moral status of human persons in bioethical contexts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Diagnosis - surveys dominant positions (reductive physicalism, functionalism, animalism, substance dualism) and identifies their limits for bioethical application.
 - Part II: Metaphysical proposal - articulates a hylomorphic/constitutive account (form-soul organizing biological life) or closely allied personal-substance view that secures unity, persistence, and moral significance.
 - Part III: Applied implications - translates metaphysical commitments into bioethical judgments (embryo moral status, personhood criteria, death, enhancement) showing how metaphysics constrains permissible policy and practice.
 - Method: careful analytic argumentation, thought experiments, and engagement with both classical sources and contemporary literature.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas (hylomorphism, soul as form).
 - Early modern / modern: Descartes (substance dualism), Locke (memory-based persistence).
 - Contemporary: proponents of animalism (Eric Olson), psychological-continuity theorists, functionalists (Mary Anne Warren-style), and analytic Thomists/Stump-style defenders of hylomorphism.
 - Bioethicists addressing embryo ethics, brain death, and enhancement debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christian anthropology (soul, image of God), metaphysics of substance and form, personal identity and persistence, moral status and rights, eschatological continuity implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Farris aims to show that a metaphysically rich, theologically informed account of the human person is not optional background but the decisive first-order resource for principled bioethical reasoning.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes metaphysical grounding over purely moral- or pragmatic-language accounts in bioethical disputes.
 - Marries classical hylomorphic insights with analytic clarity and thought-experiment methodology.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges reductive functionalism that makes personhood a matter of capacities alone (e.g., certain cognitive functions), arguing it yields unstable moral outcomes (e.g., temporary impairment, anesthesia, neonates).
 - Opposes bare biological organism views that collapse moral status into mere DNA/organismic life by insisting on form/structure constituting personal unity.
 - Distinguishes from Cartesian dualism by preserving close unity between soul/form and bodily life rather than a detached thinking substance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes classical terms (form, ensoulment, substantial unity) for analytic debate, offering refined criteria for persistence and identity applicable in clinical contexts.
 - Introduces pragmatic heuristics for translating metaphysical commitments into bioethical policy recommendations.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful to scholars seeking an alternative to both reductive materialism and simplistic dualism in bioethics; taken up in theological ethics syllabi and some Reformed and wider evangelical ethics discussions.
 - Has informed debates on embryo status, brain death criteria, and the morality of certain interventions by providing a metaphysical vocabulary to ethicists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Demonstrates methodologically how metaphysics and theology can bear on urgent biomedical questions.
 - Serves as a model for integrating historical theological resources with contemporary analytic tools in Christian moral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Person**
 - The ontological subject possessing moral status; for Farris, defined by metaphysical unity rather than merely by function or recognition.
- **Human being**
 - Biological organism considered in relation to substantial form/soul; distinct from the narrower concept of 'person' if latter is treated functionally.
- **Hylomorphism / substantial form**
 - Classical account where a human organism's unity is explained by an organizing principle (soul/form) - central to Farris's proposal.
- **Substance dualism**
 - The view of mind and body as distinct substances; Farris contrasts this with an integrated hylomorphic alternative.
- **Functionalism (personhood as function)**
 - The position that personhood is constituted by capacities (consciousness, rationality); criticized for errant bioethical conclusions.
- **Animalism**
 - The view that human persons are identical with human animals; engaged as a rival, especially on persistence and death.
- **Persistence / personal identity**
 - Criteria for continued identity through change (biological continuity vs psychological continuity vs hylomorphic continuity).
- **Moral status**
 - Grounds for rights and protections tied to metaphysical account of personhood; metaphysics determines threshold.
- **Ensoulment**
 - Terminology reframed philosophically to mark the instantiation of a substantial form rather than theological speculation alone.
- **Brain death**
 - Case study where metaphysical account impacts whether loss of certain functions constitutes loss of personhood.
- **Embryo moral status**
 - Applied site showing divergence between functionalist, organismal, and hylomorphic judgments.
- **Enhancement**
 - Ethical debate on permissible alteration of persons informed by commitments about human nature and teleology.
- **Image of God**
 - Theological concept tied to metaphysical account of personhood and basis for inherent dignity.
- **Identity criteria**
 - Short labels for competing tests (psychological-continuity, biological-continuity, formal-instantiation) used for applied analyses.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source**: supplies a metaphysically rooted definition of personhood for theological ethics and bioethics debates.
- As a **polemic**: counters functionalist and reductionist positions in contemporary bioethical literature.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: provides a model translating classical theological anthropology into policies on embryo protection, death determination, and enhancement ethics.
