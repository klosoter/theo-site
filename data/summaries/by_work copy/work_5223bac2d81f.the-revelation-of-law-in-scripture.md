### TITLE
**The Revelation of Law in Scripture** (1869) - Patrick Fairbairn, Free Church of Scotland theologian; a federal-Reformed, biblical-theological account of law in redemptive history.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post-Disruption Scottish Presbyterianism; Reformed federal theology under pressure from antinomian/neonomian disputes and early dispensational schemes.
 - Companion to Fairbairn's typological and hermeneutical works; aims to anchor ethics in biblical theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Law** is a positive revelation of God's character, grounded in creation and conscience, **re-published** through covenants, concentrated at Sinai, and **fulfilled in Christ**; the Mosaic economy is not a covenant of works in substance but an administration of the covenant of grace with a distinctive legal-covenantal form.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - From creation to Sinai: natural law in Adam; promise to Abraham; law's republication at Sinai with moral, ceremonial, judicial components.
 - Theocratic legislation: temporary, typological, and civil purposes for Israel; abiding norm of the moral law.
 - Pauline synthesis: Romans and Galatians on law's condemning and pedagogic uses; James on law as the royal law.
 - Christological fulfillment: Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King reveals, satisfies, and inscribes the law; New Covenant internalization (Jer 31).
 - Christian life: justification apart from works; sanctification in the Spirit's **third use** of the law; abrogation of ceremonial/judicial precepts as to form, not of the moral law as to substance.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Reformed standards (esp. Westminster Confession ch. 19), Calvin, Turretin, Witsius; engages Lutheran and antinomian readings; resists neonomian moralism and dispensational discontinuity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (natural/special), **covenant theology** (works vs grace; Mosaic administration), **Christology** (munus triplex), **soteriology** (law/gospel; justification/sanctification), **ethics** (three uses), **ecclesiology** (theocracy), **hermeneutics** (typology).
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Grace fulfills, not nullifies, law**: in Christ the law's demand and design meet, yielding forgiveness and formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong **organic-unity** account of law across covenants; careful threefold division with nuanced theocratic particularity.
 - **Re-publication** of the Adamic moral law at Sinai, yet firmly within the covenant of grace.
 - Law read typologically in its ceremonial/judicial aspects; moral core endures.
 - Christ's **munus triplex** coordinates revelation (Prophet), satisfaction (Priest), and renovation (King).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects Sinai as a covenant of works **as to substance**; affirms a legal cast **as to administration**.
 - Opposes antinomian denial of the **third use** and neonomian recasting of gospel as a new law.
 - Counters sharp dispensational law-gospel epochs with covenantal continuity.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Distinguishes substance vs form/administration of covenants; advances the **theocracy** category to locate judicial law.
 - Clarifies Pauline paidagogos as temporary, not teleologically ultimate.
- **Reception / influence**
 - Became a Free Church and wider Presbyterian touchstone for WCF 19; often cited in republication debates as a mediating classic pre-Kline.
 - Praised for exegetical sobriety and covenantal balance; used in seminary curricula on law-gospel.
- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable map for reading law through redemptive history and for catechizing on the Decalogue, uses of the law, and Christian ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law (Torah):** Revelation of God's righteous will; not merely forensic but covenantal and pedagogic.
- **Natural law:** Moral order known from creation and conscience; root of the Decalogue.
- **Covenant of works:** Adamic probation under promise of life upon perfect obedience; standard later re-published, not renewed as a saving covenant post-Fall.
- **Covenant of grace:** One in substance across administrations; Sinai belongs here, though with a legal cast.
 - Contrast: works in substance vs grace in substance; Sinai legal in form, gracious in substance.
- **Re-publication (Sinai):** Reassertion of the moral law; intensifies guilt and tutors Israel toward Christ.
- **Mosaic covenant:** Mixed character administratively; moral/ceremonial/judicial distinction; theocracy frames civil sanctions.
- **Theocracy:** Israel's unique church-state order; renders judicial law temporary and typological.
- **Threefold division of law:** Moral (abiding), ceremonial (fulfilled/abrogated), judicial (expired with the theocracy).
- **Three uses of the law:** Civil restraint, pedagogic conviction, normative guide for believers.
- **Munus triplex:** Christ as Prophet (reveals law), Priest (bears curse, fulfills righteousness), King (writes law on hearts).
- **Law of Christ:** New Covenant internalization by the Spirit; not laxity but fulfilled righteousness.
- **Paidagogos:** Gal 3 tutor; temporary role leading to mature sonship in Christ.
- **Abrogation vs fulfillment:** Ceremonial/judicial expired as to form; moral fulfilled and confirmed.
- **Promise and law:** Abrahamic promise precedes Sinai; gospel primacy governs legal administration.
- **Substance vs administration:** Key analytic to avoid collapsing Sinai into a works covenant.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source for WCF 19 categories and the moral/ceremonial/judicial schema.
 - Polemical resource in debates on Mosaic **republication** and the covenant of works.
 - Exegetical model for Romans, Galatians, and Decalogue preaching.
 - Conceptual pivot linking covenant theology with Christ's offices and sanctification.
