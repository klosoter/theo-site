### TITLE
You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit (James K. A. Smith, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2016 in a milieu of postliberal, liturgical, and Reformed renewal conversations; Smith writes as a philosopher-theologian trained in continental social theory and Reformed theology, addressing pastors, pastors-in-training, and public theology audiences.
 - Engages contemporary concerns about secularization, consumer capitalism, and the failure of propositionalism to shape Christian lives.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christian discipleship is primarily formation of loves (desires) through embodied practices ("liturgies"), not merely transmission of propositional beliefs. We are formed by practices; thus, conversion requires re-formation of the imagination and bodily habits toward the eschatological telos of Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Modern view over-intellectualizes faith (belief-as-proposition) and underestimates formation by practices.
 - Anthropological claim: Human beings are "desiring animals" shaped by habituation - our loves instantiate our identity.
 - Cultural diagnosis: Secular modernity and consumer capitalism function as rival liturgies that inculcate inordinate loves (idols).
 - Therapeutic proposal: Christian worship and practices are formative rehearsals of the New Creation; liturgy, sacraments, pastoral practices, and pedagogies re-orient loves toward Christ.
 - Practical application: Concrete recommendata for churches and Christian formation (liturgies of home, worship, civic life).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine (ordered loves), Alasdair MacIntyre (practices and narrative), Charles Taylor (social imaginaries), and N. T. Wright (eschatological imagination). Dialogues with contemporary cultural critics and pedagogues; critiques liberal Protestantism's cognitive emphasis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (imago Dei, desire), hamartiology (disordered loves), soteriology (reformation of desire), ecclesiology (worship as formative), sacramentology (practices that embody grace), and eschatology (telos as formative horizon).

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically centered on the claim: discipleship = re-formation of loves by liturgical practices that orient embodied creatures toward Christ and the eschatological telos.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes *formation by practices* over intellectual assent; treats worship as a "curriculum" that trains the heart.
 - Reads culture as composed of competing *liturgies* that inculcate rival loves rather than neutral background.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern Protestant overconfidence in persuasion-as-formation; contrasts with cognitive-focused evangelism and moralism.
 - Offers a corrective to purely individualistic approaches by highlighting social and embodied dimensions of sin and grace.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts "liturgy" to include quotidian secular practices (shopping malls, sporting events) as formative rituals.
 - Uses social-theoretical category of "habitus" (in dialog with MacIntyre) to bridge theology, cultural critique, and pedagogy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read across Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a resource for worship renewal, discipleship, and cultural engagement.
 - Influential in pastoral formation, Christian education, and public theology; critics ask for more explicit theological account of grace and justification.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust vocational and pedagogical framework for thinking about sin, formation, and the role of the church in countering idol-producing liturgies; useful for integrating eschatology with praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liturgy / liturgies**
 - Rituals (sacred and secular) that habituate loves and shape identity.

- **Formation / formative practices**
 - Deliberate activities (worship, sacraments, rhythms) that reorient desire toward Christ.

- **Desire / loves**
 - The fundamental orienting aims of the human person; theological anthropology foregrounds ordered vs. disordered loves (Augustinian frame).

- **Habitus / habits**
 - Bodily dispositions produced by repeated practices; noncognitive formation of character.

- **Idolatry (everyday)**
 - Modern cultural formations (consumerism, fame, convenience) acting as rival gods through liturgies.

- **Telos / eschatological orientation**
 - The future horizon (kingdom / new creation) that worship rehearses and toward which formation is aimed.

- **Worship as curriculum**
 - Concept that liturgy teaches the heart; worship is pedagogical, not merely commemorative.

- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The notion that practices are rehearsals of the coming kingdom; present formation anticipates final consummation (used in Christ and Culture conversations).

- **Disordered loves / concupiscence**
 - The Fall's effect on orientation and desire; explains why secular liturgies form sinful attachments.

- **Social imaginary / cultural liturgies**
 - MacIntyre/Taylor-influenced idea: shared communal frameworks that shape what people love and how they live.

- **Embodied theology**
 - Emphasis on body, habit, and ritual as theological loci.

- **Pedagogy of the church**
 - Practical implication: church as formative school of desire.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Christ and Culture / Eschatology debates: reframes cultural engagement in terms of rival liturgies and eschatological formation.
- As a **diagnostic source** in discussions of The Fall and Its Consequences: supplies an account of sin as disordered loves and cultural formation that produces idols.
- As a **pastoral and pedagogical model** for worship renewal, spiritual disciplines, and formation curricula in churches and seminaries.
