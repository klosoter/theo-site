### TITLE
**Kingdom Come: The Amillennial Alternative** 
Sam Storms, Crossway, 2013. 
Site references: Millennial Views; Revelation 20 and the Millennium; Antichrist and Man of Lawlessness.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early 2010s evangelical reassessment of dispensationalism; resurgence of amillennial readings in Reformed circles. 
 - In conversation with the idealist-eclectic turn in Revelation studies and inaugurated eschatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Defends amillennialism: the millennium of Revelation 20 symbolizes the interadvental age in which Christ reigns from heaven with deceased saints; Satan is bound with respect to deceiving the nations; the consummation arrives at the one parousia with a single general resurrection and judgment.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Hermeneutics: Christocentric typology, the two-age schema, Scripture interprets Scripture, apocalyptic symbolism. 
 - Exegesis: detailed treatment of Revelation 20; recapitulation across Revelation; Matthew 24; 1 Thess 4; 2 Thess 2; Daniel 9; Romans 11. 
 - Theological synthesis: the kingdom already-not-yet; church as eschatological Israel; nature of the tribulation; resurrection and intermediate state. 
 - Critique: dispensational premillennialism (including pre-trib rapture), historic premillennialism, and postmillennialism. 
 - Pastoral application: hope amid suffering, mission to the nations, worship fueled by eschatological realism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** 
 - Allies: Augustine; Anthony Hoekema; G. K. Beale; George Ladd; Ridderbos; Vos. 
 - Interlocutors: classic and progressive dispensationalists (e.g., Ryrie, Blaising, Bock; MacArthur); historic premillennialists; postmillennialists (e.g., Gentry).
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation and hermeneutics; kingdom of God; resurrection and intermediate state; Satan and demons; church and Israel; covenant and promise; last judgment; new creation; Antichrist and the man of lawlessness; tribulation and perseverance.
- **Closing line:** 
 - Theological center of gravity: the crucified and risen Christ reigns now; the church participates in his present kingdom amid suffering; final victory arrives in one climactic parousia.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - **Interadvental millennium** framed by the binding of Satan for mission to the nations. 
 - **First resurrection** as believers entry into heavenly reign at death; martyrs emblematic but not exclusive. 
 - **Recapitulation** as the structural key to Revelation, climaxing repeatedly at the parousia. 
 - Robust, accessible synthesis that marries exegesis with doctrinal clarity and pastoral tone.
- **Corrections or contrasts:** 
 - Against dispensational literalism: OT land and throne promises are fulfilled in Christ and the new creation, not a Jewish millennium. 
 - Against pre-trib rapture: parousia is single, public, and consummative. 
 - Against historic premillennial two-stage resurrection: affirms one general resurrection and judgment. 
 - Nuances postmill optimism: tribulation characterizes the whole age; gospel advances amid conflict.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Consolidates language such as **already-not-yet**, **two-age eschatology**, **interadvental binding**, and **ideal-eclectic** reading of apocalyptic texts. 
 - Clarifies **deception of the nations** as curtailed, not canceled, in Satan s binding.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely adopted in Reformed evangelical curricula as a current amill standard; frequently paired with Hoekema and Beale. 
 - Provokes sustained critique from dispensational and some historic premill scholars; appreciated for tone and exegetical care.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Serves as a clear, text-driven primer on amillennial hermeneutics; a go-to reference for Revelation 20; a pastoral antidote to date-setting and speculation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Amillennialism:** The millennium is symbolic of the present age between the advents; no future earthly thousand-year reign prior to the new earth.
- **Interadvental Millennium:** Revelation 20 s thousand years equals the church age; numeric symbolism denotes completeness, not chronology.
- **Recapitulation:** Revelation cycles through the same end-time drama from differing angles, each reaching the parousia.
- **Binding of Satan:** Restriction of Satan s power to deceive the nations wholesale, enabling global mission; does not eliminate persecution.
- **First Resurrection:** Believers translation to heavenly life at death to reign with Christ; contrasts with the bodily resurrection at the end.
- **Second Death:** Final judgment and exclusion from the new creation; powerless over those in the first resurrection.
- **Two-Age Eschatology:** This age vs the age to come; governs readings of kingdom texts and Revelation.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology:** Kingdom already present in Christ s reign yet awaits consummation.
- **Antichrist and Man of Lawlessness:** 1 John s many antichrists culminate in 2 Thess 2 s end-time opponent whose destruction coincides with the parousia.
- **Great Tribulation:** Pattern of suffering throughout the age, intensifying near the end; not a discrete 7-year escape from ordinary church life.
- **Parousia:** Single, visible return of Christ bringing resurrection, judgment, and new creation.
- **Gog and Magog:** Symbolic of the final global assault on the saints at the end of the millennium, crushed by divine intervention.
- **Israel and the Church:** One people of God; promises to Israel fulfilled in Christ and extended to Jew and Gentile in the church.
- **New Heavens and New Earth:** Final state of cosmic renewal, not mere spiritual heaven.
- **Hermeneutical Typology:** OT institutions and promises find their telos in Christ and his body.

- **How the work is used:** 
 - Definition source for **Millennial Views**, presenting a mature amill model. 
 - Exegetical template for **Revelation 20 and the Millennium** (binding, first resurrection, recapitulation). 
 - Theological synthesis and polemic on **Antichrist and Man of Lawlessness** within a unified parousia framework.
