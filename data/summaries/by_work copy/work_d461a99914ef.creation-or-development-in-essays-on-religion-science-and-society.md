### TITLE
**Creation or Development?** in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society 
Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th - early 20th century Dutch Neo-Calvinism; engagement with Darwinism, positivism, and monism in European science and culture; written as a public-facing theological essay arguing for Christian intellectual integrity within modern science.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Creation and development are not antithetical. Development belongs to the creaturely order as the unfolding of divinely created potencies under providence, while evolutionary monism as a total worldview is theologically and philosophically untenable.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Define terms:** Distinguishes creation ex nihilo from creaturely becoming; separates scientific hypotheses of evolution from evolutionism as a metaphysical creed.
 - **Scripture and doctrine:** Scripture teaches creation, providence, and teleology; it is not a scientific manual but gives reliable world-orienting truths.
 - **Limits of science:** Empirical method cannot adjudicate metaphysical origins or final causes; warns against smuggling naturalism into method.
 - **Affirmation of development:** Appeals to Augustine s rationes seminales and to secondary causes; allows for temporal processes, species variability, and historical unfolding within divinely given laws.
 - **Critique of monism:** Rejects reduction of mind, morality, and religion to matter; insists on real discontinuities and purpose in nature.
 - **Human uniqueness:** Upholds the image of God and the historical Adam; open to discussion of bodily formation while denying naturalistic accounts of the soul.
 - **Providence and teleology:** The triune God governs development toward an eschatological goal; law and chance serve divine wisdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Darwin, Spencer, Haeckel, positivists and monists; retrieval of Augustine and Aquinas on causality and teleology; dialogue with Kuyperian Neo-Calvinism; attention to contemporary biology and philosophy of science.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; creation ex nihilo; providence and concursus; anthropology and the imago Dei; sin and grace; Spirit s vivifying agency; Trinity in creation; church and culture; eschatological consummation.
- **Closing line:** Creation grounds being; providence orders becoming; development is creation s God-governed unfolding toward new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Organic motif:** Reality and revelation have organic unity; development is the organic unfolding of implanted potencies.
 - **Two-level critique:** Separates empirical evolution from evolutionism; accepts measured scientific claims while refusing naturalistic metaphysics.
 - **Teleology retrieved:** Ends and purposes are intrinsic to creation under the wisdom of the triune God.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **materialist monism** and scientism that absolutize method into metaphysics.
 - Against **deistic creationism** that severs creation from providential governance and development.
 - Against **biblicist concordism** that misuses Scripture as a science textbook.
 - For **Augustinian continuity-with-discontinuity:** genuine historical processes with real thresholds (life, consciousness, moral-religious personhood).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Creation vs development as complementary categories.
 - Evolution as **scientific hypothesis** vs **worldview claim**.
 - Use of **rationes seminales** and **secondary causes** to frame lawful becoming.
 - Emphasis on **concursus** and **law-like order** as the arena of divine action.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became a standard Neo-Calvinist template for engaging science; echoed in Bavinck s Reformed Dogmatics and in Kuyperian and later Reformed philosophy.
 - Cited across evangelical theology as a model for affirming both doctrinal orthodoxy and scientific seriousness.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable grammar for Scripture-science relations.
 - Safeguards human uniqueness and eschatological hope while encouraging scientific vocation under the cultural mandate.
 - Useful across loci, from Trinity and pneumatology to ecclesiology and ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation ex nihilo:** God freely brings all things into being; underwrites contingency and goodness of the world.
- **Providence:** Ongoing divine governance and preservation; includes concursus with secondary causes.
- **Concursus:** God s concurrent action with creaturely causes without competition or collapse into occasionalism.
- **Development (ontwikkeling):** Historical unfolding of created potencies within divinely set laws and ends.
- **Evolution vs evolutionism:**
 - **Evolution:** limited scientific account of biological change.
 - **Evolutionism:** monistic worldview denying teleology and transcendence.
- **Organic motif:** Theology and cosmos as coherent wholes with interrelated parts; resists mechanistic reduction.
- **Rationes seminales:** Augustinian notion of seminal principles implanted at creation that unfold over time.
- **Teleology:** Final causes intrinsic to creation; opposes blind chance as ultimate explanation.
- **Law and order of creation:** Stable structures and norms enabling science and culture; basis for the cultural mandate.
- **Imago Dei:** Human uniqueness in relation to God; grounds moral, rational, and religious capacities.
- **Discontinuity thresholds:** Irreducible breaks at life, consciousness, moral-religious personhood; safeguards anthropology.
- **General and special revelation:** Harmony in source, distinct in mode; Scripture norms science without replacing it.
- **Grace restores nature:** Soteriological maxim locating redemption as renewal, not negation, of creation s order.
- **Antithesis:** Ethical-religious opposition between belief and unbelief shaping interpretation of data.
- **Worldview (Weltanschauung):** Comprehensive orientation; Christian worldview frames science within creation-providence-eschaton.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** Model for Scripture-science posture and accommodation.
 - **Anthropology and Trinity:** Source for human uniqueness, Spirit s vivifying role, Word and Spirit in creation.
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacraments:** Grounds church s cultural vocation and sacramental affirmation of material creation.
 - **Eschatology and ethics:** Teleological horizon for development and cultural labor under hope of new creation.
