### TITLE
Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus - Gerald O'Collins (SJ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Roman Catholic systematic theology with strong ecumenical intent; synthesizes post-war biblical scholarship, patristic and conciliar tradition, modern philosophical theology, and contemporary theological voices (Barth, Rahner, Balthasar, Moltmann).
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** Christology must integrate the New Testament witness, the church's doctrinal history, and contemporary systematic reflection to yield a coherent account of Jesus as both true God and true human whose person and work are salvific; avoids reduction to either purely historical-critical "Jesus" or purely doctrinal "Christ."
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Part I: **Biblical foundation** - exegesis of Jesus' identity-claims, titles (Son of God, Son of Man, Logos), mission, sayings, passion-resurrection kerygma.
 - Part II: **Historical development** - patristic formulations, ecumenical councils (Nicea, Chalcedon), medieval scholasticism, Reformation and post-Reformation trajectories.
 - Part III: **Systematic construction** - doctrine of the person (hypostatic union), natures and wills, kenosis, atonement models, resurrection, ascension/exaltation, Christ in eschatology and soteriology; proposals for contemporary conceptualization.
 - Methodological constant: iterative movement from text to tradition to constructive theology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** extensive engagement with Scripture, major church councils, Church Fathers (Athanasius, Augustine), scholastics (Aquinas), Reformers (Luther, Calvin), moderns (Barth, Rahner, Balthasar, Moltmann), contemporary biblical scholars and philosophers of religion.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, Trinity (economic/ontological distinctions), incarnation, hypostatic union, two natures/one person, dyothelitism (two wills), kenosis, communicatio idiomatum, atonement theories, resurrection and ascension, soteriology, Christ and church/eschatology.
- **Closing line:** An integrative, ecumenically aware Christology that insists on the historical reality and salvific significance of the incarnate Word while reworking classical categories for contemporary theological and pastoral use.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced tripartite method:** sustained movement from biblical exegesis through doctrinal history to systematic construction; resists starting solely from philosophical presuppositions or only from historical-critical results.
- **Ecumenical catholicity:** affirms Chalcedonian realism while reading and appropriating Protestant and Orthodox emphases; frequently frames solutions that serve ecumenical consensus rather than narrow confessional wins.
- **Nuanced kenotic treatment:** uses kenosis language carefully - affirms genuine self-limitation of the divine Son without collapsing divine impassibility or divine immutability.
- **Integrative model of atonement:** refuses exclusive commitment to one theory; synthesizes **Christus Victor**, **satisfaction/sanctification**, and **penal substitution** elements as complementary aspects of a single salvific economy.
- **Clarifying terminological distinctions:** makes disciplined use of terms like hypostasis, prosopon, person, nature, and will to avoid popular confusions.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** critiques reductionist Historical Jesus scholarship for neglecting theological claims; also corrects overly abstract metaphysical accounts that lose touch with biblical narrative and soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:** widely used as a graduate-level textbook in Catholic and ecumenical settings; praised for clarity and breadth; criticized by some conservative evangelicals for perceived compromise on atonement emphasis and by some radical critics for maintaining classical metaphysics.
- **Enduring value:** superb reference for linking exegesis, doctrinal history, and constructive proposals; valuable in ecumenical dialogues and in forming pastors/theologians who must negotiate tradition and contemporary critique.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation:** the Word becoming flesh; central fact grounding Christology and soteriology.
- **Hypostatic union:** the doctrine that one person (the Son) subsists in two natures - fully divine and fully human.
- **Chalcedon (451):** the decisive conciliar formula O'Collins defends and refines as the normative boundary for orthodox Christology.
- **Kenosis:** Christ's self-emptying (Phil 2); treated as real self-limitation compatible with divine identity.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** exchange of properties between divine and human in Christ; used to explain scriptural attributions of divine actions to the human Jesus and vice versa.
- **Dyothelitism / two wills:** affirmation that Christ has two wills (divine and human); important for moral agency and redemption of human will.
- **Atonement (plural model):**
 - **Christus Victor:** victory over powers and sin.
 - **Satisfaction / penal elements:** legal and relational restitution for sin.
 - **Moral exemplar / participatory:** transformation of human freedom and sanctification.
- **Resurrection & Exaltation:** historical and transcendent vindication of Jesus; ground for Christ's present mediatorial rule and future eschatological hope.
- **Logos / Son of God / Son of Man:** titular language analyzed for Jewish, Hellenistic, and apostolic meaning.
- **Historical Jesus vs Christ of faith:** dialectic maintained - historical inquiry informs but does not supplant confessional claims.
- **Economic vs ontological Trinity:** distinction applied to avoid modalism and protect Christ's divine identity.
- **Person vs nature terminology:** careful distinctions to prevent Nestorianism or Eutychian monophysitism.
- **How this work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for precise doctrinal formulations in academic and seminary Christology courses.
 - As an **exegetical-model** bridging NT studies and dogmatic synthesis: exemplar for moving from text to dogma.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical discussions where Chalcedonian consensus must be rearticulated for modern contexts.
