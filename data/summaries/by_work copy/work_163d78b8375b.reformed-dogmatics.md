### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics** by Geerhardus Vos (c. 1896-1902; translated and edited by R. B. Gaffin Jr., 2012-2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-century Dutch Reformed and Dutch-American (CRC) milieu; confessional renewal under Kuyper and Bavinck; pre-WWI modernist controversies; Vos teaching catechetical dogmatics in Grand Rapids before Princeton tenure.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Dogmatics is the disciplined, ecclesial science that organizes the content of **special revelation** into a covenantal, God-centered system, showing the organic unity of truth as it culminates in Christ and the eschatological goal purposed by the triune God.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Vol. 1: **Prolegomena and Theology Proper** (principia, revelation, Scripture, God, Trinity, decrees, creation, providence).
 - Vol. 2: **Anthropology** (image of God, covenant of works, fall, sin, original guilt and corruption).
 - Vol. 3: **Christology** (person, natures, states and offices, atonement).
 - Vol. 4: **Soteriology** (ordo salutis: calling, regeneration, faith, repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance).
 - Vol. 5: **Ecclesiology, Means of Grace, Eschatology** (church, Word and sacraments, baptism, Lord's Supper, last things).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture as principium cognoscendi; Reformed orthodox (Calvin, Turretin, Witsius), Dutch neo-Calvinists (Kuyper, Bavinck), confessions (Belgic, Heidelberg, Dort). Engages Roman Catholicism (nature-grace, sacramental causality), Lutheranism (Christology, Lord's Supper), Anabaptism (church, sacraments), Arminianism/Socinianism (grace, atonement), Rationalism/Modernism (revelation, inspiration).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration; archetypal/ectypal theology; Trinity; decrees and providence; covenant of works, grace, and redemption; Christ's person and work; justification and imputation; church and marks; sacraments as means of grace; eschatology as creation's telos.
- **Closing line:** The triune God brings creation to consummation by covenant in Christ; dogmatics serves the church by confessing that unity of revelation and redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Organic unity of revelation** and of inspiration; Scripture as a living organism centered in Christ.
 - **Covenantal architecture**: works, grace, and redemption covenants hold the system together.
 - **Eschatology in protology**: creation ordered to Sabbath-consummation; the second Adam secures what the first forfeited.
 - **Precise, catechetical Q&A** format that distills scholastic clarity for pastoral use.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Schleiermacher/Ritschl**, grounds theology in objective revelation rather than religious consciousness or moral value.
 - Against **Rome**, denies sacramental ex opere operato and nature-grace synthesis that blurs forensic justification.
 - Against **Arminianism**, maintains monergistic grace and penal substitution.
 - Against **Lutheran ubiquity** and confusion of natures, upholds Reformed Christology and spiritual presence in the Supper.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Sharp deployment of **principia** (essendi/cognoscendi; externum/internum).
 - Fresh synthesis of **federal headship** with Christological and eschatological goals.
 - Tight definitions distinguishing **regeneration, conversion, faith** as instrument, not ground.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Long overshadowed by Vos's Biblical Theology; English translation sparked wide seminary and church use.
 - Functions as a confessional standard-bearer within contemporary Reformed retrieval.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers concise definitions and stable categories across loci.
 - Models redemptive-historical dogmatics without collapsing systematics into exegesis.
 - Pedagogically suited to catechesis, elder training, and advanced doctrinal seminars.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principium essendi / cognoscendi:** God as the being-principle; Scripture as the knowing-principle of theology.
 - **Externum/internum:** External principium (revelation/Scripture) and internal principium (Spirit-given faith).
- **Archetypal / ectypal theology:** God's self-knowledge versus creaturely participation by revelation; guards analogical reasoning.
- **Special revelation:** Historical, verbal, redemptive disclosure culminating in Christ; distinct from general revelation.
- **Organic inspiration:** Spirit's superintendence respecting authors, genres, and unity; avoids mechanical dictation.
- **Covenant of works:** Prelapsarian probation with eschatological reward held out to Adam; basis for federal guilt.
- **Covenant of grace:** Postlapsarian administration of salvation in Christ to sinners by promise and faith.
- **Pactum salutis (covenant of redemption):** Intra-trinitarian counsel grounding Christ's mediatorial mission.
- **Federal headship:** Adam and Christ as representative heads; explains imputation of guilt and righteousness.
- **Hypostatic union:** One person, two natures without confusion or change; undergirds offices and states.
- **Active and passive obedience:** Christ's law-keeping and curse-bearing together constitute the ground of justification.
- **Ordo salutis:** Logical ordering of saving benefits; preserves monergism and the instrumental role of faith.
- **Means of grace:** Word and sacraments as Spirit-used instruments, not automatic causes.
- **Spiritual presence (Supper):** Real communion with the risen Christ by the Spirit and faith; rejects both mere memorialism and local corporeal presence.
- **Marks of the church:** Pure preaching, right administration of sacraments, and discipline; visible/invisible distinction.
- **Eschatological Sabbath:** Creation's telos realized in Christ; frames protology and soteriology.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed categories and distinctions.
 - As a **polemical baseline** against Rome, Arminianism, and modernist views of revelation.
 - As an **exegetical model** integrating redemptive-historical reading with systematic synthesis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** around covenant and eschatology for organizing doctrinal teaching.
