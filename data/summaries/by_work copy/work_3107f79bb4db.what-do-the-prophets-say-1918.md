### TITLE
What Do the Prophets Say? (1918) - C. I. Scofield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century American evangelicalism; high point of classical dispensationalism following John Nelson Darby and contemporary with the rise of fundamentalism.
 - Scofield widely known from the 1909 Scofield Reference Bible; this 1918 essay operates within that popularizing, catechetical project.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament prophets, when read by a consistent literal-grammatical-historical method, testify to Christ and to a future restoration of national Israel and an earthly messianic kingdom distinct from the Church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirmation that prophetic scriptures are predictive and plain in meaning when read in their normal sense.
 - Distinction between prophetic promises to Israel (national, earthly) and the New Testament promises to the Church (spiritual, ecclesial).
 - Expectation of a future, literal fulfillment of unfulfilled prophetic promises in a premillennial kingdom following Christ's visible return.
 - Hermeneutical principle: literal interpretation with recognition of typology and progressive revelation but refusing to spiritualize Israel's promises into the Church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Old Testament prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, the Twelve) are the primary voices analyzed.
 - Interlocutors: implicit engagement with covenant theologians and allegorizing interpreters; continuity with Darby and contemporary dispensational writers (e.g., Bullinger).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (prophecy as predictive revelation), Covenant (differentiation of covenants), Eschatology (premillennial kingdom, rapture implications), Christology (two comings), Ecclesiology (distinct role of the Church), Scripture (hermeneutics).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Prophecy insists on a double-historical fulfillment: Christ is the center, but Israel's national promises await a literal consummation under His visible, millennial reign.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uncompromising literal sense hermeneutic applied to prophetic texts; strong insistence on the national destiny of Israel apart from the Church.
 - Clear articulation of prophetic fulfillment as sometimes inaugurated in Christ and sometimes deferred to a future, earthly realization.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against allegorical or spiritualizing readings common in much Reformed and liberal exegesis; corrective to any view that collapses Israel into the Church.
 - Contrasts with covenantal systems (including progressive covenantalism) that read many OT promises as fulfilled corporately in the Church.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularization of dispensational categories (distinct economies/dispensations, parenthetical Church age, future kingdom) for a broad evangelical audience.
 - Reinforcement of the "two comings" motif as hermeneutical key for prophecy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among American fundamentalists and conservative evangelicals; reinforced by the Scofield Reference Bible's marginal notes.
 - Criticized by Reformed, covenantal, and academic theologians for artificial divisions between Israel and the Church and for perceived over-literalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, popularized statement of dispensational prophetic hermeneutics; useful for understanding the dominant evangelical eschatological currents of 20th-century America and for studying debates with covenantal approaches.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dispensationalism**
 - System organizing history into distinct administrations; in this work, used to preserve distinct promises to Israel and the Church.
- **Literal (grammatical-historical) interpretation**
 - Hermeneutical rule: text's normal sense yields prophetic meaning; avoids allegory.
- **Israel vs. Church distinction**
 - Core structural divide: national promises to ethnic Israel are not reallocated to the Church.
- **Premillennialism**
 - Expectation of Christ's return prior to a literal thousand-year earthly reign where prophetic promises to Israel are fulfilled.
- **Two comings**
 - First coming: suffering and atonement; Second coming: visible, kingly, consummating world rule.
- **Fulfillment (inaugurated vs. future)**
 - Some prophecy partially inaugurated in Christ; many promises await literal future fulfillment.
- **Kingdom of God (earthly manifestation)**
 - Distinguished from spiritual kingdom present in the Church; to be realized in national restoration.
- **Typology**
 - Use of types (e.g., Davidic typology) as foreshadowing but not replacing literal consummation.
- **Covenant language**
 - Treats covenants as distinct legal/prophetic instruments binding for particular dispensations or peoples.
- **Imminence and the Rapture motif**
 - Implicit or explicit acceptance of imminent return and church's removal as a parenthesis before earthly fulfillment.
- **Mystery/Parenthesis**
 - The Church age functions as a temporary parenthesis in God's program with Israel.
- **Prophetic fulfillment criteria**
 - Historical, geographical, and national particulars necessary to identify fulfillment as literal.
- **Hermeneutical pole**
 - Used as a canonical, dispensational hermeneutic model in evangelistic and pastoral expositions of prophecy.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definition source for classical dispensational hermeneutics and prophetic interpretation.
- As a polemic exemplar against covenantal/progressive covenantal readings that spiritualize Israel's promises.
- As an exegetical model for reading major prophetic texts (Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel) in a literal-futurist key.
