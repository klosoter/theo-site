Select Scottish Presbyterian Sermons (various editions)
Author: Patrick Gillespie (1617-1675)
Site usage: 1 reference - Covenant Of Redemption

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century Scotland (Covenanter era); sermons published in various editions, partly circulated among Presbyterians during the Interregnum and Restoration aftermath.
 - Theological milieu: Scottish Reformed Presbyterianism, intense covenantal piety, political-theological conflict (Covenanters, Resolutioners vs Protesters), engagement with Westminster standards.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Preaching insists that salvation, sanctification and church fidelity must be understood and lived out in covenantal categories; sermons defend the covenantal ordering of salvation against lax ecclesial practice and political compromise.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical sermons move from Scripture texts to covenantal doctrine and pastoral application.
 - Scriptural exposition emphasizing divine promises and obligations.
 - Doctrinal framing: sin, covenant obligations, Christ's mediatorial work, assurance.
 - Practical exhortation: repentance, covenant renewal, church purity, perseverance.
 - Recurrent appeal to national and personal covenants (e.g., Solemn League and Covenant) as the concrete locus of Christian duty.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on the Scottish Reformed tradition: Scripture as norm, the Westminster Confession implicitly operative; in conversation with Covenanter leaders and opponents (Resolutioners, Erastians).
 - Uses patristic/Reformed exegetical methods typical of Rutherford, Henderson, and mainstream Scottish divines.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant theology** (primary): covenant of grace, implied covenant of redemption, national/personal covenant obligations.
 - **Christology**: mediatorial office, substitutionary atonement, federal headship.
 - **Soteriology**: effectual calling, assurance, perseverance, sanctification.
 - **Ecclesiology** & polity: church purity, discipline, sacraments as covenant seals.
 - Ancillary: moral exhortation, providence, repentance.
- **Closing line**
 - The sermons place covenantal fidelity at the heart of Christian identity: Christ as covenant Mediator binds doctrine, devotion and communal discipline into one ethic of covenant loyalty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral-political synthesis: covenant doctrine applied simultaneously to individual salvation and national/religious covenant obligations.
 - Persistent stress on the active obligations of covenant subjects-holiness and discipline are doctrinally linked to covenant relationship.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Polemical corrective against perceived compromises of the Resolutioner party and any ecclesiastical laxity; pushes back on Erastian tendencies that subordinate church discipline to civil expediency.
 - More rigorous and practical than some contemporaries who focused primarily on doctrinal exposition detached from corporate covenant duties.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - While not the originator, the sermons display a clear use of the **Covenant of Redemption** motif (pre-temporal agreement between Father and Son) as a theological lens for preaching Christ's mediatorial work and the application of salvation.
 - Consistent use of national covenant language to fuse polity and piety.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Covenanter circles and for subsequent Scottish Presbyterian preaching; less accepted in Restoration establishment.
 - Served as a resource for later evangelical and Reformed preachers who prized covenantal patterns of exposition and exhortation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a witness to 17th-century Scottish covenant theology in pulpit form and as a pastoral model for integrating doctrine, church discipline and public religion.

### KEY TERMS & USES

- **Covenant of Works**
