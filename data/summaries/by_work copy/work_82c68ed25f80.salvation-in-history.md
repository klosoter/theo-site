### TITLE
**Salvation in History** (Heil als Geschichte), Oscar Cullmann. Mid-20th century essays (ET 1967), articulating a salvation-historical approach to Scripture, Christology, and eschatology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar NT theology amid debates on **demythologizing** (Bultmann) and **realized eschatology** (C. H. Dodd).
 - Part of the mid-century **Heilsgeschichte** movement (with Christ and Time) emphasizing linear, teleological biblical history.
 - Ecumenical milieu; scholarly engagement with early Judaism, intertestamental apocalyptic, and the early church.

- **Central thesis**
 - **God redeems by decisive acts in linear history**, culminating in the Christ-event as the **midpoint of time**; this inaugurates the end but does not exhaust it. The church lives in the **time-between** the resurrection and the **Parousia**.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines **Heilsgeschichte** over against timeless ideas: revelation is event, not mere proposition or myth.
 - Presents Jesus as **Kyrios of time** whose death and resurrection are the decisive victory; the **Kingdom** is present in power yet awaits consummation.
 - Interprets the **delay of the Parousia** as salvation-historically necessary for mission and gathering of the nations.
 - Unfolds **church and sacraments** as historical participation: baptism and Eucharist bind believers to the once-for-all event and anticipate the future.
 - Develops **eschatological anthropology**: biblical resurrection of the body over against Greek **immortality of the soul**.
 - Extends scope to **cosmic new creation**: the same Lord who acts in Israel and Christ will renew **new heavens and new earth**.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Bultmann, Dodd, the apocalyptic traditions of Second Temple Judaism, Pauline and Johannine corpora, Luke-Acts, the LXX; patristic voices (e.g., Irenaeus) as allies against Gnostic dehistoricizing.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** as event; **Christology** (messianic consciousness and lordship); **Soteriology** (once-for-all accomplishment); **Eschatology** (already/not yet; Parousia); **Anthropology** (body-soul); **Ecclesiology and Sacraments**; **Creation/New Creation**.

- **Center of gravity**
 - **The once-for-all historical Christ-event orders time, grounds hope, and normatively shapes the churchs life until the Parousia.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Midpoint-of-time** Christology; **D-Day / V-Day** analogy for inaugurated eschatology.
 - Strong linkage of **sacrament** to historical saving events.
 - Integration of **individual and cosmic** horizons without collapsing one into the other.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **realized-only** eschatology (Dodd): insists on a truly **future** consummation.
 - Against **existential demythologizing** (Bultmann): refuses to de-historicize revelation into timeless self-understanding.
 - Against an ordo-salutis individualism: prioritizes **historia salutis** while not denying personal application.
 - Against Greek **dualism**: maintains resurrection hope over disembodied immortality.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Popularization of **Heilsgeschichte** as a canonical hermeneutic.
 - **Kyrios of time** and **time-between** as theological categories.
 - Clarified **eschatological reserve**: the church lives by promise, not possession.

- **Reception and influence**
 - In Reformed circles, converges with **redemptive-historical** trajectories (Vos, Ridderbos) and informs preaching and biblical theology.
 - Shapes evangelical inaugurated eschatology (e.g., G. E. Ladd) and influences later figures (e.g., Pannenberg, N. T. Wright).
 - Ecumenical uptake in sacramental and catechetical theology emphasizing paschal historicity.

- **Enduring value**
 - A durable **exegetical-theological model** for reading Scripture as a unified, forward-moving drama.
 - Pedagogically clarifies **already/not yet**, the **delay of the Parousia**, and the churchs mission-shaped interim.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heilsgeschichte (salvation history)**: The ordered sequence of divine acts culminating in Christ; Scripture narrates events, not abstractions.
- **Midpoint of time (Christ-event)**: Cross and resurrection as the decisive turn in history.
- **Already and not yet**: Kingdom inaugurated now; consummation awaits Parousia.
 - Contrasts with **realized-only** schemes; resists pure futurism.
- **Parousia (delay of)**: The Lords return is certain; its delay serves mission and gathers the elect.
- **Kyrios of time**: Christ governs historys epochs; liturgy and calendar witness to this lordship.
- **Messianic consciousness and kingdom**: Jesus self-understanding is tethered to Israels story and the dawning reign of God.
- **Historia salutis vs ordo salutis**: Priority to once-for-all redemptive events over sequencing of individual application.
 - Ordo is derivative and sacramentally tethered to historia.
- **Eschatological anthropology**: Human destiny is resurrectional and communal, not disembodied survival.
- **Immortality of the soul (critique)**: A Hellenistic intrusion when absolutized; Scripture centers bodily resurrection.
- **Individual and cosmic eschatology**: Personal salvation participates in creation-wide renewal.
- **New heavens and new earth**: Eschaton is restorative and cosmic, not merely spiritual.
- **Church in via (time-between)**: Pilgrim community whose sacraments both remember and anticipate.
- **Revelation as event**: God speaks by acts that generate the interpretive word and canon.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - **Eschatology**: Canonical model for inaugurated eschatology and the **delay of the Parousia**.
 - **Christology**: Frames Jesus **messianic consciousness** within Israels historical trajectory.
 - **Soteriology / Sacraments**: Grounds participation in a once-for-all event; critiques abstract ordo.
 - **Anthropology / Creation**: Source for teaching **resurrectional** destiny and **cosmic** new creation.
