### TITLE
**Martin Luther, Lectures on Galatians (1535)** 
Mature Reformation exposition of Paul on justification, promise, Spirit, and Christian freedom.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Wittenberg, 1531 lectures revised and published 1535; post-Augsburg Confession, amid conflicts with Rome, Anabaptists, and antinomian tendencies.
 - Late Luther: consolidates sola fide, law/gospel, pastoral care of conscience; humanist philology in service of evangelical dogmatics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **God justifies the ungodly by faith alone in Christ alone**, apart from works of the law; this **liberates the conscience** and inaugurates life in the Spirit for the new creation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Apostolic authority and gospel purity (Gal 1-2): Paul vs false apostles; **gospel not from man**; Peter incident shows law cannot justify.
 - Abrahamic **promise vs law** (Gal 3-4): righteousness by faith; curse of the law borne by Christ; adoption and the Spirit's cry, Abba.
 - **Christian freedom and life in the Spirit** (Gal 5-6): freedom from law's tyranny; flesh vs Spirit; fruit of the Spirit; bearing burdens; the cross and new creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: **Augustine**, Bernard; the Greek text against selective Vulgate readings.
 - Negatively: **Scholastics** (Aristotle, Thomas, Biel), Jerome on certain points, radical spiritualists, Judaizers, and Rome's traditions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Scripture**: apostolic authority, sufficiency of Scripture over tradition.
 - **Christology**: mediator, curse-bearer, the great exchange; union with Christ.
 - **Soteriology**: justification by faith, imputation, adoption, freedom of conscience.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit given through hearing with faith; assurance; sanctification as Spirit's fruit.
 - **Covenant/Promise**: Abrahamic promise, testament language, law as temporary pedagogue.
 - **Ecclesiology/Sacraments**: marks of the church (gospel and sacraments), baptism as clothing with Christ; pastoral office against false teachers.
 - **Eschatology**: deliverance from this present evil age; the cross inaugurates new creation.
- **Closing line**
 - **Christ's alien righteousness, received by faith through the promise, frees terrified consciences and creates a Spirit-led people in the midst of the old age.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Pastoral care of conscience**: law terrifies; gospel consoles; assurance grounded extra nos in Christ.
 - **Two kinds of righteousness**: passive/alien before God vs active/civil before neighbors.
 - **Apocalyptic tint**: Christ rescues from the present evil age; new creation displaces old.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **scholastic synergism** and habitual righteousness: insists on **imputation** and faith's receptive character.
 - Against **legalism and Judaizing**: law cannot justify; its proper office is to accuse and curb.
 - Against **antinomianism and enthusiasm**: the Spirit produces concrete fruit; rejects lawless libertinism and inner-light spiritualism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - **Law/gospel distinction**, **lex semper accusat**; **happy exchange**; **simul iustus et peccator**; **promise/testament** over legislation; **conscience captive to the Word** applied pastorally.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical in **Lutheran** dogmatics (Formula of Concord on law/gospel and justification).
 - Deep impact on **Reformed** theology: promise-law dialectic in federal theology; Calvin, Perkins, Puritans; English Protestant piety.
 - Modern exegesis: resource for **apocalyptic readings** (e.g., promise/new creation) and foil for **New Perspective** debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Template for **doctrinal preaching**, catechesis on justification, and **spiritual care**.
 - Clear paradigm for relating **Christology, pneumatology, and ethics** without collapsing grace into merit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification by faith alone**: God declares sinners righteous for Christ's sake, received by faith apart from works.
- **Law / Gospel**: distinct words of God; law commands and accuses, gospel promises and gives Christ.
- **Alien righteousness (iustitia aliena)**: Christ's righteousness imputed to the believer; contrasted with **proper/active** civic righteousness.
- **Simul iustus et peccator**: believers are righteous in Christ yet still sinners in themselves.
- **Great or happy exchange**: Christ takes our sin/curse; we receive his righteousness/blessing.
- **Promise (promissio) / Testament**: Abrahamic promise prior to and superior to the Mosaic law; inheritance language.
- **Curse and Cross**: Christ made a curse for us to redeem from the law's curse (Gal 3:13).
- **Union with Christ**: believers are in Christ; key for justification and sanctification.
- **Adoption and Abba**: Spirit of the Son cries Abba; filial assurance and freedom.
- **Spirit vs Flesh**: sanctification as Spirit's fruit; ethical antithesis not meritorious ladder.
- **Conscience**: seat of terror or peace; freed by the gospel, not by works.
- **Pedagogue (use of the law)**: civil restraint and theological accusation; drives to Christ.
- **New creation / present evil age**: eschatological frame for Christian existence and ethics.
- **Marks of the church**: pure gospel preached, sacraments rightly administered; ministry guards against false apostles.
- **Baptism as clothing with Christ**: sacramental incorporation that confirms promise and identity.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Definition source** for justification, law/gospel, and assurance in soteriology and pastoral theology.
 - **Exegetical model** for Pauline interpretation that integrates apocalyptic, covenant, and Christology.
 - **Polemic touchstone** against legalism, synergism, and enthusiasm across confessional debates.
 - **Conceptual pivot** for covenant/promissory theology and Spirit-formed ethics in ecclesial practice.
