### TITLE
Their Rock Is Not Like Our Rock - Daniel Strange

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed theological engagement with post-war debates over the relation of Israel and the church: conversations with dispensationalism, "two-covenant" proposals, and debates within evangelicalism over theological and political support for modern Israel.
 - Written from a confessional Reformed perspective aiming to correct perceived confusions in popular and academic treatments of Israel, covenant, and ecclesiology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The book seeks to clarify the theological relation between Israel and the church: how God's promises to ethnic Israel relate to the covenant people of God in Christ. It argues that proper Christian doctrine must maintain both **continuity** and **discontinuity** in orthodox ways - rejecting simplistic replacementism and rejecting a dual-covenant model that severs Christian claims about fulfillment in Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: surveys recent evangelical proposals that either (a) collapse Israel into the church (classic supersessionism) or (b) treat Jewish covenantal status as independent of Christ (two-covenant approach).
 - Thematic defense: develops a covenantal and Christocentric account of Scripture that preserves God's historical dealings with Israel while locating ultimate fulfillment in Christ and the covenant of grace.
 - Exegetical moves: reads key Old Testament promises, the Pauline corpus (esp. Romans 9-11), and New Testament covenantal language to show how corporate election, typology, and promise-function operate.
 - Practical and ecclesial implications: treats sacraments, church membership, and mission in light of the argued relations between Israel and the church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary evangelical voices proposing reappraisals of Israel/church relations (both proponents of renewed dispensationalism and advocates of two-covenant models).
 - Roots arguments in classical Reformed theologians, patristic typology, and close exegesis of canonical texts (OT prophetic promises and NT fulfillment passages).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace, promise-fulfillment)
 - Ecclesiology (nature and identity of the church)
 - Christology (Christ as fulfillment of Israel's hope)
 - Election and corporate election (remnant theology)
 - Soteriology and sacramental theology (baptism/circumcision parallels)
 - Eschatology insofar as promises to Israel are consummated

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically robust treatment that insists Christ-centered covenant continuity does not erase the distinctiveness of Israel but locates Israel's destiny in the single, unfolding plan of God revealed and fulfilled in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on a dialectic of continuity/discontinuity: continuity in God's one plan and covenantal promises, discontinuity in the concrete fulfillment being realized in Christ and the covenant community constituted by him.
 - Careful corporate reading of election and promise (focus on covenant people rather than atomized individual promises).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects popular supersessionism that cavalierly treats Old Testament promises as wholly transferred to the institutional church without nuance.
 - Counters two-covenant proposals that relativize Christ's exclusive claim by insisting on Jewish covenantal standing independent of Christ.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a reparative use of traditional Reformed categories (e.g., typology, covenant of grace) to speak pastorally and polemically into modern debates about ethnicity, land, and promise.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles as a careful, corrective resource in church teaching and apologetics on Israel-church relations.
 - Used by pastors and teachers to navigate politically and theologically fraught questions about Christian attitudes toward modern Israel and Jewish covenantal claims.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact exegetical-theological model for integrating covenant theology with biblical theology on Israel; useful for seminarians and pastors needing a measured middle path between extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Israel** - corporate people to whom particular promises were given; historical and theological status analyzed in light of Christian fulfillment.
- **Church** - covenant community constituted by Christ; receives and inherits the promises as fulfillment in him.
- **Covenant of grace** - central interpretive category that unites promise and fulfillment across Testaments.
- **Supersessionism (replacementism)** - corrected where simplistic accounts erase the particularity of Israel.
- **Two‑covenant theology** - critiqued as undermining Christ's exclusive mediatorial role.
- **Typology** - hermeneutical method for reading OT persons/events as real anticipations fulfilled in Christ and the church.
- **Corporate election** - focus on communal, covenantal election rather than purely individualist readings.
- **Fulfillment/continuity** - promise-fulfillment framework; continuity in divine purpose, discontinuity in the form of realization.
- **Remnant** - theological category for understanding faithful Israel within God's providential plan.
- **Sacraments signified** - baptism/circumcision parallels used to argue ecclesial continuity and covenant markers.
- **Eschatological consummation** - the promise horizon in which distinctions are resolved in Christ's final act.
- **Christocentrism** - insistence that Christ is the hermeneutical key for interpreting Israel's promises.
- **Typological-historical reading** - method that balances historical particularity with theological fulfillment.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against both naïve replacementism and dual‑covenant relativism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 9-11 and key OT promise-texts within a Reformed covenant framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and sacramental discussions about covenant membership and continuity with Israel.
