### TITLE
**The Oxford Companion to the Bible** (co-editor: Bruce M. Metzger) - research notes on the entry area: **Canon and Tradition**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century scholarly reference (Oxford academic milieu). Reflects ecumenical, historically grounded biblical studies shaped by textual criticism, patristics, and canon-history research.
 - Aimed at advanced students, clergy, and scholars who require concise, authoritative overviews and bibliographic signposts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Companion treats the Bible not as a monolithic given but as a set of texts shaped by historical transmission, ecclesial reception, and theological criteria. The problem addressed: how communities determined which books are authoritative (canon) and how inherited practice and interpretation (tradition) functioned as both conduit and judge of scriptural authority.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Alphabetical, multi-author entries that synthesize primary sources and modern scholarship.
 - The treatment of Canon and Tradition typically:
 - Surveys historical stages: Jewish formation (pre-70 CE developments), Septuagint usage, early Christian adoption, regional canons, formalization in late antiquity (e.g., councils, patristic lists).
 - Identifies canonical criteria: apostolicity, orthodoxy (rule of faith), catholicity (widespread use), liturgical use, and antiquity.
 - Explores the role of tradition: patristic citation practices, liturgy, doctrinal controversy, and the interpretive authority claimed by ecclesial bodies.
 - Integrates textual-critical concerns: transmission, variant texts, and how text-criticism informs canonical boundaries and reception.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic witnesses (e.g., Irenaeus, Origen, Athanasius), ecclesial councils (e.g., Hippo, Carthage), Jerome and Augustine in the Latin West, rabbinic formation and the Masoretic stabilization in Judaism.
 - Modern scholarly interlocutors implied: textual critics and historians whose work clarifies dating, transmission, and reception.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as mediated through texts and tradition), authority and inspiration of Scripture, ecclesiology (role of the church in canonization), hermeneutics (rule of faith), and confessionally charged issues about deuterocanonical/apocryphal books.

- **Closing line**
 - The Companion situates canonical formation at the intersection of historical contingency, communal use, and doctrinal adjudication: canon emerges as an ecclesial achievement grounded in tradition and clarified by critical scholarship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of **textual criticism** with canon-history: attention to how manuscripts and variant readings shaped reception.
 - Balanced, ecumenical tone that preserves both historical-critical precision and sensitivity to ecclesial claims.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges earlier confessional narratives that present the canon as instantly fixed; emphasizes gradual, regional processes and negotiated standards rather than single decisive acts.
 - Counterbalances pietistic or purely dogmatic accounts by foregrounding documentary and liturgical evidence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the functional distinction between **canon** (list of authoritative books) and **tradition** (living interpretive and liturgical practice), treating each as mutually formative rather than hierarchical.
 - Encourages use of "canonization" as a processual term rather than a single event.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as a standard reference in seminaries and academic libraries; Metzger's authority in textual criticism lends institutional weight.
 - Adopted across denominational lines for introductory and intermediate study; frequently cited in overviews of canonical studies and textbooks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable synopses, clear bibliographic pointers, and concise synthesis make it a durable pedagogical and reference tool for teaching canon, scripture history, and the role of tradition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon** - the recognized corpus of authoritative biblical books; treated as historically formed, not self-evident.
- **Canonization** - the process by which books achieved recognized status; emphasizes phases and loci (local churches, synods, patristic endorsement).
- **Tradition** - communal practices, creeds, liturgy, and interpretive patterns that preserve and judge texts.
- **Apostolicity** - criterion assessing connection to apostolic origin or witness.
- **Orthodoxy (rule of faith)** - consonance with received teaching; used as a doctrinal litmus for acceptance.
- **Catholicity (universality)** - widespread acceptance and use across churches and regions.
- **Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical books** - non‑canonical or variably canonical writings; distinction between Protestant and Catholic/Rabbinic canons highlighted.
- **Septuagint (LXX)** - Greek Old Testament translation; crucial for early Christian canonical practice and for understanding variant canons.
- **Masoretic Text** - the authoritative medieval Hebrew text tradition that shaped the Jewish canonical text.
- **Patristic citation** - usage of Church Fathers as evidence for the reception and status of particular books.
- **Councils (Hippo, Carthage, etc.)** - ecclesiastical assemblies cited for regional affirmations of canon lists.
- **Textual criticism** - study of manuscript evidence and variants; intersects with canon studies by clarifying what texts circulated.
- **Pseudepigrapha** - falsely attributed writings often excluded from canonical lists; used to contrast with apocryphal/deuterocanonical works.
- **Ecclesial usage** - the liturgical and pedagogical contexts in which books gained authority.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for canonical terms, criteria, and historical stages in courses and reference works.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates between historical‑critical and confessional accounts of scripture (provides common factual ground).
 - As an **exegetical/library tool**: bibliographies and concise entries guide deeper study rather than serving as primary polemic.
