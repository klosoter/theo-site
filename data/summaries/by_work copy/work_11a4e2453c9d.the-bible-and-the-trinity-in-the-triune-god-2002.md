### TITLE
The Bible and the Trinity - Robert W. Jenson (chapter in The Triune God, 2002)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century constructive dogmatics by a Lutheran theologian working in post-Barthian, ecumenical conversation. Jenson writes against both reductionist biblicalism and abstract metaphysical theology, aiming to recover a biblically anchored, historically informed doctrine of the Trinity.
- **Central thesis**
 - The identity of God is disclosed in the triune actions narrated in Scripture; the doctrine of the Trinity must be read from the Bible's economic presentation of God rather than abstracted away into disconnected metaphysical attributes.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture presents God primarily as an acting, covenant-making, redeeming subject whose selfhood is tri-personal (Father, Son, Spirit).
 - The economic Trinity (God as God acts in history) is not merely a contingent mask of an unknowable immanent Trinity; rather, the economy provides the constitutive grammar for speaking of God's own identity.
 - Traditional divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) require rearticulation in light of the triune narrative: they are to be read relationally and historically, not as static metaphysical predicates that sever God from the biblical acts.
 - Concludes that a properly biblical doctrine of God finds its center in the triune story - God is who God is because God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in covenantal action.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages patristic (Athanasius, Augustine) and Reformation (Calvin) traditions, Barth as a modern interlocutor, and critique of medieval metaphysics (Aquinasic simplicity).
 - Scripture is the decisive source; Jenson reads both Testaments for the unity of God's triune economy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity (central), Christology, Pneumatology, covenantal history; implications for classical attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
- **Closing line**
 - Theology must let the triune actions narrated in Scripture define God's identity: the Trinity is not an optional metaphysical addendum but the grammar of biblical theism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of the economic Trinity as constitutive of divine identity; narrative/temporal reading of God's self-revelation.
 - Treats divine attributes so that they serve the biblical account of God acting in history rather than as independent metaphysical axioms.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges classical Thomistic readings that isolate attributes (especially divine simplicity) from the triune economy and thereby risk depersonalizing God.
 - Affords Barthic resources but resists making the immanent/economic distinction purely epistemic; insists on a stronger correlation between God's acts and God's being.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Moves language from static "essence" talk toward "identity-as-history": God is who God is in the story of redemption.
 - Recasts attributes (immutability, impassibility, aseity) as relationally ordered to triune personhood and action.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among constructive theologians and ecumenical Trinitarian retrieval; provoked debate among analytic and classical systematicians about attributes and divine temporality.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forces exegetical theologians to take seriously the primacy of biblical narrative for doctrine; productive for courses on Trinity, biblical theology, and doctrine of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (triune God)** - central category: Father, Son, Spirit as the identity disclosed by God's acts in Scripture.
- **Economic Trinity** - God as God acts in redemption history; for Jenson this is constitutive rather than merely epistemic.
- **Immanent Trinity** - treated as necessarily correlated with the economy; Jenson resists a rigid separation that would make immanent talk metaphysically prior.
- **Simplicity** - classical claim that God's essence is non-composite; Jenson: must be reinterpreted so it does not erase personal, relational life of the Trinity.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; read relationally (Father-Son-Spirit) so that aseity does not negate divine relationality or historical action.
- **Immutability** - reworked to mean faithfulness to covenantal identity rather than absence of change in every modal sense; God's historical actions are real expressions of immutable faithfulness.
- **Impassibility** - critique of understanding as emotional invulnerability; Jenson allows that God's suffering in Christ must shape how impassibility is spoken of.
- **Revelation** - Scripture's narrative is the medium in which God's triune identity is given; revelation is evental and personal.
- **Covenant / Narrative** - the framework through which the biblical economy reveals the triune God.
- **Identity-as-history** - phrase summarizing Jenson's move: personal identity of God is constituted by salvific acts.
- **Personhood** - emphasized as relational (intra-Trinitarian) and historical (seen in redemptive events).
- **Act / Event** - theological primacy of God's acts over static metaphysical description.
- **Biblical grammar** - the notion that the Bible's patterns of speech determine proper theological categories.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: appeals to Scripture as primary warrant for the doctrine of the Trinity.
 - Polemic: a corrective against abstract attribute-theologies (simplicity, immutability, impassibility) that detach God from biblical action.
 - Exegetical model: supplies a narrative, economy-first method for trinitarian exegesis and constructive dogmatics.
