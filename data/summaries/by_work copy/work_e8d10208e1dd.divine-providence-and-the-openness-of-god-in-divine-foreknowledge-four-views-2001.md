### TITLE
Divine Providence and the Openness of God - John Sanders (chapter in Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early-21st-century evangelical debate over divine foreknowledge and human freedom; part of a multi-author volume framing competing responses to foreknowledge.
 - Situated within the rising Open Theism movement that sought to revise classical notions of exhaustive definite foreknowledge to preserve genuine creaturely freedom and relationality.

- **Central thesis**
 - God sovereignly orders the world through providence while knowing the future as open in relevant respects; divine omniscience is compatible with indeterminate future free actions because God knows all that is knowable (including possibilities, probabilities, and intentions) but not future free choices as fixed facts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Philosophical premise: **genuine libertarian freedom** entails that some future human acts are not yet real and therefore not knowable as definite truths.
 - Theological claim: **omniscience should be defined epistemically** (God knows all truths) rather than metaphysically (God knows future free acts as settled truths).
 - Providence reconceived: God governs via **risk-taking, persuasion, and conditional promise**, not by brute deterministic control.
 - God issues purposes and plans that are responsive and adaptable.
 - Divine action is relationally aimed to influence but not mechanically determine human choices.
 - Pastoral and biblical support: Readings of Scripture (e.g., petitions, repentance narratives, divine change of mind) better fit an open, responsive model of providence.
 - Addressing objections: argues that alternative models (classical determinism, Molinist middle knowledge) fail either to secure genuine freedom or to account for the biblical depiction of divine risk and responsiveness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with classical theism and Molinist accounts (critically evaluating their claims about exhaustive definite foreknowledge).
 - Dialogues with evangelical critics of Open Theism (implicitly answering deterministic or middle-knowledge defenses).
 - Uses biblical exegesis, philosophical analysis of knowledge/freedom, and pastoral-theological considerations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine providence** (reframed as persuasive and relational)
 - **Foreknowledge / omniscience** (redefining scope)
 - **Human freedom** (libertarian freedom emphasized)
 - **Prayer, providential risk, theodicy, divine condescension** (practical implications)
 - Secondary implications for atonement and covenantal language where divine promises are conditional rather than exhaustively determinative.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - God is providentially sovereign yet relationally vulnerable in history: omniscient regarding all that can be known, God nevertheless engages creatures in real give-and-take, pursuing purposes through persuasion rather than exhaustive determinative foreordination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on **relationality**: God prioritizes genuine interpersonal relationship over unilateral control.
 - **Providence as persuasion**: God acts to influence rather than to unilaterally determine free agents.
 - Emphasis on the **practical theology** of prayer, repentance, and moral responsibility as evidence for openness.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts with **classical foreknowledge** which claims God possess exhaustive definite knowledge of all future free acts.
 - Critiques **Molinism (middle knowledge)** as either incompatible with true libertarian freedom or as explanatorily inadequate for biblical depictions of divine risk and change.
 - Rejects classical determinism and impersonal sovereignty that undercut genuine prayer and moral agency.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts omniscience as "all that is knowable" and treats future contingents as genuinely **open** rather than merely epistemically opaque.
 - Frames divine self-limitation in terms of **condescension** or voluntary epistemic restraint for relational ends.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in defining evangelical Open Theism; widely cited in debates over divine foreknowledge.
 - Provoked sustained rebuttals from Reformed/classical theologians and philosophers (energizing clarifying defenses of Molinism and classical omniscience).
 - Used both as a constructive model in pastoral theology and as a polemical foil in systematic theology curricula.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies practical implications of views on foreknowledge for prayer, theodicy, and pastoral ministry.
 - Serves as a clear, compact presentation of Open Theism suitable for classroom comparison with classical and Molinist views.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism** - The position that some future free actions are not knowable as definite truths; God knows all that can be known.
- **Divine Providence (persuasive model)** - God orders creation by influencing and persuading free agents rather than by deterministic control.
- **Foreknowledge (restrictive definition)** - Knowledge of all true propositions; under openness, excludes settled truths about future free acts.
- **Omniscience (epistemic constraint)** - God knows everything that exists and all true propositions; future contingents are not truths until they occur.
- **Libertarian Free Will** - Human freedom conceived as genuinely undetermined by prior causes; central to Sanders' insistence that some future acts are open.
- **Middle Knowledge (Molinism)** - The doctrine that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; Sanders critiques its adequacy for biblical openness.
- **Divine Condescension / Self-limitation** - God voluntarily limits certain aspects of control or knowledge to enable genuine relationship and moral responsibility.
- **Providential Risk** - Theological claim that God accepts risk in relation to creaturely freedom as part of relational governance.
- **Prayer (relational efficacy)** - Under openness, prayer can genuinely influence God's future actions because the future is partly open.
- **Counterfactuals** - Hypothetical truths about what free agents would do in given circumstances; debated in relation to middle knowledge and openness.
- **Exhaustive Foreknowledge** - The claim that God knows all future free acts as settled truths; targeted for revision.
- **Theodicy implications** - Openness offered as a way to account for moral evil and suffering without attributing them to deterministic divine will.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: often cited to define Open Theism in systematic-theology and philosophical-theology discussions.
 - Polemic/resource: used both as a constructive presentation and as a primary target for rebuttal by proponents of classical/Molinist views.
 - Exegetical model: serves as a hermeneutical starting point for readings of biblical passages that depict divine change, petition, and contingency.
