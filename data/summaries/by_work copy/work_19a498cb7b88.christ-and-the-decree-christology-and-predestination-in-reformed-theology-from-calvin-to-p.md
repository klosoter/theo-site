### TITLE
**Christ and the Decree: Christology and Predestination in Reformed Theology from Calvin to Perkins** 
Richard A. Muller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Reformed milieu, from the humanist-Reformation synthesis (Calvin) into early orthodoxy (Beza, Ursinus, Olevianus, Zanchi) and English practical divinity (Perkins).
 - Responds to the modern narrative that later Reformed orthodoxy deformed Calvin by a speculative decree metaphysic.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Refutes the idea of a single Reformed central dogma (predestination). Shows continuity and disciplined development from Calvin to Perkins wherein the **eternal decree** and **Christology** are distinct yet integrally ordered: Christ is the **mirror and executor of election**, the decree its archetypal ground.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-doctrinal analysis of key figures to test the alleged Calvin vs. the Calvinists disjunction.
 - Distinguishes logical order (decree) from temporal execution (incarnation, atonement, union with Christ).
 - Clarifies causes: decree as **principium essendi** of salvation; the incarnate Mediator as **meritorious and instrumental cause** in history.
 - Maps doctrine into catechetical and scholastic frameworks (ordo salutis) without collapsing it into a speculative system.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Calvin, Beza, Ursinus, Olevianus, Zanchi, Junius, Polanus, Perkins.
 - Background: Augustine, Lombard, Aquinas; patristic Christology; late medieval distinctions.
 - Interlocutors: modern historiography (Barthian and Ritschlian lines), central dogma theses.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Decree and providence**, election and reprobation; **Trinity** and divine simplicity; **Christology** (two natures, extra Calvinisticum, communicatio idiomatum); **atonement** and merit; **union with Christ** and duplex gratia; **ordo salutis** vs **historia salutis**; emerging **covenant** idiom (pactum salutis in nuce).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity is the **ordered relation of decree and Christ**: the decree as God s eternal wisdom; Christ as the historical, sacramental, and pastoral face of that wisdom to the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing archetypal vs. ectypal theology; principium essendi vs. cognoscendi; logical vs. temporal order. 
 - Christ as **speculum electionis** safeguards the gospel s focus while preserving the metaphysical integrity of the decree.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters the claim that Beza and Perkins subordinated Christ to a naked decree. Shows pastoral, homiletical uses of predestination integrated with preaching Christ and assurance.
 - Nuances supralapsarian/infralapsarian debate as intra-confessional ordering, not rival gospels.
- **Conceptual / terminological contributions**
 - Clarifies the distinction between the decree s necessity and the contingency of second causes in providence; strengthens use of scholastic causal idiom for soteriology.
 - Sharpens the relation between **historia salutis** (work of Christ) and **ordo salutis** (application), preventing category mistakes.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for reassessing Reformed orthodoxy; widely cited in debates on Calvin vs. the Calvinists, predestination, and christological method.
 - Shapes current work in Reformed scholasticism, covenant theology, and methodological prolegomena.
- **Enduring value**
 - A model of how to read confessional Protestantism on its own terms; a toolkit for teaching decree, Christology, and assurance without collapsing them.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Decretum (eternal decree)**: God s simple, eternal will ordering all things; principium essendi for salvation.
- **Election and reprobation**: Double predestination framed pastorally; election terminates in Christ as Mediator and Head.
- **Speculum electionis (mirror of election)**: Calvinic idiom; Christ reveals and executes election without becoming its ontic ground.
- **Executor salutis**: Christ as the meritorious and instrumental cause of salvation s historical accomplishment.
- **Archetypal vs. ectypal theology**: God s self-knowledge vs. accommodated knowledge; underwrites method and doctrinal ordering.
- **Principium essendi / cognoscendi**: Being-principle (decree, Trinity) vs. knowing-principle (Scripture, revelation in Christ).
- **Providentia and concursus**: Decree s execution through secondary causes; guards contingency and responsibility.
- **Communicatio idiomatum / extra Calvinisticum**: Christological grammar safeguarding true mediation and finite humanity s integrity.
- **Duplex gratia**: Justification and sanctification as twin benefits of union with Christ.
- **Unio cum Christo (unio mystica)**: Soteriological hinge linking Christ s work to the believer via Spirit-formed faith.
- **Ordo salutis vs. historia salutis**:
 - Historia: once-for-all work of Christ.
 - Ordo: application by the Spirit; ordered chain (vocation, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification).
- **Supralapsarianism / infralapsarianism**: Alternative logical orders of the decree; both preserve Christ s mediatorial centrality.
- **Pactum salutis (in nuce)**: Proto-covenantal framing of Father-Son agreement in redemption, more explicit later.
- **Assurance**: Grounded in Christ and promises; predestination serves, not supplants, pastoral assurance.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, and the Problem of Evil: clarifies decree, providence, and concursus while preserving human responsibility and pastoral assurance.
 - Nature and Task of Theology: exemplifies archetypal/ectypal method and principium distinctions for prolegomena.
 - Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis: provides categories to relate Christ s once-for-all work to Spirit s application without conflation.
