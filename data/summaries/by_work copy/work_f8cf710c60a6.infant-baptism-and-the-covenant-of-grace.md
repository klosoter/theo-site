### TITLE
Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace - Paul K. Jewett

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century evangelical-Reformed milieu; Jewett writing as a theologically trained Reformed evangelical with Baptist sympathies in a period of renewed historical-covenantal debate (postwar North American theology).
 - Engages both classical Reformed confessionalists (Westminster, Heidelberg) and contemporary evangelical scholarship on sacraments and the New Covenant.

- **Central thesis**
 - Infant baptism lacks decisive biblical warrant; the sign of baptism belongs properly to those who consciously profess faith and are united to Christ. The continuity between circumcision and baptism is not sufficient to justify paedobaptism under the New Covenant.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical critique
 - Re-evaluates household baptisms in Acts: presence of children does not equate to infant inclusion as covenant members; household lists often imply believing households.
 - Reads Pauline texts (e.g., Galatians, Romans) to show baptism signifies union with Christ and appropriation of New Covenant benefits by faith.
 - Theological/covenantal argument
 - Distinguishes Old and New Covenant administrations: circumcision as sign within a typological, national covenant that anticipated the New Covenant; baptism is a sign of inaugurated New Covenant realities conditioned on faith.
 - Argues for a discontinuity in covenant sign application: promise and sign in the New Covenant are not automatically extended to unregenerate infants by virtue of birth.
 - Sacramental and ecclesiological implications
 - Baptism is a sacramental sign and seal that presupposes regeneration or at least explicit profession; therefore, the church's visible covenant membership must be composed of professing believers.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interacts with Reformed covenantal theologians and confessional texts; critiques Augustinian and medieval sacramental assumptions insofar as they undergird paedobaptism.
 - Conversant with contemporary evangelical exegesis of Acts and Pauline theology; enters debate with Presbyterian and Reformed defenders of infant baptism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Old/New Covenant distinction), sacramentology (sign and seal), ecclesiology (nature and boundaries of the visible church), soteriology (regeneration, faith), hermeneutics of household texts.

- **Closing line**
 - Jewett presses the claim that a properly reformed understanding of the New Covenant and the sign of baptism necessitates believer's baptism: baptism as the visible mark of union with Christ must follow (or at least accompany) a credible profession of faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes covenant theology from the perspective of New Covenant exigencies: the covenant of grace in its New Covenant form requires faith as the condition for sign reception.
 - Strong stress on the existential/relational meaning of baptism as union with Christ rather than mere familial or national inclusion.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges the automatic continuity model where circumcision = baptism in sign-function and administration.
 - Corrects readings of Acts that treat household baptisms as prima facie proof of infant inclusion.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts a traditionally Baptist sacramental position in covenantal language, creating a hybrid polemical-theological approach that addresses Reformed assumptions on paedobaptism.
 - Distinguishes more sharply between promise possession (as in Old Covenant national promise) and promise appropriation (in the New Covenant by faith).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked sustained debate between Reformed paedobaptists and covenantal credobaptists; influential in Reformed-Baptist dialogues.
 - Used by critics of paedobaptism as an exegetical and theological resource; criticized by paedobaptist scholars who defend household baptism exegesis and covenant continuity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Stimulates careful re-reading of household texts and covenant theology; valuable as a model for arguing credobaptism from within covenantal categories rather than purely sectarian lines.
 - Important for students studying intersections of sacrament, covenant, and ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Infant baptism** - the practice under scrutiny; Jewett argues it lacks New Testament warrant as a covenantal sign for the unregenerate.
- **Covenant of grace** - central theological category; Jewett insists the New Covenant form of this covenant demands faith for sign reception.
- **Household baptisms** - Acts passages analyzed; Jewett reads them as compatible with believing-household interpretation, not proof of infant baptism.
- **Circumcision-baptism continuity** - the thesis that baptism simply replaces circumcision; Jewett challenges its unqualified application.
- **Sign and seal** - sacramental terminology; baptism is a sign of union with Christ and a seal of covenant benefits, applied to believers.
- **New Covenant** - for Jewett, decisive hermeneutical key: its promises are appropriated by faith, altering sign admission rules.
- **Regeneration / profession of faith** - Jewett emphasizes regeneration or credible profession as prior to or concurrent with baptism.
- **Visible church / covenant membership** - ecclesiological categories redefined to favor inclusion of confessing believers rather than automatic familial inclusion.
- **Credobaptism** - believer's baptism defended on covenantal and exegetical grounds.
- **Paedobaptism** - infant baptism critiqued as a carryover of Old Covenant assumptions.
- **Union with Christ** - the theological content of baptism in Jewett's reading: baptism signifies incorporation into Christ, which presupposes faith.
- **Promise vs. appropriation** - distinction Jewett uses: promise can be present in covenantal status but requires appropriation by faith under the New Covenant.
- **Typology** - circumcision as type; baptism as antitype with different application conditions.

- How this work is used:
 - As a polemical resource against paedobaptism within Reformed discussions.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Acts and Pauline baptismal texts in support of credobaptism.
 - As a conceptual pivot: a demonstration that covenant theology can be deployed to defend believer's baptism rather than automatically supporting infant baptism.
