### TITLE
Faith. Hope. Love.: The Christ-Centered Way to Grow in Grace - Mark Jones 
Concise study arguing that the classical theological virtues (faith, hope, love) provide a Christ-centered framework for understanding and practicing sanctification in the Reformed tradition.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical context; pastoral-theological aim addressing modern Christian formation.
 - Moves against both moralistic-therapeutic tendencies and antinomian or purely forensic accounts of salvation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - True Christian growth (sanctification) is best understood and practiced through the three theological virtues - **faith**, **hope**, and **love** - each oriented to and rooted in union with Christ and the gospel.
 - Problem addressed: fragmentation between doctrinal justification and experiential sanctification; many Christians either reduce growth to moral effort or detach it from gospel assurance.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: **Faith** - treatment of faith as reliance on Christ, instrument of justification and the daily means by which believers receive Christ's righteousness and grace for growth.
 - Part II: **Hope** - emphasis on future-oriented trust: perseverance, eschatological perspective, and how promise shapes present holiness.
 - Part III: **Love** - practical outworking of sanctification: charity as evidence of union with Christ, social expression of obedience, and the telos of the Christian life.
 - Each virtue is developed doctrinally (biblical exposition, Reformed convictions about union with Christ and the Spirit) and pastorally (practices, means of grace, encouragements for believers).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Works within the Reformed canon: appeals to Scripture, classic Reformers and Puritans (for pastoral and pastoral-therapeutic resources), and contemporary evangelical voices concerned with holiness and gospel clarity.
 - Dialogues implicitly with moralism, pietism, antinomianism, and modern self-help spirituality.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Union with Christ, justification and sanctification, the role of the Holy Spirit, assurance, perseverance, the relation of law and gospel, ecclesial means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer), and Christian love as fruit and duty.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological virtues, grounded in the gospel and union with Christ, form a coherent, Christ-centered pedagogy for growing in grace that rescues sanctification from both moralistic legalism and detached doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates the classical triad (faith/hope/love) as a unified framework for sanctification rather than isolated virtues or mere ethical commands.
 - Strong insistence that all three virtues must be expressly Christ-centered and gospel-shaped to produce genuine holiness.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects moralism by rooting growth in the promises and person of Christ, not primarily in self-willed discipline.
 - Pushes back on purely forensic or intellectual presentations of Christianity that neglect Spirit-enabled transformation.
 - Offers an alternative to pietistic introspection by combining doctrinal assurance with practical exhortation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts common sanctification language through the triad: e.g., faith as ongoing reliance (not merely initial trust), hope as formative eschatological perspective, love as both motive and goal.
 - Emphasizes a dynamic interplay: faith receives Christ, hope secures perseverance, love evidences transformation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed pastoral circles for its clarity and applicability; used as a bridge between doctrine and pastoral care.
 - Received as helpful corrective in broader evangelicalism wary of either moralism or academic abstraction.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical model for preaching, discipling, and catechesis.
 - Serves as a compact handbook to integrate gospel doctrine with practical Christian living.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith** - ongoing reliance upon Christ; instrument of grace for both justification and daily sanctification.
- **Hope** - forward-looking trust in Christ's promises that sustains perseverance and shapes present conduct.
- **Love (charity)** - agapic practice and final telos of sanctification; both fruit and command.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological and covenantal grounding of all three virtues; the source of grace and change.
- **Justification / Sanctification** - distinction maintained but integrated: justification secures standing; sanctification is progressive living out of that standing.
- **Assurance** - doctrine linked to faith and hope; confidence that fuels growth rather than promoting complacency.
- **Means of grace** - Word, sacraments, prayer and church life as vehicles through which faith, hope, and love are nourished.
- **Perseverance** - hope-grounded endurance; theological and pastoral treatment to counter despair and presumption.
- **Mortification / Vivification** - biblical categories for sanctification (putting to death sin and living by the Spirit) framed within the triad.
- **Law and Gospel** - law as rule and gospel as power; gospel hermeneutic governs the application of the law in growth.
- **Pastoral application** - frequent practical guidance for pastors and laity on cultivating virtues in congregational and private life.
- **Theological virtues (general)** - the primary organizing principle of the book; each virtue functions doctrinally and practically.
- **Christ-centeredness** - recurrent qualifier: all virtues must be explicitly anchored in Christ to be orthodox and effective.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for framing sanctification in theological and catechetical contexts around the triad faith/hope/love.
- As a **pastoral/exegetical model** for preaching and discipling that seeks to integrate doctrine and devotion.
- As a **polemic tool** against moralistic or antinomian distortions by reorienting growth to gospel promises and union with Christ.
