### TITLE
**Petrus van Mastricht, Theoretical-Practical Theology, Vol. 3: The Works of God and the Fall of Man**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-17th century Dutch Reformed scholasticism; Mastricht (1630-1706) writes within the post-Reformation university tradition (Leiden/Franeker influence), combining scholastic method with pastoral application and pietistic concern. Reaction against both Socinianism and heterodox Reformed formulations (e.g., Amyraldianism).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to demonstrate how the divine works (creation, preservation, providence, decree) and the origin and effects of the Fall cohere with Scripture and sound Reformed theology, especially as they bear on salvation's federal framework (pactum salutis) and Christ's role as covenant head.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of divine works in ontological and soteriological order: decree, creation, preservation, concurrence, government, and providence.
 - Analysis of the Fall: origin, nature, guilt, transmission (original sin), and consequences for human nature and divine judgment.
 - Integration with covenant theology: the pactum salutis as the legal-historical nexus that orders election, incarnation, atonement, and imputation.
 - Christology and federal headship: Christ as covenant head effectuating both active and passive obedience for the elect.
 - Pastoral and practical implications: assurance, preaching, sacramental use, and moral exhortation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** heavy appeal to Scripture; dialogue with Reformed scholastics (Turretin, Voetius, Ames), opponents (Socinians, Arminians/Amyraldians), occasional appeal to classical scholastic categories for precision.
- **Doctrines treated:** divine decree and predestination; Trinity and divine operations; creation and providence; original sin and imputation; covenant (pactum salutis); Christology (active/passive obedience, federal headship); reprobation; grace and human responsibility.
- **Closing line:** Mastricht centers theology on the juridical-federal ordering of divine works: God's eternal pact secures Christ's headship and the coherence of decree, Fall, and salvation for the comfort and discipline of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on the *pactum salutis* as the linchpin connecting divine decree, Christ's incarnation, and atonement-both doctrinal and pastoral in application.
 - Systematic insistence on the personal, legal union between Christ and the elect (federal headship) that grounds imputation of guilt and righteousness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Critiques Amyraldian attempts to moderate particular redemption by appeal to hypothetical universal will; defends particularity of the pactum and definite atonement.
 - Opposes Socinian denial of original sin and substitutionary atonement by reasserting federal categories and forensic language.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced distinctions among orders: order of nature vs. order of decree; permission vs. positive decree; antecedent and consequent aspects of covenantal promises.
 - Careful technical parsing of imputation: original vs. actual, and active vs. passive obedience in Christ's fulfillment of the covenant.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in later Reformed systematic and pastoral theology for its clarity and application; influential in Dutch Reformed training and in Pietist-Reformed pastoral praxis.
 - Less known in English-speaking circles until modern translations and studies; nonetheless cited by conservative covenant theologians and some confessionalists.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of integrating scholastic rigor with pastoral concern; a reliable, compact defense of classical Reformed federalism and doctrines of sin and grace for teaching and polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption):** eternal agreement within the Trinity by which the Father appoints the Son as Mediator and the Son obligates Himself to accomplish redemption for the elect. Central explanatory category for incarnation and atonement.
- **Christ as Covenant Head / Federal Headship:** Christ's legal-personal union with the elect such that His obedience and suffering are imputed to believers; grounds of justification and sanctification.
- **Decree (Eternal Decree):** God's sovereign eternal plan ordering all events; Mastricht emphasizes both particular election and reprobation within covenantal logic.
- **Order of Nature vs. Order of Decree:** distinction between created causal sequences and the antecedent, divine ordering in counsel-used to prevent modal confusions about causality and responsibility.
- **Original Sin (Peccatum Originale):** inherited corrupt nature and guilt transmitted from Adam; both ontological depravity and forensic culpability.
- **Imputation:** forensic reckoning of Adam's sin to his posterity (guilt) and of Christ's righteousness to believers (justification); Mastricht clarifies active/passive imputation distinctions.
 - Active obedience: Christ's positive fulfillment of the law.
 - Passive obedience: Christ's suffering and endurance of wrath.
- **Providence & Concursus:** God's preservation and cooperative action with creaturely causes; concurrence safeguards divine sovereignty without negating creaturely responsibility.
- **Predestination / Reprobation:** double aspect of God's decree; election is understood within the pactum, reprobation treated as consistent with justice and mercy.
- **Soteriological Order / Application of Redemption:** the logical and temporal outworking of redemption from decree to calling, justification, sanctification, and glorification.
- **Mediation & Substitution:** Christ's representative obedience and penal suffering as the efficient ground of atonement.
- **Theological Method (Theoretical-Practical):** blending of scholastic precision with pastoral application; each locus closes with uses for faith and life.
- **Moral and Pastoral Implications:** assurance, exhortation, sacramental framing of covenantal promises.

- Uses across loci:
 - **Definition source:** Precise articulations of federal categories (pactum salutis, headship, imputation) used for doctrinal formulations in soteriology and covenant theology.
 - **Polemic & Exegetical model:** Employed against Amyraldian, Arminian, and Socinian readings; serves as an exegetical-theological template for Romans, Romans 5, and covenantal texts.
