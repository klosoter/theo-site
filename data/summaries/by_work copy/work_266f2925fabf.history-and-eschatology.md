### TITLE
**History and Eschatology: The Presence of Eternity** - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Gifford Lectures (1955; published 1957) in the post-war crisis of meaning.
 - Milieu: German historical criticism, existential philosophy (Heidegger), debates on natural theology, apocalyptic vs salvation-history.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Gods eschatological self-disclosure is not an object within history but an event that addresses persons in the present.** Meaning in history arises where the Word confronts hearers, calling for faith and decision.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of **historicism** and objectifying reason: history as causal chain cannot yield Gods meaning.
 - Analysis of **Greek philosophy** and **biblical apocalyptic** to show competing conceptions of time and eternity.
 - Proposal: **demythologization** as existential interpretation that retains the kerygmas claim while shedding pre-scientific cosmology.
 - **Historie vs Geschichte**: historical facts remain accessible to criticism; theological truth concerns existential history (address, decision).
 - **Revelation as Word-event**: Christ encounters us in proclamation; the eschaton is the presence of eternity in the now.
 - Implications for Jesus, cross, and resurrection: historically investigable only in part; saving significance apprehended in faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages **Heidegger**, **Kierkegaard**, **Dilthey**, **Troeltsch**, **Harnack**; contrasts with **Schweitzer** (consistent eschatology), **Cullmann** (Heilsgeschichte), and later interlocutors **Barth**, **Pannenberg**, **Moltmann**.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (against natural theology), **Scripture** as kerygmatic witness, **Christology** (kerygmatic function of Jesus), **Eschatology** (present eschaton), **Anthropology** (authentic existence, decision), **Theology Proper** (hiddenness, act in Word).
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center: **the eschatological Word of God confronts the hearer in the present, creating faith and authentic existence; only thus does history bear salvific meaning.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Demythologization** not as subtraction of miracle but as existential re-reading.
 - **Eschatology as presence**: the now of decision rather than calendrical futurism.
 - **Kerygma as event**: proclamation mediates the Christ-event.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **liberal historicism** (Harnack): revelation is not recoverable as mere past facts.
 - Against **Heilsgeschichte** (Cullmann, later Pannenberg): salvation is not a sequence of objectively meaningful epochs but Gods address in the present.
 - Qualifies **Barths** anti-natural theology by refusing to objectify revelation as a supratemporal fact over history.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Historie/Geschichte** distinction; **Word-event**; **existential eschatology**; **decision** as locus of meaning; rigorous use of **form criticism** with theological restraint on historical claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped the **New Hermeneutic** (Ebeling, Fuchs); provoked responses from **Pannenberg** (revelation in history) and **Moltmann** (futurist hope).
 - In Reformed circles: widely critiqued yet engaged for hermeneutics; used as foil for covenantal and salvation-historical theology; informed preaching theory and biblical theology debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies faiths non-objectifiable character, the priority of proclamation, and the difference between historical criticism and theological confession.
 - Stimulates careful use of historical method without collapsing theology into positivism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologization (Entmythologisierung)**: interpreting NT mythic language (cosmology, miracle) in existential terms without evacuating its soteriological claim.
- **Kerygma**: the proclaimed message wherein Christ encounters the hearer; locus of saving event.
- **Historie vs Geschichte**:
 - Historie: critical, empirical history.
 - Geschichte: history-as-existential-event, meaningful encounter.
- **Word-event (Wortgeschehen / Ereignis)**: revelation occurs as an act in the speaking/hearing of the Word.
- **Eschatological existence**: the presence of eternity in the present decision of faith; life under the verdict and promise of God now.
- **Decision (Entscheidung)**: existential response that discloses meaning; the site where history is taken up into salvation.
- **Myth / mythological worldview**: pre-scientific symbolic framework; to be interpreted, not simply retained or rejected.
- **Faith as hearing**: reception of the Word that creates understanding and obedience, not assent to bare facts.
- **Authenticity (Eigentlichkeit)**: existence freed from self-reliance and anxiety by the eschatological Word; contrasts with inauthenticity.
- **Critique of natural theology**: God is not inferable from nature/history as object; God is known where he addresses.
- **Salvation history (Heilsgeschichte) critique**: suspicion of attributing theological meaning to sequences of events as such.
- **Apocalyptic vs existential eschatology**:
 - Apocalyptic: future cosmic change.
 - Existential: eschaton present in faith-decision.
- **Resurrection as kerygmatic truth**: historical claims bracketed; saving significance grasped in proclamation.
- **Form criticism**: tool to analyze tradition layers; guards against naive harmonization of texts.
- **Justification by faith**: rendered as liberation in the Word-event, not as metaphysical transaction.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Covenant Theology**: foil for articulating salvation-historical continuity and the objectivity of promise-fulfillment.
 - **Eschatology**: benchmark for presentist eschatology; dialogue partner for futurist and inaugurated models.
 - **Bibliology**: resource on Scripture as kerygmatic witness and hermeneutic method; contested on inspiration and historicity.
 - **Christology/Anthropology/Theology Proper**: prompts clarity on Christ as event and person, faith as hearing, and Gods self-disclosure beyond natural theology.
