### TITLE
**Surprised by the Power of the Spirit** (Jack Deere, 1993)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s American evangelical milieu: post-Charismatic movement consolidation, rising polarized debate between charismatic militants and staunch cessationists (e.g., John MacArthur's Charismatic Chaos, 1992).
 - Deere wrote from within conservative evangelical institutions (Dallas Theological Seminary background) as a convert from skepticism about sign gifts to active continuationism; aimed to persuade conservative evangelicals without abandoning scriptural authority.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament gifts of the Spirit (prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles, etc.) continue today; contemporary charismatic phenomena are to be judged by Scripture and church order rather than dismissed out of hand.
 - The problem addressed: how to reconcile modern charismatic experience with evangelical commitments to sola Scriptura and responsible ecclesiology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part memoir: Deere narrates personal conversion into acceptance of gifts, providing experiential evidence to make the issue tangible.
 - Biblical exegesis: systematic engagement with NT gift lists (1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12, Ephesians 4) to show normative character of gifts.
 - Theological critique: responds to classic cessationist arguments (gifts ceased with apostolic era or Scripture completion) by reassessing purpose of sign gifts and the nature of revelation.
 - Pastoral-procedural guidance: offers controls, testing norms, and ecclesial safeguards to prevent excess and error.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary charismatic leaders (practitioners and pastors) and mainstream cessationist voices; implicitly responds to popular cessationist critiques such as MacArthur's "Charismatic Chaos" and to historical arguments originating with Warfield-style critiques of modern miracle claims.
 - Uses biblical scholars and pastoral examples rather than detailed historical theology as primary interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (chief focus): nature and operation of the Holy Spirit, gifts, Spirit baptism.
 - **Revelation and authority**: relation of contemporary prophetic utterances to canonical Scripture; testing prophecy.
 - **Ecclesiology**: ordering gifts in the congregation, authority, accountability.
 - Secondary attention to soteriology and sanctification insofar as Spirit-empowerment affects Christian life and witness.
- **Closing line**
 - A persuasive, pastoral case that the Spirit continues to work powerfully and tangibly in the church today, and that evangelical fidelity requires neither automatic rejection nor unchecked acceptance but disciplined, scriptural engagement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Combines rigorous evangelical concern for Scripture with candid personal testimony-argues that experience can be evidential without overriding Scripture.
 - Strong pastoral apparatus: testing, accountability, and normative controls to distinguish authentic gifts from excess.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges classical cessationism by reframing purposes of gifts (ongoing edification and mission rather than merely apostolic authentication).
 - Distances itself from naive Pentecostal excesses by insisting on ecclesial order and theological accountability.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes a pragmatic middle path often described as **disciplined continuationism**: continuation of gifts subject to rigorous testing and ecclesial norms.
 - Emphasizes the distinction between *revelatory authority* (closed in Scripture) and *confirmatory/functional action* of gifts in ministry.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among evangelicals moving toward charismata; served as a bridge book for many conservative pastors who became open to the gifts.
 - Sparked controversy in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; critics accused Deere of overvaluing experience, supporters praised his balance.
 - Contributed to increased dialogue between Pentecostal/Charismatic streams and conservative evangelicals in the 1990s onward.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for integrating testimony, exegesis, and pastoral restraint; remains a go-to evangelical popular-theological defense of continuationism and a teaching tool in seminary pastoral courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism** - the theological claim that charismatic gifts continue today; Deere argues for this with biblical exegesis and testimony.
- **Cessationism** - the claim that sign gifts ceased with the apostolic age; Deere critiques the historical and theological bases of this position.
- **Charismatic gifts / sign gifts** - prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles; Deere treats their normative presence and function in congregational life.
- **Baptism in the Spirit** - experience distinct from conversion; Deere affirms its fruitfulness while urging alignment with Scripture.
- **Prophecy (contemporary)** - authorized but subordinate utterance; Deere insists on testing and correction by Scripture and elders.
- **Tongues** - both personal prayer language and public sign; Deere clarifies contexts and limits (cf. 1 Cor. 14).
- **Discernment / testing** - key pastoral discipline for evaluating gifts; Deere supplies practical criteria.
- **Revelation vs. confirmation** - Deere stresses that Scripture is the final revelatory norm while allowing gifts to confirm, edify, and equip.
- **Ecclesial accountability** - structures and leadership oversight recommended to prevent abuse.
- **Spiritual experience** - treated as evidential but not authoritative over Scripture; Deere models how testimony interfaces with theology.
- **Pastoral prudence** - emphasis on shepherding, not sensationalism, as the goal of charismatic practice.
- **Mission-empowerment** - gifts as instrumental for evangelism and witness, not merely inward consolation.
- **Canonical sufficiency** - Deere affirms Scripture's sufficiency while allowing non-canonical Spirit activity that never contradicts the Bible.
- **Testing norms** - biblical, communal, and pastoral filters for prophetic claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** and accessible defense for contemporary continuationism in evangelical contexts.
 - As a **polemic** against rigid cessationism while simultaneously serving as a corrective to charismatic excess.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for interpreting NT gift lists and constructing church practices that balance freedom and order.
