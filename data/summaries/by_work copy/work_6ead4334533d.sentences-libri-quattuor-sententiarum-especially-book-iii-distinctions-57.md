### TITLE
Peter Lombard, Sentences (Libri Quattuor Sententiarum), Book III, Distinctions 5-7 - treatment of the communicatio idiomatum (predication of divine and human properties in Christ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-12th century scholastic theology (Peter Lombard c. 1100-1160). The Sentences became the standard theological textbook at the University of Paris and across medieval schools; Book III treats the Incarnation, Christology, grace and virtue in a scholastic, sourcing mode.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How may properties and actions proper to the divine and human natures of Christ be ascribed to the single Person of the Word without collapsing the distinction of natures or producing contradiction (e.g., "God is impassible" vs. "Christ suffered")?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lombard frames the problem through exegetical and logical puzzles about attribution and proposes rules for legitimate predication:
 - Reiterates the Chalcedonian commitment to two natures united in one person (hypostatic union).
 - Distinguishes modes of communication: appropriation (attribution to one nature by reason of the whole economy), communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum), and communication of operations; each has constraints.
 - Affirms that contrary properties remain proper to their respective natures but may be predicated of the Person "ad personam" (with respect to the person) without asserting that the divine nature itself undergoes change.
 - Emphasizes the salvific and revelatory rationale: Scripture and common speech attribute properties to the one Person for the sake of economy and faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Scripture and Fathers (notably Augustine, Cyril of Alexandria, Leo I / Chalcedon), and engages patristic debates against Nestorian and Monophysite misapplications; anticipates scholastic interlocutors (Anselm, later Aquinas).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: Christology (hypostatic union, attributes of natures, communication of idioms), soteriology (how divine and human actions save), scriptural hermeneutics for Christological predication.
- **Closing line**
 - Lombard centers the theology on the hypostatic union: the one Person of the Word is the legitimate locus for the attribution of either nature's properties, regulated so that unity of person and distinction of natures remain intact.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic, pedagogical ordering of communicative categories (how to speak rightly about Christ) that makes exegetical rules explicit for teaching.
 - Strong stress on the personal locus ("ad personam") as the guardrail that prevents category collapse.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond patristic, often rhetorical, attributions by offering a technical schema for predication; seeks to avoid both Nestorian separation of person and Monophysite confusion of natures.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - While not inventing the phrase, Lombard consolidates the functional taxonomy of communicatio idiomatum and related terms (appropriatio, communicatio operationum) in a textbook form that aids later scholastic precision.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became formative for medieval scholasticism; Aquinas and other schoolmen both inherit and refine Lombard's categories. The Sentences were the standard subject of disputations and commentaries.
 - In Reformed and modern theological traditions the Lombardian schema is often cited or critiqued: reformers stress accommodation and caution about ascribing suffering to the divine nature, but they retain the Thomistic/Scholastic clarifications that descend from Lombard.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a compact, didactic statement of how to reconcile seemingly contradictory Christological predicates; indispensable for students learning disciplined rules for Christological language and for tracing medieval exegetical method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The communication of the properties (idioms) of each nature to the one Person; Lombard sets limits so predicates do not migrate improperly to a nature.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - The personal union of two natures in the one Person of the Word; the central ontological starting point for Lombard's predicational rules.
- **Ad personam**
 - A locution Lombard uses to signal that a predicate is ascribed to the Person (not to a nature in abstraction).
- **Appropriatio (appropriation)**
 - Attributing to one nature or Person what is fitting in the economy (e.g., calling Christ "Creator" by reason of the Word's Person).
- **Communicatio operationum**
 - Communication of operations: how acts (e.g., creating, suffering) may be ascribed to the single acting Person though performed through a particular nature.
- **Idiomata (properties / idioms)**
 - The proper attributes of a nature (e.g., immutability for divinity, passibility for humanity); preserved in Lombard's schema.
- **Passio / impassibilitas**
 - The problem of suffering vs. impassibility; Lombard insists that suffering is proper to the human nature but may be predicated of the Person.
- **Chalcedonian definition**
 - The authoritative background; Lombard reads and operationalizes Chalcedon's "two natures unconfused, unchangeable" into rules for predication.
- **Persona / natura distinction**
 - Technical distinction Lombard preserves: predicates must be traced to either persona or natura with precision.
- **Modo loquendi (mode of speaking)**
 - Lombard's appeal to modes of speech: many Scriptural ascriptions are economic or accommodative and must be read accordingly.
- **Scriptural exegesis**
 - Lombard treats scriptural ascriptions (e.g., "God suffered") as the primary data demanding a predicational rule.
- **Union salutaris**
 - The soteriological rationale: the union of natures in the Person renders both divine and human actions salvifically efficacious; predication serves this end.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: Used as a baseline definition of communicatio idiomatum in medieval handbooks.
 - Exegetical model and polemic: Serves to justify Scriptural ascriptions of divine and human predicates to Christ while polemicizing against Nestorian/Monophysite errors.
 - Conceptual pivot: Employed in later scholastic treatments of sacramental theology and Christ's operations (how grace and sacramental effects relate to the Person).
