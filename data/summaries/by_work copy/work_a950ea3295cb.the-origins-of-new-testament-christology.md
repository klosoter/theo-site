### TITLE
The Origins of New Testament Christology - I. Howard Marshall (1970s; evangelical-critical engagement)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-1970s scholarly milieu marked by post-Bultmannian debate over the historicity and origins of high Christology; consolidation of historical-critical methods within evangelical scholarship seeking a mediating position between liberal reductionism and conservative inerrantism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** seeks to explain how early Christian high Christology (titles such as Lord, Son of God, pre-existence/exaltation motifs) arose not as a late Hellenistic imposition but from Jewish-Christian reflection on Jesus' life, death, resurrection and the Spirit's activity.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Demonstrates that confessions and titles attested in Paul and the earliest strata of the New Testament reflect early, theologically substantive christological conviction.
 - Argues the resurrection-exaltation experience, mediated by the Spirit, functions as the hermeneutical key that reinterprets Jesus within Israel's scriptural categories (kyrios, sonship, enthronement).
 - Traces development across major New Testament witnesses (Pauline letters, Synoptics, Johannine literature) to show continuity with Jewish monotheism and Scripture rather than simple Hellenistic adoptionism.
 - Engages methodological issues: criteria for historical reconstruction, the role of early confessional formulae, and the interplay of experience and theological reflection.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (especially earliest letters), Luke-Acts, Mark, John; critical interlocutors include Rudolf Bultmann and later form-critics and scholars who argued for delayed/high Hellenistic christological development.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (pre-existence, incarnation, exaltation), pneumatology (Spirit in redemptive history), revelation and Scripture usage (reinterpretation/typology), continuity with Jewish monotheism and early ecclesial confession.
- **Role of the Spirit (site usage - The Spirit In Redemptive History):** Marshall emphasizes the Spirit as the divine agent who attests and effects the resurrection/exaltation, enabling the community to confess Jesus in exalted terms; the Spirit mediates revelatory re-reading of Scripture that supplies the language and categories for early Christology.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Early high Christology is best explained as the believing community's Spirit-wrought reinterpretation of Jesus in Israelite salvific categories after the resurrection - a development rooted in Scripture and experience, not merely Hellenistic theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** Strong stress on resurrection-exaltation and the Spirit as the causal matrix for christological language; this frames Christology as post-resurrection interpretive faith rather than purely speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** Pushes back against models that locate the origin of high Christology chiefly in Hellenistic religious speculation or late church dogmatic reflection (contrasts with some readings of Bultmann and purely developmentalist accounts).
- **Conceptual innovations:** Treats confessional formulae and liturgical-soteriological language as historically primary evidence for theological content - a tight integration of confessional, experiential, and exegetical data.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely respected in evangelical and mainline circles for balanced methodology; frequently cited in debates about "early high Christology" and employed as a corrective to both minimalist and maximalist reconstructions.
- **Enduring value:** Models a principled middle path that combines rigorous historical method, careful exegesis, and theological sensitivity to pneumatology and scriptural continuity; valuable for courses on origins, Paul, and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection-exaltation:** The event-complex Marshall treats as the decisive impulse for early believers to reinterpret Jesus in cosmic/eschatological terms.
- **The Spirit in redemptive history:** The Spirit as agent who effects and attests resurrection, catalyzes confession, and enables re-reading of Scripture.
- **Kyrios (Lord):** Shown to function not merely as honorific but as a theological christological confession linked to Yahweh-language and divine lordship.
- **Son of God / Sonship:** Interpreted within Jewish covenantal and eschatological frameworks rather than as Greco-Roman divine sonship alone.
- **Pre-existence vs. exaltation:** Distinguishes claims about pre-incarnate existence from exaltation-confessions arising post-resurrection; Marshall sees early evidence for exaltation and complex but cautious evidence for pre-existence formulations.
- **Confessional formulae:** Early liturgical/creedal lines used as primary evidence for belief content and chronology of christological reflection.
- **Scriptural reinterpretation / typology:** How early Christians read Israelite Scripture (psalms, Isaianic texts) to make theological claims about Jesus.
- **Continuity with Jewish monotheism:** Emphatic insistence that early christologies negoti­ate rather than abandon monotheistic commitments.
- **Exegesis of Paul and Johannine tradition:** Marshall treats Pauline confessions and Johannine high Christology as complementary windows onto early belief.
- **Historical-critical mediation:** Use of criteria of authenticity and literary-critical tools within a theological-reading framework.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what counts as "early high Christology" and for locating the resurrection-exaltation complex as formative.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline confessions and Johannean theology with attention to communal testimony and pneumatology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about continuity with Jewish monotheism versus Hellenistic influence; frequently cited in polemics against late-developmentist accounts.
