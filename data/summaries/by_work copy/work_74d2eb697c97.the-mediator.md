### TITLE
**The Mediator** (Der Mittler) - Emil Brunner 
A study of the central doctrine of the Christian faith: Christ as the unique Mediator in whom revelation and reconciliation are one.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - First published 1927 (German), early English eds. 1930s; core text of dialectical theology after WWI.
 - Written within neo-orthodoxy, over against Protestant liberalism and confessional scholasticism; in conversation with Karl Barth yet already signaling Brunner's personalist turn.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Jesus Christ is the Mediator**: in him God's self-revelation and humanity's reconciliation converge as a single divine-human event; truth is not a datum but an **encounter** that judges and saves.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Humanity's plight: radical sin as personal revolt renders us unable to know or reach God.
 - Revelation as **personal address (Word as event)**: God speaks and encounters; religion as human ascent is exposed and negated.
 - Person of Christ: the one in whom God and humanity meet; Chalcedon affirmed but interpreted existentially rather than metaphysically.
 - Work of Christ: the cross as **judgment-and-grace**; objective reconciliation grounded in substitution, yet personal and relational rather than mechanistic.
 - Faith and Spirit: faith is obedient response created by the Spirit in the encounter; assurance rooted in God's act, not religious experience per se.
 - Church and sacraments: the community gathered by the Word; sacraments as **enacted Word**, not ex opere operato.
 - Scripture and proclamation: Scripture as normative witness that becomes God's Word in the Spirit's event of address; preaching as the present form of the Mediator's self-giving.
 - Eschatology: the Mediator who has come will come; present reconciliation anticipates consummation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical: 1 Tim 2:5; 2 Cor 5; Rom 3-5; John.
 - Historical: Fathers and Chalcedon; Anselm; Luther and Calvin.
 - Modern: Kant; Kierkegaard; Schleiermacher; Ritschl; liberal historicism; dialogue (and divergence) with Barth; influenced by dialogical personalism (e.g., Buber).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, and Word; Trinity implicitly through Christology; anthropology (imago Dei, sin); Christ's person and work; atonement; faith and Spirit; church and sacraments; covenantal command and promise; eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **In Christ the Mediator, God's No and Yes meet as one saving act; revelation is reconciliation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Encounter-personalism**: truth as event, not proposition; the Word as divine address.
 - Unity of **revelation and redemption**: no Christless revelation, no non-revelatory salvation.
 - Christological concentration: person and work are mutually interpreting.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against liberalism: rejects moral-influence reduction and immanentist revelation.
 - Against scholasticism: resists metaphysical objectification; reframes Chalcedon functionally for salvation history.
 - Against subjectivism and sacramentalism: faith is Spirit-given obedience; sacraments mediate the Word only as lived proclamation, not by inherent efficacy.
 - Nuanced divergence from Barth: allows for a **point of contact** and speaks of orders/creation; more open to general revelatory structures while insisting on Christ's necessity.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Imago Dei (formal-relational)** capacity for God; sin as rupture of relation.
 - **Judgment-and-grace** as a single act in the cross.
 - **Command and promise** as covenantal form of divine address.
 - Scripture as **witness that becomes Word** in the Spirit's event.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major neo-orthodox Christology; widely used in Reformed homiletics and catechesis.
 - Critiqued by conservative orthodoxy (Scripture, penal theories) and by strict Barthians (nature-grace).
 - Appreciated across traditions for a robust, pastoral Christocentrism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Integrates Christology, soteriology, and revelation with eschatological orientation.
 - Provides a coherent framework for preaching Christ as the living Mediator and for teaching sacraments as enacted Word.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mediator (Mittler)**: the unique person of Christ in whom God meets and reconciles humanity.
- **Revelation-as-encounter**: God's self-communication as personal address; truth as event, not mere information.
- **Word of God (threefold)**: Christ, Scripture as witness, preaching as event of address.
- **Judgment-and-grace**: one act of God in the cross that condemns sin and grants reconciliation.
- **Objective reconciliation**: atonement accomplished extra nos; personal yet not merely subjective.
 - Stands between penal mechanism and moral influence reduction.
- **Substitution**: Christ stands in our place to restore fellowship; juridical and relational dimensions held together.
- **Imago Dei (formal)**: relational capacity to hear God; material content restored in Christ.
- **Sin as revolt/unbelief**: radical personal estrangement; no neutral standpoint.
- **Faith as obedience**: Spirit-given response to the divine command and promise.
- **Command and promise**: covenant form of the divine address structuring Christian existence.
- **Church as fellowship (Gemeinschaft)**: community constituted by the Word and Spirit.
- **Sacraments as enacted Word**: visible proclamation that presupposes faith and the Spirit's action.
- **Chalcedon functionally received**: two-natures doctrine interpreted soteriologically, not speculatively.
- **Eschatological consummation**: the Mediator completes reconciliation at the parousia; proleptic reality now.
- **Religion vs faith**: human ascent vs divine descent; the former judged by the latter.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a doctrinal anchor for defining Christ as Mediator across Christology and soteriology.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking Bibliology (Word-as-event) with proclamation and ecclesiology.
 - As a corrective polemic against liberal reductions and mechanistic atonement theories.
 - As an eschatological frame: present reconciliation oriented to future consummation.
