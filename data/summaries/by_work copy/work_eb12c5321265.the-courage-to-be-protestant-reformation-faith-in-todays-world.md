### TITLE
**The Courage to Be Protestant: Reformation Faith in Today's World - David F. Wells**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - First published 1985 (revised later), in the milieu of late-20th-century American evangelicalism encountering institutional growth, cultural accommodation, and theological dilution.
 - Responds to the post-war rise of parachurch influence, pastoral managerialism, and the loss of confessional memory in Protestant churches.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary Protestantism has sacrificed doctrinal depth, catechetical formation, and fidelity to the Reformation heritage for cultural relevance, pragmatism, and experientialism. The remedy is a recovered, courageous Protestant identity grounded in doctrine and the church's means of grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: traces how evangelical institutions, seminaries, and congregations abandoned robust theology for programs, marketing, and therapeutic culture.
 - Anatomy: details specific losses - belief in Scripture as normative revelation, theological literacy among clergy, the catechetical and confessional life of the church.
 - Prescription: urges reclaiming confessional Protestant commitments, recovering doctrinal preaching, sacramental practice, and disciplined theological education.
 - Practical outworkings: implications for ministry formation, worship, pastoral priorities, and denominational identity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit critique of mid-20th-century evangelical leaders and institutions (institutional evangelicalism, revivalist/pastoral pragmatism).
 - Engages historically with Reformers (Reformation confessions) and with modern theologians as points of contrast (e.g., critiques echoing concerns raised by Barthian and confessional reactions to liberalism).
 - Converses with cultural critics of religion on secularization and religious consumerism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture (central).
 - Ecclesiology (the church as a doctrinal and formative community).
 - Means of grace: preaching, sacraments, and prayer (recovery argued as essential).
 - Soteriology and human sinfulness as background for pastoral life and theology.

- **Site usage - three topical references** 
 - **Theological Method (Principia: Theology as Science):** argues for theology as disciplined, propositional, and confessional inquiry rather than pragmatic technique (cf. methodological insistence on principia). 
 - **Nature and Task of Theology:** insists theology's task is formative and doxological - to know, confess, and shape the church by God's revelation. 
 - **Means of Grace - Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer:** central corrective that preaching and sacraments must be reclaimed as constitutive, not merely illustrative or optional.

- **Closing line**
 - A sustained plea that Protestantism must risk doctrinal distinctiveness and confessional fidelity if it is to remain true to the Reformation and faithful to God's Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Frames Protestant identity as a courageous, confessional stance rather than a broad, vague evangelical posture.
 - Emphasizes institutional memory and catechesis as theological necessities.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both liberal accommodation (loss of authority and confession) and therapeutic/consumer evangelicalism (loss of doctrinal formation).
 - Contrasts with pragmatic missiology that privileges growth metrics over doctrinal integrity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"courage to be Protestant"** as a diagnostic and programmatic slogan for doctrinal recovery.
 - Deploys cultural analysis (consumerism, managerialism) as theological critique.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars and pastors as a clarion call for reform.
 - Stimulated debates about confessional identity, theological education, and worship practice; influential in movements emphasizing classical forms of Protestant worship and catechesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a lasting diagnostic tool for pastors, seminaries, and denominations assessing theological health.
 - Useful as a pedagogical text for courses on ecclesiology, pastoral theology, and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Protestant identity** - confessional, doctrinal stance rooted in Reformation principles; not merely denominational label.
- **Courage** - willingness to resist cultural accommodation in order to maintain doctrinal distinctives.
- **Confession / confessionalism** - communal, catechetical articulation of faith as formative for identity and ministry.
- **Theology as discipline (Principia)** - theology conceived as orderly, propositional, and governed by revealed principles; opposed to ad hoc practicality.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Scripture as normative ground for doctrine and church life; non-negotiable in Wells's critique.
- **Means of grace** - preaching, sacraments, and prayer as constitutive instruments of God's work in the church (must be recovered).
 - Preaching: doctrinal, formative proclamation rather than entertainment.
 - Sacraments: corporate, formative rites that embody covenantal truth.
- **Ecclesial memory** - the church's retention of doctrinal and worship traditions that shape identity.
- **Consumer Christianity / managerialism** - cultural forces that have commodified church life and eroded doctrinal commitment.
- **Catechesis** - systematic instruction in doctrine; essential for Christian formation.
- **Theological literacy** - the level of doctrinal competence among clergy and laity as an index of church health.
- **Therapeutic culture** - emphasis on personal well-being over sin, repentance, and doctrine.
- **Confessional renewal** - the project of reasserting historic Protestant confessions as guiding church life.
- **Doctrinal preaching** - preaching that centers propositional truth to form congregation's belief and practice.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Protestant identity and confessional recovery.
 - As a **polemic** against pragmatic and consumerist trends in modern evangelicalism.
 - As a **pedagogical resource** for ecclesiology, pastoral formation, and renewal of preaching and sacramental practice.
