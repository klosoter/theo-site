### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Covenant and Testament of God (English translation selections) - Johannes Cocceius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century Dutch Reformed milieu; Cocceius (1603-1669) wrote in the aftermath of Synod of Dort, during the Cocceian-Voetian controversy. His work reflects Continental Reformed scholastic method but prioritizes redemptive-historical ordering.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture reveals God's single, unfolding covenantal administration: historical dispensations of promise and fulfillment (testament = enacted will). Cocceius argues for a covenantal hermeneutic that locates law, promise, and sacrament within a teleological progression toward Christ.
 - (See emphasis on **Pactum Salutis / Christ as covenant head** in his reckoning of federal transactions.)
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical opening: Old and New Testament covenants portrayed as one covenantal economy with distinct administrations.
 - Theoretical frame: distinction between covenant as divine will/testament and covenant as legal compact; stresses will/faithfulness over juridical formalism.
 - Christological center: Christ is federal head who fulfills and secures the covenant (tied to Pactum Salutis and Covenant of Redemption themes).
 - Practical application: sacraments and preaching are covenantal signs pointing to progressive covenant fulfilment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture, Patristic citations, Reformers (Calvin), and contemporary Reformed scholastics; polemically addresses Voetian opponents and strict scholastic readings of covenant theology.
 - Dialogues with confessional standards (e.g., Heidelberg Catechism and broader Reformed confessions) over language and ordering of covenants. (See **Confessional Formulations** treatment.)
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (primary), Christology (federal headship), soteriology (redemptive history and pactum salutis), sacramentology (covenantal signs), hermeneutics (typology and promise-fulfillment), eschatology (teleological consummation).
- **Closing line**
 - Cocceius centers theology on an historically progressive, Christ‑centered covenantal economy: God's singular testament unfolds in promises and fulfillments with Christ as the covenantal axis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Insists on a dynamic, historical reading of covenants: covenants are not mere legal contracts but expressions of God's testamentary will enacted through time.
 - Elevates promise-fulfillment typology: Old Testament rites are real anticipations whose meaning is unlocked only in Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects strict scholastic/legalistic federal models by de-emphasizing purely juridical categories and by insisting on redemptive-historical progression.
 - Opposes those who treat covenants as static paradigms divorced from historical revelation and typological development.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts the Pactum Salutis (covenant of redemption) as the inner‑Trinitarian plan realized historically in Christ's headship - both soteriological pact and testamentary will of God.
 - Terminological clarity between **testament** (God's will enacted) and **compact** (human/legal analog) helps shift focus to divine initiative.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Dutch and German Reformed circles; foundational for the Cocceian school and later redemptive-historical movements (including some influence on English Puritan and post-Reformation thought).
 - Provoked sustained debate with Voetians; limited reception in confessional orthodoxy where scholastic forms remained dominant.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust model for integrating Christology, hermeneutics, and sacramentology around covenantal history; still used pedagogically for redemptive-history approaches and critiques of purely juridical federalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (foedus / testamentum)** - single divine economy expressed in successive administrations; emphasis on testamentary will.
- **Pactum Salutis (covenant of redemption)** - intra‑divine pact or plan securing Christ's role as mediator and guaranteeing application of redemption.
 - Often read as the logical underpinning for Christ's federal headship.
- **Christ as Covenant Head** - Christ represents elect humanity, fulfilling covenant obligations and securing covenant blessings.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - explicit treatment of pre-temporal agreement between Father and Son for redemption; grounds for federal transactions.
- **Covenant of Works vs. Covenant of Grace** - retained but reframed within a historical-progressive narrative rather than static juridical opposites.
- **Typology / Promise‑Fulfillment** - Old Testament rites are prophetic images; authentic meaning realized in Christ.
- **Testamentary emphasis** - God's covenant described as will/testament rather than merely contract; highlights divine initiative and gift.
- **Federal headship** - juridical and representative language employed but subordinated to historical and Christological concerns.
- **Sacramental sign and seal** - sacraments are covenantal confirmations pointing to promise fulfillment.
- **Redemptive‑historical hermeneutic** - rules reading Scripture as an unfolding covenantal economy culminating in Christ.
- **Eschatological consummation** - covenant history moves teleologically to final consummation in Christ.
- **Confessional formulations** - engages confessions to defend a coherent covenant grammar while disputing narrower scholastic readings.
- **Typological hermeneutic vs. allegory** - insisted on robust historical correspondence, not fanciful allegory.
- **Divine will vs. legal contract** - prioritizes divine testament to correct over-legalized covenant models.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source** for covenantal theology that centers promise, promise‑fulfillment, and Christ's headship.
 - **Polemic resource** against rigid scholastic/faculty-style federalism and for redemptive‑historical ordering.
 - **Exegetical model / conceptual pivot** for preaching, sacramental theology, and confessional interpretation that reads Scripture as one progressive covenantal story.
