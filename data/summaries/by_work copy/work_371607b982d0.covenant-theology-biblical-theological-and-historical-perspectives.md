### TITLE
Covenant Theology: Biblical, Theological, and Historical Perspectives - Miles Van Pelt

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed conversation (early 21st c.); aims to recover a robust covenantal framework against both dispensationalism and diffuse "new covenant" or progressive covenantal alternatives.
 - Engages biblical theology movement, historical Reformed tradition (Puritans, Westminster), and recent scholarly debates (Vosian redemptive-historical method, Meredith Kline, Brevard Childs).
- **Central thesis**
 - Covenant theology, when grounded in careful exegesis and historical understanding, provides the best integrative framework to explain divine revelation, the unity of Scripture, Christ as covenantal fulfillment, and the church's sacraments and life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: key Old and New Testament covenants are treated as successive administrations of one gracious divine plan oriented to Christ.
 - Theological synthesis: articulates classic federal categories (covenant of works, covenant of grace, covenant of redemption) with attention to Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology.
 - Historical survey: traces development and variations in Reformed covenant theology (Patristic hints → Calvin → Puritans → Westminster → 19th-20th c. responses).
 - Polemical engagement: contrasts covenant theology with dispensational, new covenant, and certain "progressive" readings; defends continuity amid typological discontinuity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Scripture as primary source; dialogues with Calvin, Owen, the Westminster divines, Geerhardus Vos, Meredith Kline, and contemporary Reformed scholars.
 - Engages critical interlocutors: dispensationalists, New Covenant Theology proponents, and some biblical-theology scholars who resist systematic covenantal readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant (works, grace, redemption), Christology (mediatorial kingship and headship), justification and union with Christ, sanctification, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), law and gospel, ecclesiology (visible/invisible church), typology and promise-fulfillment.
- **Closing line**
 - Covenant Theology is presented as the biblically faithful, historically rooted, and theologically coherent lens that centers Christ as the covenantal fulfillment of God's unified redemptive plan.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on exegetical discipline: theological categories must be tied to redemptive-historical readings of biblical covenants, not merely inherited abstractions.
 - Balanced continuity/discontinuity: affirms organic unity of Old and New Testaments while allowing for real typological and administrative change.
 - Pastoral-catechetical orientation: shows how covenantal categories inform preaching, sacraments, and spiritual formation.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects both overly rigid "two-covenant" dichotomies (works vs grace in isolation) and minimalist "one covenant" glosses that erase structural distinctions.
 - Challenges dispensational segmentation of redemptive history; pushes back on some versions of progressive covenantalism that underplay law/gospel distinctions.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Refines classical terms (e.g., careful distinctions between covenant of redemption and covenant of grace) with updated exegetical justifications.
 - Advocates a typology that is neither purely allegorical nor purely formalistic-typology as the biblical mechanism of promise-fulfillment pointing to Christ.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Used in Reformed seminaries and by pastors as a contemporary statement defending classical federal theology; cited in syllabi and polemical literature.
 - Appreciated by those seeking a bridge between historical Reformed confessions and recent biblical-theological methods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, accessible synthesis useful for instruction, denominational formation, and informed engagement with non-Reformed positions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Prelapsarian covenant with Adam; the pattern for federal headship and obligation.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - God's one overarching promise of redemption fulfilled in Christ, administered differently across redemptive history.
- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Intra-Trinitarian pact: Father and Son agree on the plan of salvation; grounds Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Representative leadership (Adam, Christ) by which merits or demerits are imputed to many.
- **Typology / Promise-Fulfillment**
 - Old Testament persons, rites, and institutions prefigure Christ and the New Covenant realities.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity**
 - Principle for reading Scripture: essential unity in promise but real change in administration and fulfillment.
- **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
 - Interpretation that sees biblical texts within the single unfolding plan of redemption centered on Christ.
- **Law and Gospel**
 - Distinction preserved: law's covenantal function and gospel's promise-based fulfillment in Christ.
- **Sacramental Theology**
 - Baptism and Supper as covenant signs and seals; infant baptism defended as covenantal inclusion of children of believers.
- **Visible/Invisible Church**
 - Distinction maintained; covenantal membership shapes ecclesial practice and discipline.
- **Justification / Union with Christ**
 - Justification explained in federal terms: forensic imputation grounded in Christ's obedience and our union with Him.
- **Interlocutor terms**
 - Dispensationalism, New Covenant Theology, Progressive Covenantism - treated polemically and exegetically.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise definitional source for classical Reformed covenant categories in teaching and preaching.
 - As a polemical resource against dispensational and revisionist covenant proposals.
 - As an exegetical-model exemplar combining redemptive-historical reading with confessional theology.
 - As a conceptual pivot in curricula linking biblical theology, systematic theology, and church history.
