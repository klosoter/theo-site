### TITLE
The Concept of Federal Theology: Was Calvin a Federal Theologian? - James B. Torrance (Evangelical Quarterly)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed scholarship-Scottish theological renewal; conversation with historic Westminster/Covenant theology and contemporary critiques of forensic reductionism.
 - Responds to entrenched labels in systematic and confessional histories that call Calvin a "federal" theologian in the same sense as later Puritan/Westminster framers.

- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin cannot be reduced to the later, technical "federal" systematics; while Calvin uses covenantal language and accepts imputation and federal headship, his treatment of sin, guilt, pollution and death is embedded in a relational, participatory and Christocentric soteriology rather than a purely forensic contractual model.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Calvin's usage of key categories: guilt, pollution, death.
 - Shows Calvin distinguishes **guilt** (forensic condemnation), **pollution** (inherited corruption), and **death** (penal/ontological consequence), but treats them as interconnected in human existence and salvation.
 - Critique of later federal theology:
 - Identifies tendencies in post‑Calvinian federalism to bifurcate imputation (legal) from transmission (biological/moral) and to press a strictly juridical model.
 - Re‑reads Calvin through sacramental and participatory lenses:
 - Emphasizes union with Christ, incorporation by faith, and the ministry of the sacraments as loci where righteousness and life are received, not merely forensic accounts.
 - Concludes Calvin's covenantal thought is more dynamic and Trinitarian than the rigid federal label allows.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin (commentaries, Institutes).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Westminster divines and later federalists (anonymous typology), Augustine and scholastic categories that shaped both Calvin and later interpreters.
 - Contemporary context: mid‑20th century Reformed theologians reassessing forensic emphases.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin; imputation; covenant (federal) theology; atonement (forensic vs participatory); Christology (union with Christ); sacramentology; soteriology (justification, sanctification); death as penalty and condition.

- **Closing line**
 - Torrance locates Calvin between forensic federalism and a sacramental, participatory covenant theology: Calvin uses federal language but resists a flattened juridical system-his center is union with Christ, where guilt, pollution and death are overcome not merely accounted away.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Read Calvin as fundamentally **relational and participatory**: covenant is communion more than contract; sacraments mediate incorporation rather than only symbolize legal transfer.
 - Close attention to Calvin's language on **guilt, pollution and death** as overlapping realities rather than neatly separable categories.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges the anachronistic application of later Westminster/Cocceian federal schemas to Calvin.
 - Corrects scholars who portray Calvin as a proto‑Westminster forensicist by showing his broader sacramental and Christological commitments.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Insists on seeing **imputation** inside the matrix of **union with Christ** (participation + declaration), not as a stand‑alone legal fiction.
 - Reinforces a distinction between juridical language and ontological participation without collapsing them.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among scholars seeking to nuance Reformed covenant theology; used in debates about forensic vs participatory models of justification.
 - Cited in studies of Calvin's anthropology and sacramentology; stimulated reappraisals in both conservative and constructive Reformed circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable corrective to reductionist readings; supplies a textured model for teaching Calvin on sin and salvation that preserves both forensic and participatory elements.
 - Helps students and teachers reframe covenant theology around union with Christ and sacramental mediation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal theology (federalism)** - technical doctrine of covenants and headship; Torrance argues Calvin participates in but is not fully bounded by later federal formulations.
- **Imputation** - the accounting of Christ's righteousness (and/or Adam's guilt); in Calvin is intertwined with participation in Christ, not purely abstract forensic transfer.
- **Original sin** - for Calvin: both inherited corruption and the cause of condemnation; Torrance stresses Calvin's integrated account (guilt + pollution).
- **Guilt** - forensic condemnation inherited through Adam in Calvin, but addressed relationally through Christ's representative work.
- **Pollution** - inherited corruption/concupiscence; Calvin treats it as real and moral, not merely civil or rhetorical.
- **Death** - both penal (as sentence) and ontological (mortality, spiritual death); Calvin sees Christ's victory as reversing both dimensions.
- **Covenant** - relational bond rooted in the triune God; for Calvin covenant is dynamic and sacramental rather than merely contractual.
- **Federal headship** - Adam/Christ as representational heads; acknowledged by Calvin but embedded within union‑in‑Christ.
- **Forensic** - legal language used by Calvin, yet Torrance cautions against making forensic categories exhaustive.
- **Participation / union with Christ** - central lens: believers truly partake of Christ's righteousness and life; mediates imputation and regeneration.
- **Sacrament(s)** - means of incorporation; sacraments enact and seal union with Christ in Calvin's thought.
- **Declaration / alien righteousness** - the declarative aspect of justification exists with substantive participation, not in isolation.
- **Relational ontology** - Torrance's descriptor for Calvin's theological method: persons, covenant, and communion matter ontologically.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: clarifies what scholars mean by "federal theology" vs Calvin's covenantal usage.
 - As a **polemic**: deployed against strictly forensic or juridical reductions of Reformed soteriology.
 - As an **exegetical and doctrinal model**: employed in teaching Calvin on original sin, imputation, and sacraments; a conceptual pivot for integrating forensic and participatory accounts.
