### TITLE
Calvinism and the Problem of Evil - James N. Anderson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written within the Reformed/Calvinist theological tradition and contemporary apologetic milieu; addresses late 20th-21st century debates between classical theism, libertarian free‑will defenses, and modern critiques (e.g., process theology, open theism). Intended for seminary audiences and specialists in systematic theology and philosophy of religion.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can orthodox Calvinist commitments - particularly God's meticulous sovereignty and divine election - be reconciled with the reality of moral and natural evil without abandoning divine goodness or human responsibility?
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Clarifies the logical and evidential formulations of the problem of evil; distinguishes skeptical from theistic contexts.
 - Reconstructs classical Reformed resources: **predestination**, **meticulous providence**, **original sin**, and Christus Victor/atonement as central solutions.
 - Defends a **compatibilist account of freedom**: creaturely agency is real and moral responsibility is retained even under divine determinative decree.
 - Distinguishes **decretive will** (what God sovereignly ordains) from **preceptive/ideal will** (what God commands), and between **permissive** and **causative** actions in providence.
 - Argues that some evils are instrumentally used within God's redemptive plan to bring about greater goods (Glorification, display of divine justice and mercy, the atonement).
 - Engages philosophical theodicies (e.g., Plantinga's free‑will defense) but insists that a thoroughly theocentric, Christ‑centered narrative-rather than an abstract goods calculus-best answers the existential and theological dimensions of evil.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, John Calvin, Reformed scholastics, Jonathan Edwards; contemporary interlocutors include Alvin Plantinga, John Hick, Molinists, Arminians, open theists, and critics from process theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine sovereignty, providence, predestination (including double predestination debates), human freedom and responsibility, original sin, theodicy, Christology/atonement, eschatology (eschatological resolution of evil).
- **Closing line:** Anderson locates the resolution of the problem of evil within a disciplined Calvinist framework that preserves God's absolute sovereignty and goodness by grounding theodicy in redemptive history and a compatibilist anthropology rather than in libertarian accounts of creaturely autonomy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that theodicy must be **Christocentric**: the cross and resurrection are the primary theological answers to the problem of evil, not merely philosophical defenses.
 - Careful distinction between God's **decretive causation** and **moral culpability** of creatures; nuance in the language of causation to avoid both fatalism and semi‑Pelagianism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Critiques libertarian free‑will defenses (Plantinga et al.) for leaving Reformed doctrines of providence only superficially engaged.
 - Pushes back against simplistic Augustinian privation accounts that risk reducing God's goodness to mere absence of evil; stresses teleological ordering toward redemption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Frames a working category of **"instrumental evil"**-evils that are subordinate means within God's redemptive ends-without moralizing or excusing sin.
 - Refines the use of **meticulous providence** to allow a robust doctrine of creaturely agency (labelled as "ordered contingency").
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Modest but growing influence in conservative Reformed seminaries as a concise, pastorally useful theodicy; cited in courses on providence and apologetics.
 - Seen as a clarifying corrective by Reformed apologists who want to retain doctrinal rigor while engaging contemporary philosophy of religion.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Valuable pedagogically for bridging systematic theology and lived pastoral questions about suffering.
 - Useful as a compact model for integrating classical Reformed commitments with contemporary analytic theodicy debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sovereignty of God:** God's absolute rule; central presupposition shaping the entire theodical move.
- **Providence:** God's governance of creation; detailed as both sustaining and ordering events toward ends.
- **Predestination:** Divine election; discussed in light of moral responsibility and the problem of evil.
- **Decretive vs. Preceptive Will:** Decretive = what God ordains; preceptive = what God commands of creatures.
- **Permissive will:** God allows certain evils for greater providential purposes; distinguished from causative willing of sin.
- **Compatibilist freedom:** Freedom compatible with divine determinative causation; essential to Anderson's moral‑responsibility account.
- **Instrumental evil:** Evils that are used by God as means to achieve morally fitting greater goods (not morally good in themselves).
- **Felix culpa (fortunate fall):** The idea that God brings a greater good (redemption in Christ) from human sin; used cautiously and pastorally.
- **Original sin:** Doctrine explaining human propensity to evil and the metaphysical ground for moral culpability.
- **Christocentric theodicy:** Locating the primary answer to evil in the person and work of Christ rather than in abstract defenses.
- **Augustinian privation theory:** Classical claim that evil is a lack of good; engaged and refined rather than simply affirmed.
- **Molinism (contrast):** Presented as an alternative emphasizing middle knowledge and libertarian freedom - critiqued as incompatible with classical Reformed providence.
- **Double predestination:** Treated carefully; Anderson defends a nuanced Reformed posture that affirms divine election and reprobation while upholding human guilt.
- **Greater‑good defense:** The claim that God permits evils to achieve higher ends; integrated with narrative/Christological emphasis.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Calvinist terms on providence and freedom in seminary syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against libertarian free‑will defenses and open theism in apologetic contexts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Romans 9, Genesis 3, and Pauline anthropology within a Reformed theodicy framework.
