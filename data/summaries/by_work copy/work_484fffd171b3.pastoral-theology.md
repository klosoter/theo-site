### TITLE
**Pastoral Theology: A Treatise on the Office and Duties of the Christian Pastor** - Patrick Fairbairn (Free Church of Scotland, late 19th c.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-Disruption Scottish Presbyterianism; Free Church concern for a learned, biblical, and non-Erastian ministry; rising challenges from sacerdotalism, revivalist technique, and critical theology. Written by a leading exegete and principal, aiming to form pastors in a confessional, churchly mode.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Christian pastor is a divinely instituted office-bearer who, under the covenant of grace, serves Christ by the Word, sacraments, discipline, and pastoral oversight to build a holy, instructed, and comforted people.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Call and office:** Nature of the pastoral office; internal and external call; ordination; relation to presbytery and church courts.
 - **Ministry of the Word:** Expository preaching grounded in sound hermeneutics; law-gospel structure; doctrinal and practical application; catechesis.
 - **Sacraments and worship:** Administration of baptism and the Supper as covenant ordinances; Sabbath and stated services; family worship.
 - **Discipline and care:** Keys of the kingdom; restorative discipline; visitation; oversight of flock and families.
 - **Mission and church order:** Evangelistic responsibilities within ecclesial order; cooperation without ceding polity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture as supreme rule; Westminster Standards; Calvin and Reformed orthodoxy; engagement with Baxter and Bridges; cautions against Tractarian sacerdotalism and romantic individualism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and hermeneutics; church and ministry; sacraments; sanctification; discipline; **covenant theology** (Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace) as frames for preaching, assurance, and church life.
- **Closing line:** Pastoral faithfulness is covenantally shaped, churchly in form, and relentlessly Word-centered for the holiness and consolation of Christs flock.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Word before method:** Exposition governs all pastoral acts; typological sensitivity in preaching without allegory.
 - **Covenantal frame:** Ministry executed as administration of the covenant of grace through Word and sacraments.
 - **Office and order:** Strong articulation of office, courts, and discipline as gifts for edification, not merely mechanisms.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **sacerdotalism** (denies priestly caste; pastor is minister of the Word, not mediator).
 - Against **revivalist technique** (eschews manipulative measures; trusts ordinary means).
 - Against **Erastianism** (churchly independence under Christ), and against antinomian or moralistic preaching by maintaining law-gospel distinction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integration of hermeneutical principles into homiletics and cure of souls.
 - Sharpened account of discipline as pastoral, restorative, and covenantal.
- **Reception and influence:** Adopted in Presbyterian training; complements Baxter and Bridges while providing stricter confessional and covenantal ballast; continued use in Reformed seminaries for office, preaching, and polity.
- **Enduring value:** A balanced, ecclesial manual that joins exegesis, covenant theology, and pastoral prudence; a durable guide to ordinary means ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Office of the Ministry:** A Christ-instituted office for public Word, sacrament, and oversight within church courts.
- **Call (internal and external):** Spirit-wrought desire and gifts, publicly recognized and conferred by presbytery.
- **Ordination:** Ecclesial act confirming fitness and charging duties; ties the minister to a rule-bound stewardship.
- **Keys of the Kingdom:** Doctrinal instruction, sacraments, and discipline exercised under Scripture for binding and loosing.
- **Word and Sacrament:** Ordinary means appointed for conversion and growth; sacraments seal the Word within the covenant community.
- **Expository Preaching:** Text-governed proclamation with doctrinal clarity and specific application; avoids mere rhetoric.
- **Law and Gospel:** Law exposes sin and guides life; gospel offers Christ. Both must be preached in right order to avoid antinomianism or legalism.
- **Covenant of Works:** Original Adamic probation establishing the demand of perfect obedience and the curse of transgression; used to ground the preaching of law and the need for a second Adam. [Topic: Covenant Of Works]
- **Covenant of Grace:** Gods gracious provision in Christ administered through Word and sacrament, gathering a people by promise; frames pastoral consolation, assurance, and church discipline. [Topic: Covenant Of Grace]
- **Discipline:** Pastoral and judicial acts aiming at repentance, purity, and peace; medicinal, not merely punitive.
- **Catechesis:** Systematic instruction, especially of the young, anchoring households in doctrine and piety.
- **Visitation and Cure of Souls:** Personal application of Word; discernment, prayer, and counsel in homes and sickrooms.
- **Church Courts:** Session, presbytery, assembly; corporate discernment and accountability for doctrine and life.
- **Administration of Sacraments:** Careful admission, fencing, and instruction to guard against formalism and presumption.
- **Family Worship:** Extension of pastoral oversight through household piety and parental teaching.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for office, call, and discipline within confessional Presbyterian polity.
 - As an **exegetical-homiletical model** integrating hermeneutics, law-gospel, and covenant in preaching.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology to pastoral practice, especially in sacramental and disciplinary care.
 - As a **polemic resource** against sacerdotalism, Erastian control, and technique-driven revivalism.
