### TITLE
**Calvin and the Sabbath** (1998) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed debate on the Christian Sabbath and Lord s Day, amid renewed interest in Calvin vs Puritan sabbatarianism and confessional exegesis.
 - Written by a redemptive-historical theologian situating Calvin within his own corpus (Institutes, commentaries) and later Reformed developments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Clarify Calvin s twofold account of the fourth commandment: its typological, ceremonial dimension fulfilled in Christ and its abiding moral dimension ordering stated worship and humane rest.
 - Correct the assumption that Calvin is either anti-sabbatarian or identical to later strict sabbatarianism; show his distinct, Christocentric, eschatological Sabbath theology.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Textual exposition: Calvin on Gen 2, Exod 20, Deut 5, Isa 58; Institutes II.8 on the law and Sabbath.
 - Theological synthesis: three reasons for the Sabbath in Calvin
 - Typological prefiguration of spiritual rest in Christ (ceremonial, abrogated).
 - Provision for public worship, catechesis, and order (moral, perpetual).
 - Mercy and relief for laborers and beasts (moral, perpetual).
 - Historical comparison: Calvin vs later Reformed, especially English Puritanism and the Westminster standards.
 - Dogmatic implications: Lord s Day grounded in apostolic practice and ecclesiastical prudence, not a legal transfer of Mosaic sanctity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes II.8; relevant commentaries).
 - Interlocutors: Continental Reformers, English Puritans (e.g., Bownd), Westminster divines; later interpreters who either minimize or absolutize Sabbath continuity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Law and Gospel; threefold use of the law.**
 - **Covenant and typology; redemptive-historical fulfillment.**
 - **Ecclesiology and worship; means of grace.**
 - **Eschatology; already-not-yet rest (Heb 4).**
 - **Christian liberty and church polity.**
- **Closing line**
 - The Sabbath s center of gravity is Christ s eschatological rest realized in his resurrection and ministered on the Lord s Day for the gathered church, without Judaizing legalism and without secularized neglect.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - A crisp two-aspect reading of the fourth commandment that preserves moral perpetuity without a seventh-day or legal transfer.
 - Lord s Day as an ecclesiastical, apostolic ordinance serving the means of grace, not as a re-inscribed Mosaic statute.
 - Eschatological framing: the day signifies participation in Christ s consummative rest.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against readings that make Calvin antinomian on the Sabbath: he affirms abiding obligations of worship and mercy.
 - Against strict sabbatarian claims: Calvin does not teach a creationally fixed one-in-seven law or Sunday as the Sabbath by divine command.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on typology-fulfillment logic as determinative for the fourth commandment.
 - Distinguishing moral content (stated worship, mercy) from calendrical specification (adiaphorous in itself, yet prudentially necessary).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Frequently cited in Presbyterian and Reformed discussions to recalibrate Calvin s position vis-a-vis Westminster-era sabbatarianism.
 - Used in seminary curricula to model redemptive-historical method in ethics and worship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies a perennial pastoral issue with careful historical theology.
 - Offers a principled account that guards both Christian liberty and the centrality of Lord s Day worship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fourth Commandment**: Command concerning Sabbath; in Calvin, partly ceremonial (type), partly moral (worship and mercy).
- **Typology**: Old covenant signs prefiguring realities fulfilled in Christ; Sabbath as sign of eschatological rest.
- **Moral vs Ceremonial**: Calvin s distinction; Sabbath s ceremonial shadow abrogated, moral concern enduring.
- **Spiritual Rest**: Rest in Christ from sin s labors; climax of Sabbath meaning, realized eschatologically.
- **Lord s Day**: First day assembly rooted in apostolic pattern; ecclesiastically enjoined for worship, not a Mosaic transfer.
- **Creation Ordinance**: Calvin resists construing a binding one-in-seven law from creation, while acknowledging creation s witness to rest.
- **Judaizing**: Treating the day with Mosaic exactness; Calvin rejects calendrical legalism for gospel liberty.
- **Means of Grace**: Preaching and sacraments centrally exercised on the Lord s Day; moral rationale for a stated day.
- **Christian Liberty**: Freedom from ceremonial prescripts; liberty ordered to edification and corporate worship.
- **Church Polity**: The church s authority to appoint assemblies; prudential necessity of a weekly day.
- **Already-Not-Yet**: Eschatological structure; present participation in rest anticipates consummation.
- **Third Use of the Law**: The Decalogue guides the regenerate; the fourth commandment instructs worship and mercy.
- **Mercy and Rest for Laborers**: Ethical dimension of Sabbath; care for servants and creation.
- **Apostolic Practice**: Early church pattern undergirding the Lord s Day without legalistic codification.
- **Col 2 and Rom 14**: Texts delimiting binding holy days; inform Calvin s non-Judaizing stance.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source on Sabbath continuity-discontinuity and Lord s Day practice in ecclesiology and worship.
 - As a redemptive-historical model for handling law, typology, and fulfillment in ethics and sanctification.
 - As a pastoral-theological guide to the means of grace, Christian liberty, and church order.
 - As a conceptual pivot for eschatology applied to weekly worship and perseverance as foretaste of final rest.
