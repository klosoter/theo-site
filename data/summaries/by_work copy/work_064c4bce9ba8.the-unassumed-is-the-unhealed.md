### TITLE
The Unassumed Is the Unhealed - Kevin Chiarot

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary (21st-century) Reformed-evangelical theological work that participates in the recent recovery of classical Christology and patristic idioms within Protestant theology. Written amid renewed interest in union with Christ and debates over the scope of the atonement.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The axiom **"the unassumed is the unhealed"** functions as the controlling proposition: Christ must truly assume everything of human nature that needs healing if redemption is to be real and effective. The work diagnoses modern reductions of atonement (chiefly purely juridical accounts) as insufficient because they fail to account for Christ's ontological assumption and participation in human nature.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical‑theological retrieval of the patristic formulation (esp. Gregory/Cyril/Athanasius) and its logic: assumption -> recapitulation -> healing.
 - Critique of one‑dimensional atonement models that prioritize forensic satisfaction without addressing the restoration of human faculties, body, and relationality.
 - Positive constructive proposal: a Christology that integrates **hypostatic union**, **recapitulation**, and **federal/headship** so that Christ's assumption effects ontological transformation of fallen humanity.
 - Practical/pastoral extension: implications for sanctification, ecclesial life, sacramentality, and pastoral care (Christ as physician of whole persons).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Patristic authors: Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria.
 - Reformation and post‑Reformation figures: Augustine, Calvin (on union and headship).
 - Modern interlocutors: critics of penal substitution (broadly sketched), proponents of robust union theology (contemporary Reformed scholars).
 - Occasional engagement with Eastern theosis language to elucidate "healing" without collapsing distinctions.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), soteriology (atonement theories, recapitulation, penal and forensic elements), anthropology (image of God, fall, wounded humanity), ecclesiology (participation in Christ), sanctification and pastoral theology (healing, sacramental life).
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is this claim: **only what Christ truly assumed into his person he can redeem-therefore a full-orbed doctrine of the incarnation is indispensable to genuine soteriology.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Re-centers the axiom "the unassumed is the unhealed" as a hermeneutical principle for evaluating atonement accounts rather than a mere patristic slogan.
 - Stresses ontological and therapeutic dimensions of redemption alongside, not necessarily instead of, forensic satisfaction.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges theological moves that reduce atonement to legal transaction by arguing they risk leaving unaimed aspects of human existence unredeemed (body, emotions, social relations).
 - Pushes Reformed theology to recover patristic resources on assumption and recapitulation without abandoning key Protestant commitments (justification, substitution).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulates a precise dialectic between **assumption** and **healing** as normative categories for evaluating doctrines of salvation.
 - Deploys "assumption-account" as a corrective rubric to test whether a theological model secures real participation in Christ.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Useful within Reformed circles seeking deeper Christological grounding for union theology; cited selectively in studies on incarnational atonement and pastoral theology.
 - Has served as a bridge language in ecumenical conversations with Eastern theological emphases (theosis/recapitulation).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies the stakes of incarnational language for systematic doctrine and pastoral practice.
 - Serves as a compact corrective to reductionisms in soteriology and a teaching aid in courses on Christology and atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The Unassumed Is the Unhealed:** The central axiom; what Christ did not assume, he did not redeem.
- **Assumption:** Christ's taking up of human nature in its totality (body, soul, will, faculties).
- **Healing/Recapitulation:** The process by which assumed human nature is restored and transformed in Christ.
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; the ontological basis for assumption and healing.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum (implications):** How properties of the human and divine are related in Christ-used to ground real participation and healing without confusion.
- **Federal Headship / Representation:** Christ as representative who assumes and thus effects corporate healing; connects to covenantal soteriology.
- **Forensic/Penal Elements:** Acknowledged but constrained-treated as part of a larger, multi‑dimensional atonement economy.
- **Christus Medicus:** Christ as physician of the whole person; pastoral application for counseling and sacramental life.
- **Theosis / Participation:** Borrowed cautiously from Eastern language to describe transformative participation without collapsing sanctification into divinization.
- **Anthropological Wounds:** The dimensions (bodily, psychological, relational, moral) that require assumption for healing.
- **Soteriological Economy:** The integrated map of incarnation, atonement, resurrection, and Spirit‑gift for human restoration.
- **Ontological vs. Forensic Models:** Distinction emphasized to show complementary, not competing, roles in a full soteriology.
- **Recapitulation vs. Substitution:** Framing recapitulation as supplementing substitutionary accounts to ensure ontological restoration.
- **Pastoral Implications:** Use of the assumption‑healing axiom in pastoral care, liturgy, and sacramental theology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for incarnational/assumptive soteriology in Christology courses.
- As a **polemic** or corrective against strictly forensic/penal‑only accounts of atonement.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Pauline union texts (e.g., Romans, Colossians) in light of recapitulation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking theology and pastoral practice (Christ as healer of whole persons).
