### TITLE
Created and Creating - William Edgar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical theology engaging late 20th-early 21st century science-religion debates. Moves between analytic philosophy of religion, historical doctrinal resources, and pastoral concerns about culture, ecology, and worship.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God is equally the transcendent origin (Creator) and the immanent, ongoing cause (Creating) of every aspect of the world. A robust doctrine of creation must account for divine freedom and action without reducing God to a process deity, compromising creaturely autonomy, or succumbing to naturalistic explanations.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of traditional doctrines: creatio ex nihilo, providence, concurrence, and the distinction between primary and secondary causation.
 - Philosophical defense of divine action that preserves both God's immutability and His temporal activity (contra process theology and certain forms of deism).
 - Theological exploitation: implications for revelation, worship, ethics, aesthetics, and ecological responsibility.
 - Correction of modern errors: naturalism/materialism, theological dualisms that split spiritual and material, and the diminishment of creation's goodness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Classical and Reformed sources: Augustine, Aquinas (as background), Calvin, Kuyper.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: philosophers and scientists in the science-faith dialogue (analytic theists, some naturalists), proponents of process theology, and secular reductionists.
 - Use of biblical exegesis (Genesis, Psalms, New Testament) to ground doctrinal claims.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation (ex nihilo and continuous), providence and concurrence, divine action, general revelation/natural theology, Trinity (as the basis for relationality in creation), Christology (incarnation as decisive for the valuation of the created order), anthropology (creaturely vocation), and practical ethics (stewardship, worship).
- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** Theology of creation must hold together God's sovereignty and continual causation with the genuine, God-given reality and vocation of the creaturely world - a vision that secures worship, ethics, and one integrated engagement with science and culture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong corrective to both deism (God distant) and process theology (God changing into being), insisting on a God who sustains without being circumscribed by the created order.
 - Persistent attention to the theological significance of beauty and goodness in creation as evidences of divine action and purposes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Counters naturalistic reductionism that erases divine agency.
 - Opposes process/panentheistic models that dilute divine immutability and aseity.
 - Refines older scholastic categories (concurrence, primary/secondary causation) for engagement with contemporary science.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes "creatio continua" in accessible terms for dialogue with scientists: not magical interference but continuous sustaining causality that allows lawful study of nature.
 - Stresses "vocation" language for creatures: creation is not merely created but called and oriented toward divine purposes.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles for providing a biblically faithful, philosophically informed account of divine action.
 - Cited by teachers and students engaged in theology-science interfaces and in discussions of ecological ethics and worship.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between classical doctrine and contemporary questions about divine action, offering usable categories for pastors, philosophers, and scientists in theological contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creatio ex nihilo:** God as originator of all that exists; foundation for divine freedom and creature contingency.
- **Creatio continua:** Ongoing sustaining activity of God; explains lawful regularity and room for secondary causation.
- **Primary and secondary causation:** Distinction preserving God's sovereignty (primary) while affirming genuine causal power of creatures (secondary).
- **Concurrence:** Doctrine that God cooperates with creaturely causes without overruling their character.
- **Divine action (non-interventionist):** Model of God working within natural processes rather than by breaking them arbitrarily.
- **Divine immutability and temporal activity:** Balancing God's unchanging nature with real, dynamic action in history.
- **Vocation of creation:** Creatures as called toward purposes; grounds for stewardship and cultural engagement.
- **General revelation:** Creation as a theophany/witness to God's attributes and purposes - epistemic role in natural theology.
- **Beauty and goodness of creation:** Aesthetic and moral categories used as theological evidence for divine intentionality.
- **Providence:** God's governance that orders history and individual events without negating creaturely agency.
- **Trinitarian basis for creation:** Relationality of God as normative for creaturely relation and purpose.
- **Incarnation/Christology:** Christ's enfleshment as confirmation of creation's dignity and redemption.
- **Anti-naturalism:** Polemical stance against reductionist accounts that exclude God's causal role.
- **Middle knowledge/Philisophical engagements (implicit):** Philosophical resources used to articulate how God knows and ordains without coercion.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary formulations of creatio continua, concurrence, and vocation-language.
- As a **polemic** against process theology and naturalistic reductionism in science-and-religion discussions.
- As an **exegetical and normative model** for preaching and teaching on Genesis, providence, worship, and ecological responsibility.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed theology courses connecting doctrine of God to ethics, aesthetics, and engagement with culture.
