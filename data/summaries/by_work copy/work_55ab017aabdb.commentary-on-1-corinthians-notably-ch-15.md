### TITLE
**Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 15): Textual Exegesis in Scholastic Register for the Resurrection and Apostolic Doctrine**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 13th-century Dominican scholasticism; lectio-based university exegesis.
 - Written late in Aquinas career; integrates Aristotelian metaphysics with patristic exegesis.
 - Part of the Pauline commentaries corpus, aligned with the Glossa tradition but distinctly Thomistic.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Exposition and defense of apostolic teaching on church order, charity, sacraments, and above all the bodily resurrection in ch. 15, grounding ecclesial life in the risen Christ as head.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Corinthian disorders: unity, scandal, lawsuits, sexual ethics, marriage, food offered to idols.
 - Worship: headship, Eucharist abuses, spiritual gifts, love as the forma of all gifts (ch. 13).
 - Resurrection (ch. 15):
 - Proof from the gospel tradition and witnesses to Christs resurrection.
 - Consequences if there is no resurrection; soteriology collapses.
 - Adam-Christ typology: death in Adam; life in Christ; order of resurrection.
 - Nature of the resurrected body: identity and integrity; glorified qualities.
 - Victory over death; moral exhortation to steadfastness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture as norma: Paul read by the literal sense, elucidated by Fathers (Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory; with awareness of Chrysostom).
 - Philosophical tools: Aristotle on form-soul-body, causality; Boethius on person and causation; John Damascene on resurrection.
 - Interlocutors opposed: Platonizing spiritualism, Manichean dualism, materialist denials; misreadings of 1 Cor 15 texts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology**: literal and spiritual senses; apostolic authority; coherence of Scripture.
 - **Christology**: Christs resurrection as firstfruits, head, cause of ours.
 - **Eschatology**: general resurrection, order and causes, properties of glorified bodies, last enemy death.
 - **Sin and Anthropology**: original sin in Adam; death as penalty; body-soul unity and personal identity.
 - **Covenantal-Economic themes**: two Adams as corporate heads; sacramental economy ordered to resurrection life.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity is the risen Christ as head and cause, who restores the same human nature to incorruption and gathers the church into ordered, charitable worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Four properties of the glorified body: **impassibility, clarity, agility, subtlety**.
 - Identity doctrine: the numerically same body rises, perfected, not replaced.
 - Causal analysis: Christ as **efficient cause** of universal resurrection and **exemplar and meritorious cause** of the glory of the just.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against spiritualizing readings: a **spiritual body** is a body governed by spirit, not an immaterial entity.
 - Clarifies 1 Cor 15:50: **flesh and blood** excludes corruptibility, not human nature.
 - Rejects vicarious baptisms (Marcionite practice) in explaining **baptized for the dead**; reads it with reference to hope of resurrection and perseverance under peril.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Metaphysical precision on form-matter continuity to secure bodily identity.
 - Ordered taxis of resurrection: Christ, those who belong to Christ at his coming, then the end.
 - Use of seed analogy to develop continuity-discontinuity without equivocation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard medieval account of resurrected properties; echoed by later scholastics and magisterial catechesis.
 - Reformed scholastics often adopt or debate Thomistic accounts of bodily properties and the Adam-Christ parallel while maintaining biblical exegesis from 1 Cor 15.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of literal, theologically thick exegesis.
 - Stable categories for teaching the resurrection, original sin and headship, and the moral implications of eschatological hope.
