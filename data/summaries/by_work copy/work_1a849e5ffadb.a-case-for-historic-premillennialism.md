### TITLE
A Case for Historic Premillennialism - Craig L. Blomberg & Sung Wook Chung (eds.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary evangelical reassessment (Baker Academic, 2012) within post-20th-century debates over millennial positions. Responds to the dominance of dispensational premillennialism in popular Evangelicalism and the strong academic presence of amillennialism/postmillennialism.
- **Central thesis:** Historic premillennialism is a coherent, biblically defensible, and historically grounded eschatological option distinct from dispensational premillennialism and superior to amillennial and postmillennial alternatives on several exegetical and theological counts.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Biblical exegesis of key texts (Revelation 20; Matthew 24-25; 1-2 Thessalonians; Daniel; Romans 11) defending a future, literal thousand-year reign following Christ's bodily return.
 - Hermeneutical critique of amillennial allegorizing and of dispensational literalism that enforces an Israel-Church sharp divide.
 - Historical survey showing early church chiliasm (e.g., Justin, Irenaeus) and continuity of premillennial expectation prior to Augustine's reinterpretation.
 - Theological synthesis linking millennium reading to covenantal continuity, Christology (eschatological reign of the risen Christ), and pastoral implications (hope, mission, ethics).
 - Practical and polemical engagement with dispensational and amillennial arguments-clarifying misunderstandings and reformulating premillennial commitments without dispensational presuppositions.
- **Figures/sources engaged:** Scripture (primary), patristic witnesses (early church chiliasm), Augustine (as historical foil), major modern proponents of rival positions; broad evangelical scholarship for comparative argumentation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (central), covenant theology, ecclesiology (Israel and Church), Christology (return and reign), resurrection and judgment, hermeneutics of prophecy.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Historic premillennialism asserts that Christ's bodily, parousial return inaugurates a future, earthly millennium that fulfills covenant promises without resorting to dispensational severance of Israel and the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Clarifying "historic" vs "dispensational" premillennialism:** Emphasizes continuity of people of God and covenantal promises; rejects secret rapture and rigid dispensational categories.
- **Hermeneutical balance:** Advocates a measured literalness - a reading that respects genre (apocalyptic symbolism) but affirms a concrete, future fulfillment of Revelation 20 rather than total allegorization.
- **Patristic anchoring:** Reinvigorates the claim that premillennial expectation has legitimate patristic roots and was not merely a modern invention.
- **Theological corrections to rivals:**
 - To amillennialism: challenges the reduction of Revelation 20 to wholly symbolic present-reality readings and contends this undermines certain covenant promises and future hope.
 - To dispensationalism: disputes the methodological insistence on a rigid Israel-Church split and the theological necessity of a secret pretribulational rapture.
- **Conceptual emphasis:** Frames the millennium as a consummating but transitional earthly reign that leads into the final judgment and the new creation - thus preserving both realized and future eschatology.
- **Reception and influence:** Valued in evangelical circles seeking a non-dispensational premillennial alternative; frequently cited in seminaries and debates as a scholarly corrective to pop-dispensationalism; has helped normalize historic premillennialism as academically respectable.
- **Enduring value:** Useful for pastors and scholars who want a biblically attentive, historically informed, and theologically moderate premillennialism that engages rival views seriously.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historic premillennialism:** The position defended - Christ returns bodily before a future thousand-year earthly reign; distinct from dispensationalism primarily on covenantal continuity and rapture chronology.
- **Dispensational premillennialism:** Contrasted position - sharp Israel/Church divide, secret rapture, strict literalism; critiqued throughout.
- **Amillennialism:** Rival view that interprets the millennium as the present, spiritual reign of Christ; challenged for alleged over-allegorization of Revelation 20.
- **Millennium (Revelation 20):** Interpreted as a future, real reign of Christ on earth following his parousia and the binding of Satan.
- **Parousia (Second Coming):** Central event that inaugurates the millennium; bodily, visible, decisive.
- **Hermeneutical literalism vs. typological reading:** Book argues for a calibrated literalness that recognizes apocalyptic symbolism while affirming future literal fulfillment.
- **Israel-Church continuity:** Key covenantal claim: promises to Israel receive fulfilment in ways that preserve continuity with the Church rather than require an absolute ethical/theological separation.
- **Tribulation/Great Tribulation:** Discussed as part of the sequence before Christ's return; historic premillennialists typically affirm a future tribulation but reject a pretribulational secret rapture.
- **First resurrection / resurrection order:** Exegetical locus - defense of bodily resurrection preceding or associated with the millennium.
- **Eschatological ethics:** How future hope shapes mission and Christian practice.
- **Patristic chiliasm:** Use of early church testimony (Justin, Irenaeus) to ground historicity of premillennial expectation.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise, scholarly definition and defense of historic premillennialism for classroom and seminary syllabi.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Revelation 20 and related prophetic texts against both dispensational and amillennial readings.
 - As polemical resource in intra-evangelical debates, offering historical and theological ammunition for non-dispensational premillennial positions.
