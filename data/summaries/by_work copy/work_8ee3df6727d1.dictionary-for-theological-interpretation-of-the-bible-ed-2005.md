### TITLE
**Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (DTIB)** 
Editor: **Kevin J. Vanhoozer** (ed.) 
Year: **2005** 
Genre: **Reference work** mapping and resourcing theological interpretation across Scripture, doctrine, hermeneutics, and ecclesial practice.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 2000s resurgence of theological interpretation in dialogue with, and corrective to, dominant historical-critical paradigms.
 - Evangelical yet ecumenically conversant; retrieval of patristic-medieval exegesis alongside modern hermeneutics.
 - Intersects with canonical, postliberal, and speech-act approaches; situated amid renewed attention to Scripture in church and academy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to read Scripture as **divine discourse** within the **rule of faith** so that exegesis and theology mutually inform the churchs understanding and practice.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Alphabetized entries that define concepts, map debates, retrieve sources, and offer bibliographies.
 - Major moves across entries:
 - Recenter interpretation on **canon, creed, and church** as interpretive context.
 - Articulate **triune communicative action** (speech-act theory) to explain inspiration, authority, and Scripture-as-performance.
 - Retrieve **figural/literal** reading under a thick sense of the literal shaped by Christ and canon.
 - Clarify **principia** of theology (principium essendi and cognoscendi) and **theology as science** in service of method.
 - Integrate loci: revelation, Scripture, Trinity, Christology, anthropology (e.g., **psychosomatic unity**), and ecclesiology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic and medieval: Irenaeus (rule of faith), Augustine, Aquinas.
 - Reformation and post-Reformation: Luther, Calvin, Reformed orthodox (principia).
 - Modern and contemporary: Barth, Childs, Frei, Lindbeck, Gadamer, Ricoeur; speech-act theorists (Austin, Searle); critical realism (Polanyi, N. T. Wright).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general/special), **inspiration** and **authority** (self-attestation), **canon**, **accommodation/incarnational analogy**, **nature and task of theology**, **human nature** (psychosomatic unity), **Trinity**, **Christology**, **ecclesial interpretation**.
- **Closing line**
 - The dictionarys center of gravity: Scripture as the **Triunes communicative action** to be **performed by the church** under the canon and rule of faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Scripture as **speech-act**: locutions authored by humans, illocutions by the triune God, perlocutions forming the church.
 - **Theodramatic** and **performative** hermeneutic: the church enacts the canon in faithful improvisation.
 - Retrieval of **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** to frame divine authorship and human textuality.
 - Thick **literal sense** shaped by canon and Christ, enabling figural reading without allegorical license.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **historicism** and atomistic exegesis that severs text from doctrine; against **biblicism** that neglects catholic rule and tradition.
 - Moves beyond **foundationalism** and **subjectivism** via critical realism and interpretive virtues.
 - Distinguishes yet binds **exegesis** and **dogmatics**; resists both domination of either.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Triune authorial intention**; **principia** for theology retrieved and updated; **canonical-linguistic** and **ecclesial** location of interpretation.
 - Clarifies **self-attestation** not as circularity but as Spirit-enabled recognition of divine discourse.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyst within the Theological Interpretation of Scripture movement; widely used in evangelical, Reformed, and ecumenical settings.
 - Companion to projects like the Brazos Theological Commentary; shaped pedagogy in hermeneutics and prolegomena.
 - Critiqued by some historical critics for privileging doctrine; welcomed by many for disciplined ressourcement.
- **Enduring value**
 - A reliable **definition source** across loci; an integrative map linking bibliology, method, and practice with curated bibliographies.
 - Durable conceptual toolkit for reading Scripture as Scripture in the academy and church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theological Interpretation of Scripture (TIS)**: Reading the Bible as divine discourse in and for the church, under canon and creed.
- **Canon and Rule of Faith**: Canon as norming norm; regula fidei as hermeneutical guide that contours the literal sense and guards figural reading.
- **Triune Communicative Action**: God speaks through human writers; speech-act triad (locution/illocution/perlocution) explains inspiration, authority, and effect.
- **Authorial Intention (Divine/Human)**: Coordinated agency; divine intention supervenes without effacing human authors.
- **Literal Sense and Figural Reading**: Literal as what the text does in its canonical form; figural fulfills rather than escapes the literal.
- **Accommodation and Incarnational Analogy**: God speaks baby-talk; Scripture as fully human text that is fully Gods Word by the Spirit.
- **Revelation: General and Special**: Creation and conscience witness; Scripture and Christ uniquely reveal and interpret salvific truth.
- **Principia and Theology as Science**:
 - Principium essendi: the triune God as source of theological being.
 - Principium cognoscendi: revelation/Scripture as cognitive source; theology disciplined by its principia.
- **Self-Attestation and Authority of Scripture**: Scripture bears divine authority intrinsically; Spirit grants recognition; authority is communicative, not merely coercive.
- **Nature and Task of Theology**: Sapiential, ecclesial, and doxological science ordered to faithful understanding for the churchs mission.
- **Ecclesial Performance (Theodrama)**: Church improvises faithfulness consistent with canonical script; interpretation aims at obedient practice.
- **Psychosomatic Unity (Anthropology)**: Human persons as embodied souls; resists dualisms; shapes readings of resurrection, sanctification, and vocation.
- **Interpretive Virtues**: Charity, humility, patience, courage; moral formation aids truthful reading.
- **Canonical-Linguistic Approach**: Doctrines regulate how biblical language shapes communal practice and confession.
- **Critical Realism**: Epistemic posture acknowledging reality and interpretive mediation; avoids naive realism and relativism.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition and orientation source** for bibliology topics: revelation, authority, canon, accommodation.
 - As a **methodological compass** for prolegomena: principia, theology as science, nature/task of theology.
 - As an **exegetical model**: canonical, ecclesial, figural readings guided by rule of faith.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Scripture to anthropology (psychosomatic unity) and ecclesial praxis (performance).
