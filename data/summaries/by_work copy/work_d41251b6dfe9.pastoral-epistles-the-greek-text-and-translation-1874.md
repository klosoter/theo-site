### TITLE
**Patrick Fairbairn, Pastoral Epistles: The Greek Text and Translation (1874)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-century Free Church of Scotland; conservative Reformed exegesis amid rising higher criticism (Tuebingen school) and maturing textual criticism (Tregelles, Tischendorf, Lachmann). Aimed at clergy and scholars with the Greek text in view.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Pastorals are authentically Pauline and normatively articulate gospel doctrine and ordered ministry. Careful Greek exegesis resolves doctrinal and ecclesial disputes, safeguarding the church's life and confession.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Prefatory defense of Pauline authorship against critical objections.
 - Sequential commentary on 1 Timothy, Titus, 2 Timothy, with Greek notes and doctrinal syntheses at key cruxes.
 - Focus points: offices (episkopos/presbyteros, diakonos), the confessional formulae (pistos ho logos; 1 Tim 3:16), atonement (1 Tim 2:5-6), law/gospel (1 Tim 1:8-11), eschatological apostasy (1 Tim 4; 2 Tim 3).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Converses with Calvin, Bengel, Alford, Ellicott; engages De Wette, Huther, Baur; weighs readings from Tregelles and Tischendorf; cites patristic reception where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Revelation/Scripture:** authenticity, inspiration, use of creedal materials.
 - **Christology:** deity and mediatorship (Tit 2:13; 1 Tim 2:5-6; 3:16); basis for **Munus Triplex**.
 - **Soteriology:** ransom (antilutron), universality of prayer and mission.
 - **Ecclesiology:** parity of elder/bishop; qualifications; ordination; confessional discipline.
 - **Ethics/Law:** **lawful use of the law**; godliness (eusebeia).
 - **Covenant:** promissory frame (Tit 1:2; 2 Tim 1:1); pastoral deposit as covenantal trust; relation of Mosaic law to gospel in Reformed terms (against Mosaic-as-works-in-substance).
 - **Eschatology:** **Antichrist and Man of Lawlessness** motif via apostasy and false teaching trajectories.
- **Closing line:** The gospel entrusted to the church yields godliness and order, preserved through sound words, faithful offices, and confessed truth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats the Pastorals' **faithful sayings** as early confessional kernels shaping Reformed **Confessional Formulations of covenant** and life.
 - Grammatico-syntactical case for Titus 2:13 affirming Christ's deity; 1 Tim 3:16 as a christological hymn expressing elements of **Munus Triplex** (manifestation/prophetic, vindication/priestly, reign/kingly).
 - Parity of presbyter/episkopos grounding Presbyterian polity.
 - Balanced account of the **lawful use of the law** aligning with Reformed pedagogy, not antinomianism.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Counters Tuebingen denial of Pauline authorship and late institutionalism theses.
 - Pushes back on episcopal readings that separate bishop from elder.
 - Eschatology: resists speculative identifications; reads Pastorals' apostasy texts as consonant with Pauline-Johannine **Antichrist** patterns without over-claiming proof of the singular **Man of Lawlessness** here.
 - Covenant: denies that the Pastorals support a **Mosaic Covenant as covenant of works as to substance**; instead, they assume a promissory, grace-centered continuity with pedagogical law.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The pastoral **deposit (paratheke)** as a covenantal-trust motif governing ministry and confession.
 - Consolidation of the Pastorals' creedal fragments into a template for catechesis and confession.
- **Reception and influence:** Became a standard conservative Reformed commentary; cited in polity debates (elders/deacons), Christology (Tit 2:13), and catechetical use of the faithful sayings; a stabilizing reference against higher criticism.
- **Enduring value:** Durable exegetical judgments on Greek cruxes; model for integrating text, doctrine, and church order; strategic for studies in **Covenant Theology in the Reformed tradition**, confessionalism, and pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pistos ho logos (Faithful is the saying):** Formula marking creedal/summary statements (e.g., 1 Tim 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; 2 Tim 2:11; Tit 3:8); resource for **Confessional Formulations**.

- **Antilytron (Ransom, 1 Tim 2:6):** Substitutionary scope; grounds catholic mission and prayer.
- **Megas Theos kai Soter (Tit 2:13):** Construction supporting Christ's full deity; christological keystone.
- **Hygiainousa didaskalia (Sound doctrine):** Health metaphor for teaching that guards covenant life and order.
- **Eusebeia (Godliness):** Ethical telos issuing from gospel truth; pastoral aim.
- **Paratheke (Deposit, 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 1:14):** Entrusted truth; covenant-trust to be guarded through the Spirit.
- **Oikos Theou (Household of God, 1 Tim 3:15):** Ecclesial identity; shapes office and discipline.
- **Episkopos/Presbyteros; Diakonos:** Office terms; parity of elder/bishop; distinct diaconate.
- **Nomimos chresis nomou (Lawful use of the law, 1 Tim 1:8-11):** Pedagogical and normative uses; argues against reading the Mosaic economy as works in substance.
 - Distinguishes condemnatory (for the lawless) from didactic uses for the righteous in Christ.
- **Eschatai hemerai; hysterois kairois (Last days/latter times):** Apostasy trajectory; situates **Antichrist** as a recurring principle culminating in later Pauline teaching.
- **Kenophonia/gnosis pseudonymos (Vain babblings/knowledge falsely so called, 1 Tim 6:20):** Proto-gnostic errors; antichristic in tendency.
- **Epaggelia zoes (Promise of life, 2 Tim 1:1; Tit 1:2):** Promissory-covenantal frame across redemptive history.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Munus Triplex:** 1 Tim 2:5-6; 3:16; Tit 2:13 supply exegetical anchors for Christ's threefold office.
 - **Covenant Theology (Reformed):** Promissory texts and the deposit/household motifs inform covenant continuity and administration.
 - **Confessional Formulations:** Faithful sayings and hymnic material provide creedal templates and catechetical substance.
 - **Antichrist/Man of Lawlessness:** Apostasy passages form an exegetical base to triangulate Pauline-Johannine antichrist expectations.
 - **Mosaic Covenant debate:** 1 Tim 1 clarifies law's uses, countering a Mosaic-as-works-in-substance reading while preserving its pedagogical function.
