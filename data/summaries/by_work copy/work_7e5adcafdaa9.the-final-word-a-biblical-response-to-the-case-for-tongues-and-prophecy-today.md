### TITLE
**The Final Word: A Biblical Response to the Case for Tongues and Prophecy Today** - O. Palmer Robertson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1990s Reformed response to the charismatic renewal and third wave movements.
 - Engages evangelical debates on gifts after classic Pentecostalism and neocharismatic practice; situates within a confessional, covenantal Reformed milieu.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** New Testament tongues and prophecy were **foundational, redemptive-historical signs** tied to the apostolic era and have ceased; Scripture is the **final word** for the church.
 - Problem addressed: claims of ongoing, noncanonical prophecy and glossolalia within continuationist frameworks.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Revelation and Canon:** God has spoken definitively in the Son (Heb 1:1-2); apostolic witness inscripturates this final revelation; the canon closes with the cessation of apostles.
 - **Foundation Text:** Eph 2:20 frames apostles and prophets as the church's once-for-all **foundation**, not a perpetually rebuilt superstructure.
 - **Attestation of Apostles:** Miraculous signs functioned as authenticating marks (2 Cor 12:12; Heb 2:3-4), clustering at epochal turning points.
 - **Tongues as Sign:** 1 Cor 14:21 cites Isa 28; foreign tongues serve as a **covenant-judgment sign** to unbelieving Israel, not as a normative private prayer language.
 - **Nature of NT Prophecy:** NT prophecy bears divine authority continuous with OT prophecy; against proposals of routinely fallible, nonbinding prophecy.
 - **Pastoral/Worship Order:** Corporate practice must be edifying and regulated; modern practices fail apostolic tests (intelligibility, interpretation, authority).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Responds chiefly to **Wayne Grudem** (fallible prophecy thesis) and **third wave** advocates (e.g., John Wimber); notes claims popularized by **Jack Deere**.
 - Stands in the Reformed line of **B. B. Warfield** while advancing a biblical-theological frame.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Canon**, **Sola Scriptura**, **Pneumatology** (gifts, Spirit's work), **Ecclesiology** (authority, worship), **Covenant Theology** and **redemptive history**, with eschatological horizons.
- **Closing line**
 - The **sufficiency and finality of Scripture** anchor the church; sign gifts tied to laying the foundation have fulfilled their purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong use of **Eph 2:20** to render prophecy and tongues foundational and nonrepeatable.
 - **Isaiah 28 lens** for tongues as judicial sign to Israel, integrated with 1 Cor 14.
 - Redemptive-historical clustering of miracles as epochal accreditation, not timeless norm.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rejects **fallible-prophecy** models that would lower divine speech below OT standards (Deut 18).
 - Distinguishes **revelation** from **illumination**; opposes treating impressions as divine words.
 - Counters pneumatic hierarchies of **Pentecostalism** (second blessing) with Spirit's ordinary work through Word and sacrament.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies language of **foundational gifts** vs. **edifying gifts**; insists on canonical closure as Christocentric finality.
 - Reframes tongues primarily as a **covenant sign** rather than a private devotional glossolalia.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in conservative Reformed seminaries and presbyteries as a standard cessationist brief.
 - Frequently cited in debates on **Continuationism vs Cessationism** and in **Pentecostalism and Reformed Response** forums for its exegetical economy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Combines exegetical detail with biblical-theological coherence; a concise template for pastoral evaluation of charismatic claims and for teaching **Sola Scriptura**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism:** View that certain sign/revelatory gifts ceased with the apostolic foundation.
- **Continuationism:** Claims ongoing prophecy/tongues; Robertson critiques especially the fallible-prophecy variant.
- **Foundational gifts (Eph 2:20):** Apostles and prophets as once-for-all foundation of the church.
- **Apostolicity:** Authority tied to those commissioned eyewitnesses whose teaching norms the church.
- **Canon/Final Word:** The closed, sufficient Scripture as Christ's definitive speech to his church.
- **Tongues as covenant-judgment sign:** Foreign speech signaling judgment on unbelief (Isa 28; 1 Cor 14:21).
 - Contrasted with private prayer-language models; emphasizes intelligibility and interpretation.
- **Prophecy (NT):** Authoritative divine speech continuous with OT standards; not merely impressionistic guidance.
- **Attestation texts:** Heb 2:3-4; 2 Cor 12:12 as markers of miracle clusters authenticating revelatory agents.
- **Redemptive-historical epochs:** Concentrations of revelatory signs at turning points (exodus, prophetic era, Christ/apostles).
- **Illumination vs Revelation:** Spirit's ongoing work to apply Scripture vs new binding words.
- **Sola Scriptura:** Scripture alone the norming norm; charismatic claims tested by this sufficiency.
- **Order and edification:** 1 Cor 12-14 principles governing worship practice.
- **Pentecost (Acts 2):** Inbreaking of the age to come; sign-functions fulfilled as mission spreads.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional and polemical anchor in debates on **Continuationism vs Cessationism**.
 - As a Reformed exegetical model in **Pentecostalism and Reformed Response**, especially on 1 Cor 12-14 and Eph 2:20.
 - Indirectly in discussions of **Romans 11 and Israel's Future**, via tongues as a covenant sign to unbelieving Israel and the transition to Gentile inclusion.
