### TITLE
**Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit** (1979) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-1970s Reformed response to ascendant Pentecostal and Charismatic movements (classical and neo-). Written in a Westminster Seminary, Vosian redemptive-historical milieu; heir to Warfield yet offering a different, biblical-theological framing.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** What is the meaning of Pentecost and Spirit-baptism? Are tongues, prophecy, and other revelatory gifts normative for the church today? Thesis: Pentecost is a once-for-all, eschatological event bound to Christ's exaltation; Spirit-baptism is coextensive with union with Christ for every believer; revelatory and foundational gifts are tied to the apostolic era and do not continue as ordinary endowments.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Pentecost in redemptive history: The Spirit's outpouring fulfills Joel 2 and inaugurates the last days; it is epochal, not repeatable in kind.
 - Spirit-baptism defined: Not a post-conversion second blessing, but the eschatological gift bestowed on all who are in Christ (1 Cor 12:13; Rom 8), integral to salvation.
 - Acts as salvation-historical narrative: Transitional episodes (Acts 2, 8, 10, 19) mark covenantal expansion (Jews, Samaritans, Gentiles, disciples of John) and are not templates for a two-stage or subsequence ordo.
 - Tongues and prophecy: Signs of new-covenant revelation and inclusion; tongues function as revelatory sign (e.g., Isa 28 echo in 1 Cor 14), prophecy as inspired speech; interpretation of tongues is equivalent in function to prophecy.
 - Apostolic foundation and cessation: The apostolate is unique and foundational (Eph 2:20; 2 Cor 12:12; Heb 2:3-4). With the passing of the apostles and completion of the foundation-laying revelatory work, revelatory gifts cease as ordinary gifts.
 - Pastoral implications: Seek the Spirit's fullness and sanctifying presence; evaluate claims of gifts by Scripture's redemptive-historical norms; avoid both rationalistic denial of God's freedom and expectation of apostolic phenomena as ordinary.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Vos and Ridderbos (eschatology, union with Christ), Calvin (Spirit and Word), Warfield (miracle cessation, though Gaffin recasts the case), critiques of Pentecostal/Charismatic subsequence theology and James D. G. Dunn's Spirit-baptism thesis; engagement with Lukan and Pauline corpora.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and canon; union with Christ and ordo/historia salutis; ecclesiology and apostolicity; pneumatology (Spirit-baptism, filling, gifts); eschatology (already/not yet).
- **Closing line:** Pentecost is the once-for-all eschatological gift of the Spirit in Christ to the whole church; the church lives from that fullness under the completed apostolic foundation, not by replicating its epochal signs.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Redemptive-historical reading of Acts** that refuses to flatten transitional events into normative patterns.
 - **Spirit-baptism = union with Christ**, not a second, post-conversion experience.
 - **Apostolicity as foundation**: revelatory gifts serve a once-for-all foundational stratum of the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against Pentecostal/Charismatic **subsequence** and two-stage models.
 - Refines classic cessationism beyond Warfield's apologetic to an **eschatological-canonical** rationale.
 - Disagrees with readings that isolate Luke from Paul; insists on canonical coherence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tight integration of **historia salutis vs ordo salutis** to adjudicate gift claims.
 - Use of **foundation** (Eph 2:20) to locate gifts in salvation history.
 - Distinction between **baptism** (once-for-all, universal) and **filling** (recurrent, for empowerment).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in confessional Reformed seminaries and churches; a key text shaping redemptive-historical cessationism.
 - A frequent dialogue partner for evangelical continuationists and moderates; informs debates on prophecy and tongues.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers an exegetically anchored, theologically integrated account of Pentecost.
 - Provides pastoral clarity on assurance, sanctification, and the ordinary Christian life under the Word and Spirit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pentecost (Acts 2):** Epochal, once-for-all outpouring inaugurating the last days and the church's mission.
- **Spirit-baptism:** The Spirit's eschatological gift bestowed on all believers at conversion; identical with incorporation into Christ (1 Cor 12:13).
- **Filling of the Spirit:** Recurrent empowerments for witness and holiness; distinct from Spirit-baptism.
- **Historia salutis vs ordo salutis:** Salvation-historical events (Christ's work, Pentecost) vs application of redemption to individuals; confusion here breeds subsequence errors.
- **Apostolate:** Unique, eyewitness, Christ-commissioned office; bears signs and revelation; non-repeatable.
- **Foundation (Eph 2:20):** Apostles and prophets as once-for-all base; later ministry builds on, not extends, this foundation.
- **Revelatory gifts:** Prophecy, tongues (and interpretation), related signs that convey or attest new-covenant revelation.
 - **Prophecy:** Inspired, authoritative speech; not merely impressionistic guidance.
 - **Tongues:** Sign of Spirit's eschatological presence and covenantal inclusion; tied to revelation when interpreted.
- **Signs of an apostle (2 Cor 12:12):** Miraculous credentials bound to apostolic ministry.
- **Heb 2:3-4 pattern:** Salvation attested by God through signs during the foundational period.
- **Already/not yet:** Eschatological framework grounding both Pentecost's fullness and the non-repeatability of its epochal markers.
- **Luke-Acts hermeneutic:** Read descriptively and theologically, locating transitional phenomena in redemptive history.
- **Union with Christ:** The locus of every soteriological blessing, including the Spirit's gift.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Pneumatology:** Definitional for Spirit-baptism and the filling distinction.
 - **Eschatology:** Model for already/not yet and Pentecost's epochal status.
 - **Ecclesiology & Bibliology:** Grounding for apostolic foundation, canon, and cessation of revelatory gifts.
 - **Hermeneutics:** Exegetical template for reading Acts in light of redemptive history.
