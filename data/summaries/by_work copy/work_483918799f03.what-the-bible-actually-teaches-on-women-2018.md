### TITLE
What the Bible Actually Teaches on Women (Kevin Giles, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid renewed public debate over gender roles in evangelicalism (post-2000s), especially controversies about **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** of the Son and complementarian arguments using Trinitarian theology.
 - Represents a theologically trained egalitarian intervention that draws heavily on historical Trinitarian theology and biblical exegesis.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible does not teach a permanent, ontological or eternal hierarchy of authority between men and women. Claims for universal male authority in church and home that rest on an alleged eternal subordination in the Trinity are exegetically and theologically unsound.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of relevant biblical texts (Genesis, Pauline household codes, 1 Corinthians, 1 Timothy, Ephesians) to show context-dependent headship and mutuality.
 - Historical-theological analysis of classical Trinitarian teaching to argue that the Son's obedience is **economic** (related to redemption) not an eternal relational subordination that would compromise Nicene orthodoxy.
 - Critique of contemporary complementarian exegesis and use of Trinitarian categories (notably proponents like Wayne Grudem and allies) that infer eternal role-differentiation for gender.
 - Positive proposal: equality of persons (ontological) with differentiated, covenanted responsibilities in marriage (limited headship) but no transference to permanent ecclesial or ontological male authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: modern complementarians who advance EFS (e.g., Wayne Grudem, John Piper and other CBMW-related voices).
 - Historical sources: patristic and classical Trinitarian writers, Nicene formulations, Augustine, and later orthodox Trinitarian consensus.
 - Biblical commentators and recent egalitarian scholarship for exegesis of kephale, household codes.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), biblical hermeneutics and revelation, anthropology (gender), ecclesiology (leadership/eldership), marriage and family, Christology (relations of the Son and Father), and the history of doctrine (subordinationism).

- **Closing line**
 - The book argues that robust Nicene Trinitarianism plus careful exegesis leads to moral and ecclesial conclusions that reject eternal hierarchicalism: equality in being, with any role-differentiation rooted biblically in marriage and mission, not in an eternal divine order of subordination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Marries rigorous historical Trinitarian theology with contemporary gender debates-insists the metaphysical reading of Scripture that posits eternal role-differentiation is a novel innovation.
 - Reframes "headship" debates by containing legitimate notions of marital headship within the covenant of marriage rather than extending them as universal ecclesial mandates.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct corrective to proponents of EFS who appeal to intra-Trinitarian order to justify male authority; Giles contends such readings conflate economic roles with eternal relations.
 - Challenges complementarian exegesis of key Greek terms and household codes, arguing they have been read anachronistically and systematized beyond their biblical warrant.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear distinction emphasized between **economic** (redemptive, temporal) and **immanent** (eternal, ontological) relations in the Trinity as decisive for gender theology.
 - Recasts "head" (kephale) and "headship" arguments toward limited, context-bound senses rather than universal authority structures.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in egalitarian circles as a compact, historically rooted refutation of EFS; stimulated renewed debate with complementarian scholars who published responses or defenses.
 - Influenced subsequent discussions on the legitimacy of using Trinitarian doctrine to ground gender roles; often cited in academic and pastoral contexts addressing EFS.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, historically informed resource for teaching on Trinity and gender; a go-to polemical and exegetical primer for egalitarians contesting the theological bases of modern complementarianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**: The claim that the Son is eternally subordinate in authority to the Father; Giles argues this is theologically problematic and not supported by orthodox Trinitarianism.
- **Economic Trinity**: The roles of Father, Son, Spirit in redemption history; Giles insists the Son's obedience is here, not an index of eternal subordination.
- **Immanent Trinity**: The eternal being/relations of God apart from redemption; crucial to Giles' argument that immanent relations should not be read as gender-role templates.
- **Kephale (head)**: Central contested term; Giles limits "head" as used in Scripture to context-bound senses (source, representative, marital role) rather than universal authority.
- **Household Codes**: Passages in Ephesians, Colossians, 1 Peter, etc.; Giles reads them as culturally situated guidelines, not perpetual prescriptions for church leadership.
- **Ontological equality**: Equality of being between men and women; affirmed by Giles against claims of intrinsic hierarchical ordering.
- **Functional roles**: Distinction between temporary/role-based responsibilities (e.g., marriage leadership) and ontological status.
- **Subordinationism (historical)**: Heretical doctrine of inferiority of Son in being; Giles warns modern EFS risks theological echoes of this error.
- **Hermeneutics (grammatical-historical)**: Method Giles employs to argue for context-sensitive reading over systematic imposition.
- **CBMW / Complementarianism**: Institutional and theological targets of Giles' critique; he addresses their scriptural and theological claims.
- **Patristic tradition**: Used by Giles to show historical resistance to eternal hierarchical readings of intra-Trinitarian relations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **exegetical model** for context-sensitive readings of household codes and kephale.
 - As a **polemic** and historical-theological rebuttal against EFS and complementarian uses of Trinitarian doctrine.
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing economic vs immanent Trinity in gender discussions and for constraining "headship" to marital contexts.
