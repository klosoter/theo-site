### TITLE
Evangelical Theology: A Biblical and Systematic Introduction (Michael F. Bird, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 2013 amid renewed interest in biblical theology within Anglo‑Evangelical seminary circles. Aims to bridge rigorous biblical exegesis and systematic construction for contemporary evangelicalism.
 - Ecumenical and historically informed; engages Reformed, evangelical, and patristic resources while speaking to post‑Enlightenment academic theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelical theology must be both *biblical* (driven by canonical exegesis and biblical theology) and *systematic* (able to articulate coherent doctrine for church and mission). The book argues for doctrines shaped by Scripture, church tradition, and theological coherence rather than by isolated proof‑texts or modern ideology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method and biblical theology - canonical reading, typology, covenantal trajectory.
 - Part II: Systematic loci - God, Trinity, Christology, Spirit, salvation, church, mission, last things, ethics.
 - Methodological moves:
 - Prioritize biblical theology as the raw material for systematic formulation.
 - Use historical theology and contemporary debates to test theological proposals.
 - Emphasize practical ecclesial use and mission as tests of theological health.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary scholars: N. T. Wright on Israel/Paul, recent defenders and critics of Eternal Functional Subordination (e.g., Bruce Ware, Wayne Grudem, Kevin Giles).
 - Draws on classical sources (Athanasius, Augustine), Reformation and Puritan insight, and modern evangelical writers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, covenant, God (attributes), Trinity (economic/ontological relations), Christology, soteriology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, sacraments, eschatology (including Israel and the nations).

- **Site usage (selected)**
 - **Romans 11 and Israel's Future:** Uses Romans 11 to argue for a future role for ethnic Israel within God's covenantal plan - emphasizes corporate election, remnant theology, and a hermeneutic that resists simple replacement theology while affirming church inclusion.
 - **Eternal Functional Subordination debates:** Treats intra‑Trinitarian relations with caution - accepts ordered roles in the economic Trinity but rejects an ontological/eternal subordination of the Son that compromises divine immutability and unity.

- **Closing line**
 - A theologically ecumenical, biblically grounded introduction that insists evangelical doctrine be both faithful to the canon and accountable to historic orthodoxy while remaining responsive to contemporary pastoral and ethical concerns.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of canonical/biblical theology as determinate for systematic claims.
 - Balanced fidelity to the historic creeds while engaging current evangelical controversies.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against simplistic proof‑texting and both weak historicism and rigid fundamentalism.
 - In Trinitarian debates, counters proponents of Eternal Functional Subordination by distinguishing economic ordering from eternal ontological inequality.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a relational/functional language for intra‑Trinitarian relations that preserves ontological equality and denies permanent role‑based subordination in being.
 - Favors "hermeneutic of continuity" regarding Israel and the church - continuity of covenant promises with typological fulfillment in Christ and eschatological restoration for Israel.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical seminaries as a textbook for integrating exegesis and systematic theology.
 - Praised for clarity and ecumenical tone; criticized by some conservatives for perceived concessions on complementarian/EFS-linked arguments and by some progressives for remaining within confessional bounds.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a reliable, readable bridge between biblical scholarship and doctrinal theology; especially useful where doctrine must answer contemporary ecclesial controversies (e.g., Israel and eschatology; Trinitarian order debates).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evangelical theology**
 - Theology shaped by gospel commitment, biblical authority, and ecclesial mission.
- **Biblical theology**
 - Canon‑centered, diachronic reading that traces redemptive history and typology.
- **Systematic theology**
 - Synthesis of biblical data into coherent doctrines across loci.
- **Covenant / covenantal trajectory**
 - God's unfolding promises; continuity of promise with Christic fulfillment and future eschatological consummation.
- **Romans 11 (Israel's future)**
 - Interpreted as affirming corporate election, remnant, and a future national restoration within God's salvific plan - resists outright replacement theology.
- **Trinity: economic vs. ontological**
 - Economic: roles in salvation history (accepted). Ontological: being and equality of persons (insisted upon).
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**
 - Critiqued when used to argue eternal ontological subordination of the Son; Bird maintains relational ordering without ontological inferiority.
- **Intra‑Trinitarian relations**
 - Emphasizes relational terminology that preserves consubstantiality and immutability.
- **Christology / soteriology**
 - High Christology grounded in New Testament; salvation framed covenantally and corporately.
- **Canonical approach**
 - Scripture read as unified witness; theological claims must cohere with canonical trajectory.
- **Hermeneutic of continuity**
 - Reads continuity between Israel and church while allowing typological fulfillment and eschatological distinction.
- **Confessional catholicity**
 - Uses creeds and patristic consensus as checks on novel formulations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical method combining biblical theology and systematic formulation.
 - As a **polemic** against theological moves that separate economic roles from ontological equality (notably EFS arguments).
 - As an **exegetical model** for using Romans 11 in debates over Israel and the church.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in classrooms to move from exegesis to faithful doctrinal construction.
