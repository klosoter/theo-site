### TITLE
**The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism** - edited and contributed to by Gregg Strawbridge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed/evangelical milieu; an edited volume presenting a sustained defense of paedobaptism rooted in covenant theology and engaging modern credobaptist critiques. Aimed at pastors, theologians, and students participating in baptismal debates across Protestant traditions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Baptism is the covenantal sign and seal that initiates covenant membership; on covenantal and biblical grounds, infants of believing parents properly receive baptism. The work addresses the competing claims about baptismal *mode* (immersion vs sprinkling/affusion), the *subject* (infant vs believer), and the *efficacy* (sign only vs means of grace/regeneration).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reconstructs covenant continuity: circumcision in the Old Testament as the analogue of New Testament baptism.
 - Exegetical survey of household baptisms and key texts (e.g., Acts, Pauline household references, Jesus' promise to bring children into the covenant people).
 - Theological framing: baptism as a sign-and-seal within covenant of grace, conferring covenant status, not automatic salvation.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiological implications: baptismal nurture, discipline, and covenantal succession.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Classical Reformed and covenantal authorities (Calvin, Westminster tradition, Kuyper broadly represented).
 - Contemporary paedobaptist defenders and critiques from credobaptist scholars; engages the Baptist challenge concerning regeneration, believer's testimony, and the logic of voluntary church membership.
 - Biblical commentators on household baptisms and sacramental theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (covenant of grace), sacramentology (sign and seal), ecclesiology (membership, covenant households), soteriology (regeneration vs covenant status), Scripture and exegesis, pastoral theology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Baptism, rightly understood as the covenantal sign and seal, admits covenant children into the visible church and obliges the community to nurture them toward covenantal faith - without equating the sign with automatic regeneration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses *covenantal continuity* as the decisive criterion for baptismal subjects rather than primarily on experiential or ecclesiological voluntarism.
 - Distinguishes clearly between *covenant membership* and *salvific regeneration*, avoiding both sacramentalism and reductionist symbolism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on credobaptist claims that baptism requires an antecedent credible profession; argues that household baptism and OT precedent allow infant inclusion.
 - Corrects high-sacramental readings that equate baptism automatically with regeneration, reinforcing pastoral catechesis and the need for faith formation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes discussions in terms of *covenantal initiation* and *covenant succession* rather than mere rite vs. rite debates.
 - Uses "ecclesial incorporation" language to stress membership responsibilities and communal formation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted as a contemporary paedobaptist resource within Reformed seminaries, Presbyterian and continental Reformed contexts.
 - Frequently cited in debates with Baptists as a concise, scriptural-covenantal alternative to credobaptist proofs.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful as a compact curricular book for pastoral theology, sacramental instruction, and denominational identity courses; balances exegetical work with pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of grace:** Framework underpinning continuity between circumcision and baptism; grounds infant inclusion.
- **Sign and seal:** Marks baptism as a visible token and divine confirmation of covenant promises; distinguishes sign from automatic salvation.
- **Covenantal initiation:** Terminology for baptismal entry into visible covenant community.
- **Covenant children / household baptism:** Scriptural category and empirical data point used to argue for infant baptism (Acts households; Pauline contexts).
- **Regeneration vs covenant status:** Key distinction - baptism denotes membership, not assured inward conversion.
- **Credobaptism (believer's baptism):** Primary opposing position engaged and critiqued regarding subjects and ecclesial polity.
- **Baptismal efficacy:** Debates whether baptism is merely declarative or instrumentally efficacious; work favors sign-and-seal with pastoral means-of-grace nuance.
- **Mode (immersion vs affusion):** Treated as secondary to subject and sacramental significance; historical/cultural variation acknowledged.
- **Ecclesial incorporation:** Emphasizes communal obligations (nurture, instruction, discipline) that follow baptism.
- **Covenant succession:** The institutional, familial transmission of faith responsibilities and promises across generations.
- **Household faith evidence:** Use of household baptisms as exegetical support for infant inclusion.
- **Pastoral catechesis:** Practical outworking: baptism obligates catechetical responsibility toward baptized children.
- **Sacramental pastoral theology:** Integrates sacramental doctrine with family and church disciplines.
- **Scriptural exegesis model:** Prioritizes covenantal readings of key New Testament texts.
- How this work is used:
 - As a **definitional source** for contemporary covenantal paedobaptism in classroom and consistory debates.
 - As a **polemic and apologetic resource** against credobaptist arguments about subjects and efficacy.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting household baptisms and covenant continuity texts.
 - As a **practical-pastoral guide** for baptismal practice, catechesis, and covenantal family nurture.
