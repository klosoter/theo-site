### TITLE
Embodied Souls, Ensouled Bodies - Marc Cortez

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed theological conversation on human nature; written in the context of renewed interest in historical theology and analytic philosophy of mind.
 - Responds to late 20th-21st century pressures: scientific materialism, resurgence of Cartesian dualism in some evangelical circles, and increased appeal to hylomorphism among Thomists.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Human persons must be understood as real souls that are essentially embodied - or, alternately, bodies that are genuinely ensouled. Cortez argues for a middle way that preserves both the reality of an immaterial soul and the inseparability of soul and body for personal identity and moral agency.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses two dominant errors: reductive physicalism (denial of genuine immaterial soul) and crude substance dualism (separation of soul from embodied existence).
 - Reconstructs a historically informed anthropology that:
 - reads the biblical data (Hebrew nephesh, Greek psyche, sarx) in their canonical contexts;
 - engages patristic and medieval resources for categories such as form/matter and soul-body composite;
 - brings analytic philosophy of mind to bear on issues of mental causation, personal identity, and constitution.
 - Proposes a conceptual framing (often described by the phrasing "embodied souls, ensouled bodies") that affirms both immaterial aspects and essential embodiment, with implications for resurrection, sin, and sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Biblical authors (esp. Genesis, Psalms, Pauline corpus), key patristic and medieval thinkers on soul/body, Reformers who treated the image of God and human nature.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include physicalists (philosophers of mind), Cartesian dualists, and modern evangelical theologians who favor one pole over the other.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of humanity (anthropology), image of God, sin and culpability (moral agency), Christology (implications for the incarnation), soteriology and sanctification (whole-person redemption), eschatology (resurrection and intermediate state), and Scripture exegesis of terms for soul and body.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The human person is an ontological unity of soul and body such that the soul is real and immaterial yet constitutively embodied; Christian theology must therefore affirm whole-person redemption grounded in both biblical exegesis and philosophical coherence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The titular formulation "embodied souls, ensouled bodies" captures an intentional two-sided corrective: retain language and reality of both soul and body without collapsing one into the other.
 - Strong insistence that biblical terms (nephesh/psyche) do not straightforwardly map onto modern Cartesian categories; theological anthropology must be historically exegetical as well as philosophically informed.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects materialist reductions that read biblical anthropology through contemporary neuroscience alone.
 - Challenges Cartesian or popular evangelical dualisms that treat the soul as a detachable "person-substance" indifferent to bodily constitution.
 - Distinguishes itself from Thomistic hylomorphism by adapting classical form-matter resources while remaining attentive to Reformed commitments and biblical grammar.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates the phrase "ensouled body" as a theological category to highlight the formative role of soul without endorsing atomic separation at death.
 - Emphasizes a relational-functional account of the image of God tied to psychosomatic capacities (agency, moral responsibility, relationality).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Used within Reformed and broader evangelical circles as a measured third-way alternative; cited in discussions on resurrection, pastoral counseling, and Christian engagement with neuroscience.
 - Valued by teachers for its accessibility to both theologians and philosophically informed pastors; less influential in strictly Thomist or secular analytic camps.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a bridge between historical theological resources and contemporary philosophy of mind; durable as a teaching text for whole-person soteriology and biblical anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Embodied souls** - emphasizes that souls exist in and through embodied life; the soul is not a disembodied occupant.
- **Ensouled bodies** - highlights that bodies are genuinely persons because they are animated and given form by a soul.
- **Psychosomatic unity** - the functional and ontological integration of psychological life and bodily constitution.
- **Hylomorphic resources** - use of form/matter vocabulary to account for soul-body composition without full Thomistic systematization.
- **Nephesh / Psyche** - careful exegetical treatment showing polyvalence and resistence to simplistic translation into "soul" as immaterial substance.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - read as embodied capacities (relationality, agency, rationality) rather than purely spiritual attributes.
- **Personal identity & resurrection** - argues that identity across death and resurrection requires both soul continuity and bodily continuity; affirms bodily resurrection as theological necessity.
- **Materialism / physicalism** - critiqued for explanatory insufficiency regarding qualia, moral responsibility, and biblical anthropology.
- **Substance dualism (Cartesian)** - critiqued for treating the soul as detachable in a way that undermines embodied agency and biblical language about death.
- **Intermediate state** - treated theologically with nuance: death involves disembodied consciousness yet not in a way that dissolves essential embodied identity.
- **Mental causation** - addressed to show how immaterial soul and bodily brain interact without resorting to epiphenomenalism.
- **Soteriological implications** - whole-person redemption requires both sanctification of capacities (soul) and restoration of embodied existence.
- **Exegetical method** - combines lexical, canonical, and theological reading; resists anachronistic philosophical imposition.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a balanced, biblically rooted dual-aspect anthropology in courses and lectures.
- As a **polemic** against reductionist physicalism and crude Cartesianism within evangelical debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical anthropology terms without modern category imposition.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic discussions on incarnation, atonement, and resurrection emphasizing whole-person redemption.
