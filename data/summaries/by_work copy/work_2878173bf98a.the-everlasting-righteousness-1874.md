### TITLE
The Everlasting Righteousness (1874) - Andrew A. Bonar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published 1874 in the late Victorian evangelical-Scottish Presbyterian milieu. Bonar (1810-1892) wrote as a pastor-theologian within the evangelical Reformed tradition, addressing post-Enlightenment challenges to classic Protestant accounts of justification and the person/work of Christ.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Christ's obedience - both **active** (perfect law-keeping) and **passive** (suffering and atoning death) - constitutes an "everlasting righteousness" which is the sole ground of believers' justification by imputation rather than infusion.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Exegetical foundation: expounds Pauline and Johannine texts (e.g., Romans, 2 Corinthians, Philippians) to show Christ's righteousness is accounted to believers. 
 - Doctrinal distinction: rigorously separates **forensic imputation** from sanctification and from any notion of infused merit. 
 - Federal-historical argument: locates Christ as federal head/surety whose active obedience fulfills the law and passive obedience satisfies divine justice. 
 - Pastoral application: shows how assurance, prayer, and holiness flow from union with Christ and reliance on the imputed righteousness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Draws on Reformed classics (Calvin, Westminster Confession), 17th-18th-century scholastic and Puritan articulations of imputation. 
 - Implicitly counters Roman Catholic doctrines of infused righteousness and contemporary liberal or moral-government accounts that downplay Christ's active obedience.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Christology (person and work of Christ), Atonement, Justification (forensic imputation), Covenant theology (federal headship; covenant of works/grace), Sanctification (distinct but fruit of justification), Assurance.
- **Closing line:** 
 Bonar insists that genuine justification is grounded in Christ's united and completed obedience - both active and passive - which is imputed to believers as an everlasting righteousness that secures pardon, acceptance, and assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Persistent stress on the **everlasting** quality of the righteousness - not temporary merit but a permanent ground for believers' standing before God. 
 - Pastoral integration: doctrinal precision is tied to devotional assurance; theological categories are applied to prayer, comfort, and Christian living.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Corrects Roman Catholic infusion language: opposes any notion that righteousness is made intrinsic to the sinner as the ground of acceptance. 
 - Counters theories that limit Christ's saving work to penal suffering alone by affirming the necessity of Christ's active law‑keeping as meritorious for believers.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Amplifies the language of **everlasting righteousness** as a consolidating phrase for imputed active + passive obedience - a concise slogan that aided later discussions in Reformed circles.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely read in evangelical and Reformed pastoral contexts in Britain and America; served as a clarifying popular-theological treatment rather than a scholastic systematic milestone. 
 - Influenced preachers and catechetical teaching on justification; referenced in later defenses of the doctrine of imputed active obedience.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Valuable for students needing a compact, pastoral exposition of why both active and passive obedience matter for justification; useful in polemical contexts against infusing or moral‑government accounts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Everlasting Righteousness** - Bonar's shorthand for the perfect, durable righteousness of Christ accounted to believers.
- **Active Obedience** - Christ's sustained obedience to the law (fulfilment of God's commands) whose merit is imputed to the believer.
- **Passive Obedience** - Christ's suffering and vicarious death that satisfies God's justice; complementary to active obedience.
- **Imputation** - The forensic accounting by which Christ's righteousness and sinners' sin are respectively credited/declared.
- **Forensic Justification** - Legal declaration of righteousness before God based on Christ's merits, distinct from inner sanctification.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological/relational bond that makes imputation effective; Bonar links assurance and holiness to this union.
- **Federal Headship / Suretyship** - Christ as covenant representative who acts on behalf of his people in both obedience and suffering.
- **Infused vs. Imputed Righteousness** - Contrast Bonar stresses: Roman Catholic (infusion) vs. Reformed forensic imputation.
- **Covenant of Works & Covenant of Grace** - Framework for explaining why Christ's obedience fulfills the law and secures grace for believers.
- **Merits of Christ** - Both active and passive works that constitute the treasury from which righteousness is applied.
- **Justification vs Sanctification** - Bonar maintains a clear distinction: justification is forensic and foundational; sanctification is progressive fruit.
- **Assurance** - The believer's confident reliance on Christ's imputed righteousness; Bonar ties assurance to objective grounds rather than subjective feelings.
- **Redemption** - Encompasses the whole price paid (passive) and obedience rendered (active) to secure salvation.
- **Surety** - Term used for Christ's representative role in assuming obligations and discharging penalties for sinners.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for the doctrine that both active and passive obedience of Christ are imputed to believers. 
- As a **polemic tool** against Roman Catholic infusion theology and against views minimizing Christ's active obedience. 
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** demonstrating how scriptural exegesis informs homiletic assurance and catechesis.
