### TITLE
**The Mystical Presence: A Vindication of the Reformed or Calvinistic Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist** - John Williamson Nevin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century (first published 1846; expanded later) within the American German Reformed "Mercersburg" milieu.
 - Reaction to prevailing American Protestant sacramental minimalism and to both Roman Catholic and Lutheran formulations; influenced by German theological retrieval and patristic emphasis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Eucharist is an **objective, real, spiritual presence** of Christ - a mystical participation by which communicants truly partake in Christ through the sacrament - rather than a mere memorial or a physical local presence.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: dominant Protestant views reduce the sacrament to a sign or a subjective benefit; Romanism makes it a physical corporeal presence.
 - Theological principle: the **incarnation** and the believer's **covenantal union** with Christ ground an objective sacramental presence that is spiritual, not carnal.
 - Mechanism: the Holy Spirit effects a real communion with Christ in the elements - a participation (koinonia) grounded in Christ's person and the objective covenant of grace.
 - Practical and ecclesial implications: Eucharist as means of grace, corporate and objective rather than solely individualistic.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Zwingli (memorialism), Luther (real corporeal presence), Calvin (spiritual real presence), Roman Catholic transubstantiation, and contemporary American Presbyterian and revivalist tendencies.
 - Draws on Calvin's sacramental theology, patristic writers (notably Augustine), and German theological resources (Schleiermacherian and post-Schleiermacherian currents mediated through Mercersburg circle).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation and personal union), Pneumatology (Spirit as agent of sacramental appropriation), Covenant theology, Sacramentology (means of grace, sign/thing signified), Ecclesiology (corporate communion), soteriology implicit in participation.
- **Closing line**
 - Nevin centers the Eucharist as an **objective, Spirit-mediated participation in the incarnate Christ rooted in covenantal union** - the "mystical presence" that preserves reality without resorting to corporealism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasis on **incarnation as the paradigmatic principle** for understanding sacramental presence: because Christ is truly human and personally united to the divine, he can be really present sacramentally without spatial transfer.
 - Presents the Eucharist as an **organic, objective means of grace** - not merely symbolic nor merely subjective.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Zwinglian memorialism by insisting on objective efficacy and real participation.
 - Rejects Lutheran corporeal ubiquity and Roman transubstantiation by locating presence in **mystical/spiritual union** rather than physical transfer or local omnipresence.
 - Critiques pietistic subjectivism that reduces sacraments to mere signs for personal devotion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"mystical presence"** as a middle path terminology: real but spiritual, objective yet non-corporeal.
 - Use of **covenantal-incarnational logic** to ground sacramental ontology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked controversy among American Presbyterians and evangelicals; accused by some of "papism" or undue sacramentalism.
 - Influential for later Reformed sacramental renewal, ecumenical conversations on real presence, and the Mercersburg School's sacramental and liturgical emphases.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable Reformed alternative to both memorialism and transubstantiation; valuable for teaching sacramental theology, ecclesiology, and Reformed identity in liturgical debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mystical Presence** - Nevin's key term: real, spiritual communion with Christ in the Eucharist; objective without corporeality.
- **Real Presence (spiritual)** - distinction from corporal/physical presence; presence effected by Spirit and union, not by Christ's local corporeal ubiquity.
- **Incarnation principle** - the incarnation provides the ontological basis for sacramental participation.
- **Covenantal union** - the believer's standing in the covenant as the ground for sacramental incorporation into Christ.
- **Means of grace** - sacraments as objective instruments through which the Spirit communicates Christ and saving benefits.
- **Sign and thing signified** - insistence that the sign truly corresponds to and participates in the reality signified.
- **Participation / koinonia** - relational language for how communicants partake of Christ's life through the sacrament.
- **Organic union** - Nevin's language for the living, personal union that makes sacramental communion possible.
- **Objective efficacy** - sacramental effect is not merely subjective but anchored in Christ's person and covenant.
- **Memorialism** - the view Nevin critiques that reduces the Lord's Supper to remembrance only.
- **Transubstantiation / corporealism** - positions Nevin rejects as attributing physical transformation or ubiquitous corporeal presence.
- **Ecclesial sacramentality** - Eucharist as corporate, church-centered act, not merely private piety.
- **Pneumatological mediation** - Spirit as the agent by which the sacrament effects union with Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed/spiritual real presence and for articulating sacramental ontology distinct from memorialism and transubstantiation.
- As a **polemic** against reductive Protestant sacramentology and against approaches that sever sacraments from ecclesial and incarnational ground.
- As an **exegetical and theological model** for reading communion texts (1 Cor 10-11; Gospel "eating" language) through covenantal and incarnational categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in historical and ecumenical studies to locate a middle Reformed position between Roman and Lutheran extremes.
