### TITLE
**Israel's Law and the Church's Faith: Paul and His Recent Interpreters** - Stephen Westerholm

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century response (first ed. 1988) to the emergence of the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**. Westerholm writes as a critical interlocutor from a broadly Reformed/evangelical scholarly milieu, engaging renewed scholarship on Second Temple Judaism (Sanders, Dunn, Wright).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's doctrine of **justification** must be understood as fundamentally **forensic/imputative** (declarative acquittal on the basis of Christ's righteousness), not reducible to mere covenantal or boundary-marker language as some NPP proponents contend.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Careful exegetical re-reading of Pauline texts (especially Galatians and Romans) to show:
 - Paul's vocabulary and argumentative moves presuppose a forensic legal paradigm (judgment, acquittal, condemnation, reckoning).
 - NPP insights about first-century Judaism (covenantal nomism) contribute context but cannot displace Paul's soteriological categories.
 - "Works of the law" cannot be identified solely with ethnic boundary markers; they also include claims to meritorious standing before God.
 - A corrective that retains NPP's sociological acuity yet defends the classical Protestant understanding of imputation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Main interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright.
 - Reformation and patristic exemplars invoked indirectly to clarify forensic traditions.
 - Uses Second Temple Jewish studies to concede context while resisting programmatic revisionism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Justification** (central), **covenant**, Pauline **soteriology**, doctrine of **righteousness**, some implications for ecclesiology (Jew/Gentile relation) and eschatology (judgment language).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Westerholm insists Paul speaks primarily in forensic categories: God declares the sinner righteous on account of Christ's imputed righteousness, and this truth best secures the gospel's theological and pastoral meaning.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Firm recuperation of **forensic imputation** as Pauline and theologically indispensable; refuses a wholesale collapse of justification into sociological covenant membership.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Affirms NPP's corrective about Judaism's non-legalism but counters its tendency to neutralize forensic language and to read "works of the law" exclusively as ethnic boundary markers.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens distinctions between **participationist** readings (Christological participation language) and **forensic** readings (declarative acquittal); insists both must be held in tension rather than conflated.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among Reformed and evangelical scholars as a measured, textually rigorous counterbalance to NPP. Influential in subsequent debates over justification, often paired with works defending classic Reformation categories.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models disciplined exegetical engagement with contemporary historical scholarship while protecting doctrinal commitments; a go-to resource for courses on Pauline theology, justification, and NPP critique.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - For Westerholm: primarily a forensic declaration of righteousness, not merely covenantal inclusion.
- **Forensic / forensic imputation**
 - Legal language of declaration and acquittal; Christ's righteousness is **imputed** to believers.
- **Imputation**
 - The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; central to Westerholm's defense of traditional soteriology.
- **Works of the law**
 - Not reducible to ethnic boundary markers alone; includes claims to merit that Paul opposes.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - The scholarly movement Westerholm critiques; he acknowledges its corrective on Judaism but disputes its reinterpretation of Pauline soteriology.
- **Covenant / covenantal nomism**
 - Contextual frame from Second Temple studies; Westerholm uses it to nuance, not to replace, Pauline forensic claims.
- **Righteousness of God**
 - In Paul: God's covenantal and judicial righteousness that becomes the basis for justification by faith.
- **Participation / participationist language**
 - "In Christ" language; Westerholm allows its importance but resists making it the exclusive or primary category to the exclusion of forensic terms.
- **Boundary markers**
 - Ethnic practices (circumcision, food laws) emphasized by some NPP writers; Westerholm argues these are part of the issue but not the whole.
- **Eschatological judgment**
 - Paul's judgment language supports a legal framework for justification and condemnation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the forensic-imputation model of justification in advanced courses.
- As a **polemic** against NPP readings that downplay legal language in Paul.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how to synthesize historical Judaism studies with canonical Pauline exegesis.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates seeking to hold together participationist and forensic elements in Pauline theology.
