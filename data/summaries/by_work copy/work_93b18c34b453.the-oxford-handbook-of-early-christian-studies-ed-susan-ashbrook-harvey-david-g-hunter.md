### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Studies (ed. Susan Ashbrook Harvey & David G. Hunter) - notes on Cyprian of Carthage: ecclesiology centered on the "One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church"

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Cyprian of Carthage, mid-3rd century (ca. 200-258 CE); North African episcopal milieu during persecution, lapsi controversies, and disputes over schism and sacramental validity.
 - The material summarized here is synthesized from the relevant treatments in The Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Studies (ed. Harvey & Hunter), which situates Cyprian within broader Roman/Carolingian and North African debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Cyprian's ecclesiology: the Church is one visible, apostolic, and holy body whose unity and salvation depend on full communion under rightful episcopal authority; schismatics and separatists stand outside this saving communion.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - The Church is a single, concrete organism (corpus) instituted by Christ; unity is not merely spiritual but juridical and visible.
 - The bishop functions as the local point of unity and the guardian of discipline - communion with the bishop = communion with the Church.
 - Sacramental efficacy and the possibility of reconciliation hinge on the Church's visible structures and the bishop's ministry; therefore, questions of rebaptism, penance, and reception of the lapsed are resolved by episcopal judgment.
 - Schism is a greater danger than lapse: schism breaks the body and forfeits the sacramental economy unless repentance and readmission are enacted under episcopal authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Novatianists (rigorists), Roman bishops (notably Stephen), various heretical or schismatic groups; Cyprian's own letters and treatises (De Unitate, De Lapsis, letters) are primary sources.
 - Scriptural arguments used to ground ecclesial unity (e.g., Christ's prayer for unity) and patristic/ritual precedents.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (unity, catholicity, apostolicity), episcopacy and ministry, sacramental theology (baptism, penance), theodicy of persecution, authority and jurisdiction, soteriology as corporate.
- **Closing line**
 - Cyprian's theological center of gravity: the Church is a visible, juridical organism - "one" and saving only in concrete communion under the bishop - so unity and episcopal discipline are constitutive of communion and of access to salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the visible, juridical nature of unity: unity is not merely spiritual agreement but concrete communion with a bishop and community.
 - The episcopal locus as guarantee of apostolicity and sacramental order: bishops embody the Church's unity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against Novatianist rigorism: Cyprian rejects absolute exclusion of lapsed penitents, advocating measured episcopal penance and restoration.
 - Against Roman claims (e.g., Stephen of Rome) on independent sacramental validity: Cyprian asserts that sacraments outside rightful communion lack normative standing and often efficacy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Vivid use of corpus Christi and unitas ecclesiae to argue for institutional unity as salvific; articulation of communion with bishop as the test of ecclesial membership.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in later Catholic medieval ecclesiology and canonical tradition as a precedent for episcopal authority and visible unity.
 - Ambivalently used in Reformed and Protestant traditions: admired for corporate emphasis but critiqued for juridical/papal implications; leveraged in debates about visible vs. invisible church.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a paradigmatic early model linking sacramental theology, discipline, and visible unity; indispensable for studies of the development of ecclesiology, penance, and early church order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One (unitas)** - unity as visible, corporate, and juridical, not merely mystical agreement.
- **Holy** - the Church's sanctifying vocation tied to discipline and sacramental life.
- **Catholic** - universality expressed through correct communion and apostolic continuity.
- **Apostolic** - legitimacy grounded in succession and episcopal transmission.
- **Bishop (episkopos)** - focal point of local unity, disciplinarian, and minister of mercy; communion with bishop = communion with Church.
- **Presbyter/collegiality** - presbyters as collaborators under episcopal oversight; tension between collegial practice and episcopal primacy.
- **Schism/Novatianism** - rupture in communion that places actors outside the Church's saving body; Cyprian opposes schism while resisting absolute severity.
- **Lapsed (lapsi)** - those who denied faith under persecution; subject to episcopal penance and restoration.
- **Penance (poenitentia)** - ecclesially ordered process administered by bishops; restores communion when sincere.
- **Baptism/rebaptism** - contested validity outside communion; Cyprian leans toward rebaptism or non-recognition when baptism occurs outside apostolic order.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - conditioned by communion and legitimacy of ministerial order.
- **Extra ecclesiam nulla salus** - early formulation in Cyprianian rhetoric: salvation is bound up with visible Church membership.
- **Corpus Christi** - the Church framed as Christ's body, whose unity is threatened by schism.
- **Communion (communio)** - the practical marker of ecclesial belonging; broken by schism, restored by episcopal acts.
- **Jurisdiction** - the decisive criterion for resolving disputes of membership and sacrament.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for visible, hierarchical ecclesiology and the nexus of unity and sacrament.
 - As polemic ammunition in debates over schism, penance, and rebaptism (both historically and in systematic theology).
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model for disciplining communities and organizing ministry around episcopal authority.
