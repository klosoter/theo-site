### TITLE
Given for You: Reclaiming Calvin's Doctrine of the Lord's Supper - Keith A. Mathison

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed apologetic and sacramental renewal (21st century). Reaction against popular memorialist readings of Calvin and against over-simplified Lutheran/Reformed binaries in sacramental theology.
 - Engages historical theology with pastoral concern for Reformed worship and catechesis.

- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin did not teach a mere memorialism nor a physical corporeal presence, but a robust *real spiritual presence*: Christ is truly present in the Supper by the Holy Spirit to believers, and the sacrament objectively conveys saving benefits when received in faith.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical rehabilitation: close reading of Calvin's Institutes, commentaries, and sermons to show consistency in sacramental doctrine.
 - Doctrinal clarification: distinguishes Calvinian presence from Roman transubstantiation and Lutheran corporeal presence, articulating a distinct pneumatological mechanism for efficacy.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: defends the Lord's Supper as a means of grace, an objective sign that nourishes union with Christ and strengthens faith.
 - Polemical moves: critiques modern Reformed writers who reduce Calvin to Zwinglian memorialism; rebuts claims that "spiritual presence" is equivocal or merely metaphorical.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, Commentaries, Sermons).
 - Historical interlocutors: Ulrich Zwingli, Martin Luther, Roman Catholic scholastic positions.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: modern Reformed scholars and pastors who either minimize sacramental efficacy or conflate Calvin with Zwingli.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology (nature, sign and thing signified, efficacy)
 - Christology (presence of the risen Christ)
 - Pneumatology (Holy Spirit as instrumental mediator)
 - Union with Christ and justification as related to sacramental reception
 - Ecclesiology and worship (Lord's Supper as covenant meal)

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - Calvin presents the Supper as an objective means by which the Spirit truly unites believers to the risen Christ; the sacrament is therefore a real, spiritual encounter that nourishes faith rather than a mere memorial or physical transference.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reclaims the term "real presence" in a carefully qualified Calvinian sense: a non-corporeal, pneumatological reality that is nonetheless objective and efficacious.
 - Stresses the sacrament as an "instrumental means" of grace - God uses the elements and words by the Spirit to effect spiritual feeding.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects the common historiographical error that equates Calvin with Zwingli; demonstrates meaningful differences in sacramental ontology and soteriology.
 - Distinguishes Calvinian presence from Lutheran sacramental union (no physical ubiquity of Christ) and from Roman transubstantiation (no change of substance), while affirming true participation through the Spirit.

- **Conceptual or terminological clarifications**
 - Prefers "spiritual presence" or "pneumatic presence" and emphasizes objective efficacy over subjective symbolism.
 - Clarifies "sign and thing signified" as not merely indicative but instrumentally causative in the economy of salvation when received in faith.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars seeking a robust sacramental theology without Roman or Lutheran categories.
 - Used in denominational training and catechetical materials to recover sacramental piety in Reformed churches.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, source-based corrective to reductive readings of Calvin and strengthens pastoral catechesis about the Supper.
 - Serves as a bridge between historical theology and liturgical practice in Reformed contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Real presence (Calvinian sense)**: Christ truly present in the Supper, but spiritually by the Spirit, not corporeally in the bread and wine.
- **Spiritual / pneumatic presence**: The Holy Spirit mediates Christ's presence, making the sacrament effective to believers.
- **Objective efficacy**: Sacraments are means by which God objectively communicates grace, not merely symbols dependent solely on the recipient's faith.
- **Sign and thing signified**: The sacrament functions instrumentally; the sign (elements/word) truly conveys the reality it signifies when received in faith.
- **Union with Christ**: The sacrament nourishes and visibly represents the believer's real union with Christ; eating and drinking denotes participation in his benefits.
- **Memorialism**: The view Mathison disputes as inadequate for Calvin; he argues Calvin rejected a purely commemorative reading.
- **Transubstantiation / corporeal presence**: Rejected by Calvin and by Mathison for Calvin as metaphysical descriptions; these remain contrasted benchmarks.
- **Instrumental causality**: God uses created means (elements, words) via the Spirit to effect salvation realities in the sacrament.
- **Communion as covenant meal**: Emphasizes communal, covenantal dimensions - covenant signs that confirm promises to believers.
- **Reception by faith**: Faith is necessary for sacramental benefit; presence is real for the faithful, effectually applied by the Spirit.
- **Eucharistic piety**: Practical implication-promotes reverence, expectation of grace, and doctrinal catechesis.

How this work is used:
- As a concise historical-theological source for a Calvinian model of the Lord's Supper.
- As a polemic and corrective against memorialist or equivocating readings of Calvin within Reformed circles.
- As an exegetical-model exemplar for reading Reformers on sacramentology and for shaping Reformed worship and catechesis.
