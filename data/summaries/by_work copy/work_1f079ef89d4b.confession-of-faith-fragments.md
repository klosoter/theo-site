### TITLE
Confession of Faith (fragments) - Pelagius (early 5th century, attributed fragments)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in the late 4th / early 5th century within British/Continental monastic and ascetic milieus. Emerged amid controversies over sin, grace, and pastoral practice that provoked Augustine, Jerome, and synodal responses (notably African councils ca. 418).
 - Historically associated with the cluster of writings that later critics labeled "Pelagian" and with disciples (Caelestius, Julian) who systematized aspects of Pelagius' thought.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human beings are created good and retain moral capacity after Adam; Adam's transgression brings death and a corrupting example but not the imputation of guilt to his descendants. Salvation requires moral effort aided by God's revelation and help, not metaphysical incapacitation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of God's righteousness and goodness as incompatible with imputing Adam's guilt to innocents.
 - Defense of robust human freedom and moral responsibility: grace assists but does not irresistibly determine moral acts.
 - Account of sin: sin as personal choice and wrong action, not ontological hereditary guilt; baptism cleanses personal sin and initiates moral formation.
 - Pastoral emphasis: exhortation to discipline, scripture study, and imitation of Christ as means of moral transformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Principal interlocutors: Augustine (primary theological adversary), Caelestius and Julian (associates/explicators), and African bishops who condemned the movement.
 - Uses Scripture (Genesis, Pauline texts on Adam and baptism) and common patristic categories while disputing prevailing Augustinian readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (created good, moral capacity), sin (personal vs. inherited), grace (assisting, illuminating, non-irresistible), free will, baptism (removal of actual sin), lesser treatment of Trinity and Christology in ethical context.
- **Closing line**
 - The fragments crystallize a theological center of gravity: an anthropology of moral agency where grace is divine help and truth, and human responsibility remains decisive - a corrective to any doctrine that makes human will ontologically passive.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, explicit affirmation of the intrinsic goodness and *operative* moral ability of the unfallen and fallen human will.
 - Pastoral-ascetic stress: transformation through discipline, imitation, and instruction rather than an ontological remedy of a corrupted nature.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct corrective to Augustinian claims of inherited guilt and total inability: Pelagius rejects imputation of Adam's guilt and the necessity of an ontologically renewing grace to make moral acts possible.
 - Differs from Semi-Pelagianism by being less conciliatory toward doctrines that posit any innate depravity; yet later interpreters sometimes label Pelagius and Semi-Pelagians along a continuum.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on "moral ability" (the will's competence) as the pivotal category, and on grace as "revelation and aid" rather than intrinsic ontological renovation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Officially condemned by several councils; Augustine's refutations dominated Western theology and canon law. Pelagian fragments nonetheless shaped later debates by forcing precision on doctrines of sin, freedom, and grace.
 - In Reformed theology the Confession functions as a negative foil; historically it prompted tighter formulations of original sin and prevenient/irresistible grace.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for re-examining the balance between divine aid and human responsibility; valuable for pastoral theology (temptation, formation, ethics) and for teaching the contours of antithetical positions in soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin** - Pelagius treats Adam's sin as a historical precedent producing death and a bad example, not as transmitted guilt or corrupted nature.
- **Imputation (of Adam's guilt)** - Explicitly rejected: guilt cannot be justly ascribed to those who did not personally transgress.
- **Free will / moral ability** - Central positive category: humans retain the capacity to choose rightly; moral failure is voluntary.
- **Grace (Pelagian sense)** - God's revelation, instruction, and external help that enables moral choice; not a metaphysical healing of nature.
 - Contrasts with Augustinian "preventive" and "irresistible" grace models.
- **Prevenient grace** - Not articulated in Pelagius as later defined; Pelagius speaks of timely assistance but insists on human cooperation.
- **Concupiscence / inclination to sin** - For Pelagius, a consequence of example and habit rather than inherited corruption; the will remains agentive.
- **Baptism** - Cleanses personal/actual sins and initiates moral formation, not a remedy for transmitted guilt.
- **Imitation of Christ / ascetic discipline** - Means of moral transformation emphasized repeatedly.
- **Sin as personal action** - Ethical, volitional focus: sin is committed, not inherited metaphysically.
- **Merit & responsibility** - Humans can merit reward through cooperative moral action; responsibility is retained.
- **Example / contagion (moral influence)** - Pelagius explains social transmission of vice by imitation, not by ontological transmission.
- **Human nature (created good)** - Affirmed as substantially intact after Adam, capable of righteousness by cooperation with divine instruction.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for the label "Pelagianism" and for mapping its core claims about original sin and human ability.
- As a **polemic touchstone** for Augustinian/ Reformed treatments of imputation and prevenient/irresistible grace.
- As an **exegetical model** in debates over Genesis and Pauline texts (esp. Romans 5; baptismal theology).
