### TITLE
Evil and the Cross: Christian Thought and the Problem of Evil - Henri Blocher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical Reformed milieu; published amid renewed interest in theodicy after WWII and in conversation with Barthian, Moltmannian, and analytic treatments of evil. Blocher writes as a biblical theologian/systems theologian addressing both academic and pastoral audiences.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The classic philosophical theodicy (vindicating God's justice) is inadequate; the decisive Christian response to evil must be Christological - the cross is the revelatory and redemptive answer to guilt, pollution, and death.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnoses the problem of evil not only as intellectual (how to reconcile God with evil) but existential (what evil does to humans: guilt, pollution, death).
 - Reviews historical answers (Augustinian free-will defenses, Irenaean soul-making, modern philosophical concessions) and finds them partial.
 - Re-centers the debate on the cross: God takes responsibility, suffers with creatures, and defeats evil through Christ's substitutionary engagement.
 - Moves from biblical exegesis of Sin's effects to systematic implications for atonement, providence, and the doctrine of God.
 - Concludes with pastoral and eschatological implications: the cross anticipates the restoration of communion and the ultimate overcoming of death.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Irenaeus, Anselm, Calvin, Barth, Moltmann, contemporary analytic theodicists and evangelical apologists; extensive biblical exegesis (OT sacrificial imagery, Pauline soteriology).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (central), atonement theory (penal and participatory elements), sin and anthropology (original sin, guilt, pollution, death), providence, revelation (cross as hermeneutical center), eschatology; implicit Trinitarian implications (God's inner life in suffering and reconciliation).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The cross is not merely an event to be explained by theodicy; it is the decisive disclosure of God's stance toward evil - God participates in human suffering, bears guilt and death, and thereby defeats evil and restores communion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats the problem of evil primarily through categories of **guilt, pollution, and death** - locating Christ's work as the remedy for relational and existential corruption rather than only metaphysical disorder.
 - Prioritizes a **theology of the cross** over apologetic theodicy; sees the cross as explanatory and normative for understanding God and evil.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Critiques purely intellectual theodicies (vindicatory projects) for ignoring God's suffering and solidarity; challenges overly optimistic soul-making accounts for underestimating culpability.
 - Reconciles elements of **penal substitution** with Christus Victor and participatory motifs rather than insisting on one model to the exclusion of others.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rearticulates atonement language to foreground existential consequences of sin (pollution) and God's remedial action as communal cleansing and life-restoration.
 - Uses a pastoral-exegetical method that integrates historical theology with contemporary philosophical concerns.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed teaching as a balanced corrective to purely philosophical theodicies; appreciated for biblical depth and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Criticized by some for insufficient engagement with metaphysical justifications and by others for not choosing a single atonement model decisively.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a clarifying Christocentric framework for addressing evil that is both theologically rich and pastorally usable; valuable in courses on theodicy, atonement, and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evil (problem of evil):** Recast as relational and existential damage (guilt, pollution, death) rather than only philosophical incompatibility with divine goodness.
- **Theodicy vs. Theology of the Cross:** Distinguishes vindicatory projects from the cross-centered disclosure of God's response to evil.
- **Guilt:** Moral culpability before God; one of the three existential effects of sin that Christ addresses by substitution.
- **Pollution:** Ritual/relational defilement - communal and existential contamination that requires cleansing, not merely acquittal.
- **Death:** Both physical and spiritual separation from God; the cross inaugurates defeat of death in Christ's resurrection.
- **Atonement / Substitutionary atonement:** Retains penal imagery but situates substitution within a broader frame of God's solidarity and victory over evil.
 - Subsumes **penal** and **participatory/Christus Victor** motifs rather than forcing exclusive categorization.
- **Solidarity of God / Suffering God:** God suffers with humanity; divine participation is a corrective to impassible models that distance God from evil.
- **Providence:** Read through the lens of the cross - God's governance is not indifferent but redemptive and participatory.
- **Original sin / anthropology:** Human beings bear guilt and pollution that distort relational life; diagnosis precedes remedy in Christ.
- **Revelation (cross as hermeneutical center):** The cross interprets both Scripture and God's actions in history.
- **Communion / Reconciliation:** The goal of God's action; restoration of right relationship rather than primarily metaphysical restoration.
- **Escha­tology:** The final defeat of death and full cleansing of pollution realize the cross's promise.
- **Use across loci:**
 - Serves as a **definition source** for framing the problem of evil in pastoral and theological curricula (guilt, pollution, death).
 - Functions as a **polemic** against purely philosophical theodicies and impassible depictions of God.
 - Operates as an **exegetical-model** for reading atonement texts Christocentrically and for integrating soteriology with theodicy.
