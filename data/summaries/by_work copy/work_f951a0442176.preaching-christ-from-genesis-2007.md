### TITLE
Preaching Christ from Genesis (2007) - Sidney Greidanus. 
Concise, pastorally oriented treatment of how Genesis narratives and promises point forward to and are fulfilled in Christ; practical sermon models grounded in redemptive-historical hermeneutics.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed homiletical renewal emphasizing expository, redemptive-historical preaching. Greidanus builds on his earlier landmark Preaching Christ from the Old Testament (1999) and addresses pastors/sermon-writers seeking systematic help with Genesis.
- **Central thesis:** Genesis must be preached Christocentrically by showing how its original, historical meaning advances God's redemptive promise culminating in Christ; legitimate typology and promise-fulfillment reading must be disciplined by careful exegesis and canonical theology.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Defend the legitimacy and necessity of preaching Christ from Genesis against allegorizing and reductionist methods.
 - Set hermeneutical rules: establish original meaning (authorial intent, literary and historical context), trace redemptive-historical significance (promise development, typology), demonstrate fulfillment in Christ (NT witness), apply pastorally.
 - Work through major Genesis units (creation, fall, flood, patriarchal narratives, Joseph) as case studies, showing patterns: seed, covenant, exile/return, righteous sufferer, sovereign providence.
 - Provide sermon skeletons, exegetical pointers, and homiletical illustrations for each motif.
- **Figures / interlocutors:** Engages broadly with evangelical homileticians and redemptive-historical proponents; implicitly contrasts with allegorical patristic reading, moralistic New Homiletic, and some liberal biblical criticism that detaches OT from Christological reading.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (progressive, canonical), covenant theology (promise as hermeneutical key), typology and Christology (seed, new Adam, antitype), providence, sin and atonement in typological anticipation, pastoral theology of proclamation.
- **Site usage:** 1 references spanning 1 distinct topics. Topics cited here: Christ In Ot And Nt.
- **Closing line:** Greidanus locates the theological center of Genesis in the unfolding promise of God whose telos is Christ-preaching must move from text to promise to fulfillment in Christ with disciplined exegesis and pastoral application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Redemptive-historical and promise-fulfillment focus:** Emphasizes the promise (seed/covenant) as the linchpin that links Genesis narratives to Christ rather than loose typology or moralizing lessons.
- **Methodological clarity for preaching:** Offers a reproducible three-move hermeneutic (original meaning -> redemptive-historical significance -> Christological fulfillment and application) with worked examples from Genesis.
- **Pastoral, sermon-ready orientation:** Not merely academic; supplies sermon outlines, illustrations, and cautions against common homiletical abuses.
- **Correctives / contrasts:**
 - Pushes back on allegorical/moralizing approaches that ignore historical meaning.
 - Protests against a merely "historical-critical" reading that severs canonical and Christological horizons.
 - Distinguishes disciplined typology from speculative allegory.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Tightens the language of "promise-fulfillment" as the normative interpretive principle for OT-to-NT preaching of Genesis.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely adopted in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries and pulpits as a practical model for OT Christocentric preaching; influential for pastors seeking canonical, Christ-centered exegesis. Critiques arise from scholars warning of potential under-attention to Second Temple Jewish readings and to Israel's own canonical coherence apart from Christ.
- **Enduring value:** Durable bridge between careful exegesis and Christ-centered proclamation; a go-to manual for pastors preaching Genesis within covenantal and canonical frameworks.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-historical:** Reading Scripture as the single unfolding history of God's redeeming acts culminating in Christ.
- **Promise-fulfillment hermeneutic:** The interpretive key-identify divine promises in Genesis and trace their fulfillment in Christ.
- **Original meaning:** The emended authorial/historical-linguistic sense required before typological moves; Greidanus insists on establishing this first.
- **Typology:** Legitimate patterning of persons/events (types) that find their antitype in Christ; disciplined against allegory.
- **Seed (zera):** Central Genesis motif (offspring/seed) that Greidanus reads as messianic promise fulfilled in Christ.
- **Covenant:** Thematic frame-God's covenantal promises to the patriarchs as the vehicle of redemptive promise.
- **New Adam / Messianic antitype:** Use of Adam/representative figures as foreshadowing the definitive work of Christ.
- **Canon-centered reading:** Interpreting Genesis within the canon so NT testimony functions as normative for fulfillment claims.
- **Christ-fulfillment:** The NT realization and revelation of what Genesis anticipates; careful distinction between implicit foreshadowing and explicit prophecy.
- **Application (homiletical move):** Pastoral transfer that connects Christ-fulfillment to the contemporary congregation without collapsing the historical text.
- **Typological antitype vs. allegory:** Greidanus defines boundaries so typology remains tethered to text and promise.
- **Sermon outline / expository model:** Practical product of the method-Genesis texts turned into Christ-centered sermons.
- **Contextual exegesis:** Attention to literary, historical, and canonical context before Christological reading.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for promise-fulfillment and redemptive-historical preaching methodology.
- As a **polemic** against moralizing/allegorical and purely historical-critical approaches to OT preaching.
- As an **exegetical-homiletical model** for sermon preparation on Genesis in Reformed and evangelical contexts.
