### TITLE
**Oscar Cullmann, Early Christian Worship** 
Short essays on baptism, the Lord's Supper, prayer, and the Lord's Day as participation in salvation-history and anticipation of the Parousia.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century, postwar ecumenical and liturgical renewal; Cullmann (Basel/Paris) as NT scholar shaping the Heilsgeschichte paradigm.
 - Written alongside Christ and Time and Salvation in History; counters existential reduction and mythic cult theories.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Early Christian worship arises from Jewish Scripture and prayer, is centered on the once-for-all saving acts of Christ, and is ordered toward his return; sacraments are participation in that history, not timeless rites.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Jewish roots and continuity:** Synagogue berakah and scriptural proclamation reinterpreted around the Paschal event and the name of Jesus.
 - **Baptism:** Union with Christ's death and resurrection (Rom 6) constitutes entry into the eschatological people; objective incorporation precedes subjective experience.
 - **Eucharist:** Anamnesis makes present the unique, once-for-all event of the cross-resurrection without repetition; koinonia with the risen Lord amid hope for the feast to come.
 - **Time and eschatology:** Worship is the church's existence between the decisive event and the consummation (already/not yet), shaping Lord's Day, Maranatha, and epiclesis.
 - **Name and Lordship:** Invocation of the Kyrios, confession, and doxology mark worship's Christocentric form and authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - NT: Paul (1 Cor 10-11; Rom 6), Synoptics and institution narratives; Didache; Justin Martyr; synagogue liturgy.
 - Dialogues/contrasts: Odo Casel's Mysterienlehre; Rudolf Bultmann's demythologizing; Gregory Dix's shape of the liturgy; Roman Catholic sacrificial theories; Reformed memorial reductions.
 - Historical analogy: D-Day/V-Day to articulate inaugurated eschatology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and time, Christology (Kyrios, presence), ecclesiology (people-in-history), sacramentology (baptism, Eucharist), eschatology (already/not yet).**
- **Closing line**
 - Worship is the church's enacted memory and foretaste: the once-for-all Christ-event made present by Word and Spirit until he comes (see topic: Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Heilsgeschichte lens:** Rites locate believers within God's linear redemptive history.
 - **Anamnesis as effective remembrance:** No repetition, no mere mental recall; historical event present in liturgical now.
 - **Maranatha orientation:** Worship inherently petitions and anticipates the Parousia.
 - **Kyrios-name theology:** Invocation of Jesus' name as authority and presence.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **mystery-cult cyclicality** (Casel): Christian worship hinges on historical uniqueness.
 - Against **existential reduction** (Bultmann): concrete events, not only kerygmatic decision.
 - Against **sacrificial re-offering**: Eucharist is thanksgiving and participation in the once-for-all sacrifice.
 - Against **thin memorialism**: Real participation without metaphysical repetition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Already/not yet** framed by historical analogy; **prolepsis** of the end in worship; retrieval of **berakah** structure; centrality of **the name**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped ecumenical discussions on the **paschal mystery** and the wording of eucharistic prayers; influenced Reformed redemptive-historical preaching and sacramental theology; provoked debate on presence and sacrifice.
- **Enduring value**
 - A durable **exegetical-liturgy bridge**, clarifying how rites proclaim and apply the gospel of the kingdom (see topic: Christs Messianic Consciousness And Kingdom).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heilsgeschichte (salvation-history):** Linear, once-for-all divine acts culminating in Christ; frames worship's memory and mission.
 - Contrast: centers corporate history over individual sequence of benefits.
- **Anamnesis:** Effective remembrance that renders the unique event present without re-sacrificing.
- **Prolepsis / Already-not yet:** Liturgical foretaste of consummation within historical time.
- **Paschal event:** Cross-resurrection-ascension as single complex saving act.
- **Maranatha:** Prayer for the Lord's coming; eschatological posture of worship.
- **Kyrios confession:** Jesus is Lord; basis for invocation, doxology, baptismal formula.
- **Berakah:** Jewish blessing-thanksgiving pattern reoriented Christologically in Eucharist.
- **Koinonia:** Communion with Christ and his body mediated by Word and sacrament.
- **Epiclesis:** Invocation of the Spirit to actualize the anamnetic presence of the risen Lord.
- **Baptism into Christ:** Objective incorporation into death-resurrection; ecclesial identity marker.
- **Lord's Day:** Weekly celebration of resurrection within salvation-history.
- **Name of Jesus:** Authority and presence concentrated in the invoked name.
- **Once-for-all (ephapax):** Non-repeatable character of Christ's sacrifice, shaping non-repetitive worship.
- **Synagogue-to-church continuity:** Continuity in form, discontinuity in content fulfilled in Christ.
- **Temple/body ecclesiology:** Community as Spirit-indwelt locus of worship.
- **How this work is used**
 - **Definition source:** Establishes salvation-historical categories for sacrament and time across loci.
 - **Exegetical model:** Integrates NT texts with early sources to ground liturgical theology.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Reorients from individualistic ordo to communal history, aiding ecclesiology and missiology (see topic: Eschatological Anthropology).
