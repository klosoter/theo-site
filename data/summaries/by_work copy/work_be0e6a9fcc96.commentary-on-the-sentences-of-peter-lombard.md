### TITLE
**Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Scriptum super Sententiis)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Paris, ca. 1252-1256, as Aquinas serves as bachelor of the Sentences in the Dominican studium, early high scholasticism amid the reception of Aristotle.
 - Milieu: Dominican appropriation of Augustine and Dionysius through Aristotelian metaphysics; interlocution with Franciscan contemporaries (e.g., Bonaventure).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To order Christian doctrine (sacra doctrina) as a unified wisdom under God, integrating Scripture and Fathers with precise metaphysical distinctions, and to clarify grace, sacraments, and Christology within Lombard's fourfold framework.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Follows Lombard's four books:
 - I. **God and the Trinity**: divine simplicity, names of God, processions and relations, missions, knowledge and will, providence and predestination.
 - II. **Creation and Sin**: angels and cosmos, image of God, original justice, fall, nature and grace, habitus and virtue.
 - III. **Incarnation and Virtue**: hypostatic union, Christ's knowledge and wills, grace in Christ, merit and satisfaction, virtues and gifts, justification.
 - IV. **Sacraments and Last Things**: nature, number, and causality of sacraments; Eucharist and transubstantiation; orders, keys, penance; eschatology (beatific vision, purgation, resurrection).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Authorities: **Scripture** (literal and spiritual senses), Augustine, Gregory, Ambrose, Dionysius, Boethius, Anselm; Peter Lombard as base text.
 - Philosophical tools: Aristotle (substance, act/potency, causality), mediated by Albert the Great; dialogue with Avicenna and Averroes.
 - Contemporary contrasts: Franciscan exemplarism and illumination (Bonaventure), views on grace and sacraments among bachelors.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology and method; Trinity; divine names and simplicity; creation and providence; anthropology of powers and habits; sin and reatus; Christology (union, knowledge, satisfaction); soteriology (grace, justification, merit, predestination); pneumatology (gifts, missions); ecclesiology (keys, orders); sacraments (nature, number, efficacy); last things.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on **God the simple Triune source ordering creatures to beatific communion through Christ's headship and the Spirit's grace, ministered ecclesially in the sacraments**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Created habit of grace** and infused virtues; charity as the form of the virtues.
 - **Instrumental causality of sacraments** causing grace ex opere operato by Christ's institution.
 - **Subsistent relations** in the Trinity; names said of God analogically; divine simplicity rigorously maintained.
 - **New Law chiefly the grace of the Holy Spirit**, giving an inner covenantal form to Christian life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Sharpens Lombard on Trinitarian relations by rooting personal distinction in relations of origin.
 - Against merely moral or symbolic accounts of Eucharist: affirms **transubstantiation** with accidents sustained without a subject by divine power.
 - Against occasionalism: robust **primary-secondary causality** enabling creaturely freedom and merit under providence.
 - On merit and satisfaction, integrates Anselmian satisfaction with Augustinian charity, distinguishing condign and congruent merit.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deployment of **act/potency, form/matter, efficient/formal cause** across loci.
 - Early Thomistic **essence/existence** real distinction operative in doctrine of God and creation.
 - Technical accounts of **habitus**, **virtues/gifts**, and sacramental **character**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Template for scholastic quaestio method; mined by later Thomists and commentators.
 - In Reformed theology: positive reception on **simplicity, providence, analogy, Christology**; critical engagement on **ex opere operato**, sacramental number and causality.
 - A sourcebook for medieval debates on justification, predestination, ecclesial power, and sacramental theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogical precision in articulating distinctions that travel across doctrines.
 - Provides durable metaphysical grammar for Trinity, Christology, grace, and sacraments with exegetical anchoring.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacra doctrina**: a science ordered to God under revelation; unifies loci by one formal object.
- **Divine simplicity**: God is ipsum esse subsistens; attributes are really identical with essence, distinct by reason.
- **Analogical predication**: names said of God and creatures neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically.
- **Subsistent relations**: Father, Son, Spirit distinguished by relations of origin (generation, spiration).
- **Primary and secondary causality**: God as first cause moves true secondary causes without destroying contingency.
- **Grace as habitus**: created participation in divine life; foundation of infused virtues; opposed to mere extrinsic favor.
 - **Charity**: infused love of God as form of virtues.
- **Justification**: includes infusion of grace, movement of free will, remission of sins; yields merit.
 - **Merit de condigno/de congruo**: strict merit proportioned by grace vs fitting merit by friendship.
- **Satisfaction**: voluntary recompense offered to God, rooted in Christ's passion and communicated to believers.
- **Predestination**: ordering to glory grounded in divine wisdom and will; permits reprobation without causing sin.
- **Lex nova / Lex vetus**: New Law chiefly the Spirit's grace written on hearts; Old Law chiefly external precepts and figures.
- **Sacrament**: sign that causes grace as Christ's instrument; requires matter and form; confers **character** in baptism, confirmation, orders.
- **Ex opere operato**: efficacy flows from Christ's institution when duly celebrated, not from minister's holiness.
- **Transubstantiation**: conversion of substance of bread and wine into Christ's body and blood; accidents remain by divine power.
- **Fourfold sense of Scripture**: literal foundational; spiritual (allegory, tropology, anagogy) grounded in literal.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for sacrament, grace, merit, simplicity, and analogy.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for causality (instrumental, primary/secondary) in soteriology and providence.
 - As an **ecclesiological resource** on orders, keys, and sacramental economy within the New Covenant.
 - As an **exegetical model** for literal-spiritual senses informing doctrinal synthesis.
