### TITLE
Justification: The New Perspective on Paul (1982, Christianity Today) - Robert H. Gundry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early reception of E.P. Sanders' Paul and Palestinian Judaism (1977) and the emergent **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** in the late 1970s-1980s.
 - Published in Christianity Today (1982) as an accessible, polemical critique aimed at evangelical readership concerned about implications for soteriology and pastoral assurance.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Gundry argues that the NPP misconstrues Paul by minimizing the **forensic**-legal-character of justification and by misreading "works of the law" as primarily boundary-markers rather than meritorious attempts to earn salvation.
 - The core problem: whether Paul's antagonism toward "works" targets Jewish identity markers/covenant nomism (Sanders) or human attempts to obtain acquittal before a just God.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Brief survey of Sanders' thesis (covenant nomism; Judaism not works-righteous) and its appeal.
 - Textual rebuttal: Gundry reads key Pauline texts (notably Romans and Galatians) as articulating **forensic imputation** - God declares sinners righteous through Christ's righteousness received by faith.
 - Theological defense: historic Protestant categories (justification by faith alone; imputation) are necessary to preserve divine justice, substitutionary atonement, and assurance.
 - Polemical conclusion: accepting NPP without correction risks collapsing justification into mere corporate covenant membership and undermining individual forensic acquittal.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: E.P. Sanders (Paul and Palestinian Judaism).
 - Secondary: emerging NPP voices (e.g., James D.G. Dunn-early phase), though Gundry primarily addresses Sanders.
 - Uses Pauline texts and Reformation-era theology as touchstones.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Soteriology** (justification, imputation, faith).
 - **Covenant** (contrasting covenant nomism with Reformed covenantal readings).
 - **Christology** and **atonement** (substitutionary/apologetic import for forensic declaration).
 - Secondary: ecclesiology and assurance insofar as they depend on the doctrine of justification.

- **Closing line**
 - Gundry insists the theological heart of Pauline proclamation is a forensic declaration of righteousness through Christ received by faith; any re-reading that evacuates the legal/imputational element threatens the gospel's center.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm reassertion of **forensic imputation** as indispensable to Paul's message.
 - Emphasis on pastoral consequences: assurance and the motif of acquittal are non-negotiable.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects NPP tendency to translate "works of the law" as ethnic boundary-markers by arguing for a broader Pauline critique of works-based self-justification.
 - Contrasts covenant nomism's sociological focus with classical Protestant doctrinal categories.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Less innovation than sharpened recovery: re-applies classical **forensic** vocabulary to rebut a sociological-historical exegesis.
 - Frames debate as theological (soteriological consequences), not merely historical.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Popular among conservative evangelicals as an early, readable rebuttal to Sanders.
 - Helped catalyze further evangelical responses (e.g., writings by D.A. Carson, Douglas Moo, Leon Morris, and later Gordon Fee/Mark Seifrid critiques).
 - NPP proponents criticized Gundry for theological presupposition and for downplaying Sanders' historical insights.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable primer for students to see conservative theological stakes in the NPP debate.
 - Useful model of combining textual reading with doctrinal concerns and pastoral implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - Gundry: primarily a **forensic declaration** by God, not merely covenant membership.

- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - The umbrella label for Sanders/Dunn/Wright school reinterpreting Second Temple Judaism and Paul's polemics.

- **Forensic (legal)**
 - Central category Gundry defends; justification as courtroom verdict (acquittal).

- **Imputation**
 - Christ's righteousness counted to believers; key to maintaining objective justification.

- **Works of the law**
 - Gundry: not limited to ethnic boundary markers; includes any attempt to gain acquittal by works.

- **Covenant nomism**
 - Sanders' description of Judaism as covenant-based with obedience as response, not merit-based salvation; Gundry critiques its implications for Pauline theology.

- **Merit / Legalism**
 - Gundry insists Paul opposes reliance on merit-based standing before God.

- **Faith**
 - Instrument of receiving justification; not redefined as mere covenant allegiance but as trust in Christ's substitutionary work.

- **Substitutionary atonement**
 - Presupposed: without substitution, forensic acquittal loses ground.

- **Assurance**
 - Pastoral consequence: forensic imputation secures believer's assurance; Gundry emphasizes this practical stake.

- **Pauline soteriology**
 - Read through classical Protestant lenses: justification by faith, imputation, penal substitution.

- **Second Temple Judaism / Palestinian Judaism**
 - Historical context deployed by Sanders; Gundry accepts some historical points but contests theological conclusions.

- **Polemic usage**
 - Gundry uses the article to defend orthodox Protestant readings against sociological re-descriptions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise evangelical **polemic** against NPP claims in surveys and classroom discussion.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how theological commitments shape reading of Paul (cautionary example for method debates).
- As a **definition source** for dissenting readings of NPP, often cited in bibliographies of Reformed critiques.
