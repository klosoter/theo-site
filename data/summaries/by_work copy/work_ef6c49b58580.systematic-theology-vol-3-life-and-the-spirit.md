### TITLE
**Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Life and the Spirit (1963)** 
Life, Spirit, Church, History, and the Kingdom in correlation with the human condition

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1960s, late phase of mainline Protestant theology in dialogue with existentialism, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and the natural sciences.
 - Tillich, a German-American Lutheran, advances his **method of correlation** against both classical liberalism and strict Barthian dialectics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How the **New Being in Christ** (vol. 2) becomes present as **Spiritual Presence** in the ambiguities of life, forming church and culture and orienting history toward the **Kingdom of God**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Life**: ontology of life marked by structural polarities and dynamics (self-integration, self-creativity, self-transcendence) and their **ambiguities** (tensions toward distortion and the **demonic**).
 - **Spirit**: the **Spirit** as God's personal, transformative depth-dimension in life; the **Spiritual Presence** produces **ecstasy** (self-transcending centeredness) and **agape**.
 - **Church and Sacraments**: the church as the **community of the Spirit** under the dialectic of **Protestant principle** and **Catholic substance**; **Word-event** and **sacraments** as participation-points of the Spiritual Presence.
 - **History and Eschatology**: **theonomy** beyond autonomy/heteronomy; **kairos** moments; the **Kingdom** as symbolic consummation; **eternal life** as the eternal now within temporality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine (love, spirit), Aquinas (analogia), Luther (justification, Word), Schleiermacher (feeling/absolute dependence), Hegel and Schelling (spirit/history), Kierkegaard and Heidegger (existence), Barth (revelation), and modern sciences (biology, depth psychology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Scripture** (symbol and Word-event), **Trinity** (Spirit's presence), **Christology** (New Being as foundation of Spiritual Presence), **Pneumatology**, **Soteriology** (acceptance/transformative participation), **Ecclesiology and Sacraments**, **Anthropology** (estrangement), **Demonology**, **Eschatology** (Kingdom/eternal life).
- **Center of gravity**
 - The **Spiritual Presence** of God heals estrangement and creates communities of agape within history's ambiguities, orienting life toward the symbolic fullness named **Kingdom of God**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Method of correlation** linking existential questions with theological answers.
 - **Spiritual Presence** as the Spirit's mode of mediating the New Being across personal, communal, and cultural dimensions.
 - **Ecstasy** as Spirit-given transcendence that re-centers the person in agape, not mere enthusiasm.
 - Church under the tension of **Protestant principle** (critical iconoclasm) and **Catholic substance** (sacramental embodiment).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **fundamentalist inerrancy**: Scripture as normative witness and symbol, not identical with revelation.
 - Against pure **Barthian externalism**: insists on correlation with human questions and cultural forms.
 - Against secular progressivism or triumphalism: underscores **ambiguities** and the **demonic** in history.
 - Against magical sacramentalism or sectarian enthusiasm: sacraments as **events** of presence; charisms ordered to agape and justice.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Triad **autonomy/heteronomy/theonomy**; **ambiguities of life**; **New Being / Spiritual Presence**; **essential vs. existential church**; **symbolic realism**; **kairos**; **ultimate concern**; **ground of being**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as a constructive foil in Reformed theology (critiqued for ontology of God, Scripture, and eschatology), yet appreciated for the **Protestant principle**, cultural diagnostics, and demonology.
 - Influenced political, liberation, and contextual theologies; significant in ecumenical sacramental discussions and theology of culture.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable categories for discerning Spirit and ideology in culture; integrated account of pneumatology, church, and history; a disciplined warning against **idolatry of the finite**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ground of being / being-itself**: God not as a supreme being but as the depth and power of being.
- **Ultimate concern**: structure of faith as the unconditional that claims the person.
- **Method of correlation**: reciprocity of existential questions and revelatory answers.
- **New Being**: Christ-event overcoming estrangement; basis of salvation.
- **Spiritual Presence**: the Spirit's mediating power actualizing New Being in persons, communities, and culture.
- **Ecstasy**: Spirit-enabled transcendence of self-closure into centered freedom for agape.
- **Ambiguities of life**: ineradicable tensions in life's structures and dynamics prone to distortion.
- **Theonomy**: Spirit-grounded law where freedom and form coinhere, beyond autonomy/heteronomy.
- **Protestant principle**: no finite bearers can be absolutized; perpetual reformation.
- **Catholic substance**: sacramental, institutional continuity necessary for communal life.
- **Demonic**: finite realities absolutized, producing self-destructive bondage.
- **Kairos**: qualitatively fulfilled time in which the Spirit decisively breaks in.
- **Symbol / transparency**: signs that participate in and render the ultimate present.
- **Word as event**: revelation occurs; Scripture normatively witnesses to it.
- **Sacraments**: finite media as participation-points of the Spiritual Presence (baptism, Eucharist).
- **Kingdom / eternal life**: symbolic consummation; the eternal now within time.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Protestant principle, Spiritual Presence, symbol, and theonomy in ecclesiology and sacraments.
 - As a **polemic foil** in bibliology and theology proper (critiques of inerrancy, substance ontology of God).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for pneumatology-linked soteriology (agape, acceptance, transformation) and eschatology (Kingdom as symbol).
 - As an **analytic model** for theology of culture and discernment of the demonic in ideology and praxis.
