### TITLE
Adoption - Robert A. Peterson, entry in New Dictionary of Theology, 2nd ed. (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical scholarship (early 21st century); reflection within a handbook aimed at pastors, teachers, and advanced students.
 - Written against a backdrop of renewed interest in soteriological nuances (justification, sanctification, union with Christ) and the pastoral theology of identity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Adoption is a distinct, necessary category of salvation doctrine: it names the relational and familial reality by which God makes believers his children and heirs - a status not reducible to justification or sanctification alone.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and biblical data: traces primary NT texts (e.g., Rom. 8; Gal. 4; Eph. 1; John 1) that present believers as sons/daughters and heirs.
 - Theological analysis:
 - Adoption as a legal/relational act: God decrees believers to be children (forensic declaration) and brings about an inward relational reality (participation in family life).
 - Trinitarian economy: Father as adopter, Son as ground of adoption (redemption), Spirit as seal/witness and inward assurance.
 - Relation to other soteriological loci: distinguishes adoption from justification (status before God), union with Christ (ontological basis), sanctification (moral growth), and election (the divine decree enabling adoption).
 - Practical and pastoral implications: assurance, prayer (Abba), ecclesial identity, ethical fruit of filial status.
 - Eschatological dimension: adoption as already-posited but not yet fully consummated - future inheritance and glorification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary biblical witnesses (Pauline corpus, Johannine themes).
 - Historical Reformed voices (Calvin and Puritan treatment of sonship), patristic echoes (Augustine on filiation), and modern interlocutors within evangelical and Reformed theology.
 - Implicit contrast with traditions that either minimize filial language or interpret it chiefly metaphorically.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology, soteriology (justification, sanctification, election), covenant theology, ecclesiology (church as family), eschatology, pneumatology (Spirit as seal/witness), anthropology (sonship identity).

- **Closing line**
 - Adoption is the Trinitarian, covenantal heart of Christian identity: God the Father makes sinners his children through the Son and by the Spirit, giving present relational status, ongoing transformation, and future inheritance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses adoption as both forensic/legal and deeply relational - not merely a legal declaration nor merely an ethical transformation but a complex of status, relation, and possession.
 - Highlights the Spirit's personal role (seal and witness) in securing the believer's filial status and assurance.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies that collapse adoption into justification or reduce it to an ethical metaphor; clarifies how adoption complements and presupposes union with Christ rather than duplicating it.
 - Pushes back against theological streams that secularize or minimize familial language of Scripture.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear parsing of temporal dimensions: adoption as accomplished (positional), progressive (relational life in the family), and eschatological (final inheritance).
 - Emphasizes the legal-relationship composite as a hermeneutical key for relevant texts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful and widely cited in Reformed and evangelical teaching contexts as a concise, theologically robust summary.
 - Serves as a corrective resource where adoption has been neglected in systematic treatments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Strong pedagogical clarity for pastors and teachers; integrates biblical exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral application in a compact entry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adoption** - God making believers his children and heirs; includes forensic declaration, relational incorporation, and future inheritance.
- **Sonship / Daughtership** - Primary biblical category for the believer's identity; language of intimacy and inheritance.
- **Heir / Inheritance** - Eschatological and present privileges that flow from filial status.
- **Union with Christ** - Ontological ground for adoption; adoption is a fruit/implication of being in Christ.
- **Justification** - Distinct forensic declaration of righteousness; related to but not identical with adoption.
 - Contrast: justification changes legal standing before God; adoption confers familial status and privileges.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive moral/ontological outworking of filial life; evidence and consequence of adoption.
- **Trinity (Father, Son, Spirit)** - Father as adopter, Son as basis (redemption), Spirit as seal/witness/guarantor.
- **Abba** - Term denoting intimate filial address; used to show the experiential reality and prayer-shaping effect of adoption.
- **Election / Predestination** - Divine decree that includes selection for sonship; grounds of assured adoption.
- **Seal & Witness** - Pneumatological terms emphasizing assurance and present possession (Eph. 1 language).
- **Forensic vs. Relational categories** - Distinction stressed to avoid reductionism.
- **Already / Not Yet** - Temporal framing: adoption already granted, not yet fully consummated in glorification.
- **Ecclesial family language** - Church as domestic family; adoption shapes worship, discipline, and mutual care.
- **Pastoral assurance** - Adoption as theological resource for assurance, prayer life, and identity formation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: concise, systematic definition of adoption for doctrinal summaries and catechesis.
 - Exegetical model & pastoral tool: informs NT exegesis (Pauline and Johannine texts) and pastoral applications (assurance, prayer, family ethics).
