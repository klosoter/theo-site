### TITLE
**Atonement: The Person and Work of Christ** - Thomas F. Torrance 
Collected Edinburgh lectures (mid-20th c.), published posthumously (ed. Robert T. Walker). A constructive, patristically rooted, Reformed-catholic account of atonement as the incarnate mediation of the Son in the Spirit, climaxing in cross, resurrection, ascension, and priestly intercession.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-century Scottish Reformed theology engaging patristic ressourcement and post-Barthian dogmatics; published 2009 from decades of university lectures.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How the one incarnate Son, consubstantial with the Father and with us, accomplishes reconciliation from both the Godward and humanward sides, in an indivisible life, death, and exaltation, mediated to the church by the Spirit.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Trinitarian ground:** Homoousion secures the objective efficacy of atonement; the Father acts in and with the Son by the Spirit.
 - **Incarnational ontology:** Hypostatic union means Christ lives our life for us; atonement is as wide as his person and history (life, cross, descent, resurrection, ascension).
 - **Priestly substitution and vicarious agency:** Jesus offers obedient faith, repentance, prayer, and sacrifice in our name; penal, cultic, and covenantal motifs integrated.
 - **Spirit and participation:** The Spirit unites us to Christ, actualizing what is accomplished; ecclesial mediation in Word and Sacrament.
 - **Pastoral-ecclesial outflow:** The munus triplex governs ministry and mission; assurance rooted in the objectivity of Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Athanasius, Irenaeus, Cyril; Calvin and the Reformed liturgical-catechetical tradition; Anselm; Barth (critical reception); critiques of kenoticism and liberal moralism; engagement with Eastern emphases (recapitulation/theosis).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity; Christology (hypostatic union, anhypostasia/enhypostasia); revelation; covenant and union; sin and death; atonement (substitution, reconciliation, recapitulation); Spirit and ecclesiology; sacraments; eschatology (priestly intercession).
- **Closing line:** The atonement is the incarnate Son's high-priestly, Spirit-empowered mediation, in which he is God toward us and us toward God, objectively accomplished and subjectively applied.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Vicarious humanity:** Jesus believes, repents, obeys, prays, and offers sacrifice on our behalf.
 - **Consubstantial mediation:** The homoousion with the Father and with us grounds both Godward and humanward dimensions.
 - **Ontological healing with forensic depth:** Cleansing corruption and bearing guilt are inseparable acts in the one Priest.
 - **Whole-Christ atonement:** Life, cross, resurrection, ascension, and intercession are one saving movement.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against reductionist penal or exemplarist models; affirms penal realities within covenantal, priestly, and ontological frames.
 - Rejects **kenotic** diminutions of divine being; insists the Incarnate acts as the undiminished Son.
 - Nuances Anselm by integrating patristic recapitulation and temple-cult motifs; complements and sometimes corrects Barth by stronger sacramental and patristic retrieval.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Scientific theology** as evangelical realism (coherence with the object).
 - **Vicarious repentance/faith** as soteriological categories.
 - **Non-competitive agency** of God and humanity in the one Person of the Mediator.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Shaped Reformed-catholic atonement theology, evangelical discussions on union with Christ, and ecumenical dialogues (Word/Sacrament).
 - Used in pastoral theology for assurance, priesthood of Christ, and sacramental practice.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A balanced Trinitarian, incarnational, and ecclesial account that trains readers to think soteriology from Christ's person and priestly ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Homoousion (consubstantial):** The Son is of one being with the Father (divine efficacy) and with us (saving solidarity).
- **Hypostatic union (anhypostasia/enhypostasia):** The human nature has no independent hypostasis; is personalized in the Son for our salvation.
- **Vicarious humanity:** Christ performs the human response to God in our stead and on our behalf.
- **Recapitulation:** Christ sums up and heals human history by living it rightly from within.
- **Priestly mediation:** Cultic core of atonement; Christ as offerer, offering, and place of meeting.
- **Substitution and representation:** Not alternatives but united in the one High Priest bearing sin and guilt.
- **Guilt, pollution, and death:** Sin involves forensic liability and ontological corruption; atonement addresses both by judgment and healing (Guilt Pollution And Death).
- **Kenosis (theories and critiques):** Torrance rejects metaphysical divestment models; the Son's self-emptying is obedient humility in the flesh, not surrender of deity (Kenosis Theories And Critiques).
- **Spirit's agency:** The Spirit conceives, anoints, empowers Jesus' ministry, raises him, and unites believers to his finished work (Spirits Role In Christs Ministry And Resurrection).
- **Munus triplex:** Christ as Prophet (revelation), Priest (reconciliation), King (renewal), structuring doctrine and ministry (Munus Triplex).
- **Means of grace:** Word preached, Baptism, Eucharist, and prayer as Christ's continued self-giving by the Spirit; participation not repetition (Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer).
- **Union with Christ:** Objective accomplishment in Christ, subjectively actualized by the Spirit in faith and sacrament.
- **Non-competitive agency:** Divine and human operations coincide in the one person without zero-sum rivalry.
- **Ascension and intercession:** The crucified-and-risen Priest continues to minister, grounding assurance and ecclesial worship.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definition source for atonement framed by Trinity and incarnation; a template for integrating penal, cultic, and participatory motifs.
 - As a polemic against kenoticism and reductionist atonement models; an exegetical-theological model for priesthood and union with Christ.
 - As a conceptual pivot for ecclesiology and sacramental theology, connecting atonement to preaching, Baptism, Eucharist, and prayer.
