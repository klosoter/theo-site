### TITLE
**New Horizons in Hermeneutics** - Anthony C. Thiselton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century, post-linguistic-turn theological method; dialogue with continental hermeneutics (Gadamer, Ricoeur), analytic philosophy of language (Austin, Searle), and contemporary biblical scholarship. Addresses evangelical and Reformed concerns about method, doctrine, and ecclesial practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Hermeneutics must be both philosophically informed and theologically disciplined: interpretation is a transformative, Spirit-enabled event that moves from text to responsible appropriation in faith and practice. Problematizes both naïve literalism and reductive historicism.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic: critiques limits in historicist, literalist, and purely critical methodologies.
 - Resource retrieval: imports philosophical hermeneutics (fusion of horizons, Ricoeurian narrative identity) and speech-act theory to reconceive textual meaning as communicative event.
 - Theological corrective: argues for a pneumatological account of appropriation - the Spirit mediates the text's revelatory force, enabling union with Christ and participation in the eschatological new creation.
 - Practical outworkings: implications for preaching, doctrine, pastoral theology, and ecclesial formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, J. L. Austin, John Searle, major biblical-critical voices; engages Reformation and post-Reformation hermeneutical traditions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration, pneumatology (illumination and appropriation), Christology (union with Christ), eschatology (resurrection and new creation), ecclesiology (congregational reading and practice).
 - Explicit attention to: **Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination**, **Spirit And Union With Christ**, **Resurrection And New Creation** as loci where hermeneutic method intersects dogma.
- **Closing line**
 - Thiselton reconceives hermeneutics as a multidisciplinary, theologically governed practice: interpretation is an incarnational, pneumatized communicative event that grounds Christian belief, ecclesial life, and eschatological hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the unity of philosophical hermeneutics and systematic theology rather than their separation; reading is not merely cognitive but existential and performative.
 - Emphasizes speech-act dynamics (illocutionary force, perlocution) to explain how texts do things to readers rather than only refer to facts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges the sufficiency of both classical historical-critical method (which isolates text from transformative reception) and devotional literalism (which bypasses rigorous interpretive discipline).
 - Offers a corrective to purely reader-response approaches by retaining authorial, historical, and canonical constraints within a dialogical model.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrates "fusion of horizons" with speech-act pragmatics and a pneumatological theory of appropriation - treating understanding as mediated by the Spirit and accountable to the church.
 - Frames interpretation as a "transforming reading" that has ontological effects (participation in Christ; movement toward new creation).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and Reformed seminaries as a bridge between philosophy and theology; adopted in homiletics, systematic theology, and biblical interpretation courses.
 - Critiques from some quarters for perceived philosophical eclecticism or for the challenge of operationalizing pneumatological claims in scholarly exegesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological framework that keeps theological commitments central to hermeneutics while respecting philosophical insight and exegetical rigor.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Philosophical hermeneutics**
 - Gadamerian and Ricoeurian resources applied to biblical texts; emphasis on tradition, prejudice, and narrative identity.
- **Speech-act theory**
 - Texts as illocutionary acts with force; meaning includes performative effects on hearers/readers.
- **Fusion of horizons**
 - Dialectical meeting of text-world and interpreter-world; interpretive understanding is dialogical not merely reconstructive.
- **Transforming reading**
 - Interpretation that effects moral/ontological change in the reader (distinct from mere information transfer).
- **Pneumatological appropriation**
 - **Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination** - the Spirit mediates the text's saving power and enables true appropriation.
- **Union with Christ**
 - **Spirit And Union With Christ** - the Spirit is the agent who actualizes the believer's participation in Christ, a hermeneutical outcome as much as a soteriological reality.
- **Eschatological hermeneutic**
 - **Resurrection And New Creation** - interpretation is oriented toward the eschatological reality the text announces; reading anticipates and participates in new-creation life.
- **Authorial intention vs. reader appropriation**
 - Balances respect for historical intent with recognition of the text's ongoing communicative and transformative capacity in new contexts.
- **Canon and community**
 - Emphasizes ecclesial boundaries and communal practices as stages where interpretation is tested and formed.
- **Historical-critical method (reinterpreted)**
 - Retains historical analysis as necessary but insufficient without theological and pragmatic integration.
- **Illocutionary force**
 - How texts command, promise, or embody action - central to preaching and pastoral application.
- **Hermeneutical responsibility**
 - Ethical obligation of interpreters to the text, community, and tradition.
- **Narrative identity**
 - Ricoeurian notion linking scriptural narrative to the formation of Christian self-understanding.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary, theologically integrated hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic** against both naïve literalism and anti-theological historicism.
 - As an **exegetical model** combining speech-act and narrative approaches for preaching and theological reflection.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for pneumatological claims about illumination, union with Christ, and interpretive eschatology.
