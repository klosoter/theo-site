### TITLE
Reading Genesis Well: Navigating History, Poetry, Science, and Truth in Genesis 1-11 (2018) - C. John Collins

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2018 amid renewed evangelical debate over Genesis 1-11: tensions between Young Earth Creationism, theistic evolution, and literary/functional readings (e.g., Walton). Collins writes from an evangelical, broadly Reformed academic setting (Covenant Theological Seminary) seeking a middle path.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1-11 should be read as **theological history** in ancient historiographical mode: neither modern scientific report nor mere myth. Properly read, Genesis affirms foundational doctrines (creation, imago Dei, Fall, covenant realities) while permitting disciplined dialogue with modern science.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - 1) Establish literary and genre criteria: Genesis uses ancient historiographical techniques; identify narrative, genealogies, and poetic interludes.
 - 2) Distinguish theological claims from incidental scientific description; resist naive concordism and unwarranted dismissal of historicity.
 - 3) Examine contested loci (days of creation, Adam and Eve, Flood) by balancing exegesis, theology, and scientific data.
 - 4) Offer hermeneutical principles for reading Genesis well: exegetical priority, genre awareness, restraint in importing modern categories.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with modern interpreters: John Walton (functional/temple reading), framework hypothesis proponents, Young Earth Creationists, and scientists (population genetics commentators). Interacts with historical interpreters and standard evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation doctrine, imago Dei, anthropology, Fall and original sin, covenantal consequences, revelation/inspiration (hermeneutics), and implications for Christology (typology of Adam).
- **Site usages (three explicit topical focuses in the book)**
 - **Historicity and Federal Headship of Adam** - argues for a historical Adam as theological necessity while engaging genetic evidence.
 - **Days of Creation** - reviews competing models (24-hour, day-age, framework, analogical) and presses exegetical constraints.
 - **Science and Scripture: Genesis 1-11** - develops a posture of dialogue: non-concordist, humble about scientific claims, but protective of theological truth.
- **Closing line**
 - Collins proposes a disciplined, historically informed reading that preserves Genesis as theological history and enables responsible engagement with contemporary science.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **genre sensitivity**: locating Genesis in ancient historiography prevents both modern literalism and dismissive allegorizing.
 - Balanced hermeneutic that gives **exegetical priority** while allowing legitimate scientific input where the Bible is silent.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Young Earth concordism by exposing methodological flaws in demanding scripture to mimic modern science.
 - Counters purely functional/temple readings that entirely de-historicize Genesis by defending meaningful historic claims (notably Adam as a real actor).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates the phrasing **"theological history"** as distinct from myth or modern historiography and promotes pragmatic hermeneutical checklists for reading Genesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries and Bible-study contexts as a temperate alternative to polar extremes; praised for clarity and judged by some conservatives as too conciliatory toward science, by some liberal interpreters as still too conservative.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable model for integrating careful exegesis, theological fidelity, and scientific humility; valuable for pastors, seminarians, and scholars navigating contemporary science-bible tensions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theological history** - Genesis as ancient historiography with theological aims; asserts meaningful past referents without modern historiographical demands.
- **Genre sensitivity** - Method: determine authorial intent by genre to set interpretive limits.
- **Concordism** - The attempt to force Genesis into modern scientific categories; Collins critiques its methodological excesses.
- **Framework hypothesis** - Treated as a rival model for the days; Collins evaluates it against grammatical-historical constraints.
- **Analogical/Day interpretations** - Surveys 24-hour, day-age, and analogical readings and stresses exegetical criteria for adjudicating them.
- **Historic Adam** - Collins defends a real historical Adam as theologically necessary (especially for federal headship) while engaging population-genetics objections.
 - Relation to **federal headship**: Adam functions as covenantal representative; this theological claim undergirds Christus/Adam typology.
- **Imago Dei** - Central anthropological datum shaping ethics, covenant responsibility, and redemption.
- **Science-scripture boundary** - Collins formulates norms for interaction: Scripture answers theological questions; science addresses empirical mechanism; overlap must be negotiated carefully.
- **Ancient historiography** - Technical category placing Genesis among ANE historical modes (sparse modern chronological detail but real events).
- **Exegesis-first hermeneutic** - Prioritize close reading of the text before importing external scientific or philosophical frameworks.
- **Original sin / Fall** - Treated as historically consequential event with cosmic and covenantal effects.
- **Typology of Adam/Christ** - Theological linkage between Adam's role and Christ's redemptive headship.
- **Narrative theology** - Uses the story-shape of Genesis to anchor doctrine and praxis.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "theological history" and hermeneutical norms in evangelical curricula.
 - As a **polemic tool** against naive concordism and against total demythologizing of Genesis.
 - As an **exegetical model** for pastors and teachers: disciplined reading that preserves theological claims while engaging science responsibly.
