### TITLE
**Instruction in the Christian Religion** (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion), 1875 
Albrecht Ritschl (1822-1889)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-c. German Protestant theology; post-Kantian milieu; after Ritschl's trilogy on Justification and Reconciliation (1870-74).
 - Programmatic for the Ritschlian school: theology freed from metaphysics, grounded in historical revelation and ethical values.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to articulate Christian doctrine as instruction for the church when speculative metaphysics is excluded and the historical Christ is central.
 - The Kingdom of God, founded by Jesus, is the organizing principle of doctrine and piety.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Method:** Theology operates by value-judgments (Werturteile) arising from the Christian community's faith; not theoretical metaphysics.
 - **Revelation:** God is known in Jesus' historical work and the community he inaugurates; Scripture is the normative witness to this event.
 - **God:** The Father of Jesus Christ, defined by holy love and purpose toward the Kingdom; divine attributes are soteriologically framed.
 - **Christ:** The Son by vocation and perfect filial trust; his significance is measured by saving efficacy, not metaphysical speculation.
 - **Salvation:** Justification and reconciliation consist in forgiveness and incorporation into the ethical community of the Kingdom.
 - **Spirit:** The power actualizing communal life, faith, and love; experienced in the church's moral fellowship.
 - **Church and sacraments:** The church is the community of moral ends; sacraments are symbolic acts strengthening faith and fellowship.
 - **Eschatology:** The consummation of the Kingdom as moral victory of God's rule; apocalyptic imagery subordinated to ethical telos.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Luther (justification), biblical witness, Kant and Lotze (value-judgment and teleology), historical criticism.
 - Critically: Protestant scholasticism and speculative Trinitarian metaphysics; Schleiermacher's subjectivism; Roman Catholic merit and ecclesiocentrism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; God and attributes; Christology; sin, grace, justification, reconciliation; Spirit and sanctification; church and sacraments; prayer and moral life; hope and Kingdom.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: God's holy love realizing the Kingdom through Jesus, creating a forgiven, Spirit-filled community that lives toward the ethical consummation of God's rule.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Kingdom of God** as the architectonic principle across all loci.
 - **Value-judgment method:** doctrinal claims justified by their soteriological value for the community.
 - **Ethical teleology:** doctrine ordered to the moral end of love and communal righteousness.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects penal substitution and predestinarian determinism; reframes atonement as reconciliation in and for the community.
 - Minimizes speculative Trinity and two-natures metaphysics; affirms Christ's deity as a soteriological confession, not an ontological construction.
 - Displaces apocalyptic futurism with ethical-realized eschatology oriented to communal life.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Werturteil** as criterion; **Gemeinde** as locus of revelation's efficacy; **moral world-order** under God's fatherly rule.
 - Recasts sacraments as communal-symbolic rather than instrumental, rejecting ex opere notions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed the Ritschlian school (e.g., Harnack) and influenced Social Gospel trajectories.
 - Provoked neo-orthodox critique (Barth, Brunner) for historicism and anti-metaphysics, yet shaped their Kingdom and ethical emphases.
 - In Reformed circles: used as a foil and conversation partner on Kingdom, atonement, and ecclesiology; occasionally mined for ethical-kingdom integration.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, catechetical synthesis; rigorous method tying doctrine to salvation and community.
 - Stimulates critical reflection on metaphysics, method, and the primacy of the Kingdom for preaching and practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God:** Organizing telos of doctrine, ethics, and hope; defines God's purpose and the church's vocation.
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil):** Non-speculative criterion grounding theology in saving significance rather than theory.
- **Revelation in history:** God known through Jesus' historical work and its apostolic witness, not through nature or metaphysics.
- **God as Father:** Divine holiness and love oriented to communal redemption; attributes read soteriologically.
- **Christ's vocation and sonship:** Filial obedience and trust as the mode of mediation; deity confessed for saving efficacy.
- **Justification and reconciliation:** Forgiveness and restored fellowship; incorporation into the community rather than legal transfer.
 - Contra penal satisfaction; for relational restoration and moral transformation within the Gemeinde.
- **Faith as trust:** Practical reliance that binds to Christ and the community, not mere assent.
- **Holy Spirit as communal power:** Actualizes love, unity, and mission; the experiential presence of God in the church.
- **Gemeinde (community):** Locus of salvation's realization; the ethical fellowship founded by Jesus.
- **Sacraments as symbols:** Baptism and Supper confirm faith and communal identity; deny automatic efficacy.
- **Moral world-order:** Teleological frame in which God governs history toward the Kingdom.
- **Eschatology as ethical consummation:** Hope for the perfected communal order, not speculative timelines.
- **Scripture as normative witness:** Authoritative because of its relation to Christ and the community's faith.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source:** Kingdom-centered definitions for God, church, salvation, and hope.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Value-judgment method for doctrinal construction and critique.
 - **Polemic foil:** Against penal substitution, speculative Trinity, and sacramentalism.
 - **Exegetical-model influence:** Reading texts through the ethical-kingdom horizon and communal outcomes.
