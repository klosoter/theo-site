### TITLE
**Karl Barth and the Analogia Entis** 
Keith L. Johnson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary scholarly engagement with Karl Barth within a broader revival of historical-theological retrieval (late 20th-early 21st century). Situated amid longstanding debates about natural theology sparked by the Barth-Brunner controversy and ongoing Reformed reassessments of Thomistic categories.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Johnson interrogates Barth's rejection of the classical *analogia entis* (analogy of being) and argues that Barth neither simply abandons analogical predication nor accepts the medieval Thomistic model uncritically; rather Barth reconceives analogy in light of revelation so that meaningful, though strictly conditioned, analogical language about God remains possible.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnoses the rhetorical and theological targets of Barth's critique: metaphysical natural theology and presumptive claims that creaturely being gives unmediated ontological warrant for divine attributes.
 - Reconstructs Barth's positive theological alternative (often labeled *analogia relationis* or revelation-grounded analogy), showing how it preserves a form of analogy without collapsing into either natural theology or purely equivocal language.
 - Traces historical antecedents and contrasts (Patristic, Scholastic, Reformation) to locate Barth's remedial move between Aquinas and radical fideism.
 - Evaluates implications for doctrines of revelation, God-world relation, and theological method: how doctrine about God must be anchored in the Christ-event yet still enable predication about God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth's Dogmatics and lectures; Thomas Aquinas and classical scholastic expositions of *analogia entis*; Patristic analogical language; Barth's critics and interpreters (notably Emil Brunner, Thomists, and modern Barth scholars).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (central), natural theology (critically), theology proper (doctrine of God), Trinity (implications for predication), Christology (basis of disclosure), anthropology (creatureliness and analogical knowledge).
- **Closing line:** Johnson's study situates Barth as redefining-not simply rejecting-analogy: analogical speech about God is preserved only when rooted in the particularity of revealed, covenantal self-disclosure in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the continuity between Barth's negative polemics and his positive account of revelation-bound analogy, avoiding caricatures that portray him as wholly anti-analogical.
 - Highlights a methodological move: analogy becomes relational and event-centered rather than metaphysically inferential.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects readings that equate Barth with wholesale denial of any analogical talk; contrasts Barth with Aquinas by insisting Barth rejects ontological bridging claims that ground natural theology.
 - Positions Barth against Brunner-style claims that human experience yields immediate theological warrant.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies distinctions among **analogia entis**, **analogia relationis**, and **analogia fidei** in Barthian usage and shows how Barth's terms function operationally in dogmatic method.
 - Emphasizes a hermeneutical criterion: analogy is valid only insofar as it derives from and conforms to the Christ-event.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Useful corrective in Reformed and evangelical arenas that wrestle with integrating classical analogical metaphysics and Barthian revelationism.
 - Influential among theologians seeking a mediating position that preserves robust divine transcendence without forfeiting meaningful predication about God.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a rigorous model for teaching the limits and possibilities of theological language in confessional settings.
 - Serves as a resource for contemporary debates on natural theology, analogy, and the place of Thomistic categories in Protestant theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis:** Classical doctrine that creaturely being bears a proportionate resemblance to divine being; Johnson treats Barth as critical of metaphysical uses of this term.
- **Analogia relationis:** Barth's preferred slot-analogy grounded in God's relational self-disclosure; Johnson explicates its structure and limits.
- **Analogia fidei:** Theological hermeneutic where doctrine coheres analogically within the economy of revelation; Johnson notes Barth's affinities here.
- **Natural theology:** Knowledge of God purportedly available apart from revelation; Johnson analyzes how Barth restricts its legitimate forms.
- **Revelation / disclosure:** For Barth, the decisive basis for analogical predication; Johnson foregrounds Christ as the hermeneutical center.
- **Transcendence / immanence:** Tension mediated by Barthian analogy-God remains utterly other yet disclosive; Johnson tracks how analogy negotiates this.
- **Predication (analogical, equivocal, univocal):** Johnson maps Barth's move toward analogical predication that is neither fully equivocal nor univocal.
- **Covenant / event-centered theology:** Framework Johnson uses to explain why analogy must be tethered to divine action in history.
- **Metaphysical warrant:** The problematic claim Barth opposes; Johnson identifies limits to any ontologically grounded bridge from creature to Creator.
- **Christ-event:** The criterion for legitimate analogical speech; all theological analogy must be tested against this event.
- **Dogmatic method:** The procedural locus where analogy is applied-Johnson shows Barth's method restricts analogical claims.
- **Anthropological analogy:** Human attributes as pointers to God only insofar as revelation reinterprets them.
- **Dialectical theology:** Contextual category-Johnson situates Barth's analogical stance within this movement.
- **Language of being / language of relation:** Distinction Johnson uses to show different operative vocabularies in debates about analogy.
- **Hermeneutical rule:** Analogy's validity judged by fidelity to Scripture and Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for a Barthian understanding of analogy (clarifying terms and limits).
- As a **polemic resource** against simplistic endorsements of classical *analogia entis* within Reformed theology.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Barth's Dogmatics on revelation and predication.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curriculum treating the interface of natural theology, revelation, and theological language.
