### TITLE
De Vocatione Omnium Gentium (On the Calling of All Nations) - Prosper of Aquitaine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-5th century Latin West (Prosper active c. 430s-450s). Written amid post-Pelagian controversy in Gaul and Italy as an explicit defense and popularizer of Augustine's theology.
 - Theological milieu: reaction against Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian currents (e.g., Julian of Eclanum, John Cassian) that stressed human initiative in salvation; growing articulation of predestination and efficacious grace.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - God issues a universal call to all nations, but that call is efficacious only insofar as divine election and gratuitous prevenient grace render faith possible; human will cannot initiate saving movement without prior grace.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Exposition that Scripture records a universal proclamation (vocatio) to Jews and Gentiles - God's will to call all.
 - Analysis of human inability: original sin renders the will incapable of turning to God unaided.
 - Defense of Augustine's doctrine of election and predestination as the explanation for why some accept the call and others do not.
 - Distinction between prevenient/operating grace (gratia praeveniens / operans) that causes conversion and cooperating grace; insistence that true conversion is the work of God's efficacious grace.
 - Polemic against semi‑Pelagian assertions of an initial movent of the will; reading of Pauline texts (esp. Romans/Ephesians) to support depravity and necessity of grace.
 - Pastoral concern: assurance of the elect, perseverance secured by divine will and grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine (primary authority and textual source), Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum (adversaries), John Cassian and Gallic semi‑Pelagians (targets of critique), Scripture (Pauline corpus heavily invoked).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (operative, prevenient, efficacious), predestination/election, original sin, free will (limits after the Fall), calling/vocation, perseverance of the saints, soteriology broadly; exegetical method on Pauline texts.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Salvation is initiated and secured by God's gratuitous, efficacious grace: the universal call is genuine, but only the elect, drawn by prior divine action, truly respond.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp insistence on **efficacious prevenient grace** as the necessary cause of conversion; little patience for any doctrine that makes the human will the initial principle of salvation.
 - Articulation that the universal external call (preaching to all) and particular divine election coexist-God wills the call to all but efficaciously grants conversion to the elect.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Pelagius: denies sufficiency of unaided free will, affirms original sin and necessity of grace.
 - Contrasts with Cassian/semi‑Pelagians: rejects the idea that the will can begin salvation and that grace only assists a self‑started motion; stresses Augustine's reading of Pauline depravity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes distinction between **gratia operans** (grace that effects) and **gratia cooperans** (grace that cooperates), pressing the former as decisive for conversion.
 - Tightens language about vocation: makes rhetorical and theological space for a universal proclamation that is not thereby universal in effect.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in later Western debates: read by medieval scholastics; cited by Reformers as an Augustinian exemplar for predestination and effectual grace.
 - Criticized by some medieval and modern Catholic commentators as edging toward determinism; later Council of Orange (529) would nuance Augustine while endorsing many of his and Prosper's anti‑semi‑Pelagian positions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact polemical synthesis of Augustinian soteriology; valuable for tracing the formation of doctrines of efficacious grace, predestination, and the limits of free will in Western theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Vocatio / Calling** - public proclamation to all peoples; universal in offer but not in saving effect.
- **Praedestinatio / Election** - God's prior choice determining who will efficaciously receive the call.
- **Gratia praeveniens (prevenient grace)** - divine grace that precedes and enables any true turning to God; for Prosper it is decisive and efficacious in the elect.
- **Gratia operans (operative grace)** - the working, effectual grace that produces conversion; contrasted with mere assisting grace.
- **Gratia cooperans (cooperating grace)** - used by opponents to describe grace that assists a self‑willed motion; Prosper demurs from reducing grace to this role.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - total corruption of the will's ability to choose God without divine intervention.
- **Libertum arbitrium (free will)** - affirmed in a qualified sense but incapable post‑Fall of beginning salvation apart from grace.
- **Efficacy / efficax** - the power of divine grace that necessarily achieves its intended end in the elect.
- **Reprobation** - implicit in Prosper's logic (some are not elected and do not receive efficacious grace); treated cautiously but present as corollary.
- **Perseverantia (perseverance)** - perseverance secured by election and sustaining grace.
- **Scriptural exegesis** - heavy reliance on Pauline soteriology (Romans, Ephesians) as doctrinal foundation.
- **Merit / human agency** - strictly denied as antecedent cause of election or initial conversion.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Polemic**: primary source in anti‑Pelagian and anti‑semi‑Pelagian arguments, weaponized to defend Augustine's positions.
- **Doctrinal definition source**: cited in later debates on predestination and efficacious grace; a touchstone for Reformers and scholastics.
- **Exegetical model**: exemplar for reading Pauline texts through an Augustinian lens that emphasizes depravity and divine initiative.
