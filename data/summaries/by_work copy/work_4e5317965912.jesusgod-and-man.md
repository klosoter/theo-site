### TITLE
**Jesus - God and Man** (Wolfhart Pannenberg) 
A programmatic Christology from below that argues the resurrection as the eschatological revelation of Jesus deity, grounding Christian doctrine in publicly accessible history.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1960s German Protestant theology; postwar, post-Bultmann milieu; debates over historical Jesus, demythologizing, and Barthian revelational positivism.
 - Aimed to restore theology as public truth by rooting revelation in universal history rather than private experience or ecclesial fiat.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** Jesus divinity is revealed and determined by his resurrection as a proleptic event of the end of history, through which God identifies Jesus as Son and Lord. 
 - **Problem:** How to confess Jesus as God without bypassing historical inquiry or collapsing into existential myth or ahistorical metaphysics.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - From history to dogma: begin with the publicly assessable figure of Jesus, culminating in the resurrection as a historical, eschatological event.
 - **Revelation as history:** God reveals himself in the course of universal history; the resurrection is the decisive disclosure.
 - **Prolepsis of the future:** The end of history (Gods rule) anticipates itself in Jesus resurrection, retroactively determining his identity.
 - **Christology from below to above:** Historical Jesus and kingdom mission lead to ontological confession (homoousios) read through eschatology, not pre-existent speculation.
 - **Soteriological integration:** Jesus saving significance flows from his identity as the eschatological representative who brings the rule of God; reconciliation and lordship cohere.
 - **Doctrinal reception:** Re-reads Chalcedon in light of history; affirms unity of person while resisting static two-natures metaphysics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Bultmann (against existential demythologizing), Barth (for revelation, against non-historical closure), Troeltsch (historicism), Hegel/Kant (history and reason), Rahner (Christology), and patristic dogma (Nicaea, Chalcedon). Uses historical-critical NT scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology:** Scripture as witness to Gods historical self-disclosure; authority tied to events and their public meaning.
 - **Christology:** Person and work unified by the resurrection; Son of God, Son of Man, kingdom bearer; ontological claims grounded historically.
 - **Soteriology:** Reconciliation as participation in the eschatological lordship; representation and obedience of Jesus.
 - **Eschatology:** Future of God determines the present; resurrection as anticipation of the end.
 - **Trinity:** Gods deity as his eschatological rule; the Son identified in history; pneumatological dimensions implicit in eschatological life.
 - **Anthropology/Creation:** Human identity as openness to the future of God; history-oriented imago Dei.
- **Closing line**
 - The **resurrection as proleptic revelation** is the works center of gravity: it secures Jesus deity and renders Christian theology a rational account of reality in universal history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Revelation as history** and the resurrection as the crucial public event.
 - **Proleptic eschatology:** the future determines the meaning of the present and past.
 - **Public, apologetic rationality:** dogmatics accountable to common historical reasoning.
 - Tight **person-work unity**: identity disclosed in mission and destiny.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against **Bultmann**: refuses existential reduction; retains real, historical resurrection.
 - Against a strong **Barthian** closure: insists on publicly accessible grounds, not only internal church confession.
 - Recasts **Chalcedon**: affirms its intent but resists ahistorical substance metaphysics; identity arises from Gods act in history.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Prolepsis**, **universal history**, **eschatological verification**, and deity as **Gods rule** manifested in history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in 20th-century Christology and public theology; constructive dialogue partner for Moltmann and many post-biblical theologians.
 - In Reformed circles: valued for historical case for the resurrection and eschatological integration; critiqued for underdeveloped ontic preexistence and a thinner doctrine of Scripture and penal substitution.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating exegesis, historical method, and dogmatics.
 - Stimulus for teaching Christology as the doctrinal pivot linking eschatology, soteriology, and revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
