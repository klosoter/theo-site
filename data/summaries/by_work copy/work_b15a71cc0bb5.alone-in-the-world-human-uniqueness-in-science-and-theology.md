### TITLE
Alone in the World? Human Uniqueness in Science and Theology - J. Wentzel van Huyssteen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century engagement (1990s) at the intersection of theology, philosophy of science, and cognitive/neurobiological accounts of personhood.
 - Situated within constructive Reformed theology but oriented ecumenically; responds to the rise of evolutionary biology, cognitive science, and reductionist philosophies of mind.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Question: Are humans uniquely constituted in ways that demand theological explanation beyond scientific description?
 - Thesis: Human uniqueness is best understood neither by reductive naturalism nor by crude dualism, but through an interdisciplinary, critically realistic theology that reads scientific data through theological categories (not vice versa).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of scientific claims about human distinctiveness (language, self-awareness, moral agency, culture) and their philosophical interpretations.
 - Critique of reductionist accounts (neuroreductionism, eliminative materialism) and of uncritical appeals to metaphysical souls.
 - Proposal of a non-reductive, relational account of personhood that emphasizes embodiment, emergence, and the social-linguistic constitution of selfhood.
 - Methodological program: epistemological pluralism and disciplined interdisciplinarity - theologians should engage empirical sciences seriously while retaining theological norms and insights (e.g., imago Dei).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists (representative figures like Dennett, Searle, Churchland in the debate landscape), evolutionary biology, and neuroscientific data.
 - Dialogues with theologians and philosophical theologians concerned with anthropology and science-theology method (e.g., Polkinghorne-style rapprochement, broadly Barthian/Reformed concerns about scriptural primacy).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (central): the nature, status, and uniqueness of the human person.
 - **Imago Dei**: reinterpreted in light of sociality, language, moral agency rather than substance dualism.
 - **Creation and providence**: how evolutionary processes and contingency relate to divine purposes for humanity.
 - **Epistemology and revelation**: how theological claims and scientific explanations inform each other.
 - Secondary attention to soteriology and Christology insofar as they presuppose a theological anthropology.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: a critically realistic, non-reductive theological anthropology that grounds human uniqueness in relational, embodied, and morally agentive humanity interpreted through the imago Dei and disciplined engagement with the sciences.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on disciplined interdisciplinarity: theology must take scientific results seriously without capitulating to scientism.
 - Prioritizes **relationality** and **embodiment** over metaphysical soul-substance models as loci of human distinctiveness.
 - Champions **epistemological pluralism** - multiple legitimate explanatory levels (neural, psychological, cultural, theological).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects classical Cartesian dualism by rejecting a detached immaterial soul as the primary explanatory token of uniqueness.
 - Counters reductive naturalism (neuro- or evolutionary reductionism) that claims theological language is obsolete.
 - Offers an alternative to both extremes: neither a retreat to pre-scientific theological claims nor an uncritical scientific monism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes terms such as **non-reductive emergence**, **disciplinary contextualism**, and **transdisciplinary hermeneutics** (theology as interpretive partner rather than competitor).
 - Reframes **imago Dei** as functional and relational rather than primarily ontological-substantive.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in theology-and-science circles as a model for constructive engagement; cited in debates over neuroscience, evolutionary anthropology, and theological method.
 - Influential among constructive Reformed and ecumenical theologians seeking to integrate science without loss of theological depth.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable methodological template for theology-science dialogue and a plausible middle way for theological anthropology in the era of cognitive science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - Reinterpreted relationally: image expressed in moral agency, sociality, and vocation rather than a separable immaterial substance.
- **Human uniqueness** - Multi-dimensional: language, reflexivity, moral responsibility, culture; defended as real but not reducible to neural states.
- **Non-reductive emergence** - Higher-level properties (personhood, agency) arise from but are not exhaustively explained by lower-level biological processes.
- **Embodiment** - Stress on bodily locatedness as constitutive of personhood; rejects disembodied soul models.
- **Agency / Moral agency** - Central marker of uniqueness; grounds theological claims about responsibility, vocation, and sin.
- **Epistemological pluralism** - Multiple legitimate explanatory frameworks (scientific, philosophical, theological) that must be integrated critically.
- **Critical realism** - Epistemic stance: scientific descriptions give real knowledge of structures without collapsing into naive realism or relativism.
- **Transdisciplinarity / Interdisciplinarity** - Methodological commitment to sustained conversation across disciplines with mutual correction and appropriation.
- **Methodological naturalism** - A working scientific constraint; theology can critique its metaphysical overreach but accept its methodological utility.
- **Narrative identity** - Human persons are constituted by story, memory, communal narratives - theological implications for sin, repentance, and redemption.
- **Theological anthropology** - Central locus of the book: synthesis of empirical findings and theological doctrine concerning human nature.
- **Relationality** - Human beings as fundamentally constituted in relation - to God, others, and creation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary, non-reductive readings of imago Dei in theological anthropology.
 - As a **polemic** against both reductionist neuroscientific accounts and naive substance dualism.
 - As a **methodological exemplar** for interdisciplinary theology - a conceptual pivot for curriculum and research programs in theology-and-science.
