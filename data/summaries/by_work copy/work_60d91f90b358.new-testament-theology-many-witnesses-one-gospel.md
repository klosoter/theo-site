### TITLE
**New Testament Theology: Many Witnesses, One Gospel** - I. Howard Marshall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2004 within late 20th/early 21st-century evangelical scholarship. Marshall writes as a conservative Anglican exegete reacting to both fragmentary historical-critical approaches and sweeping systematic reconstructions; situated among British evangelical New Testament scholars emphasizing careful exegesis and canonical reading.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament comprises a plurality of apostolic testimonies that nevertheless cohere into a single gospel of Jesus Christ; theological synthesis must respect diversity without collapsing it into artificial uniformity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Surveys the major New Testament corpora (Gospels, Acts, Pauline letters, General Epistles, Johannine literature) with attention to each author's distinct witness.
 - Identifies recurring theological nodes (Christology, atonement, resurrection, kingdom, covenant, Spirit, church, eschatology) and traces how different witnesses treat them.
 - Argues for a hermeneutic of **unity-in-diversity**: theological claims are best built on careful exegesis that recognizes particular emphases and canonical relations.
 - Applies this hermeneutic to show continuity with Israel and discontinuity inaugurated in Christ, mediated by the Spirit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary engagement with New Testament texts; dialogues implicitly with form-criticism, redaction-critical reconstructions, and scholars emphasizing either fragmentation (multiple gospels) or over-systematized unity. Resonant with conservative interlocutors like F. F. Bruce and contrasts with more radical critical voices.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Christology, atonement, resurrection, eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), covenant theology (continuity with Israel vs. new covenant), church, and **pneumatology** - the Spirit as central agent in redemptive history.
- **Closing line:** Marshall's theological center of gravity: the apostolic witness, diverse in texture but unified in proclaiming Jesus Christ - crucified, risen, and present by the Spirit - as the decisive fulfillment of God's redemptive purposes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong methodological insistence on reading each New Testament writer on his own terms while mapping legitimate theological connections across the canon.
 - Pneumatology framed not as a marginal addendum but as the connective agent that links Jesus, the church, and the redemptive-historical movement.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters overly synthetic systems that flatten apostolic diversity and also resists relativizing diversity into mere contradiction.
 - Pushes back on models that downplay continuity with Israel or treat the Spirit solely as an experiential phenomenon divorced from historical promise-fulfillment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The phrase "many witnesses, one gospel" functions as a hermeneutical rubric: diversity of testimony must be read in the light of apostolic authority and common christological center.
 - Uses the Spirit as a criterion for theological continuity: where the Spirit is operative, fulfillment and continuity with God's promises are located.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in evangelical circles for rigorous, balanced NT theology; used in seminaries as a reliable survey that avoids speculative system-building.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments of canonical cohesion and practical integrations of pneumatology with historical theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of disciplined, text-sensitive NT theology that keeps doctrine tethered to exegetical realities and treats the Spirit as central in interpreting redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Many witnesses, one gospel:** Thesis-rubric asserting plurality of apostolic voices united around Christ.
- **Canonical coherence:** The methodological aim to read NT diversity within a single canonical framework.
- **Continuity and discontinuity:** Framework for relating Israel's promises to the church's identity; continuity in promise, discontinuity in covenant form and vocation.
- **Fulfillment:** Jesus as the locus of covenantal fulfillment; not merely typological but eschatological realization.
- **New covenant:** Central organizing covenantal category; the Spirit inaugurated the covenantal age of restoration.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** Kingdom as already/not yet; resurrection and Spirit mark the inauguration.
- **Pneumatology / Spirit as Agent:** The Spirit mediates new-covenant reality - empowering witness, enabling resurrection life, guiding the church, and authenticating fulfillment.
 - Sub-note: Marshall stresses both the Spirit's historical acts (in Jesus, in Acts) and ongoing presence in the church and sacraments.
- **Christocentrism:** The interpretive center - all major NT doctrines directed to identity and work of Christ.
- **Apostolic witness:** Authority-ground for theological claims; diversity judged by apostolic testimony.
- **Resurrection:** Risen Christ as eschatological vindication; Spirit linked as life-giving power.
- **Church as community:** Product and bearer of Spirit-enabled mission; continuity with Israel's vocation reframed.
- **Inspiration / revelation:** Scripture as authoritative witness to the apostolic testimony grounded in the Spirit.
- **Historical-critical restraint:** Commitment to rigorous exegesis without capitulation to reductionist skepticism.
- **Theological synthesis by analogy:** Avoids system imposing uniformity, builds theology by analogical reading across texts.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for a responsible method in New Testament theology: unity-in-diversity model.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating pneumatology into redemptive-historical reading (Spirit as historical agent).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses contrasting fragmentary vs. canonical approaches and in discussions of continuity between Israel and the church.
 - As a restrained **polemic** against both reductionist critical reconstructions and overly schematic confessional systems.
