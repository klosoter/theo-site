### TITLE
**God and the Reach of Reason: C.S. Lewis, David Hume, and Bertrand Russell** - Gregory E. Ganssle

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Situated in late 20th / early 21st-century Anglo-American analytic philosophy of religion and Christian apologetics.
 - Addresses historical and methodological contrasts among a Christian apologist (C.S. Lewis), a canonical empiricist skeptic (David Hume), and a prominent atheist/analytical thinker (Bertrand Russell).
 - Engages contemporary debates about natural theology, evidentialism, and the epistemic limits of reason in religious belief.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Ganssle argues that reasonable, rational belief in God survives the challenges posed by skeptical empiricism (Hume) and atheist critique (Russell) when one properly diagnoses the epistemic reach and limits of reason; Lewis provides a model for how to defend theism that is philosophically substantive rather than merely rhetorical or fideistic.
 - Theodicy and divine justice are addressed as a pivotal test-case for reason's capacity to adjudicate religious claims.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Reconstructs Hume's skeptical constraints (on causation, induction, and miracles) and Russell's atheistic pronouncements about reason and metaphysics.
 - Exposes weaknesses and overreaches in Humean and Russellian dismissals of theistic claims, especially when they import their own epistemic presuppositions as neutral.
 - Presents Lewis not merely as an apologist but as offering a philosophically viable suite of responses:
 - Moral argument and conscience as evidence for God.
 - Free-will and "soul-making" style defenses against the problem of evil (theodicy).
 - The limited but real reach of reason regarding metaphysical claims (natural theology).
 - Evaluates whether Lewisian moves secure defeasible warrant for theistic belief in light of Humean skepticism and Russellian atheism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity, The Problem of Pain, Miracles), David Hume (Enquiry, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion), Bertrand Russell (Why I Am Not a Christian, various essays).
 - Secondary: contemporary analytic philosophers of religion and historiographical treatments of Lewis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Natural theology, the epistemology of religious belief, theodicy (free will and soul-making variants), miracles, moral argument, and the scope of rational justification.
 - Implicitly engages with revelation (as supplementing natural reason) and with basic doctrinal commitments regarding divine justice and human moral responsibility.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Ganssle locates the theological center of gravity in a restrained but robust Christian rationalism: reason has real, defeasible reach into theological claims (including theodicy), and Lewis exemplifies how to marshal philosophical arguments without collapsing into fideism or scientistic skepticism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats Lewis as a philosophically serious interlocutor rather than merely a popular apologist; reads Lewis through analytic standards of argument reconstruction and defeasibility.
 - Focuses the debate on *epistemic reach* rather than merely truth-claims - i.e., what reason is competent to adjudicate.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges Humean restrictions that reduce all theological claims to empirical hypotheses beyond rational warrant, showing that Hume imports contestable epistemic principles.
 - Counters Russellian dismissals by demonstrating that assertions of atheism often beg substantive epistemic questions (e.g., about moral facts and explanatory adequacy).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "restrained natural theology": a middle way that acknowledges limits but affirms rational warrant for certain theistic inferences.
 - Articulates Lewisian theodicy as part of a broader epistemic strategy rather than an isolated theological patch.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in philosophy-of-religion and apologetics curricula for rehabilitating Lewis as a resource for natural theology.
 - Influential among scholars seeking analytic readings of literary/apologetic figures.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a usable model for teaching how to align literary-apologetic material with analytic argumentation.
 - Useful as a bridge text for theologians engaging analytic epistemology and theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reach of Reason**
 - Scope of rational inquiry and what metaphysical/religious claims it can legitimately support.

- **Natural Theology**
 - Arguments for God based on reason and observed reality (causation, moral order, design).

- **Evidentialism**
 - The view that beliefs must be proportioned to evidence; critiqued when applied overly restrictively to religious belief.

- **Fideism**
 - The doctrine that faith is independent of reason; Ganssle rejects strict fideism in favor of reasoned faith.

- **Empiricism (Humean)**
 - Skeptical constraints on metaphysical inference; scrutinized for smuggling normative epistemic assumptions.

- **Russellian Atheism**
 - A principled, often polemical rejection of religious belief grounded in analytic clarity and empirical commitments.

- **Theodicy**
 - Defense of divine goodness and justice given evil; treated via free-will defenses and Lewisian "soul-making" motifs.

- **Free-Will Defense**
 - Evil as consequence of creaturely freedom; used to preserve divine justice and responsibility.

- **Soul-Making Theodicy**
 - Suffering as formation for moral/spiritual development (Lewisian emphasis).

- **Moral Argument**
 - Conscience and moral facts as pointers to the divine.

- **Miracles**
 - Humean appraisal and Lewisian counter-arguments about credibility and metaphysical possibility.

- **Defeasible Warrant**
 - Epistemic status of theistic claims as rational but revisable in light of new reasons.

- **Analytic Reading**
 - Methodology of reconstructing arguments from literary/apologetic texts into formal philosophical dialectic.

- **Restrained Natural Theology**
 - A middle path: affirming rational support for theism without scientistic claims to total proof.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for reading Lewis as a philosophically competent apologist and for defining "reach of reason."
 - As a **polemic** against Humean and Russellian reductions of religious epistemology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating literary apologetics with analytic argumentation in teaching theodicy and natural theology.
