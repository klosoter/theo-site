### TITLE
Charles Hodge, Commentary on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 15)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 1857, Old School Princeton, confessional Presbyterian Calvinism; grammatical-historical exegesis under common-sense realism; resisting both rationalist criticism and revivalist enthusiasm.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate Pauls apostolic teaching on the churchs order and hope: gifts of the Spirit properly regulated, sacraments rightly used, and the bodily resurrection as indispensable to the gospel.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Sequential commentary with doctrinal syntheses at key nodes.
 - Chs. 12-14: nature and regulation of charismata; unity of the body; love as the supreme rule.
 - Ch. 11: the Supper as spiritual communion; necessity of discipline and discernment of the body.
 - Ch. 15: the gospel tradition, resurrection of Christ as firstfruits, entailments if there is no resurrection, order of resurrection, nature of the resurrection body, consummation and the Sons mediatorial subjection.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Augustine, Chrysostom, Calvin, Turretin.
 - Critically: De Wette, Meyer, Neander; Socinians/Unitarians; Roman Catholic sacramentalism; perfectionist and enthusiastic readings of the gifts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (apostolic authority; tradition delivered).
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit-baptism, gifts, edification).
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments** (unity, discipline, Supper).
 - **Covenant Theology** (Adam-Christ federal headship, imputation).
 - **Christology** (resurrection, mediatorial kingship).
 - **Anthropology/Creation** (body-soul integrity; natural vs spiritual body).
 - **Eschatology** (bodily resurrection; final victory over death).
- **Closing line**
 - The risen Christ, the last Adam and firstfruits, by the Spirit forms one disciplined body now and guarantees the glorified, Spirit-governed body then.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Spiritual body** means Spirit-dominated, not immaterial; continuity with transformation.
 - **Federal reading of 1 Cor 15**: in Adam/in Christ as covenantal heads; denial that the passage teaches universal salvation.
 - **Spirit-baptism (12:13)** as initiation common to all believers, not a second-blessing crisis.
 - **Cessationist tilt**: extraordinary gifts temporary; tongues as real languages, subordinate to intelligible edification.
 - **Mediatorial subjection (15:24-28)**: the Son delivers the kingdom economically; no ontological inferiority.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **rationalism**: affirms miracle, prophecy, and resurrection as historical.
 - Against **enthusiasm**: insists on order, intelligibility, and church oversight of gifts.
 - Against **sacramentalism**: rejects transubstantiation/consubstantiation; asserts spiritual presence and fencing of the table.
 - Against **vicarious baptism**: 15:29 is ad hominem reasoning from a practice or from the churches baptismal hope, not apostolic sanction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies **psychikos/pneumatikos** as modes of life-principle (soul vs Spirit), shaping anthropology and eschatology.
 - Leverages **firstfruits** covenantally, tying Christology to corporate eschatology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard Old Princeton exemplar; widely cited in Reformed discussions of gifts, sacraments, and resurrection; a stabilizing voice in debates on Spirit-baptism and the nature of the resurrection body.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of doctrinally alert exegesis; offers clear categories that travel across loci and classroom contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Firstfruits**: Christs resurrection as the representative, causative pledge of the harvest of believers.
- **Last Adam**: federal head whose obedience and life reverse Adams ruin; grounds imputation and union.
- **Life-giving Spirit**: the risen Christ communicates resurrection-life by the Spirit.
- **Spiritual body**: glorified body enlivened and governed by the Holy Spirit; not ethereal or non-bodily.
- **Natural (psychikos) body**: present embodied life under the soul-principle, perishable and dishonored by sin.
- **Baptized in one Spirit (12:13)**: the Spirits unitive work incorporating all believers into one body at conversion.
- **Tongues**: extraordinary linguistic gift; intelligibility required; inferior to prophecy for edification.
- **Prophecy**: intelligible, edifying speech under the Spirit; norm of congregational upbuilding.
- **Cessation of extraordinary gifts**: apostolic-era credentials cease, ordinary operations of the Spirit continue.
- **Discern the body (11:29)**: recognize Christs body in the Supper and the church; basis for discipline and self-examination.
- **Subjection of the Son (15:28)**: economic, mediatorial ordering at consummation; safeguards Trinitarian equality.
- **Death, last enemy**: personal, penal power destroyed at resurrection; not a friend or mere process.
- **Baptism for the dead (15:29)**: not approved vicarious rite; rhetorical appeal to practice or hope inconsistent without resurrection.
- **Order of resurrection**: Christ the firstfruits, then those who are His, then the end; frames eschatological sequence.
- **Analogy of faith**: Scripture interprets Scripture; doctrinal coherence constrains exegesis.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a doctrinal anchor for the resurrection body and Adam-Christ federalism in eschatology and covenant theology.
 - As a polemical source against second-blessing pneumatology and continuationist claims.
 - As an exegetical model for sacramental practice and church discipline grounded in 1 Cor 10-11.
 - As a conceptual pivot clarifying economic subordination and Trinitarian orthodoxy from 1 Cor 15.
