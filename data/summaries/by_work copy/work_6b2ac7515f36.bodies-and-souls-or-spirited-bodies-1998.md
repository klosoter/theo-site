### TITLE
Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies? (1998) - Nancey Murphy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Late-20th-century dialogue between Christian theology and philosophy of mind; rising engagement with neuroscience and cognitive science; growing evangelical interest in reconciling orthodox anthropology with naturalistic science. Murphy writes from a broadly evangelical/academic theological position sympathetic to naturalistic resources.
- **Central thesis:** Traditional Cartesian substance dualism is theologically and scientifically untenable; a **psychosomatic unity** described as a "spirited body" (an embodied person with capacities oriented toward God) better preserves biblical anthropology, doctrine of resurrection, and coherence with contemporary science.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critiques classical soul-body dualism on biblical, philosophical, and empirical grounds.
 - Adopts **nonreductive physicalism / emergentism**: mental/psychological properties depend on but are not reducible to physical properties.
 - Reinterprets "soul" and "spirit" as relational, functional, or capacitive descriptors of the whole person rather than as an immaterial substance separable from the body.
 - Argues that personal identity and moral responsibility remain intelligible under psychosomatic unity, and that Christian hopes (immortality, resurrection) are best understood eschatologically (divine resurrection/transformation) rather than as innate immortality of an immaterial soul.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical sources (Scripture, Augustine and medieval soul-talk), Cartesian/modern dualists (Descartes, contemporary substance dualists), and contemporary philosophy of mind and neuroscience (emergentist and nonreductive voices).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christian anthropology, resurrection and eschatology, salvation (soteriology insofar as it presumes a view of the person), and implications for imago Dei and moral agency; also touches on hermeneutics of soul-language in Scripture.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** A theologically responsible anthropology affirms that humans are **embodied, psychosomatic persons** whose "soul" and "spirit" language names capacities and relations of the whole person, and whose ultimate survival and flourishing are grounded in divine resurrection/transformation rather than in a separable immaterial substance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Coining and arguing for the "spirited body" idiom: keeps spiritual language while denying separable soul-substance.
 - Firm integration of nonreductive physicalist philosophy of mind with orthodox Christian commitments.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects classical dualism for creating theological problems (e.g., problematic immortality, denigration of embodied life, difficulties for resurrection).
 - Contrasts with reductive materialism by retaining genuine mental/folk-psychological realities (agency, consciousness, intentionality).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Treats "soul" and "spirit" as **capacity/relational terms** rather than as ontological categories.
 - Frames eschatological hope as divine action (resurrection/transformation) rather than as simple continuation of an immaterial substratum.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among evangelicals and theologians seeking science-theology integration; frequently cited in debates on Christian naturalism and the doctrine of human nature.
 - Criticized by substance dualists who argue it undermines personal survival or weakens traditional notions of immortality; also debated by philosophers over details of emergentism and mental causation.
- **Enduring value for study/teaching:**
 - Offers a teachable model for integrating biblical exegesis, doctrinal fidelity, and current philosophy of mind.
 - Serves as a bridge for students learning to read theological anthropology against scientific critiques.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity:** The core claim that persons are integrated embodied organisms; mind and body are not separable substances.
- **Spirited body:** Murphy's evocative phrase: an embodied human whose "spirit" names relational and orientational capacities toward God, not an immaterial soul.
- **Nonreductive physicalism:** The view adopted-mental properties depend on the physical but are not reducible to physical descriptions.
- **Emergentism:** Mental/psychological properties emerge from complex physical systems (the brain/body) and can have novel causal powers.
- **Soul-language (functional/relational reading):** Interprets biblical "soul" (psyche/nefesh) as referring to life, relationality, personhood, or capacities rather than to a separable immaterial substance.
- **Personal identity (under psychosomatic unity):** Continuity of the whole embodied organism plus psychological continuity, rather than identity of an immaterial soul.
- **Resurrection/transformation (eschatological continuity):** Christian hope framed as God recreating or transforming embodied persons; continuity is grounded in divine action, not in an immortal substratum.
- **Imago Dei (embodied image):** The divine image is instantiated in embodied relational capacities and persons, not in an immaterial ghost inhabiting a body.
- **Mental causation:** Defense that emergent mental properties can be causally efficacious without violating physical dependence.
- **Anti-Cartesianism:** Systematic rejection of Descartes' mind-body substance dualism.
- **Scriptural hermeneutics of anthropology:** Use of biblical language to justify capacital/relational readings of "soul" and "spirit."
- **Moral responsibility & agency:** Argued to be intact under a psychosomatic account because persons are unified agents.
- **Theological naturalism (qualified):** Use of naturalistic resources for theology while retaining supernatural hope (resurrection).
- **Embodiment (theological significance):** Body as constitutive of personhood and locus of sanctification, vocation, and eschatological redemption.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for psychosomatic unity and "spirited body" formulations in systematic anthropology.
 - As a **polemic** against both Cartesian dualism and reductive materialism in theology-of-human-nature debates.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating philosophy of mind (emergentism) with doctrinal commitments about resurrection and the imago Dei.
