### TITLE
Chosen by God (R. C. Sproul, 1986)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Published during the late-20th-century resurgence of confessional Reformed theology in North American evangelicalism. Sproul writes as pastor-theologian within the Presbyterian/Reformed tradition, addressing popular misconceptions about predestination amid widespread Arminian influence.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** The doctrine of **unconditional election** is the biblical explanation for why some are saved; human beings, owing to **total depravity and total inability**, cannot choose God apart from sovereign, effectual divine choice.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of biblical texts (esp. Romans, Ephesians, John 6, and selected Pauline passages) that speak to election and divine initiative.
 - Historical-theological defense: tracing Augustine, Calvin, the Reformation consensus, and rebutting Arminian and semi-Pelagian readings.
 - Philosophical-theological clarification: analysis of freedom, responsibility, and the will (compatibilist framework) to show how divine sovereignty and human accountability coexist.
 - Pastoral and practical implications: the comfort and motivation of assurance, evangelism, and the justice of God in election.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and Calvin as primary historical allies; Jacob Arminius and later Arminian/Wesleyan proponents as primary interlocutors; also engages semi-Pelagians, modern evangelical critiques, and some contemporary philosophers on free will.
- **Doctrines treated:** Election (unconditional), reprobation (as corollary), human sinfulness (total depravity), human inability to effect saving faith (total inability), grace (efficacious vs. merely sufficient), freedom of the will (compatibilist account), divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity: **salvation is initiated and secured by God's sovereign choice because fallen human beings are morally and spiritually incapable of choosing God apart from sovereign, efficacious grace.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Clear coupling of **total depravity** and **total inability**: Sproul insists the problem is not mere intellectual ignorance but a moral/spiritual incapacity to believe.
 - Use of a robust **compatibilist** account of freedom: humans act according to their desires but those desires are bound by sin unless sovereignly renewed.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Arminian appeals to "free will" by distinguishing libertarian freedom from biblical freedom; critiques prevenient-grace models that claim ability is restored prior to saving faith.
 - Balances against hyper-Calvinist indifference: insists on active evangelism and universal proclamation despite affirmation of unconditional election.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes accessible language for complex categories (e.g., "total inability" as a pastoral-soteriological claim rather than an abstract metaphysical one).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential among late-20th and early-21st century Reformed evangelicals - became a staple for catechesis on election.
 - Criticized by Arminian and some evangelical scholars as deterministic; praised for pastoral clarity and apologetic force.
- **Enduring value:** A concise, readable bridge between academic Reformed theology and pastoral instruction; invaluable for teaching election, explicating human inability, and defending compatibilist freedom.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Unconditional election:** God's choosing of some to salvation based on His sovereign will, not foreseen faith or merit.
- **Total depravity:** The doctrine that sin has corrupted every aspect of human nature, rendering people unable to come to God in saving faith on their own.
- **Total inability:** The practical consequence of depravity - humans lack the moral/spiritual capacity to choose God without divine regeneration.
- **Bondage of the will:** The concept that the will is bound to sin and therefore not free in the libertarian sense to choose God.
- **Compatibilist freedom:** The view endorsed by Sproul that human choices are free when they flow from the agent's desires, even though those desires are themselves shaped by nature or grace.
- **Unmerited grace / unconditionality:** Emphasis that salvation is gratuitous and not conditioned on human foreseen acts.
- **Efficacious grace (effectual calling):** Grace that accomplishes what it intends - the divine work that results in regeneration and faith (distinct from merely sufficient grace).
- **Reprobation:** The negative corollary to election; God's just passing over some in judgment - treated as coherent with divine justice.
- **Prevenient grace (rejected in Sproul's framing):** The Arminian notion of grace that restores the ability to respond prior to regeneration - Sproul argues it undermines total inability and divine sovereignty.
- **Divine sovereignty vs. human responsibility:** Sproul's consistent formula: both true without contradiction, explicable via compatibilism.
- **Pastoral assurance:** Election as the ground for believer confidence, not license for complacency.
- **Scriptural loci used:** Romans (esp. 9), Ephesians, John 6, and Pauline theology as exegetical centers.
- **How the work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for teaching unconditional election and total inability in classroom and church settings.
 - As a **polemic** in debates with Arminian/Wesleyan positions - commonly cited to rebut prevenient grace claims.
 - As an **exegetical model**: a compact exemplar of reading Romans/Ephesians with theological coherence and pastoral sensitivity.
