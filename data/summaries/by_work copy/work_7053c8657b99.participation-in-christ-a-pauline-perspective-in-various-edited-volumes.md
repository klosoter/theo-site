### TITLE
Participation in Christ: A Pauline Perspective - Grant Macaskill

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Pauline scholarship within the last two decades; contributions appear in edited volumes on "Union with Christ" and Pauline theology.
 - Located at the intersection of historical-critical exegesis, Reformed covenantal theology, and the so-called "union with Christ" revival among evangelical and academic audiences.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's language of participation and being "in Christ" is best understood as **covenantal incorporation**: believers are placed into the Messiah's historical reality (his death, resurrection, and vindication) so that justification, sanctification and eschatological status are grounded in that participatory union.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrate that Pauline prepositional and participatory language (e.g., "in Christ", "participation in his death") coheres with Jewish-covenantal categories and early Christian ritual practice (notably baptism).
 - Read texts (Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians, Philippians) to show a multi-dimensional union: legal/forensic, ontological, ethical and eschatological.
 - Argue that the Spirit and baptism function as the mediating realities by which this incorporation is effected and signified.
 - Conclude that a robust theology of union must integrate exegesis, covenantal-historical categories, and pneumatology rather than reduce union to a single doctrinal locus.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with contemporary Pauline scholars and traditions: N.T. Wright, John Barclay, Michael Gorman, as well as Reformed interpreters who emphasize federal headship and covenant (broadly speaking).
 - Draws on exegetical work in Second Temple Jewish literature, baptismal theology, and patristic echoes of participatory motifs.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (Messiah as basis for incorporation), Pneumatology (Spirit as agent of union), Covenant theology (representative headship and incorporation), Soteriology (justification, sanctification, eschatology), Sacramentology (baptism as participatory sign).
- **Closing line**
 - **The theological center of gravity:** Pauline "participation in Christ" is primarily covenantal incorporation-an ontological and relational placing of believers into the Messiah's death-resurrection reality, mediated by Spirit and baptism and bearing simultaneous forensic, ethical, and eschatological consequences.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the *covenantal-historical* matrix for "in Christ" language rather than treating it as only mystical spirituality or merely forensic status.
 - Emphasizes the **mediating role of baptism and the Spirit** - not merely metaphorical language but ecclesial and sacramental realities that effect incorporation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on accounts that overly spiritualize union (making it primarily mystical) or that reduce it to forensic justification alone.
 - Integrates New Perspective insights about covenantal language while retaining classical concerns about representation and objective status in Christ.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions among related participatory phrases (e.g., "in Christ," "with Christ," "partake/participate") and maps them onto covenantal categories (headship, incorporation, membership).
 - Frames union as inherently multi-modal: **legal-positional**, **ontological/relational**, **sacramental**, and **eschatological** - a schema helpful for systematic retrieval.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited widely in contemporary discussions of union with Christ within Reformed and evangelical scholarship; used to bridge exegetical studies and systematic theology.
 - Valued by those seeking a measured corrective to both reductionist forensic accounts and unchecked experiential mysticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for reading Pauline soteriology as ecclesial and covenantal; useful for sermonizing baptism, teaching union, and grounding pastoral assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Participation (methexis/ koinonia language)** - central Pauline category; denotes sharing in the Messiah's life, death, and vindication.
- **Union with Christ / "in Christ" (en Christō)** - shorthand for covenantal incorporation that structures Pauline identity and status.
- **Incorporation** - the act/result of being constituted a member of Christ's body; the work of representation and headship.
- **Representation / Federal headship** - Christ as corporate head; believers receive status through his representative action.
- **Baptism** - sacramental sign and means of being placed into the death-resurrection reality of Christ.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit as agent)** - Spirit effects and sustains the believer's participation and ongoing union.
- **Justification (forensic dimension)** - one consequence of union; status before God grounded in Christ's act but mediated by incorporation.
- **Sanctification (ethical dimension)** - the transformed life as the outworking of participatory union.
- **Eschatology (already/not-yet)** - union locates believers in the inaugurated eschatological reality of Messiah.
- **Messiah / Christology** - Christ's person and work provide the objective reality into which believers are incorporated.
- **Sacramental realism** - the tendency to read baptism and ecclesial practice as real mediators, not mere symbols.
- **Covenant language** - frames Pauline participation in terms of covenantal belonging and covenantal status.
- **"With Christ" vs "In Christ"** - discriminates relational shades: experiential accompaniment ("with") vs ontological placement ("in").
- **Scriptural-exegetical model** - Macaskill's close reading of Pauline texts supplies the exegetical backbone for systematic claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for "union with Christ" that emphasizes covenantal incorporation.
 - As a **polemic** against forensic-only or purely mystical models of union.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline 'in Christ' texts with attention to ritual (baptism) and pneumatological mediation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology, sacrament practice, and Pauline soteriology in teaching and systematics.
