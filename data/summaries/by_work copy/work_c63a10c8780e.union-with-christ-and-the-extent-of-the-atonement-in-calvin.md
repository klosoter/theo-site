### TITLE
**Union with Christ and the Extent of the Atonement in Calvin - Kevin D. Kennedy**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Modern historical-theological study situated in recent debates over the extent of the atonement within Reformed theology. Engages primary texts from the sixteenth century (John Calvin's Institutes, commentaries, sermons) and the secondary scholarly conversation about Calvin's soteriology and covenant theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Kennedy contends that for Calvin the doctrine of **union with Christ** is the decisive hermeneutical and theological key to understanding the **extent** (scope and application) of the atonement. Rather than reducing Calvin to a simple "limited/unlimited" binary, Kennedy argues Calvin maintains a complex distinction between the universal sufficiency of Christ's work and its particular efficacy grounded in covenantal-union realities.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Maps Calvin's use of union-language (federal, mystical, corporative) across Institutes, commentaries, and sermons. 
 - Shows how Calvin links Christ's mediatorial offices (prophet, priest, king) to the believer's participation in justification, sanctification, and adoption via union. 
 - Distinguishes Calvin's repeated claims of universal sufficiency (Christ's death is sufficient for all) from his insistence that Christ's efficacious redeeming work is **for the elect** - a particularity explained by union and election rather than by an abstractly limited satisfaction. 
 - Reconstructs Calvin's logic: atonement is objectively real in Christ (sufficient), offered and applied by the Spirit within covenant-union (efficacious for those united to Christ).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries, sermons). 
 - Secondary/contextual: Reformation covenantal theology generally; contrasts with later scholastic formulations and with Amyrautian hypothetical universalism; dialogues implicitly with contemporary interpreters of limited atonement.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Union with Christ (federal and mystical) 
 - Extent and efficacy of the atonement (sufficiency vs efficacy) 
 - Election and covenant of redemption / covenant of grace 
 - Imputation, justification, sanctification, Christology (mediatorial offices)

- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** 
 Kennedy locates Calvin's particularity of redemption not in a rationed satisfaction but in the covenantal, Spirit-wrought union by which Christ's universally sufficient merits become efficacious for those personally united to him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Elevates **union with Christ** from a pastoral motif to the central explanatory principle for Calvin's doctrine of atonement extent. 
 - Emphasizes relational/covenantal mechanics (union, Spirit application) over abstract juridical limitation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against readings that portray Calvin as either a proto-scholastic limited-atoner (simple particularism) or as an Amyraldian universalist. Instead presents Calvin as holding **universal sufficiency + particular efficacy** with union as the mediating theological category.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clarifies and systematizes Calvin's multiple senses of "union" (federal/representative, mystical/participatory, legal/forensic) and shows how they function together to explain atonement scope.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Useful to scholars arguing for a nuanced Calvinian position on atonement; often cited in debates over "limited atonement" and in studies linking Christology to soteriology. Gains traction among those seeking to retain both Calvinian particularity and pastoral universality language.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models careful textual exegesis tied to systematic retrieval. 
 - Provides a hermeneutical corrective to reductionist readings of Calvin and a template for integrating historical theology with contemporary polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - The central category; for Kennedy, the locus where sufficiency becomes efficacy. 
 - **Federal union** - Christ as representative head; legal imputation. 
 - **Mystical/participatory union** - Spirit-wrought incorporation; actual sharing in Christ's life.

- **Extent of the atonement** - Scope of Christ's redeeming work (who it was intended for and who it accomplishes salvation for).

- **Sufficiency vs. efficacy** - Distinction Calvin uses and Kennedy refines: Christ's death is sufficient for all, efficacious for the elect via union.

- **Particular redemption / Definite atonement** - The particularity of effect (salvation of the elect), explained relationally rather than by a narrowly limited satisfaction.

- **Universal provision (or universal offer)** - Calvin's language that Christ's work is offered to all and is sufficient for all, understood by Kennedy within covenantal proclamation and Spirit application.

- **Imputation** - Legal crediting of Christ's righteousness to believers through union; central to justification.

- **Covenant of redemption / Covenant of grace** - The intra-Trinitarian agreement and historical administration that frames Christ's mediatorial work and the promise/appliance of salvation.

- **Christus mediátor (mediatorial offices)** - Christ's priestly, kingly, prophetic roles tied to union and application of atonement.

- **Hypothetical universalism (Amyraldianism)** - Contrasted as a rival structure; Kennedy shows Calvin does not adopt Amyraut's logic though he uses universal language differently.

- **Double imputation** - Sinner's sins imputed to Christ and Christ's righteousness imputed to the believer via union - explanatory for Calvin's forensic soteriology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Calvinian model that unifies federal and mystical dimensions of union in explaining atonement scope. 
- As a **polemic resource** in contemporary debates-used to critique both simplistic "limited" and "universal" labels. 
- As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating how close reading of Calvin's texts can revise received doctrinal categories and reframe soteriological disputes.
