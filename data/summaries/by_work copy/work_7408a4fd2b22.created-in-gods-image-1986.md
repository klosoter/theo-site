### TITLE
**Created in God's Image (1986) - Anthony A. Hoekema** 
A Reformed, biblico-theological anthropology grounding dignity, sin, redemption, and consummation in the imago Dei as renewed in Christ.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1986, in the wake of 20th-c. debates on the imago Dei (Barth/Brunner) and evangelical engagement with secular psychological views of the self.
 - Stands within Dutch Reformed/neo-Calvinist currents (Calvin, Bavinck, Kuyper; mediated through Berkouwer), complementing Hoekema's works on eschatology and soteriology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The image of God is a whole-person reality that persists after the fall yet is radically corrupted; salvation renews that image in union with Christ and culminates eschatologically in glorification on the new earth.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Definition and scope of imago Dei**: rejects reductionism; argues both a broad sense (humanity as God-related personhood with capacities and calling) and a narrower, moral-ethical aspect (knowledge, righteousness, holiness).
 - **Creation and vocation**: cultural mandate (Gen 1:26-28) frames human dominion, work, and community; humans are psychosomatic unities, not trichotomous parts.
 - **Sin and its effects**: imago not annihilated but pervasively distorted; total depravity is corruption of every faculty, not loss of humanity.
 - **Common grace and restraint**: God preserves human structures and enables civic goods despite sinful direction.
 - **Christ the Image and redemption**: Christ is the true image; in union with him believers are being renewed (Eph 4:24; Col 3:10), moving toward conformity to Christ.
 - **Sanctification and ethics**: the Christian life is progressive image-renewal in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, embodied in community and vocation.
 - **Eschatological consummation**: restoration consummates in resurrection glory and the new earth; anthropology is teleologically ordered to that end.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Calvin, Bavinck, Berkouwer; interacts critically with Barth and Brunner on relational views; contrasts Roman Catholic donum superadditum; assesses modern psychologies and secular humanisms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence; anthropology (imago, body-soul, vocation); hamartiology (fall, total depravity); soteriology (union with Christ, sanctification); Christology (Christ as image); common grace; eschatology (resurrection, new earth); covenant contours throughout.
- **Closing line**
 - The imago Dei, centered in and restored by Christ, unites creation, redemption, and consummation, giving a single, coherent anthropology for faith and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Whole-person imago**: structural, functional, and relational aspects held together.
 - **Broad/narrow sense**: image retained broadly post-fall; narrower moral likeness marred and being renewed in Christ.
 - **Psychosomatic unity**: rejects trichotomy; affirms body-soul duality within holistic unity.
 - **Creation-to-consummation arc**: anthropology is inherently eschatological; new earth central.
 - **Common grace/structure-direction** distinction to explain human dignity amid pervasive sin.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Barth's almost exclusively relational account; insists on structural and functional dimensions.
 - Against Roman Catholic donum superadditum that divides nature and grace; righteousness integral to creational design.
 - Against secular reductions (materialism, behaviorism, Freudianism) and overinflated self-esteem movements; for a grace-formed, Christic self-understanding.
 - Clarifies total vs utter depravity; image damaged, not destroyed.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Consolidates Reformed categories (broad/narrow imago; knowledge-righteousness-holiness triad) with neo-Calvinist structure/direction and cultural mandate in a single frame.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard evangelical-Reformed text on anthropology; widely cited across loci (sin, salvation, eschatology, ethics).
 - Its balanced critique of Barth and retrieval of classic Reformed anthropology shaped late-20th-c. discussions of dignity, vocation, and the self.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear exegetical anchors (Gen 1-2; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10; Rom 8).
 - Pedagogically useful schema linking creation, fall, redemption, and glory.
 - Pastoral traction for identity, work, embodiment, and community ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**: the whole-human likeness and vocation to represent God.
 - Broad sense: structural capacities and personhood retained after the fall.
 - Narrow sense: moral likeness (knowledge, righteousness, holiness) renewed in Christ.
- **Structural-functional-relational**: three inseparable aspects of the image; being, doing, and communion.
- **Cultural mandate (dominion)**: creational calling to fill, rule, and cultivate the earth under God.
- **Psychosomatic unity**: humans as embodied souls; rejects trichotomy; honors bodily and spiritual dimensions.
- **Original righteousness**: creational moral integrity; corrupted, not annihilated, by sin.
- **Total depravity (not utter)**: pervasive corruption affecting all faculties without erasing the image.
- **Common grace**: divine restraint and enablement preserving human goods and culture despite sin.
- **Structure vs direction**: stable creational givens (structure) versus moral-spiritual orientation (direction).
- **Christ the True Image**: the archetype and goal of human renewal; pattern for sanctification.
- **Union with Christ**: soteriological bond by which the image is restored and conformed to Christ.
- **Knowledge-righteousness-holiness**: Eph 4:24/Col 3:10 triad marking image-renewal.
- **New self/new man**: sanctified identity replacing the old, aligning with Christ's image.
- **Glorification/new earth**: eschatological completion of the image and human vocation in a renewed creation.
- **Person-in-community**: the image expressed corporately (male-female, church, society), not merely individualistically.
- **Self-image under grace**: humility and dignity grounded in creation and redemption, not autonomy.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for the imago Dei and human dignity in creation and ethics.
 - As a polemic against reductionist anthropologies (Barthian, trichotomist, secular).
 - As an exegetical model for Gen 1-2, Eph 4:24, Col 3:10 tied to Rom 8 and new-creation hope.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking hamartiology, sanctification, vocation, and eschatology in a creation-fall-redemption-consummation frame.
