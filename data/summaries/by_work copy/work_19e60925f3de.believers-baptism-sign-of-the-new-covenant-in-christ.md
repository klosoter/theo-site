### TITLE
Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ - Thomas R. Schreiner & Shawn D. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed milieu (early 21st century). Product of renewed debate within Reformed and Baptist circles over covenant theology and sacramental practice.
 - Authors: Thomas R. Schreiner (New Testament scholar, broadly Reformed evangelical) and Shawn D. Wright (Baptist theologian). A corrective from a credobaptist angle to prevailing paedobaptist readings within some Reformed scholarship.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Baptism is the sign of the New Covenant given to believers in Christ, not a sacramental sign for infants.** Inclusion in the covenant community in the new era requires faith and regeneration; therefore the proper recipients of baptism are professing believers.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical work on key NT passages (especially Pauline texts: Romans 6; Colossians 2; 1 Corinthians; and Acts household lists) to show baptism functions as union with Christ, public profession, and sign of covenantal participation for believers.
 - Historical-theological survey of circumcision-baptism typology: acknowledges continuity in God's covenant purpose but denies functional continuity that would make baptism an infant sign analogous to circumcision.
 - Theological synthesis arguing New Covenant realities (internal, mediated by the Spirit) transform how signs operate: the sign (baptism) presupposes inner reality (faith/regeneration).
 - Polemical engagement with paedobaptist claims that household baptisms and Abrahamic covenant promises ground infant baptism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broad traditions: classical Reformed paedobaptist sources (confessional standards and major Reformed theologians) and contemporary paedobaptist defenders; substantial use of New Testament exegesis and Pauline theology.
 - Dialogues with covenant theology frameworks that emphasize covenantal continuity between old and new covenants.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, sacraments (signs and seals), ecclesiology (membership and boundaries), soteriology (faith and regeneration), pneumatology (Spirit-work as internalizing the covenant), Christology (union with Christ), and biblical authority/exegesis.
- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner & Wright center baptism within the New Covenant as the outward sign corresponding to inward faith and regeneration: baptism marks entrance into covenant community only for those who have received Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong exegetical focus on the New Testament witness to baptism as union with Christ and as inherently linked to professed faith and newness of life.
 - Emphasizes **ontological priority of the Spirit-work/new covenant reality** over ritual inclusion: signs are grounded in realized covenantal renewal, not merely familial lineage.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges typical paedobaptist readings that treat baptism as a direct successor to infant circumcision; argues continuity is theological but not functional with respect to sign administration.
 - Reframes household baptisms as ambiguous and not decisive proof for infant baptism-urges reading them in light of conversion narratives and the NT's faith-regeneration nexus.
- **Terminological or conceptual moves**
 - Clarifies "sign of the New Covenant" language to mean a sign that presupposes internal covenant membership (faith/Spirit) rather than a marker that creates or assumes external familial inclusion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used within Baptist and evangelical Reformed circles as a concise theological and exegetical defense of credobaptism.
 - Provoked clarifying responses from paedobaptist scholars; used in academic and parish debates about covenant inclusion and baptismal practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for its accessible but careful NT exegesis married to systematic concerns; useful as a teaching text for pastors, students, and those navigating baptistic/covenantal debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Believer's baptism (credobaptism)** - Baptism administered to professing believers as sign of their union with Christ and entry into the New Covenant community.
- **Paedobaptism** - Infant baptism; the book's principal foil and target of exegetical/theological critique.
- **New Covenant** - Central canonical framework: fulfilled in Christ, internalized by the Spirit; the covenant whose sign is baptism (for believers).
- **Sign and seal** - Sacramental language: baptism as the sign pointing to an inward reality (faith/regeneration) and as a seal of promise to the recipient.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology** - Historical typological link; authors allow continuity of promise but deny automatic transfer of infant sign-function from circumcision to baptism.
- **Union with Christ** - The theological locus linking baptism to justification, sanctification, and newness of life; baptism symbolizes and publicly declares this union.
- **Household baptisms (Acts)** - Scriptural data scrutinized; authors argue contexts often indicate believing households or narrative reasons that do not establish infant baptism as normative.
- **Covenant continuity vs discontinuity** - Distinction: continuity of divine purpose but discontinuity regarding sign administration (i.e., who receives the sign).
- **Regeneration / Faith** - Internal prerequisites or corollaries for being a proper recipient of the New Covenant sign.
- **Ecclesial boundary marker** - Baptism functions as membership marker, but only where the subject possesses covenantal faith.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - The book resists a purely automatic efficacy for baptism; efficacy is tied to Christ's promise and the Spirit's work.
- **Mode & subjects** - Secondary discussion: mode less decisive; subjectivity (believer vs infant) is primary.
- **Public profession** - Emphasized as a pastoral and ecclesial function of baptism.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional source** for credobaptist theory of baptism as New Covenant sign.
- As a **polemic** against paedobaptist readings within covenant theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline baptism texts in systematic argumentation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and debates linking covenant theology and sacramental practice.
