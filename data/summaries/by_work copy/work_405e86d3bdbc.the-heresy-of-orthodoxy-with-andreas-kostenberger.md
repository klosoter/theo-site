### TITLE
The Heresy of Orthodoxy (with Andreas Köstenberger) - Michael J. Kruger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical and academic milieu concerned with boundaries of Christian belief: debates over scriptural authority, ecumenical rapprochement, and the role of historical tradition in defining orthodoxy.
 - Responds to pressures from both liberal accommodation and ecclesial claims (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some confessional trajectories) that privilege tradition or institutional formulations alongside or above the biblical canon.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - What appears as settled "orthodoxy" can become a form of heresy when it substitutes human tradition, ecclesial authority, or non-apostolic readings for the apostolic faith preserved in the canonical Scriptures.
 - The decisive norm for Christian truth must remain the apostolic canon; otherwise orthodoxy risks losing contact with the apostolic gospel.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: identifies modern patterns where institutional orthodoxy departs from apostolic teaching (doctrinal accommodation, ritualism, or interpretive shifts).
 - Normative claim: defends the canonical Scriptures as the final arbiter of doctrine and the corrective to corrupting tendencies within confessional or institutional traditions.
 - Historical-theological support: marshals patristic testimony, Reformational loci, and contemporary theological critique to show how canon and apostolicity functioned as boundary-markers historically.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial application: urges churches to restore a canon-centered identity that resists both liberal revisionism and uncritical deference to non-apostolic tradition.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic authors invoked to show early appeals to apostolic faith and rule of faith.
 - Reformers (implicitly and explicitly) as allies in asserting Scripture's primacy against tradition that usurps Scripture.
 - Contemporary theologians and ecclesial positions as interlocutors-both those critiqued for elevating tradition and those advocating for canonical centrality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority (primacy of Scripture)
 - Canon and apostolicity (what constitutes the rule of faith)
 - Ecclesiology (role of church tradition, authority structures)
 - Implicitly touches on Christology and soteriology insofar as they are protected by canonical boundaries

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers the canonical apostolic witness as the decisive norm: true orthodoxy is not institutional conformity but fidelity to the apostolic canon that guards the gospel against latent heresies cloaked as tradition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes the danger facing the church: not only heresy from outside but heresy arising from a self-described orthodoxy that has drifted from apostolic Scripture.
 - Prioritizes the canon as corrective over creeds or ecclesial tradition when tensions arise.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects forms of Roman Catholic and some Orthodox apologetics that treat Tradition as co-authoritative with Scripture by insisting on canonical finality.
 - Contrasts with liberal theology by refusing to adapt doctrine to cultural or moral currents that contradict apostolic witness.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - The oxymoronic phrase **"heresy of orthodoxy"** serves as a diagnostic category: institutional or confessional forms that preserve the shape of orthodoxy while betraying its substance.
 - Treats the canon not merely as a list but as the *hermeneutical lens* through which authentic orthodoxy is discerned.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked conversation in evangelical circles about boundary maintenance and the relation of Scripture and tradition.
 - Used by canon scholars and pastors as a clarion call for apostolic fidelity; critiqued by some for polemical tone against broader historical traditions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a compact corrective for pastors, teachers, and students wrestling with questions of authority and identity.
 - Clarifies why and how the canon functions ecclesially to preserve core doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heresy of Orthodoxy**: institutional conformity that nevertheless departs from apostolic truth; the book's defining diagnostic phrase.
- **Apostolic Faith**: the content of the gospel as transmitted by the apostles and encoded in the canon; the normative standard.
- **Canon**: the corpus of Scripture that serves as the final doctrinal boundary and hermeneutical rule.
 - Emphasized as authoritative, apostolic, and normative rather than merely historical.
- **Tradition (ecclesial Tradition)**: accumulated teaching/practice of the church; treated as valuable but subordinate to the canon.
 - Distinguishes descriptive tradition (what churches have done) from normative tradition (what must bind belief).
- **Rule of Faith**: early church formulae pointing to apostolic confession; used to demonstrate canonical priorities in patristic practice.
- **Sola Scriptura (canonical emphasis)**: defended in a nuanced form that focuses on the canon's finality rather than a caricatured individualistic reading.
- **Apostolicity**: criterion for truth rooted in connection to the apostolic witness; used to judge traditions and doctrines.
- **Ecclesial Authority**: the role of church office and councils; affirmed but circumscribed by the canon's authority.
- **Confessionalism**: the risk of elevating denominational formularies above Scripture; critiqued when it displaces apostolic norm.
- **Canonical Hermeneutic**: reading Scripture with the canon as the controlling interpretive frame.
- **Normative vs Descriptive Tradition**: analytic distinction for assessing which traditions bind doctrine.
- **Boundary Markers**: concepts the author uses to delineate orthodox belief (canon, apostolic proclamation, core gospel claims).

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies "canon vs tradition" for courses on Scripture and authority.
 - Polemic/resource: deployed in debates against ecclesial positions that elevate Tradition to parity with Scripture.
 - Pedagogical pivot: used in preaching and pastoral formation to re-center the apostolic canon as the church's doctrinal guardrail.
