### TITLE
Selections (by Julian of Eclanum) in Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 4th-early 5th century theological conflict in the Western Latin Church; Pelagian controversy centered in North Africa and Italy. Julian of Eclanum emerges as principal leader of the Pelagian party after Pelagius and Coelestius. Peter Brown (20th c.) includes Julianian selections in his biography of Augustine to illustrate the contested theological landscape.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The core dispute: the nature and scope of human freedom, the reality of original sin, and the necessity/operation of divine grace in salvation. Julian argues against Augustine's account of inherited guilt and deterministic elements of predestination.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Julian systematically defends human moral responsibility and capacity:
 - Denies that Adam's sin imputes guilt to descendants; posits only temporal consequences (death, inclination) rather than forensic guilt.
 - Emphasizes willful sin and voluntary consent as the locus of culpability.
 - Affirms the necessity of grace but construes it as assistance that cooperates with an intrinsically capable will rather than as overpowering prevenient causality.
 - Challenges Augustine's rhetoric of a "massa damnata" and the certainty of reprobation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal interlocutors: Augustine of Hippo (primary antagonist), Pelagius and Coelestius (fellow proponents, sometimes moderated by Julian), bishops and papal authorities (Innocent I, councils of Carthage), and patristic Scripture exegesis (Paul, psalms, Gospel texts).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin and its transmission; human will and freedom; grace (its form, sufficiency, cooperation); predestination and reprobation; baptism and infant status; merit, guilt, and responsibility; ecclesial authority in doctrinal adjudication.
- **Closing line**
 - Julian's selections articulate the Pelagian pole: a persistent insistence on human moral agency and a construal of grace as compatible with robust free will, set in tight opposition to Augustinian doctrines of inherited guilt and efficacious predestination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stronger insistence on forensic justice of God: God cannot justly punish one for another's sin; therefore Adam's guilt cannot be imputed.
 - Recasts grace as an empowering, cooperative aid rather than monergistic initiative; moral progress remains genuinely human.
 - Distinguishes between propensity (concupiscence) and culpability-concupiscence is a consequence, not imputable guilt.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts sharply with Augustine: rejects the doctrine that original sin = inherited guilt and the Augustinian depiction of human will as so weakened that grace must be irresistibly determining.
 - Moderates earlier Pelagius at points by accepting a need for grace, yet preserves Pelagius's optimism about created human capacity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refined use of "cooperation" (synergia) language to articulate joint divine-human agency without collapsing into determinism.
 - Reframing "concupiscence" as non-forensic predisposition rather than intrinsic guilt-bearing corruption.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Officially condemned in multiple synods and sidelined within Western orthodoxy; Julian became a chief foil in Augustinian and later medieval treatments of grace and original sin.
 - Indirectly shaped later debates: served as interlocutor for Semi-Pelagian formulations in Gaul and later critiques by Augustineans and Reformers. Modern historians value Julian as evidence of alternative late antique theological imagination.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Offers a rigorous, historically close counterpoint to Augustine; indispensable for understanding the boundaries of orthodoxy, the stakes of soteriological language, and the development of concepts like prevenient grace and synergy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - Julian: a condition of mortality and inclination, not forensic guilt imputed from Adam.
- **Concupiscence** - For Julian: a disordered tendency consequent on Adam, distinguishable from culpability.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - Emphasized as real and sufficient to cooperate with grace; central locus of moral responsibility.
- **Grace (gratia)** - Needed and efficacious but described primarily as enabling cooperation rather than irresistibly determining the will.
 - Preventive vs. assistive nuance: Julian tends to stress assistive/concordant grace.
- **Predestination** - Julian critiques deterministic readings; resists inviolable reprobation and absolute double predestination.
- **Imputation** - Key contested term: Augustine affirms forensic imputation of Adam's sin; Julian denies such imputative justice.
- **Synergy / cooperation (synergia)** - Term for joint divine-human action; Julian's preferred framework to avoid monergism.
- **Merit** - Julian locates genuine human contribution to moral achievement; grace elevates rather than obliterates merit.
- **Infant baptism** - Practiced and often defended; Julian denies that infants bear guilt meriting damnation.
- **"Massa damnata"** - Augustine's phrase for humanity's mass condemned; Julian rejects the depiction as unjust and unbiblical.
- **Responsibility / voluntas** - Central moral categories for Julian: blame attaches to voluntary consent, not merely to fallen nature.
- **Scriptural exegesis (Pauline texts)** - Julian reinterprets Pauline passages (e.g., Romans) to minimize universal forensic culpability and emphasize context.
- **Ecclesial authority** - Julian contested with episcopal and papal decisions; his writings illuminate processes of doctrinal policing.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism** - Julian is often archetypal Pelagian voice but accepts some role for grace, making him pivotal to understanding Semi-Pelagian mediations.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definition source: exemplifies Pelagian anthropology and alternative readings of Pauline soteriology.
 - As polemic: primary counter-example against which Augustinian and later Reformed doctrines are sharpened.
 - As exegetical model: offers alternative hermeneutics of Adam and Paul that inform comparative exegesis and historical theology.
