### TITLE
**Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of the Historical Jesus** (secondary analysis)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology; post-Kantian, anti-speculative; shaped by historical criticism.
 - Ritschlian school situated between Schleiermacherian experience-theology and Hegelian metaphysics; reacting to Tuebingen skepticism (F. C. Baur) and to confessional scholasticism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How theology may responsibly know Jesus historically without metaphysical speculation: Christian doctrine arises from **value-judgments** (Werthurtheile) about the historical Jesus, whose significance is grasped within the **community ordered to the Kingdom of God**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Epistemology**: Theology is practical-scientific; judgments of value, not metaphysical essences, yield religious knowledge. Revelation is God s saving action in history assessed by faith.
 - **Sources**: Scripture as historically credible witness, with **Synoptic priority** for Jesus teaching; the canon functions normatively as the church s primary historical testimony.
 - **Jesus and the Kingdom**: Jesus identity is inferred from his vocation and work in establishing the **Kingdom of God** and revealing the **Fatherhood of God**; the church is the ethical community of love his mission creates.
 - **Soteriology**: **Justification and reconciliation** express God s fatherly forgiveness and the formation of a moral community; atonement is teleological and ethical rather than penal-substitutionary.
 - **Sin**: Guilt and bondage are construed relationally as rupture of filial trust; deliverance is restoration to communal vocation.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: Church is the sphere of the Kingdom; sacraments serve communal formation in faith and love, not metaphysical conveyance of substance.
 - **Eschatology**: Recasts apocalyptic expectation as the moral end of history realized in community; tilts realized-ethical rather than futurist-catastrophic.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit as the divine power shaping communal love and perseverance in the Kingdom s ends.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **Kant** and **Lotze** (value theory); engages **Schleiermacher** (corrects subjectivism), opposes **Hegelian** metaphysics; disputes **Baur** on Gospel skepticism.
 - Later engagements: **Harnack** (affinity), **Kahler** (historic Jesus vs biblical Christ), **Troeltsch** (historicist critique), **Bultmann** (kerygma vs history), **Barth** (christocentric critique of moralism).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology**, **revelation**, **Christology** (from work to person), **soteriology** (justification/reconciliation), **doctrine of sin**, **ecclesiology and sacraments**, **pneumatology**, **eschatology**, minimalist **Trinity** (functional).
- **Closing line**
 - Theology serves the church s practical judgment that in the historical Jesus God establishes the Kingdom, creating a community of filial trust and love.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Value-judgment epistemology**; theology as practical science.
 - **Kingdom-of-God-centered** reading of Jesus; community as theology s orienting end.
 - **From work to person**: Jesus identity known through vocation and effect in history.
 - **Synoptic priority** and historical Jesus as necessary (against kerygmatic reduction).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **metaphysical speculation** (Hegelian, scholastic two-natures abstraction).
 - Against **pious subjectivism** (Schleiermacher s Gefühl) by communal-ethical objectivity.
 - Against **Tuebingen skepticism** by a chastened historical confidence.
 - Against **penal substitution** as controlling model; for ethical-teleological reconciliation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Werthurtheile**; **Fatherhood of God** as soteriological center; **Church as moral kingdom**; **revelation-in-history**; **functional Christology**; sacraments as **communal acts**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped classic Liberal Protestantism (**Harnack**); provoked **Kahler** s biblical Christ corrective; catalyzed **Barth** s revolt (revelation sovereignly given, not value-judged).
 - In Reformed circles: engaged critically by **Kuyper** and **Bavinck**; later re-assessed by **Pannenberg** and **Berkouwer** on history and revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined use of history for dogmatics; foregrounds ecclesial practice and ethics; clarifies Scripture as normative historical witness; offers a counterweight to speculative or merely experiential theologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Value-judgment (Werthurteil)**: Faith s practical judgment of Jesus significance for salvation; non-metaphysical but cognitively binding.
 - Contrasts with essence-speculation; aligns with practical reason.
- **Revelation-in-history**: God known in acts culminating in Jesus, not in timeless ideas.
- **Kingdom of God**: Ethical end and communal order instituted by Jesus; teleological horizon for doctrine.
- **Fatherhood of God**: Central soteriological predicate grounding forgiveness and communion.
- **Historical Jesus**: Object of disciplined historical inquiry necessary for theology s content.
 - Held over against purely kerygmatic or mythic construals.
- **Christ of faith**: The community s confessed significance of Jesus; inseparable from but not reducible to bare facts.
- **Justification and reconciliation**: Divine forgiveness and restoration to communal vocation; ethical-teleological rather than juridical-penal.
- **Sin as relational guilt**: Rupture of filial trust and communal calling; overcome in reconciliation.
- **Synoptic priority**: Methodological preference for Synoptics in reconstructing Jesus proclamation.
- **Church as ethical community**: Communal form of love and service; sphere of salvation.
- **Sacraments as communal acts**: Signs that consolidate faith and love within the community.
- **Functional Christology**: Identity from saving work and lordship in community rather than ontic natures.
- **Realized-ethical eschatology**: Emphasis on present moral consummation over catastrophic futurism.
- **Spirit as communal power**: Pneumatology focused on formation of love and perseverance.
- **Scripture as normative witness**: Authoritative historical testimony guiding the church s value-judgments.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a conceptual pivot for **ecclesiology and sacraments** (community, practices).
 - As a framing source in **bibliology** (Scripture as witness) and **revelation**.
 - As a foil and resource in **soteriology** and **doctrine of sin** (ethical-teleological models).
 - As a model and counter-model in **eschatology** and **pneumatology** (ethical realization, communal Spirit).
