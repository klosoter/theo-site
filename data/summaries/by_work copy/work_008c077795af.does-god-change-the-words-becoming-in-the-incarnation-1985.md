### TITLE
Does God Change? The Word's Becoming in the Incarnation (1985) - Thomas Weinandy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Catholic systematic theology reacting to theological currents that emphasize divine change (process theology, some strands of kenoticism, and existential/event-theologies).
 - Engages classical patristic and scholastic resources (Augustine, Chalcedon, Aquinas) while interacting with modern theologians (Rahner, Barth, Balthasar, Moltmann, proponents of kenotic theology).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Can the Incarnation be affirmed without conceding that God undergoes ontological change? Weinandy defends the classical claim that **God in his divine nature does not change** while accounting for the real historical becoming of the Word who assumes a human nature.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Establishes the theological stakes: divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) and their relation to the Incarnation.
 - Distinguishes types of change (ontological/substantial vs. relational/occurring) and insists that any change in the economy belongs to the person of the Son in relation to a new human nature, not to the divine nature itself.
 - Reconstructs Chalcedonian hypostatic union: the Word assumes human nature without mixture, loss, or alteration of the divine nature.
 - Treats suffering and emotional language: suffering belongs to the human nature assumed by the divine person; properly understood, theodramatic language does not require divine passibility in the incommunicable sense.
 - Offers a corrective to kenotic readings that would make the divine nature contingent or deficient.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic witnesses (notably Alexandrian and Cappadocian emphases), Aquinas, Chalcedon; modern interlocutors include Rahner (self-communication), Barth (event-theology), Balthasar (Christological drama), Moltmann (passible God), and process theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology (hypostatic union), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), revelation, person-nature distinction.
- **Closing line**
 - Weinandy's center of gravity: the Incarnation is a real historical act of the divine Person that does not compromise the immutability or incommunicable perfections of the divine nature; the Word truly becomes human while God remains God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp analytical distinction between change in a divine nature (ruled out) and real relational/temporal acts of the divine Person (permitted) - preserving both metaphysical rigor and historical reality.
 - Emphasizes the priority of Chalcedonian language as the correct grammar for discussing divine involvement in history.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects kenotic and process accounts that collapse the divine incommunicables into mutable events; resists Rahnerian and Barthian tendencies to make God's being essentially historical and eventful in a way that undermines aseity/immutability.
 - Offers a middle path to account for Christ's genuine human experiences without attributing passibility to the divine nature.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-presents classical metaphysical distinctions (nature vs. person, ad intra/ad extra, communicable/incommunicable attributes) in service of a contemporary Christological problem - not wholly new terms but a clarified deployment for modern debates.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in conservative Catholic and ecumenical circles that value classical Christology; used as a corrective in debates on divine passibility and in assessments of kenotic proposals.
 - Critiqued by some who favor stronger existential/event formulations of God's engagement with time.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for courses in Christology and doctrine of God as a clear, disciplined defense of Chalcedonian commitments against modern revisionisms; useful for clarifying how theological language about God's immutability coheres with the doctrine of the Incarnation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity** - God's attributes are identical to God's essence; cannot be partitioned or altered by the Incarnation.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence and independence; the Word's assumption of humanity does not compromise divine self-sufficiency.
- **Immutability** - God does not undergo substantial change; Weinandy reaffirms classical immutability while allowing for real historical acts by the divine Person.
- **Impassibility** - God does not suffer as God; suffering in Christ is real but belongs to the human nature assumed by the divine Person.
- **Hypostatic Union** - The one Person (the Word) unites two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation - central hermeneutical key in the book.
- **Person/Nature Distinction** - Crucial analytic tool: change can be ascribed to the person (as relationally assuming a nature) without ascribing change to the divine nature.
- **Ad intra / Ad extra** - Distinction between God's inner life and external relations; Weinandy uses this to explain how divine attributes operate in the economy without alteration of the Godhead.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying)** - Critically examined; Weinandy resists versions that imply loss or weakening of divine attributes, while allowing a genuine self-giving in the economy.
- **Communicable / Incommunicable Attributes** - Framework for explaining which divine properties may be analogically predicated of Christ's human experiences and which cannot be transferred.
- **Metaphysical vs. Relational Change** - Key conceptual distinction: metaphysical change alters essence; relational/temporal acts do not.
- **Word's Becoming** - Phrase denoting the central mystery: the eternal Word's assuming human existence - treated as a real historical addition without ontological diminishment.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for formulations of classical immutability and impassibility in Christology and doctrine of God.
 - As a **polemic tool** against process theology and strong kenotic proposals.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** to account for the genuine human experiences of Jesus while preserving Chalcedonian orthodoxy.
