### TITLE
Neuroscience, Psychology, and Religion: Illusions, Delusions, and Realities about Human Nature (Joel B. Green with Malcolm Jeeves)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century interdisciplinary engagement (science-theology interface). Co-authorship of a theologian/New Testament scholar (Joel B. Green) with a neuropsychologist (Malcolm Jeeves) signals deliberate interdisciplinary collaboration aimed at evangelical and broader Christian audiences.
 - Responds to rising claims from neuroscience and cognitive science that challenge traditional theological anthropology, pastoral practice, and moral responsibility.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary neuroscience and psychology raise both legitimate corrections and overreaches ("illusions" and "delusions") about what they say concerning human nature. A theologically informed, empirically attentive account affirms **psychosomatic unity**: persons are embodied, relational agents whose mental life is neither reducible to neural mechanism nor separate as immaterial substances.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of neuroscientific and psychological claims that bear on personhood (brain correlates, modular mind proposals, disorders, plasticity).
 - Philosophical assessment of explanatory options: reductionism, eliminative materialism, Cartesian dualism, and emergent/nonreductive physicalist alternatives.
 - Theological integration: reinterpreting classical categories (soul, imago Dei, incarnation) in light of neuroscience while preserving moral responsibility and ritual/practical theology.
 - Practical implications: pastoral care, ethics, and ecclesial formation that take embodied agency seriously.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scientific interlocutors: contemporary neuroscientists and cognitive scientists (representative figures and schools rather than a single lab). Critical engagement with reductionist thinkers (e.g., Churchland/Dennett-type eliminativists) and defenders of mental causation.
 - Philosophical interlocutors: debates in philosophy of mind over emergence and mental causation; historical reference to Cartesian dualism.
 - Theological interlocutors: Christian anthropological traditions and incarnational theology as resources for reframing personhood.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: **Theological anthropology** (human nature, imago Dei, embodied personhood).
 - Secondary: implications for **Christology** (incarnation as analogue), **soteriology** (sin and transformation of whole person), **ethics** and **pastoral theology** (responsibility, therapy, formation).

- **Closing line**
 - A disciplined, incarnationally rooted defense of **psychosomatic unity** that resists both mechanistic reduction and disembodied dualism, urging careful interdisciplinary humility and theological refinement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Collaborative method: theologian + practitioner-scientist model to avoid simplistic appropriation of data or theology.
 - Prioritizes incarnational and relational categories as hermeneutical keys for reading neuroscientific claims about agency and personhood.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against **eliminative materialism** (the claim that folk-psychological constructs should be abandoned) by defending the reality and explanatory role of mental states.
 - Rejects **Cartesian substance dualism** as theologically archaic and scientifically untenable, while nonetheless defending nonreductive accounts that preserve meaningful mental causation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates and refines the language of **psychosomatic unity** for contemporary discourse, emphasizing **levels of explanation** and emergent properties rather than metaphysical partitioning.
 - Advocates for an **integrative pluralism** in explanation: neural, psychological, social, and theological-linguistic levels all have legitimate explanatory purchase.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in evangelical and mainline circles for its constructive, non-polemical tone; adopted in curricula that bridge theology, pastoral care, and neuroscience.
 - Cited in debates over free will, moral responsibility, and pastoral responses to neurological disorders.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for disciplined interdisciplinary theology: empirically literate, philosophically informed, and theologically coherent.
 - Serves as a durable corrective to both scientistic reductionism and nostalgic dualism in teaching and pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Persons as unified embodied agents; mental and bodily states are integrally related without collapsing mental into mere neural description.

- **Nonreductive physicalism / emergence**
 - Mental properties emerge from but are not reducible to physical processes; they can have causal efficacy.

- **Reductionism**
 - The view that higher-level phenomena (mind, meaning) can be fully explained by lower-level neural mechanisms; book critiques strong forms.

- **Eliminative materialism**
 - The idea that common-sense mental categories (beliefs, desires) should be discarded; treated as an overreach and unnecessary for scientific progress.

- **Folk psychology**
 - Everyday frameworks for mental life (belief, intention) defended as indispensable explanatory tools despite neuroscientific detail.

- **Mental causation**
 - How mental states can be causally efficacious in an embodied agent; defended via emergentist and levels-of-explanation strategies.

- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - Reinterpreted in embodied, relational, functional terms rather than as an immaterial soul-substance; grounds dignity, responsibility, and relationality.

- **Incarnation (as analogical resource)**
 - Christology used as a theological model that legitimizes embodied personhood and grounds the redemption of whole persons.

- **Levels of explanation**
 - Methodological principle: neural, psychological, social, and theological explanations provide complementary insights.

- **Moral responsibility**
 - Preserved by emphasizing agency, narrative identity, and social-ethical frameworks that outstrip mere neural determinism.

- **Neural correlates**
 - Empirical findings matter but are interpreted within broader explanatory frameworks; correlation not identical to ontological reduction.

- **Dualism (Cartesian)**
 - Rejected as an inadequate theological anthropology; historical reference point for critique.

- **Plasticity**
 - Neuroscientific evidence of brain change used to argue for relational and formative aspects of Christian moral formation and pastoral care.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary theological affirmation of psychosomatic unity in curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against scientistic reductionism and nostalgic dualism in ethics, pastoral theology, and systematic theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for developing incarnational anthropology, models of mental causation, and church practices attentive to embodied formation.
