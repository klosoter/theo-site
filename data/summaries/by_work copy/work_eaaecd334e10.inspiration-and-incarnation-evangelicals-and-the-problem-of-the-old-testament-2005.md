### TITLE
**Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament** - Peter Enns (2005)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical milieu; reaction to rising tensions between confessional inerrancy and critical biblical scholarship.
 - Enns writes as an evangelical Old Testament scholar committed to Christian faith but influenced by historical-critical methods and ANE studies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Traditional evangelical accounts of inspiration (especially *plenary, verbal inerrancy*) cannot adequately account for the character, diversity, and occasionally "imperfect" expressions found in the Old Testament. Enns proposes understanding inspiration analogically to the Incarnation: God condescends into particular human forms and cultures, allowing genuine human characteristics in Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: surveys apparent tensions between OT content (historical claims, literary forms, theological development) and modern evangelical expectations of uniform propositional inerrancy.
 - Historical-theological move: traces patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern evangelical conceptions of inspiration to show contingency and development.
 - Constructive proposal: offers an **incarnational analogy**-Scripture is both divine and genuinely human; divine message comes through culturally conditioned, sometimes fallible-seeming human expression.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: calls for renewed humility and a hermeneutic that accommodates biblical diversity without abandoning authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages evangelical leaders defending inerrancy (implicit critique of classical defenders of plenary verbal inspiration).
 - Dialogues with ANE scholarship, historical-critical OT scholarship, and the New Testament's use of the Old.
 - Draws analogies to Christological doctrine (Incarnation) and to historical theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (central), authority of Scripture, hermeneutics, the doctrine of God's action in history; touches on anthropology and soteriology insofar as they relate to Adam and covenant language.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Enns advances an **incarnational model of inspiration**: Scripture truly communicates God's revelation by entering real human language, history, and culture, thereby reshaping evangelical confidence in inerrancy into a confidence in the Bible's faithful divine-human witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong emphasis on the Old Testament's own particularity: genre variety, ANE parallels, theological development, and rhetorical/historical contingency.
 - The **incarnational analogy** is the book's signature move-treating Scripture's human elements as analogous to Christ's human nature.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges the veneer of uniform propositional inerrancy as historically contingent and theologically unnecessary for orthodox faith.
 - Contrasts with conservative apologetics that prioritize literal-historical readings of Genesis 1-11 and uniform verbal inspiration.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Moves the debate from "inerrant vs. errant" checklist toward a model that integrates divine agency and human contingency without capitulating to relativism.
 - Frames authority in relational and redemptive-truth terms rather than propositional perfection.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Polarizing within evangelicalism: praised by many for intellectual honesty and pastoral sensitivity; criticized by some for undermining traditional inerrancy commitments.
 - Provoked significant debate in seminaries and churches about hermeneutics, science-Scripture relations, and teaching on Genesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a pedagogical bridge between OT scholarship and evangelical theology; useful for courses on inspiration, hermeneutics, and the theology of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration**
 - Enns: divine self-disclosure mediated through genuinely human authors; not synonymous with dictation.
- **Inerrancy**
 - Critiqued in its classical, plenary-verbal form; Enns argues inerrancy as usually defined is not necessary for the Bible's authority.
- **Accommodation**
 - Scripture speaks in ways adapted to historical-cultural horizons of its authors and audiences; parallel to divine condescension.
- **Incarnational Analogy**
 - Central heuristic: just as Christ was fully God and fully human, Scripture is divine message in human language and cultural forms.
- **Historicity of Adam**
 - Treated as a contested locus: Enns urges caution about reading Adam primarily as a scientific or literal-historical anchor; raises questions about federal headship language when read against modern science.
 - Engages debates on how a non-literal or representative Adam affects doctrines like original sin and federal representation.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Discussed as a doctrinal locus needing theological refinement if historicity of Adam is reconsidered; Enns prompts reformulation rather than abandonment.
- **Genesis 1-11 (Science and Scripture)**
 - Advocates reading the primeval narratives with attention to ANE genre and intent; argues science and Scripture operate with different methods and questions-calls evangelical theology to rethink hermeneutics in light of science.
- **Plenary Verbal Inspiration**
 - Identified as the dominant model Enns critiques; he shows how OT textual phenomena resist this neat category.
- **Human Authorship / Divine Agency**
 - Emphasizes synergistic model: God works through, not around, human authors-explaining diversity, occasional biblical "rough edges."
- **Canonical Context**
 - Insists on reading individual texts within canonical and redemptive-historical trajectory, noting evolving revelation across the OT.
- **Hermeneutical Pluralism**
 - Encourages multiple legitimate reading strategies sensitive to genre, audience, and purpose.
- **Ancient Near Eastern Context**
 - Uses ANE parallels to illuminate how Israelite writers shaped material, not to reduce uniqueness but to contextualize form and expression.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: reframing "inspiration" for contemporary evangelical theology courses.
 - Polemic: deployed against strict inerrantist formulations in debates over Genesis and Scripture.
 - Exegetical model: cited in hermeneutics and OT studies to justify genre-sensitive readings of Genesis 1-11 and to mediate science/Scripture tensions.
 - Conceptual pivot: serves as a hinge for rethinking doctrines (e.g., Adam and federal headship) when integrating scientific plausibility and theological continuity.
