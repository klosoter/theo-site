### TITLE
Homilies on Genesis - Origen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 3rd / early 4th century Alexandrian Christian exegetical milieu. Delivered as pastoral sermons on Genesis in Caesarea (traditionally) during Origen's prolific exegetical period; reflects Alexandrian allegorical method and engagement with Hellenistic philosophy and Jewish exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to read Genesis theologically - reconciling the literal narrative with the spiritual realities of creation, human origins, sin, and destiny; relatedly, the status and origin of the soul (relevant to Traducianism vs Creationism debates).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Repeatedly contrasts **literal** (historical) and **spiritual** (allegorical/moral/anagogical) senses of Genesis.
 - Reads creation accounts as layered: surface narrative instructs moral behavior; deeper reading reveals ontological truths about souls, angels, and God's providence.
 - Maintains **preexistence of souls**: souls exist prior to bodily formation and descend into bodies as consequence of moral standing.
 - Treats Genesis episodes (Adam, Eve, Fall, Cain and Abel, Flood, Babel) as typological pointers to Christ, the Church, and the soul's journey.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Septuagint), Philo and Hellenistic allegorists, Jewish midrashic motifs, contemporary Christian teachers; implicitly polemicizes against strictly literal readings and later against positions that attribute soul-origin to parental generation (traducianism) or to immediate creation at conception without preexistence (creationism).
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, anthropology (soul-body relation), fall and sin, free will, providence, typology/Christology (many Genesis persons foreshadow Christ), Trinity (handled by allegory and anti-anthropomorphism), eschatology (tendency toward universal restoration/apokatastasis in Origenian corpus).
- **Closing line:** Origen's Homilies on Genesis press the interpreter to read Genesis not merely as primitive history but as a multi-sensed theological map in which souls preexist, fall, and are called to restoration - thus privileging spiritual exegesis over naturalistic accounts of origin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong assertion of **soul preexistence**: souls are spiritual substances prior to embodiment, making Origen distinct from both later traducianism and classical creationism.
 - Systematic use of the **triplex sense** (literal, moral, spiritual/anagogical) applied verse-by-verse.
 - Radical anti-anthropomorphism: divine anthropomorphisms in Genesis are to be read metaphorically.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves beyond Philo's allegory by integrating distinctly Christian Christological typology.
 - Contrasts with literalist interpreters who ground anthropology in immediate divine creation at conception or parental transmission; Origen's model sidelines those binary options by positing preexistence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Deploys early formulations of **spiritual senses** as systematic hermeneutical categories.
 - Develops a coherent exegetical vocabulary linking Genesis typology to Christ's salvific economy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Deep influence on Eastern patristic exegesis and medieval allegorical reading; source of inspiration for later mystical reading.
 - Controversial: Origenist doctrines (preexistence, apokatastasis) later condemned in parts by some councils and critics; Protestants selectively appropriated his allegorical method but rejected his speculative metaphysics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable as an exemplar of Alexandrian hermeneutics, for tracing patristic uses of Genesis, and for understanding historical alternatives to traducianism/creationism debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Preexistence of souls:** Souls exist prior to embodiment; central to Origen's anthropology and decisive in opposing both traducianism and simple creationism in his framework.
- **Triplex sense / allegorical method:** Literal, moral (tropological), and spiritual/anagogical senses used to extract layered meanings from Genesis.
- **Allegorization of anthropomorphism:** Reading God's bodily language in Genesis metaphorically to safeguard divine transcendence.
- **Typology/Christological reading:** Figures in Genesis prefigure Christ and the Church (Adam as type, Eden as spiritual condition).
- **Soul-body relation / ensoulment:** Souls are spiritual substances that enter bodies, not produced by parental seed nor newly created ex nihilo at birth in Origen's system.
- **Free will and fall:** Moral accountability precedes embodiment; the fall is a moral/metaphysical turning prior to or associated with descent into bodies.
- **Apokatastasis (restoration):** Origenian trajectory toward universal restoration influences his Genesis exegesis (hope for final reconciliation).
- **Anti-anthropomorphic exegesis:** Methodological principle guarding theological doctrine of God's immutability and incorporeality.
- **Typological hermeneutics for ecclesial formation:** Genesis narratives read as formative for Christian moral and liturgical life.
- **Providence and moral cosmology:** Creation narrative read as ordered by a providential moral economy rather than mere physical history.
- **Use in Traducianism vs Creationism debates:** Origen's preexistence provides historical evidence that early patristic thought offered an alternative to the later binary.
- **Exegetical model:** Employed as a model for layered biblical interpretation in patristic and medieval commentaries.
- **Polemic resource:** Cited in debates-both invoked by critics to caricature Origenism and by allies to argue for non-materialist views of the soul.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Alexandrian allegorical hermeneutics and for the preexistence position (historical witness).
- As a **polemic**: mobilized either to criticize Origenist excesses (preexistence, apokatastasis) or to counter traducianist/materialist accounts of the soul.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis typologically and spiritually in homiletics and theology.
