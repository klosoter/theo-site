### TITLE
**Calvin's Sermons on Acts** 
John Calvin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context.** Preached in Geneva during Calvin's mature ministry (1540s-1550s), amid consolidation of Reformed worship and polity, conflict with Rome and radicals, and an influx of refugees. Sermons follow lectio continua, recorded by auditors and published posthumously/translationally.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem.** How the exalted Christ advances His kingdom by Word and Spirit through ordinary ministry and ordered offices, amid persecution, for the gathering of Jew and Gentile into one church; Scripture, not human authority, norming church and mission.
- **Core argument / structure.**
 - **Acts 1-2:** Christ's ascension and session; Pentecost as inauguration of the age of the Spirit; apostolic preaching as means of conversion; church's marks formed.
 - **Acts 3-7:** Word confirmed by signs; suffering as normal; appointment of deacons (Acts 6) for mercy; Stephen's speech as covenantal diagnosis.
 - **Acts 8-12:** Gospel's outward thrust (Samaria, Ethiopian, Cornelius); unity without legal yoke; miracles as apostolic and foundational, not perpetual norm.
 - **Acts 13-15:** Mission pattern; elders in every church; Council of Jerusalem models synodical judgment bound to Scripture, preserving liberty of conscience.
 - **Acts 16-20:** Planting and strengthening churches; ordinary means (preaching, sacraments, discipline); Paul's Miletus address (Acts 20) as archetype of pastoral oversight.
 - **Acts 21-28:** Providence over persecution; witness before powers; shipwreck and Rome displaying God's unthwarted promise to the nations.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors.** Luke-Acts foremost; patristic exegesis (esp. Augustine, Chrysostom) engaged discerningly; philological humanism; in debate with Roman claims (papal primacy, sacramentalism), Anabaptists (community of goods, anti-magistracy), and Enthusiasts (immediate revelations).
- **Doctrines treated.** **Bibliology** (apostolic authority, sufficiency), **Trinity/Pneumatology** (mission of the Spirit), **Christology** (ascension, session, kingship), **Soteriology** (repentance, faith, justification, sanctification), **Ecclesiology/Polity** (marks, offices, councils, discipline, diaconate), **Sacraments** (ordinary means), **Providence/Mission**, **Eschatology** (already/not yet kingdom).
- **Center of gravity.** The ascended Christ governs His pilgrim church by the inseparable **Word and Spirit**, gathering and preserving through ordinary means and ordered offices under providence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases.**
 - **Word-Spirit inseparability:** Scripture read, preached, and sealed by the Spirit as Christ's scepter.
 - **Ordinary means over spectacle:** Preaching, sacraments, prayer, discipline as normative; signs are ancillary and time-bound.
 - **Ordered polity:** Elders and deacons instituted for edification and mercy; synodical counsel under Scripture.
 - **Suffering as mark:** The church advances cruciformly, not triumphalistically.
- **Corrections/contrasts.**
 - Against **papal primacy:** Peter is exemplar, not monarch; councils judged by Scripture (Acts 15).
 - Against **Anabaptist communism:** Acts 2-4 depicts voluntary charity, not enforced community of goods; magistracy affirmed in its sphere.
 - Against **Enthusiasm:** Private revelations and perpetual miracles subordinated to canonical Word; extraordinary gifts not the church's ordinary estate.
 - Against **legalism/antinomianism:** Liberty from Mosaic yoke without moral laxity; repentance is necessary fruit of faith.
- **Conceptual innovations.**
 - Consolidation of **presbyterial-synodical** polity from Acts 6, 14, 15, 20.
 - Clarified **diaconate** as a distinct office of mercy.
 - Homiletical model of **lectio continua** integrating exegesis and dogmatics.
- **Reception and influence.**
 - Shaped Reformed and Presbyterian polity; informed Puritan preaching; cited in debates on miracles/cessation, church discipline, and liberty of conscience.
 - A touchstone for Reformed missiology: ordinary means and providence rather than coercion or spectacle.
- **Enduring value.**
 - Exegetical-dogmatic integration; pastoral application tethered to text.
 - Reliable anchor across loci: Christology (session), Pneumatology (Pentecost), Ecclesiology (offices), Bibliology (apostolic authority), Eschatology (kingdom's growth).
