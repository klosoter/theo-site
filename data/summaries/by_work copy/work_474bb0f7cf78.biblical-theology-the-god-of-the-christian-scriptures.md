### TITLE
**Biblical Theology: The God of the Christian Scriptures - John Goldingay**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical- Anglican biblical scholarship; situated within the renewal of canonical and narrative biblical theology that seeks to read Scripture on its own terms while engaging historical-critical tools.
 - Goldingay writes as an Old Testament specialist intent on constructing a theology of God that is anchored in the texts Christians confess as Scripture rather than starting from later dogmatic systems.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian Scriptures present a distinctive, coherent portrait of God rooted in Israel's story and continued in the church's witness; theology should emerge from sustained, textually disciplined attention to how the Bible speaks of God rather than from external systematic categories.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close, book-by-book and theme-by-theme reading of biblical texts to assemble a composite portrait of God's character and action.
 - Emphasis on verbs and actions (God who acts) as primary theological data; attributes are discerned in relation to covenantal activity.
 - Attention to continuity and development between the Testaments: the God revealed in Israel's Scriptures is the God of the Christian Scriptures, whose self-revelation reaches fuller narrative and christological clarity in the New Testament.
 - Methodological restraint: descriptive theological reporting rather than speculative metaphysics; principle of letting biblical language shape theological categories.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interacts programmatically with the canonical and narrative theologians (e.g., Brevard Childs-style attention to canon) and with recent biblical-theological work (e.g., Brueggemann, Wright) while remaining rooted in technical OT exegesis and historical-critical scholarship.
 - Engages church doctrinal tradition indirectly by testing confessional claims against the biblical record rather than by defending confessions from the outset.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant, election, creation and providence, presence/temple, holiness and wrath, mercy/hesed, Christology (as the New Testament locates God's decisive action), Trinity as the scriptural pattern of divine self-disclosure, redemption and eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - The work's center of gravity: a disciplined, text-driven portrait of the living God who acts in covenant fidelity - a theological account that privileges narrative action and scriptural witness over abstract doctrinal extrapolation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of divine action and narrative over static attribute lists; God is known primarily as the One who acts in history (covenant, promise, salvation).
 - Descriptive, not programmatic: theology as reportage of scriptural speech about God rather than as systematic construction.
 - Strong insistence on lexical and literary sensitivity (Hebrew/Greek nuances), bringing exegetical exactitude to theological claims.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against theological systems that import extrabiblical metaphysical categories (e.g., some forms of abstract Trinitarian metaphysics) and against overly schematic readings that disconnect New Testament christology from Israel's story.
 - Offers a corrective to readings that fragment Old and New Testaments; argues for organic continuity with room for development.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframing theological categories around the language of divine activity (e.g., "God's action of covenant faithfulness") rather than isolated attributes.
 - Emphasis on how biblical speech forms (narrative, poetry, prophecy) shape claims about God - theological categories must respect genre.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among evangelical and mainstream academic audiences as a model of exegetical biblical theology; appreciated for combining scholarly rigor with theological seriousness.
 - Influential in seminary curricula that favor Bible-grounded theology; sometimes critiqued by systematic theologians for caution about doctrinal construction.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary methodological model for doing theology from Scripture: rigorous exegesis, careful canon-awareness, and theological restraint.
 - Valuable resource for pastors and teachers seeking a theologically rich but textually faithful portrait of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith / diathēkē)** - central organizing category; God's identity is covenantal fidelity rather than merely metaphysical being.
- **Hesed (steadfast love / mercy)** - presented as a defining moral and relational trait of God in Israel's witness.
- **Faithfulness (emunah)** - God's trustworthiness as revealed in action; theological ground for promise-keeping.
- **God who acts** - methodological motto: verbs and deeds precede abstract attributes.
- **Presence / Shekinah / Spirit** - language of divine immanence and agency, bridging temple motifs to New Testament pneumatology.
- **Election / calling** - relational and narrative, not merely determinative: election as means to God's purposes for blessing and witness.
- **Wrath and justice** - treated as aspects of God's covenant fidelity; disciplinary and restorative within narrative economy.
- **Christological reading** - New Testament portrayal of God's saving action centered on Jesus; Christ as interpretive key for Israel's Scriptures.
- **Trinity (scriptural witness)** - described primarily as the pattern of divine self-revelation rather than as a speculative ontology; attention to Father, Son, Spirit in the biblical narrative.
- **Eschatology (already / not yet)** - God's future-directed promises shape present ethical and worshipful response.
- **Revelation (historical and narrative)** - Scripture as the locus of God's self-disclosure; theology must be faithful to biblical modes of speech.
- **Canonical method** - reading texts in their canonical witness to assemble theological portrait.
- **Anthropomorphism and theology of language** - careful handling of human language for God; resists literalizing anthropomorphisms while preserving their communicative function.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for biblical-theological method that privileges scriptural reportage over systematic imposition.
 - As an **exegetical model** for teaching God-centered theology grounded in Old and New Testament texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over continuity between Testaments and the proper starting point for doctrinal claims.
