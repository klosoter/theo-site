### TITLE
The Old Testament in Seven Sentences - Christopher J. H. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published within early 21st-century evangelical scholarship (Eerdmans, 2014). Wright writes as a global-evangelical Old Testament scholar and mission theologian with long Service in Africa and at Langham Partnership; engages both academy and church pedagogically.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Old Testament is a coherent, unified witness whose theological center is God's covenantal mission to bless the nations through Israel, culminating and finding fulfillment in Christ and carried forward by the church.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Wright compresses the OT into **seven concise theological sentences** that aggregate creation, fall, covenant, law, kingship, exile/prophecy, and the messianic hope.
 - He argues for a **canonical, theological reading** that preserves historical particularity (Israel, land, temple) while insisting these particulars point beyond themselves to God's universal purposes.
 - Emphasis on **mission**: Israel's vocation is not an end but a vehicle for God's blessing of the nations; the OT is thus intrinsically missional.
 - Concludes with continuity into the New Testament: Christ fulfills and recasts the OT story, and the church inherits the mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Implicit dialogue with canonical and theological interpreters (e.g., Brevard Childs-style canonical emphasis), mission theologians, and contemporary evangelical scholars.
 - Critical distance from reductionist historical-critical readings and from simplistic supersessionist or detached-nationalist readings of Israel.
 - Resource engagement with OT texts themselves rather than heavy interaction with continental critics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Scripture as narrative witness), Covenant, Christology (OT as pointer to Messiah), Kingdom of God, Mission, Creation, Sin/Exile, Prophecy, Law and Wisdom, Worship/Temple.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** The Old Testament, rightly read, narrates God's covenantal mission: from creation to covenant, through exile and prophetic promise, toward the Messiah who brings God's blessing to the nations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The method of **seven sentences** as a pedagogical and exegetical heuristic - compressing the canon without flattening complexity.
 - Persistent framing of the OT as **mission-shaped Scripture** rather than primarily law, cult, or national chronicle.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against readings that privatize the gospel or make the OT merely a prelude to New Testament doctrine; also resists viewing Israel's election as an ethno-national dead end.
 - Corrects exclusive focus on individual salvation by restoring corporate, covenantal, and societal dimensions (justice, land, worship).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Treats the OT's particularities (land, temple, covenant) as **in-purpose** rather than incidental - i.e., ordained means of universal blessing.
 - Uses concise doctrinal sentences as an interpretive key to maintain theological density and instructional clarity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical seminaries and churches for teaching; praised for clarity and pastoral usefulness.
 - Influential among those integrating biblical theology with mission studies; less engaged by strictly technical critical OT scholarship but respected for its theological synthesis.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exceptional as an accessible, theologically robust summary for students, pastors, and mission-minded scholars; serves as a bridge between academic OT study and church catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Seven Sentences:** The core pedagogical device; each sentence encapsulates a major canonical movement (creation, fall, election, law/temple, kingship/prophecy, exile/hope, messianic mission).
- **Covenant:** Central organizing category; Israel's election is covenantal service to God's purpose for the nations.
- **Mission (missio Dei):** Primary lens - OT as fundamentally about God's sending to bless the nations.
- **Land/Temple:** Treated as covenantal instruments, not ends in themselves; loci of God's presence and flourishing for the world.
- **Exile/Return:** The theological interpretive hinge showing sin's consequences and the promise of restoration.
- **Messiah:** The eschatological and Christological culmination; OT pointing forward to the one who will fulfill covenant purposes.
- **Kingdom/Kingship:** God's reign embodied in Davidic promises and eschatological consummation.
- **Law/Wisdom:** Provide covenantal structure for life under God; social, liturgical, and ethical dimensions emphasized.
- **Worship/Presence:** Temple cult and liturgy as formative of identity and mission.
- **Creation:** Foundation for God's lordship and human vocation; grounds stewardship and social ethics.
- **Prophecy:** Not only foretelling but covenantal critique and promise - call to justice, hope for restoration.
- **Nations:** Recurring object and beneficiary of God's plan; Israel's role is vocationally outward-looking.
- **Canonical reading:** Reading the OT as unified testimony, balancing particularity and universality.
- **Christ in OT and NT:** Thematic insistence that the OT anticipates and is fulfilled in Christ without collapsing Israel into the church.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for OT theology shaped by mission and covenant.
 - As a **pedagogical/exegetical model** for teaching canonical, Christ-informed OT reading.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in church contexts to reframe preaching and discipleship toward social, liturgical, and missionary engagement.
