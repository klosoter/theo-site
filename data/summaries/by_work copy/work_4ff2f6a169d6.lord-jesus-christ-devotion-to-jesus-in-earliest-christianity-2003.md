### TITLE
Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity (2003) - Larry Hurtado

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2003; situated in late 20th-early 21st century NT studies emphasizing social-historical and practice-oriented readings.
 - Reaction against models that locate high Christology only in later, post-apostolic development; interacts with scholarship on Jewish monotheism, Second Temple Judaism, and early Christian worship forms.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Early Christians manifested widespread, sustained **devotion to Jesus** (prayer, hymns, invocation, veneration) that is theologically significant: it shows a form of high Christological devotion within first-century Jewish monotheism, antecedent to later formal Trinitarian formulations.
 - This devotional phenomenon is not a late Gentile accretion nor merely metaphorical; it is an early and culturally intelligible pattern of honoring Jesus in ways previously reserved for God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Empirical survey of textual and material evidence (Pauline letters, Gospels, baptismal/prayer traditions, hymnic material, epigraphic/papyrological data).
 - Analytical move: interpret worship practices (latreia/adoration), titles (Kurios/Lord), benedictions, and ritual use (baptism, Eucharist, invocation) as primary data for belief about Jesus.
 - Comparative move: show how devotion to Jesus is modeled on Jewish monotheistic worship yet adapted to Christ's person - producing a **distinctive early Christian devotional pattern** that is not identical with later Trinitarian doctrine but is a formative stage toward it.
 - Conclusion: the evidence demands recognizing **early high Christology** embedded in devotional practice, which shapes later doctrinal development (including the doctrine of the Trinity).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Pauline corpus, Synoptics, Johannine material, early liturgical fragments, baptismal/prayer formulas.
 - Secondary dialogue with scholars who posited later high Christology (e.g., some strands of Bultmannian or developmental models), and with work on Jewish monotheism (Philo, Josephus, Second Temple literature).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (how Jesus is presented/received), Christology (the status and worship of Jesus), Trinity (as later doctrinal articulation emerging from devotional practice), worship and liturgy, and continuity with Jewish monotheism.

- **Closing line**
 - Hurtado locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that **early Christian devotion to Jesus is an early, practice-grounded form of high Christology that functioned inside Jewish monotheism and anticipates - but is not identical to - later Trinitarian formulations.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on *devotional practice* (prayer, invocation, hymns, benedictions) as primary evidence for belief, rather than treating doctrinal statements alone as decisive.
 - Argued for **priority of ritual and praise forms** in shaping Christological belief.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges positions that portray worship of Jesus as a late Gentile innovation or derivative of Hellenistic divinization; insists worship begins early and is attested in Jewish-Christian contexts.
 - Contrasts with purely propositional-development models of doctrine by showing embodied, communal religious activity as formative.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the analytic category **"devotion to Jesus"** as a scholarly heuristic distinguishing practices of honor, invocation, and worship from later dogmatic labels.
 - Emphasizes **"patterned devotion"** - recurrent ritual and verbal forms adapted to Jesus.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in NT studies, liturgical theology, and historical Christology; became a standard reference when addressing origins of Christian worship and early high Christology.
 - Adopted by many Reformed and evangelical scholars to argue that early Christian worship of Jesus is scripturally grounded and formative for doctrine of the Trinity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological model: use communal practices as windows into early belief.
 - Important corrective to simplistic development narratives and a foundational resource for courses on Christology, worship history, and Trinitarian development.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Devotion to Jesus** - cluster of practices (prayer, hymns, invocation, benediction, veneration) directed to Jesus; Hurtado's primary analytic category.
- **Early high Christology** - thesis that very early Christian groups ascribed statuses and honors to Jesus that imply divine standing.
- **Kurios (Lord)** - title applied to Jesus; treated as a key index of divine honor when used in prayer/doxology.
- **Latreia / worship practices** - ritual forms of religious service; Hurtado reads these as evidence of divine-level honor given to Jesus.
- **Patterned devotion** - recurrent liturgical-language and ritual templates adapted from Jewish worship to Jesus.
- **Jewish monotheism (constraint and context)** - the cultural-religious background that shaped how devotion to Jesus could be intelligible without abandoning monotheism.
- **Invocation / prayer formulas** - concrete textual loci (e.g., benedictions) used to argue for early Jesus-prayer.
- **Hymnic material** - embedded hymns/creedal lines (Philippians 2; Colossians 1-2) used as evidence of early devotion.
- **Baptismal and Eucharistic practice** - ritual contexts where Jesus' name receives central, sometimes quasi-divine, status.
- **Proto-Trinitarian / developmental relation** - Hurtado's view that early devotion is a formative antecedent to later Trinitarian doctrine, not its full expression.
- **Devotional evidence vs. theological formulations** - methodological contrast: practices precede formal dogma.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading NT texts: prioritize ritual/practice evidence (prayers, doxologies, titles) to infer belief.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Trinitarian studies: supplies historical grounding for arguing that Trinitarian doctrine grew out of early worship patterns.
- As a **polemic/resource** in debates over the chronology of Christological development: marshals data against late-developments-only models.
