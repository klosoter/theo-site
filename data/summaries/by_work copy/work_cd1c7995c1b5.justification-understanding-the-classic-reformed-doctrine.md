### TITLE
Justification: Understanding the Classic Reformed Doctrine - J. V. Fesko

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed theological recovery; written for confessional Protestants concerned with contemporary challenges to classical Protestant soteriology (Roman Catholic recovery, New Perspective on Paul, and Federal Vision debates).
 - Aimed at seminary students, pastors, and informed laity within the Reformed tradition.

- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem**
 - Defends the **classic Reformed (forensic) doctrine of justification**: God declares sinners righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness, received by faith alone, not by infused merit or cooperative human righteousness.
 - Responds to attacks that reinterpret justification as covenantal status, covenantal participation, or transformative/final renewal rather than a legal declaration.

- **Core argument/structure**
 - Overview of the biblical data that supports a forensic reading of justification (Pauline corpus emphasized).
 - Historical-theological survey tracing the doctrine through Augustine, the Reformers (Luther, Calvin), and the Westminster divines.
 - Doctrinal analysis: links **union with Christ** to the mechanisms of imputation (active and passive obedience), and argues that imputation is the consistent explanation for believers' declared righteousness.
 - Polemical engagement: evaluates Roman Catholic assertions (infusion/merit), the New Perspective on Paul (covenantal nomism/redefinition of justification), and internal Reformed controversies (Federal Vision, works-salvation misunderstandings).
 - Pastoral implications: how doctrine shapes preaching, assurance, and the life of the church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Westminster Confession, John Owen; modern interlocutors include proponents of the New Perspective (e.g., E. P. Sanders, N. T. Wright), Roman Catholic formulations (Council of Trent summaries), and Federal Vision proponents.
 - Employs biblical exegesis, Reformation-era polemics, and Reformed systematic theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (central), imputation (double imputation), union with Christ, atonement (active/passive obedience), faith, grace (sola gratia), sola fide, sanctification (distinguished from justification), covenant theology, and sacramental implications.

- **Closing line**
 - Fesko locates the heart of Reformed soteriology in the forensic declaration of righteousness grounded in Christ's active and passive obedience, received by faith within union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates **union with Christ** more tightly with imputation than some older accounts, making union the relational ground for the forensic declaration.
 - Stresses both **active and passive obedience** of Christ as essential to the believer's declared righteousness (not merely penal substitution).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Explicitly pushes back on the New Perspective's shift from forensic to covenantal readings of Paul, arguing that covenantal language does not displace declarative justification.
 - Corrects Roman Catholic infusion/merit language by clarifying alien (Christ's) righteousness versus infused righteousness.
 - Distinguishes Reformed orthodoxy from certain Federal Vision claims that blur justification and sanctification.

- **Conceptual/terminological clarity**
 - Reasserts technical terms such as **forensic (legal) declaration**, **imputation**, and **alien righteousness**, using them as precise theological tools rather than rhetorical tags.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded in confessional Reformed circles as a clear, compact pedagogical treatment; widely used in Reformed seminaries and by pastors for training and polemical clarity.
 - Cited in debates over NPP and Federal Vision as a reliable representative of classic Reformed defenses.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, historically informed defense of classical Reformed justification for teaching, polemic, and ecclesial catechesis; useful for clarifying pastoral consequences (assurance, preaching).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification** - God's forensic declaration that a sinner is righteous on account of Christ.
- **Forensic/legal declaration** - The nature of justification as a verdict rather than intrinsic moral transformation.
- **Imputation** - The accounting whereby Christ's righteousness is reckoned to believers and believers' sin is reckoned to Christ.
 - **Double imputation** - Sinner's guilt imputed to Christ; Christ's righteousness imputed to believer.
- **Union with Christ** - The relational ground that makes imputation and justification intelligible; believers are "in Christ."
- **Active obedience** - Christ's perfect fulfilling of the law credited to believers.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering and penal substitution bearing the penalty of sin.
- **Alien righteousness** - Righteousness belonging to Christ and attributed to believers (not intrinsic).
- **Sola fide / sola gratia** - Faith alone and grace alone as the means/ground of receiving justification.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive moral transformation-distinct from justification though related as fruit and evidence.
- **Infusion vs. imputation** - Catholic teaching of infused righteousness contrasted with Reformed imputed righteousness.
- **Covenant of grace** - The theological framework situating Christ's work and the believer's status.
- **Forensic assurance** - Pastoral implication: assurance flows from declared status, not subjective perfection.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: clear, confessional summary of classic Reformed justification for courses and catechesis.
- As **polemic**: concise rebuttal resource against New Perspective, Federal Vision, and Roman Catholic formulations.
- As an **exegetical-model**: example of integrating Pauline exegesis with historical theology to defend imputation and forensic language.
