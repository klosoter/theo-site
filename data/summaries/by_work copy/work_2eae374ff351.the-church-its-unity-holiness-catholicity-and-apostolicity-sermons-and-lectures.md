### TITLE
The Church: Its Unity, Holiness, Catholicity, and Apostolicity (sermons and lectures) - James Bannerman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century Scottish Reformed context (Bannerman 1807-1868). Response to revival of Anglican High Church/Tractarianism and to Roman ultramontane claims after Vatican I; written within Presbyterian theology and the framework of the Westminster standards.
 - Pastoral-lectural form: sermons and public lectures addressing church identity amid confessional and institutional controversies.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To define the Church of Christ by its four classical marks - **unity, holiness, catholicity, apostolicity** - understood on Reformed principles: the marks indicate the true Church by fidelity to Scripture and the Spirit's work rather than by mere outward continuity or hierarchical succession.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of each of the four marks in turn:
 - **Unity:** Distinguishes the invisible spiritual unity (bond of the Spirit around Christ and truth) from visible, institutional plurality; unity is organic and rooted in faith and sacramental fellowship, not uniform polity.
 - **Holiness:** The Church's holiness is both positional (Christ's sanctifying work) and progressive (sanctification in believers); visible church contains both saints and sinners, requiring discipline.
 - **Catholicity:** Catholicity = universality of the one Church across space and time in faithful witness to apostolic doctrine; not equivalent to Roman jurisdictional claims.
 - **Apostolicity:** Apostolicity defined primarily as fidelity to apostolic doctrine and order, not as unbroken juridical succession of episcopal ordination. The living continuity is doctrinal and spiritual.
 - Integrates biblical exegesis, patristic appeals, and Reformation principles to reject both Romanist and some High‑Church Anglican positions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture (NT ecclesiology), early Fathers (appealed to for continuity), Calvin, Knox, Westminster Confession; direct polemic against Roman Catholic claims (papal authority, sacramental system) and Tractarian Anglo‑Catholicism; interacts with contemporary debates about state control (Erastianism) and church order.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (church definition, marks), sacraments (nature and purpose), ministry and ordination, discipline, authority of Scripture, role of tradition, sanctification, covenantal understanding of church membership.

- **Closing line**
 - Bannerman's theological center: the true Church is identified by the Spirit‑wrought possession and proclamation of apostolic truth - a visible communion marked by spiritual unity and holiness, catholic in reach and apostolic in faith, not merely by external succession or state sanction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that **apostolicity = doctrinal fidelity**, not episcopal succession; apostolic continuity is spiritual and confessional.
 - Clear articulation of **visible/invisible church distinction** with rigorous pastoral consequences (discipline, membership standards).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Direct correction of Roman Catholicism: denies that sacramental efficacy or jurisdictional succession alone constitute the Church.
 - Contrasts with High‑Church Anglicanism (Tractarianism): resists confounding catholicity with institutional continuity of orders.
 - Opposes Erastian reduction of church authority to the state; defends Christ's headship and ecclesial autonomy in spiritual matters.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the four marks within a Reformed covenantal and pneumatological framework: marks function as evidences produced by the Spirit's work around Christ and Scripture.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Presbyterian and Reformed circles as a concise, authoritative statement of classical Reformed ecclesiology during a period of liturgical and institutional challenges.
 - Used as a polemical resource against Roman and Anglo‑Catholic claims; cited in later confessional restorations and debates over ordination and church order.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for reading the "marks" as theological criteria rather than institutional logos; valuable for teaching ecclesiology, church order, and polemics while retaining pastoral sensitivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Unity (visible vs invisible)** - Unity as spiritual bond in Christ (invisible) and as outward communion of worship and discipline (visible); both necessary but distinct.
- **Holiness** - Church's sanctification grounded in Christ; visible holiness imperfect and requires discipline and means of grace.
- **Catholicity** - Universality of the Church insofar as it bears apostolic truth across time and geography; rejects jurisdictional monopoly claims.
- **Apostolicity (doctrinal vs succession)** - Primary sense: fidelity to apostolic teaching and ministry; secondary sense: commemorative historical succession, not ontologically constitutive.
- **Marks of the Church** - The four classical marks reinterpreted in Reformed theology as tests of authenticity.
- **Visible Church** - External congregation, sacraments, ministry, mixed membership; locus of pastoral oversight.
- **Invisible Church** - Sum of the elect known to God, united to Christ by faith.
- **Sacraments (signs and seals)** - Means of grace as instituted signs; efficacy tied to Christ and faith, not to sacerdotal status alone.
- **Ministry and Ordination** - Office derived from Scripture and apostolic practice; legitimacy tied to faithful preaching and administration, not merely to episcopal lineage.
- **Discipline and Keys** - Practical upshot of holiness and visibility; necessary for church purity.
- **Scripture as rule** - Final authority for apostolic doctrine and church order.
- **Confession and continuity** - Use of Reformation confessions as indices of catholic continuity in doctrine.
- **Pneumatological grounding** - Emphasis that the Spirit preserves unity and apostolicity through truth.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed ecclesiology and for teaching the four marks understood confessionaly.
 - As **polemic** against Roman Catholic and Tractarian claims concerning succession and sacramental efficacy.
 - As an **exegetical and confessional model** for applying the marks pastorally (membership, discipline, ministry).
