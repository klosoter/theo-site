### TITLE
A Free Disputation Against Pretended Liberty of Conscience (1649) - Samuel Rutherford

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1649 amid British Isles turmoil after the English Civil War; theocratic and covenantal debates between Presbyterians/Covenanters, Independents, sectaries, and emergent arguments for religious toleration. Rutherford writes as a Scottish Reformed divine addressing practical and political consequences of tolerating divergent belief and practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** There is no lawful, absolute "liberty of conscience" to profess and practice error; conscience is bound by Scripture, covenant obligations, and rightful ecclesiastical and civil authority. The magistrate and church must restrain and correct public error to preserve gospel purity and civil peace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scripture and natural law bind conscience; conscience cannot be a private judge against revealed truth.
 - Covenantal obligations (corporate pledges of nations and churches) create public duties that justify civil enforcement of true religion.
 - The magistrate, acting within God-ordained limits, has power and duty to suppress public heresy and maintain ecclesiastical order.
 - Church officers and discipline are necessary to preserve the visible church; toleration undermines this by dissolving jurisdiction.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Opposes the arguments of proponents of toleration and sectaries of mid-17th century England (broadly: Independents, Brownists, Anabaptists, and some civil libertarians).
 - Draws on Scripture, patristic and scholastic authorities, Calvinist theology, and Scottish Covenanter practice.
- **Doctrines treated:** Conscience, covenant theology (corporate covenants and obligations), ecclesiology (visible church, offices, discipline), magistracy and civil authority, soteriology implications for church membership, and polemical theology toward heresy.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Rutherford centers a covenantal, communally constrained conscience under Scripture and rightly ordered authority - rejecting individualistic liberty as destructive of church purity and covenantal fidelity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong link between **national covenants** and magistral responsibility; public covenants bind nations to enforce true religion.
 - Treats conscience not as an autonomous tribunal but as relationally and legally bound within covenant and church structures.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Directly opposes emergent tolerationist thought that elevates private conscience above public order and ecclesial jurisdiction.
 - Contrasts with Independent/Presbyterian compromises that favor voluntary church affiliation by insisting on enforcement of external conformity where covenants exist.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Labels religious freedom as a **"pretended" liberty**, reframing the toleration claim as illegitimate when it enables error.
 - Tightens language around **public conscience** versus private scruple, insisting on corporate accountability.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among Scottish Covenanters and conservative Reformed polemicists; used to justify strict ecclesial discipline and civil measures against sects.
 - Criticized by later dissenting and Enlightenment writers advocating conscience rights and religious liberty.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A primary source for the Reformed critique of toleration and for understanding covenantal Presbyterian polity.
 - Valuable for courses on church-state relations, early modern polemics, and development of Reformed political theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liberty of Conscience (pretended liberty):** The central contested phrase - Rutherford denies an unrestricted right to believe/act against revealed truth; distinguishes lawful liberty (within Scripture/covenant) from pretended liberty (permitting error).
- **Conscience (bound vs. free):** Conscience is morally and covenantally bound; "freedom" that contradicts Scripture is false freedom.
- **Covenant (corporate/national):**
 - Emphasizes national and church covenants as binding communal commitments that impose public duties.
 - Use: links to Covenant Of Redemption insofar as public covenanting expresses corporate fidelity to redemptive purposes.
- **Magistrate / Civil Power:** God-ordained office with duty to restrain public heresy and maintain religious order within covenant obligations.
- **Visible Church:** The corporate body accountable for discipline and oversight; protects truth through offices and censures.
- **Offices & Discipline:** Presbyterian polity elements stressed - elders and ministers share responsibility to guard doctrine and exercise censures.
- **Heresy / Error:** Public threats to doctrinal purity warrant civil and ecclesiastical response; toleration exacerbates contagion.
- **National Covenant / Solemn League:** Historical instruments cited to justify public enforcement of religion in covenanting nations.
- **Public Religion vs. Private Worship:** Rutherford privileges public, covenantal religion (ordered worship and discipline) over privatized, unconstrained devotion.
- **Liberty vs. License:** Distinguishes lawful Christian liberty (obedience within God's law) from license to deviate from creedal truth.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Ultimate norm binding conscience and grounding magistral and ecclesial duties.
- **Church-State Relation:** Interdependent model - state supports ecclesial order; church informs state responsibility.
- **Discipline as Salvific Means:** Discipline is portrayed as both protective of the church and instrumentally tied to covenantal salvation promises.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against toleration and a canonical statement of Reformed civil-ecclesial order.
 - As a **source** in teaching Presbyterian polity and discipline (offices, magistrate responsibilities).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in studies of Covenant theology (corporate obligations) and debates on the Covenant Of Redemption and public religion.
