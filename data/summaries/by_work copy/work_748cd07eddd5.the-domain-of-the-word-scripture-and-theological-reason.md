### TITLE
The Domain of the Word: Scripture and Theological Reason - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century retrieval of classical Christian dogmatics within a post-Barth, postcritical milieu.
 - Responds to historicist biblical criticism and autonomous public reason; contributes to the theological interpretation of Scripture (TIS) movement.
- **Central thesis**
 - Theology belongs within the triune God's self-communicative domain. Scripture is a sanctified, creaturely instrument by which the Word and Spirit generate and regulate theological reason; theology is a holy science with principia given by God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Dogmatic location:** Place Scripture, canon, and reason within the economy of the Word and Spirit; divine agency is primary, creaturely agency instrumental.
 - **Principia of theology:** God as **principium essendi**; revelation/Scripture as **principium cognoscendi**, received in faith within the church.
 - **Sanctified intelligence:** The intellect is reconciled and reordered by grace; theological reasoning is an act of regenerate participation, not neutral technique.
 - **Canon and church:** Canon is an effect of God's self-giving; tradition is ministerial recognition and service to the canon, not constitutive authority.
 - **Biblical reasoning:** Reading as spiritual, ecclesial, and moral activity ordered to God; exegesis within dogmatic rule (creed, rule of faith) and under sanctification.
 - **Modernity critiqued:** Rejects historicism and methodological naturalism that exclude God's agency from hermeneutics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Reformed scholastics (principia doctrine), and Barth; contrasts Schleiermacher and post-Kantian historicism; converses with TIS and evangelical ressourcement.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), Scripture, canon and tradition, Trinity and missions, creation and sanctification, sin and reconciliation, ecclesiology, theological method.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological reason is the church's reconciled intelligence, sanctified by Word and Spirit to hear, confess, and obey the triune God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as a holy science: cognitive act encompassed by God's sanctifying presence.
 - Non-competitive agency: divine primacy elevates, not erases, creaturely instrumentality (Scripture, canon, church).
 - Moral ontology of reading: exegesis requires repentance, patience, and ecclesial discipline.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against historicism: Scripture's objectivity is God's ongoing self-communication, not merely historical artifact.
 - Against biblicism: insists on dogmatic location and ecclesial rule; against traditionalism: tradition is servant to canon.
 - Against autonomous reason: theological knowledge is principled by revelation, not by putative neutrality.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The **domain** metaphor (realm established by God's communicative presence).
 - Rearticulation of **principia** (essendi/cognoscendi) for contemporary dogmatics.
 - **Biblical reasoning** as an integrative account of exegesis and doctrine.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant in Reformed catholicity and evangelical dogmatics; reshaped discourse on prolegomena, canon, and TIS; widely cited in debates on theology as science.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent map for locating Scripture, reason, and church within the triune economy; provides durable vocabulary and posture for theological work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Domain of the Word**: The sphere constituted by God's self-communicative presence wherein Scripture and theology properly occur.
- **Principium essendi**: God himself as the ontological ground of theology.
- **Principium cognoscendi**: God's self-revelation, normatively in Holy Scripture, as the cognitive ground of theology.
- **Sanctification of reason**: Renewal of intellect by Word and Spirit; the condition for theological understanding.
- **Biblical reasoning**: The church's disciplined, prayerful construal of reality from Scripture within dogmatic rule.
- **Dogmatic location**: Positioning doctrines (e.g., canon) within the triune economy to avoid abstraction or reduction.
- **Canon**: The Spirit-given, apostolic-prophetic writings that norm the church; effect of revelation, not its cause.
 - Tradition is ministerial recognition; canon is magisterial rule.
- **Rule of faith**: The church's summarizing creed that guides exegesis and doctrinal coherence under Scripture.
- **Non-competitive causality**: Divine and creaturely agencies are asymmetrically ordered; divine primacy enables creaturely efficacy.
- **General vs. special revelation**: Creation discloses God truly; special revelation in Christ/Scripture saves and corrects; theology arises from the latter while acknowledging the former.
- **Aseity and missions**: The triune God's self-sufficiency and outgoing acts ground revelation's freedom.
- **Reconciled intelligence**: Theologizing as an act of those restored to fellowship with God.
- **Ecclesial reading**: Interpretation located in the church's worship, confession, and catechesis.
- **Objectivity as gift**: Scriptural authority is given by God's act, not constructed by community consensus.
- **Peace of the church**: The telos of theology as edification and unity under the Word.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Theological Method (principia; theology as holy science; regenerate reason).
 - Canon and Tradition (dogmatic location of canon; tradition's ministerial role).
 - General and Special Revelation (ordering of general to special; critique of foundational naturalism).
 - Nature and Task of Theology (ecclesial, doxological, sanctified practice ordered to the church's peace).
