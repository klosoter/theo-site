### TITLE
Trinitarian Doctrine: A Summary History - Stephen R. Holmes (The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary academic systematic theology (Oxford Handbook volume). Designed as a compact historical-theological survey for advanced students and scholars; presupposes familiarity with patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity is best understood as a historically contingent but theologically constrained attempt to mediate the biblical "economic" revelation of the triune God into coherent ontological and devotional language that avoids modalism and subordinationism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Rapid chronological sweep with thematic stops:
 - Patristic response to modalism and Arianism; development of ousia/hypostasis vocabulary.
 - Cappadocians' contribution to personhood and relational ontology.
 - Augustine and Latin reflection on unity, procession, and psychological analogies.
 - Medieval scholastic refinement (analogy, simplicity, procession).
 - Reformation-era retrievals (creedal fidelity, anti-scholastic emphases).
 - 19th-20th century shifts: historical-critical pressures, renewed patristic interest, and modern theological moves (Barth, Rahner, Moltmann, Torrance).
 - Contemporary debates: social vs classical Trinitarianisms, economy vs immanent Trinity, apologetic and pastoral uses.
 - Holmes repeatedly insists that the creeds and councils remain normative checkpoints for legitimate doctrinal variation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Tertullian, Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Barth, Rahner, Moltmann, Torrance - plus recent interlocutors in social-Trinity debates and Reformed apologetics (including mention of Van Til).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), person/hypostasis, ousia (essence), procession(s), perichoresis, divine simplicity, relation and distinction, Christology as implicated by Trinitarian language, implications for revelation and ecclesial worship.
- **Closing line**
 - Holmes situates Trinitarian doctrine as the church's creedal attempt to hold **the unity of God and the real distinction of Persons** in sustained theological, pastoral, and apologetic practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Historical sweep that treats patristic formulations as formative rather than merely antiquarian; stresses relational ontology (persons as relations) without lapsing into recent social-Trinity rhetoric unmoored from the creeds.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on both extremes:
 - Against modalism and simplistic unitarian reductions.
 - Against certain social-Trinitarian or modern philosophical accounts that risk making the Trinity a construct of relationality divorced from creedal constraints.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Reaffirms the importance of classical technical vocabulary (ousia/hypostasis) while showing how different epochs reinterpreted these terms in response to pastoral and philosophical pressures.
- **Engagement with Van Til's "one-person language"**
 - Holmes notes and critically assesses Van Tilian tendencies to compress Trinitarian language for apologetic ends; he treats "one-person language" as an apologetic strategy that may safeguard divine simplicity but risks collapsing proper personal distinctions or confusing the economic/immanent distinction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as a reliable, judicious historical summary in Reformed and broader Protestant theological training; recommended for students who need a balanced historically grounded account before advancing to specialized debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches methodological restraint: historical fidelity to creeds, cautious appropriation of philosophical categories, and attentiveness to pastoral consequences of doctrinal formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed and active in history; the starting point for theological formulations.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God as God is in Godself; theological extrapolation from economic revelation.
- **Ousia (essence)**
 - The unified divine substance - classical safeguard of divine unity.
- **Hypostasis / Person**
 - The three distinct centers of personal identity within the divine life; crucial for avoiding modalism.
- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling; term used to describe relational interpenetration of the Persons.
- **Modalism (Sabellianism)**
 - Error that collapses Persons into modes; background foil for most historical developments.
- **Subordinationism**
 - Error positing ontological inferiority of Son or Spirit; repeatedly rejected in the creeds.
- **Divine simplicity**
 - Classical doctrine emphasizing lack of parts in God; tensions with some modern relational accounts noted.
- **Social Trinitarianism**
 - Contemporary movement emphasizing personhood and relations; Holmes treats it critically when it departs from creedal constraints.
- **One-person language (Van Til)**
 - Apologetic tendency to emphasize divine unity by using "one-person" terms to avoid metaphysical complexity.
 - Holmes's critique: useful safeguard for divine simplicity but potentially detrimental to proper Trinitarian distinctions and Christological personhood; recommends careful distinction between rhetorical/apologetic moves and doctrinal formulation.
- **Economy vs. Immanence distinction**
 - Emphasized as methodological necessity: do not read speculative ontologies back into the revealed economy.
- **Analogical predication**
 - Key hermeneutical device for speaking about God analogically rather than univocally.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for historical contours of Trinitarian doctrine.
- As a **polemic resource** against both modalist reductions and unmoored social-Trinity formulations.
- As an **exegetical-model primer**: shows how creedal language mediates scriptural claims into doctrinal categories.
