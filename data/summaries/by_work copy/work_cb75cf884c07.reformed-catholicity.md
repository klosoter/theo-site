### TITLE
**Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation** 
Michael Allen and Scott R. Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century Protestant ressourcement; evangelical-Reformed response to biblicism and ecclesial amnesia; constructive engagement with Theological Interpretation of Scripture and the recovery of classical theism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can Reformed theology be genuinely catholic (according to the whole) without surrendering sola Scriptura? Answer: by a principled retrieval of patristic, medieval, and Reformed orthodox sources under Scripture as the norma normans.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define **catholicity** as breadth and depth within the rule of faith, not Roman jurisdictional claims.
 - Clarify **sola Scriptura vs. nuda Scriptura**: Scripture alone as supreme norm does not exclude ministerial authority of creeds, confessions, and teachers.
 - Commend **retrieval (ressourcement)**: reading Scripture with the church across ages, using dogmatics to guide exegesis and vice versa.
 - Defend **scholastic method** and metaphysical clarity as aids to piety and precision, not enemies of spirituality.
 - Articulate the **rule of faith** and **analogy of faith** as hermeneutical canons; affirm **good and necessary consequence** for doctrinal inference.
 - Locate theology **ecclesially**: interpretation belongs to the baptized community, shaped by liturgy, catechesis, and office.
 - Offer case engagements in **Trinity** and classical doctrines to model doctrinally regulated exegesis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture; creeds (Apostles, Nicene, Chalcedon); Augustine, Athanasius; Aquinas; Calvin; Junius on principia; Turretin, Polanus, Owen; Bavinck; modern interlocutors include Richard Muller, Heiko Oberman, John Webster, Kevin Vanhoozer, Brevard Childs, D. H. Williams; engagement (critically and sympathetically) with Roman Catholic ressourcement and evangelical TIS.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; tradition and authority; ecclesiology of interpretation; Trinity (simplicity, processions, missions); Christology (rule-of-faith boundaries); creation and providence implicitly via classical theism; theological method and principia.
- **Closing line:** A Reformed church is most Reformed when it is most catholic, receiving the whole churchs wisdom ministerially under the sole, final authority of Holy Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reframing catholicity as a Reformed virtue, not a rival identity.
 - Strong account of confessions as subordinate norms within the interpretive economy.
 - Integration of scholastic precision with doxological and pastoral aims.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **biblicism/primitivism**: denies that solo Scripture or historical naivete honors the Reformers.
 - Against **traditionalism**: tradition is a servant, not a second source of revelation.
 - Nuancing some TIS tendencies by insisting on dogmatic clarity and metaphysical realism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Fresh articulation of **ministerial vs. magisterial** authority.
 - Renewed emphasis on **good and necessary consequence** and **rule of faith** as hermeneutical rules.
 - Retrieval as a sustained habit, not a sporadic quotation of fathers.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed seminaries for prolegomena and hermeneutics; catalyzed Protestant retrieval across confessional lines.
 - Often paired with Muller on Reformed orthodoxy and with Webster/Vanhoozer on theological interpretation.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A stable template for holding sola Scriptura with ecclesial memory.
 - Pedagogically useful for catechesis in reading Scripture with the church.
 - Bridges exegesis, dogmatics, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura:** Scripture alone as supreme norm; permits but regulates tradition.
 - Contrast: **Nuda/solo Scriptura** rejects tradition; the book rejects this.
- **Norma normans / norma normata:** Scripture as the norming norm; creeds/confessions as normed norms.
- **Ministerial vs. magisterial authority:** The church teaches under Scripture; only God in Scripture rules absolutely.
- **Ressourcement / retrieval:** Returning to classic sources to renew doctrine and exegesis for today.
- **Regula fidei (rule of faith):** Creedal summary guiding reading and setting doctrinal boundaries.
- **Analogy of faith:** Interpret Scripture in harmony with whole-bible teaching and creedal core.
- **Good and necessary consequence:** Legitimate doctrinal inference from Scripture, not only explicit statements.
- **Principia of theology:** Juniuss principium essendi (God) and cognoscendi (Scripture/Spirit) framing method.
- **Theological exegesis:** Reading that is ecclesial, confessional, and directed toward confessing God rightly.
- **Catholicity:** According to the whole; breadth across time and space within apostolic truth.
- **Scholastic method:** Ordered distinctions and disputations serving clarity, not arid speculation.
- **Classical theism:** Simplicity, immutability, and Trinitarian processions/missions as retrieved grammar.
- **Confessionality:** Binding yet reformable standards that tutor biblical interpretation.
- **Ecclesial location:** Interpretation occurs in the churchs liturgy, catechesis, and offices.

- **How this work is used:**
 - **Definition source** for sola Scriptura, rule of faith, and ministerial authority.
 - **Conceptual pivot** for integrating exegesis and dogmatics in prolegomena.
 - **Pedagogical model** for retrieval-driven reading across loci, especially Trinity and Scripture.
 - **Polemic and constructive resource** against biblicism and against traditionalism alike.
