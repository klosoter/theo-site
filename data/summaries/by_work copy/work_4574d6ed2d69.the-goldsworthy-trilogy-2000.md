### TITLE
The Goldsworthy Trilogy (2000) - Graeme Goldsworthy 
Collected presentation of Goldsworthy's Christ‑centred biblical theology and hermeneutic, emphasizing the unity of Scripture through promise, fulfillment and consummation.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th century evangelical and Reformed biblical‑theology milieu; product of a sustained pastoral and academic engagement with preaching and hermeneutics. Collected in 2000 as a concise presentation of Goldsworthy's mature method.
 - Responds to trends in dispensationalism, moralistic or proof‑text preaching, and fragmentation between OT and NT interpretation.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible is a unified, Christ‑centred revelation: the Old Testament is Christian Scripture when read as part of a single redemptive narrative of promise, fulfillment (in Christ), and consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture must be read canonically with the gospel as the controlling idea.
 - Major hermeneutical sequence: God gives a promise → history, institutions and types point forward → Christ is the fulfillment → church life and preaching witness to consummation.
 - Advocates typological and covenantal reading that preserves historical particularity while recognizing theological continuity between Testaments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages implicitly with the biblical‑theology movement and with covenantal traditions (Vosian and Reformed streams) and stands as corrective to dispensational literalism and moralistic sermonizing.
 - Dialogues with biblical criticism only insofar as it affects canonical and theological interpretation; more pastoral/homiletical than technical critical work.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as unified revelation), Christology (Christ as centre and fulfillment), Covenant (promise and fulfillment framework), Kingdom (eschatological centre), Typology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology (church as witness to fulfillment).
- **Closing line**
 - Goldsworthy's theological center of gravity: the gospel of Jesus Christ governs the reading of all Scripture so that promise, fulfillment, and consummation provide the single interpretive line through both Testaments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that the Old Testament is legitimately "Christian Scripture" when read Christologically; not annexed but integral to gospel proclamation.
 - Practical homiletical concern: whole‑Bible preaching must be governed by the gospel pattern rather than isolated moral lessons or topical proof‑texts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counteracts dispensational compartmentalization of OT and NT and the tendency to moralize the text apart from its redemptive‑historical trajectory.
 - Offers an alternative to strictly historical‑critical reductionism by privileging theological unity without denying historical particularity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the phrase and practice of a "Christ‑centred" or "promise‑fulfillment" hermeneutic in evangelical circles.
 - Clarified and streamlined the tripartite interpretive pattern (promise → fulfillment → consummation) as a default reading grid.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries, homiletics courses, and preaching movements (notably English‑speaking Anglican and Presbyterian contexts).
 - Served as a key pedagogical tool for training pastors to read and preach the Bible as a single gospel story.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable for teaching and sermon preparation: a clear, pastorally oriented model that makes canonical theology accessible and actionable.
 - Endures as a corrective canonical lens though it invites supplementary interaction with detailed historical criticism and recent canonical theory.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ‑centred (hermeneutic)** - reading every text in light of Christ as the aim and fulfillment of revelation.
- **Promise → Fulfillment → Consummation** - the basic redemptive‑historical pattern Goldsworthy recommends as the controlling storyline.
- **Typology** - theological pattern where persons/rites/events of the OT signify and anticipate their fulfillment in Christ (type → antitype).
- **Covenant (frame)** - theological grid of promise and fulfillment; not merely legal contracts but God's redemptive commitments across history.
- **Kingdom** - eschatological and present reality centered in Christ's reign; serves as hermeneutical theme linking OT hope and NT fulfillment.
- **Old Testament as Christian Scripture** - claim that OT belongs within and serves the Christian canon when read gospel‑centredly.
- **Canonical reading** - reading texts within the final shape of Scripture, emphasizing theological coherence over isolated historical readings.
- **Gospel (controlling idea)** - the lynchpin concept that organizes theological reading, preaching, and application.
- **Redemptive history** - narrative approach focusing on God's saving acts and progressive revelation culminating in Christ.
- **Homiletical application** - emphasis on translating canonical insight into faithful sermon practice; resists proof‑texting and moralizing.
- **Promise‑fulfillment hermeneutic** - methodological label for Goldsworthy's interpretive move from covenant promises to Christ's fulfillment.
- **Typological antitype** - the New Testament person/event (Christ) that fulfills an Old Testament type.
- **Unity of Scripture** - affirmation that OT and NT together form one coherent witness to Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "Christ‑centred biblical theology" in courses and curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational fragmentation and moralizing preaching.
 - As an **exegetical/homiletical model** for preaching the whole Bible as Christian Scripture.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed evangelical training: integrating covenantal categories with narrative and typological emphasis.
