### TITLE
**Jesus is Lord: Christology Yesterday and Today** - Donald Macleod

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed/evangelical apologetic and academic milieu; responds to both liberal-critical historiography and modernist reductions of Christology.
 - Situated amid renewed interest in classical Christology, post-war ecumenical dialogue, and intra-evangelical debates over the incarnation and ethical implications of Christology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Affirmation that historic, creedal Christology (eternal Son, two natures in one person) remains the necessary framework for faithful biblical and systematic understanding of Jesus as Lord, and that contemporary deviations (modern kenosis proposals, functional reductions) distort salvation and worship.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological survey: traces Christological development from New Testament witness through patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern receptions.
 - Biblical-theological exegesis: marshals New Testament data to defend the coexistence of full deity and genuine humanity.
 - Systematic engagement: interacts with modern proposals (kenotic theology, functional Christologies) and defends doctrines such as impeccability, eternal Sonship, and the munus triplex from both exegetical and dogmatic angles.
 - Practical-theological implications: shows how Christology shapes soteriology, worship, ethics, and pastoral ministry.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic authorities (e.g., Athanasius, Cyril), Chalcedon, reformers (e.g., Calvin), modern critics and proponents (kenotic theologians, B. Barth elements, neo-orthodoxy), and contemporary evangelical scholars.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, incarnation, hypostatic union, two natures, eternal Sonship, impeccability, kenosis (and its critiques), munus triplex (prophet, priest, king), revelation and atonement.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Macleod argues that a historically grounded, biblically faithful classical Christology is indispensable: Jesus is Lord precisely because he is the eternal Son who assumed true humanity without forfeiting divine personhood or saving efficacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stronger insistence on doctrinal continuity with creedal formulations as guardrails against modern innovations that either dilute deity or reduce humanity to mere appearance.
 - Balanced attention to both historical reception and contemporary pastoral implications.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Explicit critique of kenoticism: rejects the notion that the Son "emptied" himself of divine attributes in a way that compromises omniscience, omnipotence, or immutability.
 - Counters radical functional Christologies that subordinate ontological claims to ethical or relational models of Jesus.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-presents classical categories (e.g., eternal Sonship, hypostatic union) with renewed exegetical argumentation aimed at evangelical readers rather than purely academic theologians.
 - Emphasizes a careful distinction between *what* the Son assumes (real human properties) and *who* the Son remains (the divine person).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, accessible corrective to liberal and speculative modern Christologies.
 - Influential for pastors and seminary teachers in reasserting classical formulations; occasionally criticized by proponents of kenotic or nonhistoricist accounts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for defending the continuity of orthodoxy in a plural theological marketplace; serves as a bridge between historical theology and contemporary pastoral concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Sonship**
 - Asserts the Son's personal, eternal relation to the Father prior to incarnation; Macleod defends against "adoptionist" or merely functional readings.

- **Incarnation**
 - The eternal Son taking real human nature; emphasis on genuine human properties united to the divine person without mixture.

- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Two natures united in one person; Macleod insists on Chalcedonian balance to protect both full deity and full humanity.

- **Kenosis / Kenotic Theories**
 - Theories that the Son "emptied" divine attributes in the incarnation. Macleod critiques these as risking the loss of essential divine attributes and undermining salvific efficacy.
 - Distinguishes between legitimate self-limitation (voluntary accommodation) and ontological relinquishment (rejected).

- **Impeccability of Christ**
 - Doctrine that Christ could not sin; Macleod argues for compatibility with genuine temptation and full humanity, maintaining moral integrity and necessity for saving work.

- **Munus Triplex (Threefold Office)**
 - Christ's roles as Prophet, Priest, King; used to integrate Christ's person with his mediatorial functions and pastoral implications.

- **Two Natures (Dyophysitism)**
 - Clarifies how properties are ascribed: acts sometimes attributed to the person (not to one nature alone) to avoid confusion.

- **Person of Christ / Personal Union**
 - Focus on personal attribution of both divine and human acts to the one person; safeguards against Nestorian and Eutychian errors.

- **Chalcedonian Framework**
 - Appeals to Chalcedon as normative; Macleod uses it as hermeneutical-locus for contemporary debates.

- **Soteriological Implications**
 - How Christ's divine-human identity secures atonement, resurrection, and mediation.

- **Revelation & Worship**
 - Christology as the foundation of divine self-disclosure and rightful human response.

- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitional source: affirms classical definitions for dogmatic entries (incarnation, hypostatic union).
 - As polemic: frequently cited in rebuttals to kenotic and "functional-only" Christologies.
 - As exegetical model: offers readings of New Testament Christological texts used in NT-theology courses.
 - As conceptual pivot in practical theology: grounds preaching, liturgy, and pastoral care in robust Christology.
