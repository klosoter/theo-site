### TITLE
**Seized by Truth: Reading the Bible as Scripture** - Joel B. Green

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st century evangelical theological milieu (post-1990s). Responds to debates about the authority and function of Scripture within evangelical and broader Protestant theology; engages canonical and theological interpretation movements and recent work in hermeneutics and formation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Bible must be read as Scripture - not merely as historical data or private devotional text - because Scripture functions as formative truth that "seizes" readers, shaping cognition, moral perception, and embodied life in community.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Stage-setting critique of reductive historical-critical and purely propositional/foundationalist readings that detach truth from formation.
 - Positive account of Scripture as a theological and communicative act of God: texts are performative and formative when read within the life of the church.
 - Exegetical demonstrations showing how canonical shape, narrative, and rhetorical force aim at whole-person transformation.
 - Practical implications: ecclesial reading practices, preaching, teaching, and pastoral formation that honor psychosomatic unity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Dialogues with Brevard Childs (canonical theology), Kevin J. Vanhoozer (theological interpretation), proponents of historical criticism, and thinkers in philosophical hermeneutics (e.g., Gadamerian concerns about horizons). N.T. Wright and ethicists such as Stanley Hauerwas inform elements of narrative and community ethics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and authority of Scripture; ecclesiology (reading as communal act); anthropology (esp. psychosomatic unity and embodied formation); ethics and sanctification; implicit Christological and Trinitarian background informing Scripture's communicative action.
- **Closing line:** Scripture as Scripture is truth that, when read within covenantal community, seizes the whole person (mind, body, and will) into participation in the life of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The metaphor of being "seized by truth" captures Scripture as an event that overcomes individual autonomy and effects moral-psychosomatic formation.
 - Strong integration of hermeneutics and spiritual formation: reading is both interpretive and transformative.
 - Explicit attention to embodied human nature (psychosomatic unity): Scripture addresses and reshapes embodied persons, not disembodied souls.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects propositionalist models that reduce Scripture to a set of detached doctrines or information.
 - Challenges liberal-critical tendencies that treat biblical texts solely as historical artifacts, divorced from their formative ecclesial function.
 - Builds on but nuances Childs and Vanhoozer: affirms canonical contours while insisting on ecclesial practices that allow Scripture to seize readers.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Seized" as technical metaphor for the persuasive, formative power of scriptural truth.
 - Framing reading as a bodily, ecclesial practice rather than merely cognitive assent.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in evangelical seminaries for connecting exegesis with spiritual formation and ecclesiology.
 - Influential for those pursuing theological interpretation that is both scholarly and practicially oriented.
 - Received mixed critique from strict historical-critical scholars who question the ontological claim of Scripture "seizing" readers.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a practical bridge between academic hermeneutics and parish formation.
 - Models how to incorporate biblical anthropology (psychosomatic unity) into exegesis and ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture as Scripture:** Reading texts in their canonical, ecclesial role rather than as isolated literature.
- **Seized by truth:** Truth conceived as a formative, persuasive event that captures the whole person.
- **Formative truth:** Truth that not only informs belief but shapes desires, habits, and embodied life.
- **Canonical shape:** Attention to the ordering and theological logic of the biblical canon.
- **Theological interpretation:** Reading Scripture with explicit theological, ecclesial aims rather than neutral historicism.
- **Communicative act of God:** Scripture as God's speech-act that intends transformation in readers.
- **Ecclesial reading:** Corporate, liturgical, and communal practices of interpretation that enable Scripture's formative effect.
- **Psychosomatic unity (Human Nature):** Human beings as integrated body-soul unities; formation must attend to embodied practices.
 - Contrasts with dualistic anthropology that separates spiritual formation from bodily practices.
- **Hermeneutical circle (revisited):** Interaction between text, reader, and community horizon that allows truth to seize readers.
- **Rhetorical/performative force:** Emphasis on how biblical discourse functions to move and shape audiences.
- **Authority vs. autonomy:** Theological claim that Scripture's authority disrupts individualistic autonomy by inviting communal submission.
- **Narrative identity:** How canonical story shapes communal and personal identity through formation.
- **Practical theology integration:** Linking exegesis with pastoral practices and formation strategies.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what it means to read "Scripture" theologically (useful in hermeneutics syllabi).
 - As a **polemic** against both reductive historical-critical and fundamentalist-propositional approaches (used in debates over authority).
 - As an **exegetical model** emphasizing canonical shape, rhetorical force, and embodied formation for preaching and spiritual formation curricula.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating biblical anthropology (psychosomatic unity) into theology, ethics, and pastoral practice.
