### TITLE
Has the Church Replaced Israel? A Theological Evaluation (The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, 2011) - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 2011 in a conservative evangelical venue (SBJT). Situated within late 20th-21st century Reformed-evangelical debates over Israel, supersessionism, and eschatology.
 - Engages contemporary Pauline scholarship and pastoral-theological concerns about Christian attitudes toward ethnic Israel and biblical promises.
- **Central thesis**
 - The church has not replaced Israel; Paul's argument in Romans 9-11 affirms both the continuity of God's promises and the future salvation of ethnic Israel without collapsing Israel into the church in a way that nullifies God's covenantal faithfulness.
- **Core argument/structure**
 - Close exegesis of Romans 9-11, with Romans 11 as the climactic corrective to any notion of total and permanent rejection of Israel.
 - Romans 11:11-24: Olive-tree metaphor - Gentile ingrafting does not obliterate the original place of the natural branches; God's covenantal promises remain operative.
 - Romans 11:25-32: The "mystery" and future turning of Israel; Paul anticipates a national restoration/salvation of Israel in God's eschatological plan.
 - Romans 11:29: "Gifts and calling of God are irrevocable" used as theological hinge against replacement theology.
 - Theological synthesis: Holds continuity of promises (covenantal continuity) while maintaining distinction between Israel (ethnic, covenants to the fathers) and the church as the body of Christ composed of believing Jews and Gentiles.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Pauline commentators and interlocutors in recent scholarship (pro/anti-supersessionist voices). Implicitly responds to strands of classical supersessionism and to views minimizing ethnic Israel's future (sometimes associated with certain covenantal theologies).
 - Interacts with exegetical tradition on Romans 9-11 (e.g., Moo, Dunn, Wright-style readings).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (promise-fulfillment relation), election, soteriology, ecclesiology (identity of the church), eschatology (Israel's future), Pauline hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner locates the theological center of gravity in God's faithfulness: biblical exegesis of Romans 9-11 requires that we affirm both the incorporation of Gentiles and the irrevocable place of Israel within God's redemptive plan.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong exegetical commitment to Romans 9-11 as decisive for the question of replacement; emphasizes Paul's pastoral and theological concern for Israel's future.
 - Balances covenantal continuity with a refusal to equate ethnic Israel exhaustively with the visible church.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects classical supersessionism by insisting the New Testament language (esp. Romans 11) affirms future corporate blessing for Israel and the non-revocability of certain divine promises.
 - Distinguishes from both hard-line replacement models and from absolutist "two-covenant" separations that deny ecclesial incorporation of believing Jews.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Reappropriates Paul's metaphors (olive tree, remnant, mystery) to argue for a nuanced unity-and-distinction model rather than replacement or dissolution.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in Reformed-evangelical circles as a concise, pastoral, exegetically-driven rebuttal to supersessionism.
 - Cited in debates over Christian responsibilities toward Israel, eschatological forecasting, and covenantal interpretation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model of combining careful Pauline exegesis with theological reflection; valuable for courses on Pauline theology, ecclesiology, and covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Supersessionism / Replacement theology**
 - The claim that the church has fully replaced ethnic Israel in God's plan; Schreiner argues against this as inconsistent with Romans 9-11.
- **Olive-tree metaphor (Romans 11)**
 - Central exegetical image: natural branches (Israel) were broken off; wild branches (Gentiles) grafted in - but original root/stock remains.
- **Remnant**
 - Paul's concept of a faithful minority within Israel; Schreiner uses this to explain continuity without uniform acceptance.
- **Mystery (mysterion)**
 - Paul's "mystery" that Gentile inclusion does not preclude future national salvation of Israel.
- **Irrevocable gifts and calling (charismata kai klesis)**
 - Romans 11:29 as theological anchor: God's oath, promises, and election vis-a-vis Israel remain in force.
- **Covenant continuity**
 - Theological claim that God's promises to the patriarchs maintain force; the church participates but does not annul those promises.
- **Election**
 - Divine choosing of Israel and of believers; Schreiner emphasizes corporate and eschatological dimensions.
- **Eschatological restoration**
 - The future turning/salvation of Israel anticipated by Paul; Schreiner reads Romans 11 as non-symbolic about Israel's future.
- **Ecclesiology**
 - The church is the body of Christ composed of believing Jews and Gentiles, not a simple renaming of ethnic Israel.
- **Pauline hermeneutics**
 - Priority of Paul's argument in Romans for adjudicating theological claims about Israel and the church.
- **Promise to the fathers**
 - Promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob retained in God's plan; not nullified by Gentile inclusion.
- **Grafting / engrafted**
 - Image used to describe Gentile inclusion; Schreiner stresses temporary breakage of branches, not permanent excision.
- **National vs. spiritual Israel**
 - Implicitly navigates between ethnic/national identity and the church's spiritual reality without conflating them.
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: concise corrective definition of anti-supersessionism for systematic theology.
 - Exegetical model/polemic: model for interpreting Romans 9-11 in biblical-theological and pastoral contexts.
