### TITLE
**Canons of Dort (1618-1619) - Three Forms of Unity**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** International Reformed synod in Dordrecht, Dutch Republic, 1618-1619, convened to adjudicate the Remonstrant controversy after debates sparked by Jacobus Arminius and the 1610 Remonstrance. Politically and ecclesially charged milieu; Scripture and Augustinian-Reformed soteriology were central authorities.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Whether salvation rests upon God's unconditional grace in Christ or upon foreseen human responses. The Canons defend the former, articulating a pastoral, churchly account of sovereign grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Five Heads of Doctrine** with positive articles and Rejections of Errors:
 1. **Divine Election and Reprobation** (unconditional election; careful, pastoral handling of reprobation; I.17 on infants of believers).
 2. **Christ's Death and Human Redemption** (sufficiency for all, efficiency for the elect; definite intent).
 3/4. **Human Corruption, Calling, and Conversion** (total inability; effectual calling by Word and Spirit; regeneration as gift; serious and universal gospel call).
 5. **Perseverance of the Saints** (God preserves by means; assurance fostered, carnal security denied).
 - **Conclusion:** Warns against caricature, exhorts to humility, worship, and holy living.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Remonstrants (e.g., Simon Episcopius) vs. Contra-Remonstrants (e.g., Franciscus Gomarus); president Johannes Bogerman; foreign delegates (e.g., John Davenant, British; Swiss; Genevan). Heavily Augustinian; saturated with Scripture (Rom 9, John 6, 10; Eph 1).
- **Doctrines treated:** **Bibliology** (Scripture as judge; insufficiency of natural light for salvation), **Theology Proper** (decree, will of God), **Christology** (priestly work, atonement), **Anthropology** (fall, inability), **Soteriology** (election, calling, faith as gift, perseverance, assurance), **Ecclesiology/Sacraments** (means of grace, preaching, catechesis; pastoral care of covenant children), **Eschatology** (perseverance unto final salvation).
- **Center of gravity:** God saves sinners effectually through Christ by the Spirit, through ordained means, to the praise of divine grace and the humility and holiness of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Sufficiency-efficiency distinction** in atonement: universally sufficient, particularly efficacious.
 - **Serious, well-meant offer** of the gospel to all; indiscriminate preaching commanded.
 - **Pastoral precision on assurance and perseverance:** real assurance attainable and normatively nurtured; not antinomian security.
 - **Article I.17** on **infants of believers**, locating comfort within the covenant community.
 - Allows **infra/supralapsarian** diversity while adopting infra-friendly formulations.
- **Corrections or contrasts:** Rejects **conditional election** grounded in foreseen faith, **universal atonement in intent**, **synergistic regeneration**, **resistible grace as final norm**, and **loss of true saving faith**; also rejects misrepresentations of Reformed teaching.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Codifies the **Five Heads of Doctrine** later summarized as TULIP; sharpens distinctions between **external/internal call**, **common/special operations of the Spirit**, **preterition/condemnation** in reprobation, and **means-ends** in divine providence.
- **Reception and influence:** Became part of the **Three Forms of Unity** with the Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism; informed the Westminster standards; set the baseline for later debates (Amyraldian hypothetical universalism, Wesleyan Arminianism, Marrow controversy). Strengthened preaching-centered piety and catechesis across Reformed churches; associated with the Dutch Statenvertaling project.
- **Enduring value:** A concise, exegetically anchored, pastorally careful standard for teaching sovereign grace; a template for combining doctrinal clarity with catholic breadth and churchly consolation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Unconditional election:** God chooses from fallen humanity apart from foreseen faith or merit; faith is an ordained means and gift.
- **Reprobation:** Carefully distinguished as **preterition** (passing by) and just **condemnation** for sin; not parallel to election in mode.
- **Total depravity / inability:** The fall renders humans unable to turn to God without regenerating grace; does not deny natural virtues or civil good.
- **Effectual calling:** The Spirit inwardly illumines and renews through the Word, producing faith; contrasted with the **external call**.
 - External call is universal and sincere; internal call is particular and efficacious.
- **Regeneration / conversion:** Work of the Spirit enlivening the will; not mere moral suasion; ordinarily through means.
- **Faith as gift:** Granted by God, sustained by God, yet truly exercised by believers.
- **Atonement sufficiency and efficiency:** Christ's death sufficient for the world's sins, efficacious for the elect by divine design.
- **Definite atonement (intent):** The saving intent of the cross is particular, while the gospel offer remains universal.
- **Perseverance of the saints:** God preserves true believers to the end through means; real lapses and discipline possible; apostasy of the regenerate denied.
- **Assurance:** Normatively attainable by Word, sacraments, and Spirit's testimony; distinct from presumption; may be shaken and renewed.
- **Serious or well-meant offer:** God sincerely commands and invites all to repent and believe; grounds preaching to all.
- **Means of grace:** Preaching, sacraments, catechesis, and discipline as ordained instruments for effectual calling and perseverance.
- **Foreknowledge vs. foreseen faith:** Divine foreknowledge is not the cause or condition of election; faith flows from election.
- **Common vs. special grace:** Acknowledges common operations and natural light, yet denies saving sufficiency apart from Scripture and regeneration.
- **Lapsarian views:** Infra- and supralapsarian options permitted; the Canons avoid dogmatizing order within the decree.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Definition source** for Reformed soteriology and assurance.
 - **Polemical standard** against Arminianism and semi-Pelagian tendencies.
 - **Exegetical model** for texts like Rom 9, John 6, Eph 1, John 10 on calling, election, and atonement.
 - **Pastoral-covenantal touchstone** for preaching, catechesis, and comfort (e.g., infants of believers; perseverance).
