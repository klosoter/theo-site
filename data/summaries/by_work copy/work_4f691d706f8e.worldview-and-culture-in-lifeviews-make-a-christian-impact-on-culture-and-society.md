### TITLE
**Worldview and Culture** (chapter in LifeViews: Make a Christian Impact on Culture and Society) - Al Wolters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th-century Reformed/neo-Calvinist conversation about the public role of Christianity. Wolters writes from the Canadian Reformed/intellectual tradition shaped by Kuyperian and Reformational thinkers (e.g., Kuyper, Bavinck, Dooyeweerd), addressing evangelical readers concerned about faith and cultural engagement.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 A Christian **worldview** must provide the theological basis for sustained cultural engagement: culture is a legitimate and God-given sphere of human activity rooted in creation and the cultural mandate, not merely a neutral or hostile arena to be escaped or merely evangelized.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Define "worldview" as a comprehensive, life-structuring commitment that orders thought and practice across social institutions. 
 - Ground cultural activity in **creation theology**: God as Creator gives humans vocation and dominion to steward and cultivate the created order. 
 - Critique two distortions: (1) pietistic privatization of faith that confines Christianity to inner piety and church life; (2) secular reductionism that detaches cultural goods from their created purpose. 
 - Propose a theology of vocation and dominion: ordinary callings and cultural practices are sites of faithful Christian responsibility under Christ's lordship. 
 - Offer practical implications for cultural formation, education, arts, and public life grounded in creational norms and common grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Abraham Kuyper and the neo-Calvinist tradition (sphere sovereignty, cultural calling). 
 - Herman Dooyeweerd and Reformational philosophy (structure of reality, law-idea) as intellectual background. 
 - Reformed scholastic sources (creation/ordinances) and contemporary evangelicalism (critique of privatized faith).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Creation** (ontological ground for culture), **Providence**, **Fall** (distortion of cultural goods), **Redemption** (restoration of creation), **Vocation** and **Dominion** (cultural mandate), **Common Grace** (enabling non-Christian cultural contribution), implicit **Christology** (Christ's lordship over all spheres).

- **Closing line:** 
 Wolters centers a creationally rooted Christian worldview that affirms ordinary vocations and cultural dominion as faithful stewardship under Christ, opposing privatizing piety and secular reductionism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Moves the conversation from abstract "beliefs" to a **structural, creational ordering** of life: worldview as grammar for culture. 
 - Strong stress on **vocation** in everyday social institutions (work, arts, education) as theological categories, not merely moral choices.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects pietistic tendencies that confine Christianity to church/inner life by insisting on the theological legitimacy of public cultural engagement. 
 - Pushes back against assimilationist secular frameworks that secularize cultural goods, insisting on creational norms and the restorationary aim of redemption.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Rearticulates the **cultural mandate** and **dominion** language in contemporary worldview terms, making these doctrines operative for policy, education, and vocation debates. 
 - Treats "worldview" as a structural operating system rather than only a set of propositional beliefs.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited in Reformed and neo-Calvinist circles as a clear explication of cultural engagement; influential in evangelical higher-education and public theology programs. 
 - Serves as a bridge between academic Reformational philosophy and pastoral concerns about mission and vocation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Excellent concise resource for courses on worldview, public theology, and vocation; clarifies how creation theology yields a robust cultural mandate and practical theology of daily calling.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Worldview** - a comprehensive, structuring set of commitments that orders all life and cultural institutions; not merely private belief but formative for public action.
- **Culture mandate (cultural mandate)** - Genesis-rooted calling to cultivate, steward, and develop creation; the theological warrant for Christian cultural work.
- **Vocation** - God-given call in ordinary life and professions; the primary locus of Christian service and cultural influence.
- **Dominion** - Responsible stewardship and rule over creation entrusted to humanity; to be exercised under God's norms, not exploitatively.
- **Creation (creational theology)** - Ontological ground for ethics and cultural ordering; affirms goodness and purpose of created structures.
- **Common grace** - The theological account explaining how non-Christian culture can produce genuine goods and insight while remaining fallen.
- **Sphere sovereignty / institutional pluralism** - Neo-Calvinist conviction that different social spheres have distinct responsibilities and authority under God (used to defend varied cultural vocations).
- **Secularization (critique)** - The process or ideology that narrows meaning to nontranscendent categories; Wolters diagnoses it as a theological and cultural error.
- **Two kingdoms (implicit contrast)** - The distinction between church and world; Wolters critiques strict privatizing readings that remove the world from Christian responsibility.
- **Creational norms / law-structure** - The idea that creation bears normative patterns (orders, laws) that guide flourishing human cultural practices.
- **Christ's lordship** - The theological claim that Jesus governs all spheres and thus grounds the Christian imperative for cultural engagement.
- **Cultural formation** - Process by which worldview shapes education, arts, institutions, and public life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "worldview," vocation, and cultural mandate in Reformed/public theology curricula. 
- As a **polemic** against privatized pietism and secular reductionism, supplying an alternative framework for cultural engagement. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking creation theology to practical ethics, education, and institutional formation in Christian scholarship and ministry.
