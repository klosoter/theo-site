### TITLE
**Jesus and the Victory of God** (1996), N. T. Wright, Christian Origins and the Question of God, vol. 2 
Loci emphasized: **Eschatology, Christology, Covenant, Soteriology, Pneumatology**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th c. Third Quest for the Historical Jesus; post-Bultmann, post-Sanders; retrieval of Second Temple Jewish context with robust historiography and linguistic sensitivity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Who did Jesus think he was, and what did he think he was doing? Wright argues Jesus consciously enacted Israels eschatological story: announcing YHWHs return, ending Israels exile, reconstituting Israel around himself, and predicting judgment on the temple, with the **kingdom** inaugurated in his ministry, vindicated in resurrection.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Reconstructing **Jewish worldviews**: story, symbols, praxis; Israels ongoing exile and hope for restoration.
 - Jesus proclamation and **parables** as subversive retellings of Israels story, calling Israel to a new way of peace.
 - **Symbolic praxis**: table fellowship, healings, exorcisms by the Spirit, and the temple action as enacted prophecy.
 - **Eschatological discourse**: apocalyptic language primarily about imminent judgment on Jerusalem and the temple (AD 70), not cosmic annihilation, within an inaugurated eschatology.
 - **Messianic vocation**: Jesus saw himself as embodying Israels destiny, the Son of Man of Daniel 7, bringing the new exodus and covenant renewal through representative suffering.
 - **Vindication**: God vindicates Jesus through resurrection, confirming his kingdom announcement and reinterpretation of Israel.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages E. P. Sanders, J. P. Meier, J. D. G. Dunn, A. Schweitzer, R. Bultmann, J. D. Crossan, M. Borg; uses Josephus, Qumran, apocalyptic literature, Isaiah 40-55, Daniel 7; builds on Wrights own critical realism.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Revelation and Scripture** (OT narrative fulfillment, typology), **Covenant** (new covenant, exile-return), **Christology** (messianic self-understanding, Son of Man, return of YHWH in Jesus), **Eschatology** (kingdom, judgment, inaugurated vs future), **Soteriology** (forgiveness as end of exile, representative atonement), **Pneumatology** (Spirit-anointed ministry and exorcisms).
- **Closing line:** The victory of God arrives in and through Jesus prophetic, kingdom-bearing mission, climactically vindicated in resurrection and historically signaled in the temple's fall.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Exile-return** as the master narrative for Jesus mission.
 - **Temple action** as enacted prophecy of judgment and replacement.
 - **Apocalyptic as metaphor-rich, political-theological discourse** about Israels crisis and Gods reign.
 - **Inaugurated eschatology**: already present in Jesus ministry, not yet consummated.
 - **Messianic consciousness as vocational**: Jesus as representative Israel, bearing covenant destiny.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against Schweitzer's total imminent-end apocalyptic and Bultmann's existential demythologizing.
 - Against purely timeless moral teacher portraits and against overly futurist or disembodied kingdom readings.
 - Nuances Crossan/Borg on historicity and eschatology; pushes beyond Sanders apocalyptic prophet by framing Jesus within Israels narrative symbols.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Stories-symbols-praxis** analytical grid; **critical realism** applied to Jesus research.
 - **Return of YHWH in Jesus** as christological claim within Jewish monotheism.
 - **Son of Man enthronement** tied to Daniel 7 and AD 70 vindication readings.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical, Anglican, and Reformed circles for redemptive-historical exegesis; critiques from strict futurists and from some Reformed theologians on atonement accent.
 - Sets the stage for Wrights Resurrection of the Son of God and broader inaugurated eschatology in biblical theology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of historically thick, canonically attuned Jesus study.
 - Clarifies **realized vs future eschatology**, **Christ in OT and NT** continuity, and **typology-fulfillment** for preaching and teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES

- **Symbolic actions:** Healings, meals, exorcisms, and temple action as enacted eschatology.
- **Son of Man (Daniel 7):** Corporate-representative figure whose vindication Jesus claims.
 - Contrasts with purely individual or purely apocalyptic doomsday readings.
