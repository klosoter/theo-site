### TITLE
**Caspar Olevian and the Substance of the Covenant - R. Scott Clark**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late sixteenth-century Reformed milieu (Heidelberg/Palatinate). Olevian (Caspar Olevianus) was a generational colleague of Ursinus and formative in the Heidelberg Catechism and Palatine Reformed theology.
 - Clark writes as a historical theologian reconstructing Olevian's usage of classical covenant vocabulary against later misreadings by Reformed scholastics and modern interpreters.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Olevian locates the **substance (substantia) of the covenant** not in rites or external forms but in the legal-promise structure constituted by God's **promise, obligation, and the mediator (Christ)**. Clark argues this is decisive for understanding Reformed federal theology and the relation of sacraments to covenant.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical-historical reconstruction of Olevian's texts on foedus/pactum and sacramentum.
 - Distinction between **substance (what the covenant is)** and **signs/seals (how it is administered)**.
 - Demonstration that Olevian:
 - treats covenant as a juridical pact grounded in God's will and promise;
 - affirms a covenant of works and a covenant of grace distinct in terms of promise/condition;
 - understands sacraments as seals/testimonies that confirm the covenantal promise rather than create its substance.
 - Polemical moves: contrasts Olevian with Roman Catholic sacramentalism and with readings that collapse covenant substance into ecclesiastical rites or mere moral law.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Caspar Olevianus (works and sermons), Heidelberg Catechism background.
 - Interlocutors implied: Calvin and early Reformed covenant language; Roman Catholic and Lutheran sacramental theology; later Reformed scholastic interpreters.
 - Clark engages primary Latin texts and traces reception in confessional Reformed theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (foedus/pactum), promise, law, sacraments, Christology (mediatorial obedience and satisfaction), soteriology (union with Christ, justification), ecclesiology (administration of covenant).

- **Closing line**
 - Olevian's theology centers the covenant as a legal-promise nexus grounded in God's promise and fulfilled in Christ, with sacraments as seals - a formulation that anchors classical Reformed federalism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sharp **substance/sign** distinction: covenant substantive content = promise/obligation/mediator; sacraments are secondary seals.
 - Emphasis on **legal-pact language (foedus/pactum)** rather than merely moral or mystical categories.
 - Clear linking of covenant substance to **Christ's mediatorial obedience** as the operative fulfillment.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against interpretations that make sacraments constitutive of covenant membership or that reduce covenant to moral law.
 - Refines Calvinic emphases by situating the covenant more precisely in juridical contract vocabulary familiar to sixteenth-century disputation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reclamation of classical Latin terms (substantia foederis, promissio, signum) with careful functional distinctions to avoid later conflations.
 - Treats the covenant as an **arrangement of obligations and promises** where assurance and salvation flow from fulfilled promissory obligation in Christ.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in tracing the genealogy of Reformed federal theology; used by modern Reformed historians and systematicians to clarify what "federal" meant for early Reformed authors.
 - Valued by confessional Reformed scholars defending the legal-promise model against sacramentalist or pietistic reinterpretations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a historically grounded template for locating covenant substance in promise and mediator rather than in sacramental form - useful for theology, preaching, and confessional teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Substantia foederis (substance of the covenant)** - the essential content: promise, obligation, and mediator (Christ).
- **Foedus / pactum (covenant / pact)** - juridical agreement language; stresses parties, obligations, and promises.
- **Promissio (promise)** - central vehicle of covenantal life; God's promise is primary in constituting the covenant.
- **Mediatio / Mediator (mediator)** - Christ as the one who secures and fulfills covenantal obligations.
- **Covenant of works** - framed as a conditional promissory pact: life promised upon perfect obedience (Adam and representative structures).
- **Covenant of grace** - promise-based covenant mediated in Christ; contrasts with covenant of works by its promissory and redemptive content.
- **Sacramentum / signa et testimonia (sacrament / signs & seals)** - external administrations that attest and seal the substance, not create it.
 - Emphasizes **sealing function** over ontological constituting.
- **Obedientia Christi (Christ's obedience)** - the fulfillment of covenant obligations, constitutive for justification within the federal framework.
- **Assurance / testimony** - the role of sacraments and word in producing covenantal assurance.
- **Union with Christ** - soteriological endpoint of the covenant; secured by promise and mediator.
- **Federalism (federal theology)** - systematizes salvation history in covenantal pacts with representative heads.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what early Reformed writers meant by the "substance" of covenant (theological locus: covenant, soteriology).
 - As a **polemic resource** against sacramentalist or non-federal reinterpretations (ecclesiology, sacramentology).
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for interpreting Genesis 2-3, Pauline covenant passages, and the function of sacraments (biblical theology and homiletics).
