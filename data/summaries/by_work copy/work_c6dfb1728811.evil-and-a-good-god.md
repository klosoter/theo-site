### TITLE
Evil and a Good God - Bruce Reichenbach

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion and contemporary theodical debate. Engages the mainstream problem-of-evil literature produced by analytic philosophers and theologians responding to modern secular critiques of theism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to reconcile pervasive moral and natural evil with the classical attributes of God (omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence). Reichenbach aims to show that the existence of evil does not render belief in a loving, powerful God unreasonable and that a theodical account grounded in moral agency and divine purposes can respond to both logical and evidential forms of the problem.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis of the problem in two registers: the *logical* problem (alleged contradiction of God + evil) and the *evidential* problem (evil as strong evidence against theism).
 - Critical survey of main responses (Augustinian privation, Irenaean/soul-making, Plantinga-style free will defense) and their strengths/limits.
 - Positive proposal emphasizing a synthesis of **free will** considerations with a **greater-good** and **moral-responsibility** framework:
 - Moral evil explained primarily by the genuine, world-making freedom of creatures; responsibility and growth are intrinsic goods that justify permitting risk of evil.
 - Natural evil is accounted for in terms of necessary background conditions for agency, character development, and the reliable operation of physical laws.
 - Epistemic move: argues for *epistemic humility* concerning God's reasons - limitations on human epistemic access mean many evils may not be gratuitous even if inscrutable.
 - Practical/pastoral corollary: because moral responsibility is central, human ethical response and solidarity are part of the theological solution.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Alvin Plantinga (free will defense), J.L. Mackie (logical problem), William Rowe (evidential problem), John Hick (soul-making), classical Augustinian and Irenaean streams; draws on analytic theism literature and philosophical theology methodology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence), providence, human freedom and responsibility, original sin and moral culpability, natural order and laws, eschatological compensation (final justice).
- **Closing line:** Reichenbach situates theodicy as an interdisciplinary project: theological affirmation of divine goodness remains coherent when coupled to a robust account of creaturely freedom, necessary goods produced by a lawful creation, and epistemic limits that preclude inferring gratuitous evil.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **moral-responsibility as theodical pivot**: the intrinsic value of genuine agency is the primary explanans for moral evil.
 - Integrates an epistemic defense (humility about God's reasons) more centrally and systematically than some prior defenders.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Unlike strict Augustinian approaches, Reichenbach resists locating primary blame in metaphysical privation or an ontological dualism; he stresses agent causation and systemic features.
 - Compared with Hickian soul-making, he gives greater weight to the role of free agency and less to developmental theodicy as a total explanation.
 - Builds on Plantinga's move but attempts to broaden it: not merely showing logical possibility of God plus evil, but offering positive explanatory resources for natural evils and evidential concerns.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the notion of **theodical priority of agency** (agency as the central theodical good that explains permissive divine action).
 - Uses **epistemic humility** as a formal defeater-response integrated into the wider theodical account.
- **Reception and influence:** Modest but steady influence in analytic theology and philosophy of religion curricula; cited as a clear, pedagogical synthesis in courses on theodicy and often used as a bridge text between technical defenses (Plantinga) and pastoral theologies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Clear synthesis of free-will and greater-good strategies, helpful methodological model for combining analytic rigor with pastoral sensitivity; useful as a temperate rejoinder to evidential atheism and as a classroom exposition of contemporary theodical options.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodicy:** systematic attempt to justify God's goodness in view of evil; Reichenbach treats it as explanatory and pastoral.
- **Defense:** showing logical possibility of God with evil (engages Plantinga); distinguished from theodicy but used in tandem.
- **Logical problem of evil:** claim of contradiction between God and evil; Reichenbach reiterates standard rebuttals and narrows the argumentative ground.
- **Evidential problem of evil:** claim that evil is strong evidence against God; central target of his positive account.
- **Free will (defense):** freedom as central explanatory resource for moral evil; genuine, risky agency makes certain evils possible but not gratuitous.
- **Soul-making/greater-good:** developmental goods and character formation as partial account for why evil might be permitted; integrated but not sole explanation.
- **Natural evil:** suffering from non-agent sources; treated as attendant to law-governed world necessary for agency and reliably ordered goods.
- **Omnipotence/omniscience/omnibenevolence:** classical divine attributes under analysis; reconciled via permissive divine action and epistemic humility.
- **Epistemic humility (skeptical-theist move):** limitation on human ability to infer gratuitousness from lack of known reasons; used to blunt evidential inferences.
- **Moral responsibility:** normative weight assigned to human responses; central theological and practical implication.
- **Providence:** reinterpreted to allow for substantive creaturely freedom and lawful natural processes rather than micromanagement.
- **Gratuitous evil:** debated category; Reichenbach argues many apparent cases are defeasible judgments due to limited perspective.
- **Eschatological compensation:** final justice as corrective horizon that complements present-theodical explanations.
- **Instrumental goods:** goods that obtain through risky freedom and lawful nature; pivotal explanans for permitting evil.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition and synthesis** in evangelical/analytic courses on theodicy.
 - As a **polemic resource** against evidential atheism and for defending the rationality of theism.
 - As a **pastoral-exegetical model** for integrating doctrine of providence with human ethical responsibility.
