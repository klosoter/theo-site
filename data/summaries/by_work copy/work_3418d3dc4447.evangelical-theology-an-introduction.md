### TITLE
**Evangelical Theology: An Introduction** - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late work distilled from Basel lectures (early 1960s), after Church Dogmatics; postwar ecumenical milieu; mature phase of dialectical/Christocentric dogmatics.
 - Against liberal historicism and natural theology; within Reformed catholicity, engaging modern philosophy and Protestant tradition.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Theology is evangelical when it lives from and serves the Gospel: God speaks and gives Himself in Jesus Christ by the Spirit. The object (the living God) determines method, scope, and ethos; theology is thankful, prayerful service of the Word for the church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - From object to method: God reveals; therefore theology is responsive, not speculative or experiential self-report.
 - Threefold Word of God structures all doctrinal work: Jesus Christ (revealed Word), Scripture (written witness), proclamation (preached Word).
 - Theological existence: wonder, humility, joy, freedom, repentance, and prayer qualify the theologian.
 - Theological task: attentive exegesis of Scripture; ecclesial location; critical engagement with culture and philosophies; dogmatics ordered to proclamation.
 - Dogmatic loci in evangelical key:
 - Revelation and Scripture as witness and instrument of the Spirit.
 - God as the One who loves in freedom; Trinity as the form of the Gospel.
 - Christology: God for us in Jesus Christ; election concentrated in Him.
 - Pneumatology: the Spirit actualizes the Word in the church.
 - Anthropology and creation: humanity addressed and determined in encounter with God; sin as contradiction to grace.
 - Soteriology: reconciliation as divine act; faith as grateful human response; sanctification and vocation in community.
 - Ecclesiology and mission: the church as hearing and witnessing community for the world.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Scripture; Fathers; Anselm (faith seeking understanding); Luther and Calvin; Kierkegaard on subjectivity under the Word.
 - Critically: Schleiermacher and liberalism (experience-centered method); natural theology and the analogia entis; biblicism that treats the text as autonomous object; existential reductionisms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Word of God; Scripture; Trinity; Christology; Holy Spirit; creation and humanity; sin; reconciliation; sanctification; church and proclamation; mission; eschatological orientation.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological science is grateful, prayerful service in the freedom of the Gospel, because God speaks and gives Himself to the church in Jesus Christ by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Actualism: God is who He is in His acts; revelation is an event.
 - Threefold Word of God guiding bibliology and proclamation.
 - Theology as prayer, repentance, and joy; ethos is intrinsic to method.
 - Christological concentration of election and all dogmatics.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Schleiermacher: method begins in God's self-speech, not religious consciousness.
 - Against natural theology: no path from creaturely reason to God apart from revelation; analogia fidei over analogia entis.
 - Against rationalist system-building and biblicist positivism: Scripture is witness used by the Spirit, not an impersonal deposit.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Analogia fidei; threefold Word; freedom of God; actualism; dogmatics as service of proclamation; church as hearing-witnessing community.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical in Reformed and ecumenical classrooms as prolegomena-in-miniature; resource for postliberal and Torrance-Jungel trajectories.
 - Critiqued by some evangelicals on Scripture and history; debated by Roman Catholics over the analogia entis; engaged by liberation and feminist theologies on praxis and history.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forms the theologian's posture; clarifies why theology is ecclesial, exegetical, and doxological; provides a durable grammar for revelation, Scripture, and proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evangelical theology**: dogmatics determined by the Gospel and ordered to proclamation and doxology.
- **Word of God (threefold)**:
 - Revealed (Jesus Christ), written (Scripture), preached (proclamation) in ordered relationship under the Spirit.
- **Revelation**: God's free self-giving event; the Subject remains Lord of the knowing.
- **Scripture as witness**: normative human texts commissioned to testify to Christ; instrument of the Spirit for the church's hearing.
- **Analogia fidei**: correspondence of knowing to revelation in faith; opposed to analogia entis.
- **Freedom of God**: God's lordly self-determination in grace; grounds divine initiative in creation and reconciliation.
- **Actualism**: God's being-in-act; doctrine and salvation as events, not static essences.
- **Election in Christ**: the Gospel's center; God's Yes precedes and judges human No.
- **Pneumatological actualization**: the Spirit makes the Word present and efficacious in the community.
- **Church as hearing community**: first a listener, then a witness; theology serves this movement.
- **Anthropology as addressed existence**: humanity defined in encounter; sin as refusal of address; vocation as responsive freedom.
- **Dogmatics as service**: secondary, ministerial science aiding proclamation.
- **Prayer and repentance of theology**: methodological humility and continual self-critique under Scripture.
- **Dialectic of Yes/No**: evangelical assertion and evangelical negation guarding the Gospel's freedom.
- **Mission**: outward movement of the heard Word toward the world in witness and service.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Bibliology: definitions of revelation, Scripture-as-witness, and preaching's relation to the text.
 - Theology Proper: God's freedom, Trinity as Gospel form, actualism.
 - Anthropology/Creation: human identity in divine address; creation under covenantal grace.
 - Soteriology and Pneumatology: reconciliation as divine act; Spirit's role in making the Word present; ecclesial vocation and mission.
