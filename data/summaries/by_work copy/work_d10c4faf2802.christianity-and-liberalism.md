### TITLE
**Christianity and Liberalism** (1923) - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written amid the American Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy; Princeton Seminary debates; Presbyterian Church in the USA turmoil. Targets early 20th-century Protestant liberalism shaped by Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and the ethos of scientific progress.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Liberal Protestantism is not a variant of Christianity but a different religion altogether, because it denies the supernatural, historical, and doctrinal core of the gospel.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Doctrine vs. experience:** Christianity is founded on public revelation and historical fact, not on religious feeling. Truth precedes experience.
 - **God and man:** Rejects optimistic anthropology; defends Augustinian view of sin against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian tendencies in liberal ethics.
 - **The Bible:** Upholds plenary inspiration, self-attesting authority, and a stable canon over evolving tradition or pragmatic utility.
 - **Christ:** Asserts virgin birth, true deity and humanity (Chalcedon), substitutionary atonement, and bodily resurrection; without these, faith has no object.
 - **Salvation:** Justification by faith alone; repudiates moralism and the reduction of redemption to ethical uplift or social improvement.
 - **The Church:** One, holy, catholic, and apostolic; an institution bound by confession and discipline, not merely a fellowship of shared values.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Contrasts with Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Harnack, and Herrmann; engages American modernists (e.g., Fosdick, Shailer Mathews). Stands with Old Princeton (Warfield) and the Reformed confessional tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, inerrancy, canon), Christology (two natures, hypostatic union), soteriology (atonement, justification, faith and repentance), ecclesiology (nature, marks, office), and hamartiology (original sin vs Pelagianism).
- **Closing line:** The gospel is a supernatural, historical announcement about Christ that creates the church; abandon that, and what remains is not Christianity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Religion of fact:** Doctrinal truth grounded in historical events is constitutive, not optional.
 - **Sharp antithesis:** Liberalism is another religion, not a family member within Christianity.
 - **Ministerial reason:** Reason serves revelation; it does not sit in judgment over it.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **experientialism:** Feeling cannot found faith; faith rests on God's self-revelation.
 - Against **Pelagian moralism:** Human nature is fallen; redemption is needed, not mere education or example.
 - Against **ecclesial latitudinarianism:** The church must confess and discipline; tolerance is not agreement.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Supernaturalism vs. naturalism** as a fault-line category.
 - **History-doctrine nexus:** Historical events interpreted by inspired Scripture constitute doctrine.
 - **Two religions thesis:** A polemical but clarifying taxonomy of modern Protestant options.
- **Reception and influence:** Catalyzed conservative Presbyterian resistance, shaped Westminster Seminary's ethos; enduring touchstone in Reformed and evangelical defenses of inerrancy, substitutionary atonement, and confessional ecclesiology; often paired with Warfield and later with neo-evangelical debates.
- **Enduring value:** A compact, integrated case linking bibliology, Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology; a model of principled polemics with pastoral and institutional implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liberalism:** A naturalistic reinterpretation of Christianity in categories of ethics and experience; for Machen, a different religion.
- **Supernaturalism:** God acts in history; miracles, incarnation, and resurrection are essential, not dispensable.
- **Revelation:** God's self-disclosure in events and words, culminating in Christ and inscripturated by inspiration.
- **Inspiration and inerrancy:** Scripture as God-breathed, truthful in all it affirms; the Bible self-attests its authority.
- **Canon and tradition:** Fixed apostolic norm over against evolving communal consensus; tradition ministerial, not magisterial.
- **Doctrine vs. experience:** Objective truth precedes and norms subjective religious states.
- **Hypostatic union / Chalcedon:** Christ is one person in two natures, without confusion or division; grounds atonement and worship.
- **Virgin birth and resurrection:** Non-negotiable historical claims anchoring Christ's identity and work.
- **Substitutionary atonement:** Christ bears the penalty for sin; the heart of redemption, not a peripheral theory.
- **Faith and repentance:** Trust in the crucified and risen Christ, turning from sin; faith has a definite object and content.
- **Pelagianism (and semi-Pelagianism) vs. Augustinianism:** Human inability vs. moral optimism; Machen sides with Augustinian realism about sin.
- **One, holy, catholic, apostolic church:** An institution with confessional boundaries, offices, sacraments, and discipline.
- **Tolerance and truth:** Charity in manner without surrender of doctrinal substance.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** As a classic brief for inspiration, inerrancy, self-attestation, and the primacy of canon over experience.
 - **Christology and Soteriology:** For non-negotiables of the incarnation, two natures, atonement, and resurrection as historical-doctrinal core.
 - **Ecclesiology:** As a case for confessionalism, doctrinal discipline, and the church's identity as truth-guard.
 - **Doctrine of sin and ethics:** As a corrective to moralistic or progressive anthropologies in public theology.
