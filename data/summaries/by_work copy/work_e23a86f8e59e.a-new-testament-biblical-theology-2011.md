### TITLE
**Gregory K. Beale, A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New (2011)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed resurgence of biblical theology; indebted to Vos, Ridderbos, and Kline.
 - Engages Second Temple literature, LXX, and intertextual methods; responds to NPP, apocalyptic readings, and dispensational eschatology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The NT presents the OT story reaching its goal in Christ as last Adam/true Israel who inaugurates the end-time new-creational temple by the Spirit; the church shares Adamic priest-king vocation now, awaiting consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Creation-to-new-creation storyline: Eden as proto-temple and Adam as priest-king given a culture mandate.
 - Fall as idolatrous de-creation; exile theme frames human history.
 - Israel recapitulates Adam; prophets promise a Spirit-wrought end-time temple/new covenant/new exodus.
 - Christ fulfills Adam/Israel offices; by death-resurrection and Spirit outpouring, he launches the new-creational temple.
 - Union with Christ restores image and vocation; church as temple expands globally through mission and suffering.
 - Already-not-yet eschatology: tribulation, antichrist/man of lawlessness, and the millennium read amillennially (Rev 20).
 - Consummation: final judgment/new creation; priestly dominion fully realized.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Geerhardus Vos, Herman Ridderbos, Meredith Kline, Richard Bauckham, D. A. Carson.
 - Critically: N. T. Wright and NPP trajectories on Adam and justification; dispensational premillennialism on Israel/temple; skeptical views of OT-in-NT usage.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture (intertextuality, typology), creation/anthropology (image, vocation), covenant (Adamic to New), sin (idolatry, federal headship), Christology (last Adam), pneumatology (Spirit as eschatological gift), ecclesiology (church-as-temple), eschatology (inauguration, antichrist, millennium), mission.
- **Center of gravity**
 - Christ, as eschatological temple-builder, restores and globalizes Edenic priest-kingdom through his Spirit until the new creation is unveiled.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Temple/New Creation as canonical center**: Eden-temple motif unifies creation, redemption, and consummation.
 - **Image-as-vocation**: priestly-royal commission reframed as mission; Great Commission = culture mandate renewed in Christ.
 - **Idolatry as de-creation**: you become what you worship, leading to beast-like deformation and exile.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - **Against dispensationalism**: church is the eschatological temple; Rev 20 read amillennially; OT promises fulfilled in Christ and his body.
 - **Against non-historical Adam**: defends historicity and federal headship grounding sin and redemption.
 - **Against reductionist intertextuality**: argues for authorial intention and covenantal typology, not free associative echoes.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - **Intrusion ethics** (Klinean): episodes of proleptic judgment explain holy war and Revelation.
 - Tight criteria for **OT allusions**; canonical, linguistic, and thematic controls.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed seminaries; a reference point for biblical-theological curricula.
 - Critiqued for a strong temple-centric center and heavy typological synthesis; debated vis-a-vis NPP and some historical-critical methods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent map from Genesis to Revelation; models text-driven, covenantal synthesis useful for preaching, teaching, and doctrinal construction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Creation**: Eschatological reality inaugurated in Christ; frames soteriology and mission.
- **Edenic Temple**: Garden as archetypal sanctuary; patterns priestly presence, boundaries, and expansion.
- **Image of God (Priest-King)**: Functional, relational vocation to mediate God's rule; restored in union with Christ.
- **Culture/Dominion Mandate**: Genesis 1:26-28; refracted as Great Commission in the church age.
- **Idolatry as De-creation**: Worship disorder unmakes humanity; linked to exile and beast imagery.
- **Already-Not Yet**: Inaugurated eschatology governing tribulation, kingdom, resurrection, and judgment.
- **Church as Temple**: Spirit-indwelt community, locus of God's presence and mission.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness**: Corporate-systemic apostasy climaxing in a personal figure opposing the temple-church.
- **Intrusion Ethics**: Eschatological judgment breaking into history; clarifies holy war and apocalyptic.
- **Federal Headship of Adam**: Historical Adam as covenant representative; ground for imputation and Christ's last-Adam work.
- **Typology and Allusion**: Controlled, author-intended links from OT to NT; methodological backbone of the book.
- **Exile and Restoration**: Master theme organizing redemption; Christ enacts true return from exile.
- **Revelation 20 / Millennium**: Amillennial, interadvent reign; first resurrection as believers' vindication and heavenly reign; Satan bound with limited scope.
- **Binding of Satan**: Restriction for gospel mission post-Christ; not elimination of opposition.
- **Union with Christ**: Participation in last Adam's life; basis for image renewal and vocation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source** for biblical theology method and OT-in-NT hermeneutics.
 - **Polemic** against dispensational millennialism and non-historical Adam proposals.
 - **Exegetical model** for antichrist, 2 Thess 2, Gen 1-3, and Revelation.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking creation mandate, ecclesiology (temple), and eschatology in a unified mission theology.
