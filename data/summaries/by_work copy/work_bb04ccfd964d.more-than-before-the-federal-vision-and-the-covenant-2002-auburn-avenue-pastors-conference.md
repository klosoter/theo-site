### TITLE
More Than Before: The Federal Vision and the Covenant (Auburn Ave Pastors Conf. address, 2002) - Steve Schlissel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Delivered at the 2002 Auburn Avenue Pastors Conference amid early public emergence of the Federal Vision (FV) movement within segments of contemporary Reformed circles. Takes place against renewed interest in covenant theology, sacramental theology, and pastoral formation in late 20th-early 21st century North American Presbyterian/Reformed contexts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Federal Vision's monocovenantal reconfiguration of covenant theology redefines covenant membership, sacramental efficacy, and the relation of faith and works in ways that compromise classical Reformed teaching on forensic justification and imputation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnostic: FV advances a **monocovenantal** framework (one covenant across redemptive history) that emphasizes corporate/covenantal status and sacramental incorporation.
 - Exposition: Shows how this framework alters the semantics of baptism, union with Christ, and covenantal obedience - treating covenant signs as conveying a presumptive, status-bearing righteousness rather than mere signs/means by faith.
 - Critique: Argues these moves collapse the Reformed distinction between covenant membership and final justification, undermine forensic imputation, and make perseverance and assurance covenantal achievements rather than gracious gifts grounded in Christ's righteousness.
 - Pastoral/ecclesial implication: Warns of a pastoral regime where sacramental belonging functions as an index of salvific standing, pressuring external conformity and confusing assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages the Federal Vision movement broadly (its published statements and prominent advocates) and contrasts it with classical Reformed sources (confessions, covenantal orthodox writers). Uses biblical texts and Reformed doctrinal categories as primary interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (structure and administrations), justification (forensic imputation), union with Christ, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), perseverance and assurance, faith and works, ecclesiology (membership and discipline).
- **Closing line:** The Federal Vision's monocovenantal emphasis reshapes covenant signs and communal status into de facto criteria for salvation, thereby threatening the classical Reformed gospel distinction between covenant membership and forensic justification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Sharp focus on **monocovenantalism** as the hinge issue - not merely sacramentalism, but a systemic recasting of covenantal categories.
 - Emphasizes pastoral consequences (assurance, church discipline, member expectations) rather than only abstract doctrinal disputes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Reaffirms classical twofold Reformed distinctions (covenant of works/administrations, forensic imputation) as necessary correctives to FV's conflations.
 - Counters FV tendencies to read OT/NT continuity as continuity of a single covenant in ways that minimize redemptive-administrative distinctions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Highlights the term **"covenantal status"** as used by FV to denote an observable, sacramentally mediated standing that risks functioning as a salvific criterion.
 - Frames sacramental incorporation rhetoric as potentially indistinguishable from assertions of baptismal or covenantal regeneration.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Used widely in conservative Reformed critiques of the Federal Vision; contributed to pastoral and denominational scrutiny in the 2000s.
 - Cited in polemical and clarifying literature defending classical Reformed understandings of justification and sacrament.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Compact, pastorally oriented summary of key theological stakes in the FV controversy.
 - Useful primer for seminarians and pastors on how covenantal re-interpretations affect preaching, sacraments, and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal Vision:** Broad contemporary movement rethinking covenant continuity, sacramental efficacy, and corporate identity; Schlissel treats it as a cluster of proposals with shared monocovenantal thrust.
- **Monocovenantalism:** The claim that God's redemptive relationship is governed by one covenant (the covenant of grace) across both Testaments; Schlissel argues this compresses crucial Reformed distinctions.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** Traditional Reformed pair of covenantal categories; Schlissel appeals to their distinction to resist FV conflation of law and gospel.
- **Forensic Justification:** The legal declaration of righteousness by God through imputation; presented as the doctrinal pivot threatened by FV's covenantal-status language.
- **Imputation:** The crediting of Christ's righteousness to believers; Schlissel defends its forensic character against FV's tendency to emphasize covenantal union over forensic exchange.
- **Union with Christ:** Mystical-corporate reality emphasized by FV; Schlissel acknowledges its importance but warns against subsuming imputation under a primarily covenantal union.
- **Covenantal Objectivity / Covenant Membership:** FV's stress that covenant signs confer a visible, status-bearing membership; Schlissel critiques the move when it becomes a proxy for salvation.
- **Sacramental Efficacy:** Discussion of whether and how baptism/communion effect union or convey status; Schlissel argues for means-of-grace language within classical provisos (faith as appropriating).
- **Baptismal Regeneration (or presumptive regeneration):** The idea that baptism communicates real covenantal standing; Schlissel resists any formula that makes baptism the presumptive guarantee of justification.
- **Covenant Faithfulness / Works:** FV emphasis on obedience as integral to covenant life; Schlissel stresses distinction between covenantal fruit and meritorious justification.
- **Perseverance / Assurance:** Practical outworkings; Schlissel highlights how FV's framework can alter pastoral assurance by tying it to demonstrated covenantal faithfulness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and clarifying summary in controversies over the Federal Vision (ecclesiology, justification).
- As a **pastoral-theological resource** for pastors evaluating sacramental practice, assurance, and membership discipline.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching covenant theology: used to illustrate how shifts in covenantal schema change soteriological and sacramental conclusions.
