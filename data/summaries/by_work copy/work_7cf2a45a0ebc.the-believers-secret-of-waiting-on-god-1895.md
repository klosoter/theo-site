### TITLE
The Believer's Secret of Waiting on God (Andrew Murray, 1895)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late Victorian evangelical milieu (1895). Murray writes from a South African Reformed/evangelical missionary context, drawing on Puritan and continental pietistic resources and influenced by late-19th-century holiness/Keswick currents that emphasized inward dependence and Spirit-filled life.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The believer's chief spiritual power and sanctification flow not from human striving but from the disciplined practice of "waiting on God"-a posture of restful, expectant dependence rooted in union with Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Christian failure stems from self-reliance, activity without dependence, and superficial devotion.
 - Definition and biblical warrant: "Waiting on God" is presented as a scriptural command and spiritual discipline (Psalms, prophets, New Testament examples) that is both receptive and obedient.
 - Means: Waiting is enacted through yieldedness to the Holy Spirit, meditative rest in the Word, prayerful silence, and faith that trusts divine timing.
 - Fruit/result: Genuine waiting brings deeper union with Christ, renewed power for service, holiness of life, and intimate communion with God.
 - Practical application: Murray offers pastoral directions for cultivating waiting as a habitual inner posture rather than an episodic practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis, Puritan and Reformed spiritual writers implied (e.g., Sibbes, Owen), and the broader Keswick/holiness emphasis on spiritual rest and surrender. Murray positions himself against both moralistic activism and mere quietism.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Union with Christ** (central), sanctification, Holy Spirit (indwelling and operation), prayer, faith, grace, providence, and spiritual formation.
- **Closing line:** The book locates the Christian life's decisive power in union with Christ realized by **waiting on God**-a receptive, faith-filled dependence that produces sanctification and fruitful service.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats "waiting" as an active, obedient receptivity rather than passive passivity; waiting is a spiritual discipline that produces power.
 - Frames waiting explicitly as an expression and means of **union with Christ**, not merely a devotional technique.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects moralistic activism and results-oriented ministry by insisting that fruit follows surrendered waiting.
 - Distinguishes itself from quietist withdrawal by insisting waiting leads to renewed service and obedience.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized the language of "the secret of waiting" as theological shorthand for the union-formed interior life.
 - Integrates pastoral formation language with systematic categories (union, Spirit, sanctification).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Long-standing influence in evangelical and Reformed devotional literature, spiritual formation curricula, and missionary spirituality.
 - Valued across pietistic and evangelical circles for its pastoral clarity; less prominent in strictly academic systematic theology but often cited in union-with-Christ and sanctification studies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to read devotional theology with theological categories (union with Christ, Spirit) and offers a compact twofold corrective: anti-activism and anti-quietism.
 - Useful for pastoral theology, spiritual direction, and courses on union with Christ and Christian formation.
