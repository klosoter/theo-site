### TITLE
An Old Testament Theology: An Exegetical, Canonical, and Thematic Approach (2007) - Bruce K. Waltke

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2007 amid renewed interest in canonical and theological readings of the OT; situated within evangelical-Reformed scholarship that seeks to recover theological theology from careful exegesis.
 - Converses with form/tradition history and canonical approaches (e.g., von Rad, Brevard Childs) while maintaining conservative commitments to inspiration and theological coherence.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Old Testament must be read exegetically within its canonical shape to recover its theological witness; the covenantal story of God (creation → covenant → kingdom → new creation) provides the controlling theological rhythm.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Meticulous verse-level exegesis grounds canonical and thematic syntheses.
 - Major moves:
 - Demonstrate how literary/rhetorical structures carry theological claims (e.g., law, wisdom, prophecy).
 - Trace covenant (YHWH-human relationship) as the organizing theological locus across genres.
 - Map redemptive-historical progression to show continuity toward Christ and eschatological consummation.
 - Integrates law, narrative, wisdom, and prophetic theology into a coherent covenantal framework.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages critical scholarship (historical-critical insights) but reframes them within canonical theology.
 - Dialogues implicitly with Childs (canonical focus), von Rad (tradition-history), and with evangelical exegetes on covenant and typology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture's self-witness), covenant (central), creation and new-creation, law and wisdom, kingship/kingdom, prophecy and eschatology, divine sovereignty/providence, human sin and responsibility.
 - Christological and redemptive-historical readings are implied as the telos of OT theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Waltke's theological center of gravity: the Old Testament is a covenantal, canonical testimony whose exegetical particulars cohere into a redemptive-historical portrayal of God as sovereign covenant-maker who orders creation toward divine communion and eschatological renewal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous exegetical discipline fused with canonical theology: text-critical/grammatical detail is subordinated to-and serves-the canonical theological argument.
 - Covenant as the hermeneutical key: not merely a theme but the structural organizing principle for doctrine and narrative.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves away from fragmentation of disciplines (pure historical criticism or abstract systematic readings), correcting both liberal historicism and schematic systematicisms that ignore canonical shape.
 - Contrasts with readings that isolate law, wisdom, or prophecy; instead argues for their interdependence within covenant narrative.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasis on functional/teleological readings of texts (what God intends the text to do in covenant life), especially in narrative and wisdom literature.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed seminaries as a model for integrating exegetical fidelity with theological synthesis.
 - Praised for theological breadth and exegetical acuity; critiqued by some for remaining too systematically harmonizing and for presupposing certain doctrinal commitments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a methodological exemplar for producing theologically serious OT theologies that begin in the text; valuable for pastors, exegetes, and systematic theologians seeking OT-grounded doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant**
 - The central organizing category; explains law, election, and the shape of redemptive history.
- **Canonical shape**
 - The final form of the OT as theological witness; reading must account for arrangement and final form.
- **Exegetical-theological method**
 - Close grammatical-historical exegesis integrated with canonical and thematic synthesis.
- **Creation / New Creation**
 - Creation is God's ordered, covenantal act; new creation is the eschatological fulfillment of covenant promises.
- **Days of Creation**
 - Waltke treats the Genesis days as theological ordering of cosmos for covenant life-emphasis on function and purpose rather than modern chronological-scientific questions; reads Genesis 1 as a canonical theological prologue to covenant responsibilities.
- **Kingship / Kingdom**
 - God's reign and the human institutions reflecting covenant faithfulness; monarchy and messianic hope are key redemptive loci.
- **Law and Wisdom**
 - Mutually informing: law shapes covenant identity; wisdom interprets life under the law within creation's structure.
- **Prophecy and Eschatology**
 - Prophetic corpus explicates covenant fidelity and promises future restoration as part of redemptive-historical continuity.
- **Divine Sovereignty / Providence**
 - God's providence is read covenantally: God governs history to fulfill covenant promises while upholding human accountability.
- **Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, and Problem of Evil**
 - Waltke frames foreknowledge and providence within covenantal governance: God's foreknowledge does not negate human moral responsibility; evil is treated as covenantal breach that God sovereignly judges and will finally rectify in redemptive history.
- **Typology / Christological Fulfillment**
 - OT persons/events hold Christic significance as covenantal foreshadowings within canonical progression.
- **Theological center**
 - Scripture's aim is covenantal communion with God culminating in eschatological renewal.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a model for OT theological method combining exegetical minutiae with theological synthesis.
 - As a definition source for covenantal readings across loci (creation, law, kingship, prophecy).
 - As an exegetical template in polemics against purely historical-critical or purely systematic readings of the OT.
