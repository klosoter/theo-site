### TITLE
**Summa Contra Gentiles (SCG)** - Thomas Aquinas, c. 1259-1265 
A systematic apologetic and doctrinal synthesis ordered from natural reason to revealed mysteries, crafted within the Dominican missionizing milieu.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - High medieval scholasticism; Aristotelian recovery via Arabic and Jewish commentators.
 - Dominican concern for reasoned engagement with Jews and Muslims; probable pedagogical manual for mission and disputation.
 - Composed in Italy (Parisian and Roman schools in view), contemporaneous with Catena Aurea.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How truths about God known by **reason** relate to and prepare for truths known only by **revelation**, and how to argue both persuasively before non-Christians.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Book I: God as known by reason** - existence of God and divine attributes (simplicity, perfection, immutability, eternity, unity; intellect and will).
 - **Book II: Creation** - God as cause of all being; creation, spiritual and material substances; the soul; rejection of necessity in emanation.
 - **Book III: Providence and moral teleology** - divine governance, problem of evil, human freedom, virtues, and ultimate end (beatitude).
 - **Book IV: Mysteries of faith** - Trinity, Incarnation, sacraments, resurrection; beyond reason yet non-contradictory and fitting, authenticated by signs (miracles, prophecy).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **Sources:** Aristotle, Augustine, Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius; Scripture as confirmatory rather than probative in Books I-III.
 - **Interlocutors:** Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides; Latin Averroists; Islamic and Jewish philosophy; various heresies on Trinity/Christology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology:** modes and motives of credibility (miracles, prophecy), authority of Scripture.
 - **Theology Proper:** existence and attributes, simplicity, analogy, knowledge and will, providence.
 - **Creation/Anthropology:** creation ex nihilo (as revealed), soul-body relation, angels, secondary causes.
 - **Christology/Pneumatology:** Incarnation, Trinity, missions/processions, grace.
 - **Soteriology:** fittingness of the Passion, sacraments as instrumental causes, beatitude.

- **Closing line**
 - The work's center of gravity: **God as ipsum esse subsistens ordering all things to Himself**, with reason serving faith and faith crowning reason.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp but harmonious distinction between **preambles of faith** and **mysteries of faith**.
 - Method of **demonstration from effects** to cause; extensive development of **divine simplicity** and **analogical predication**.
 - Defense of **secondary causality** under providence; teleological account of creation and ethics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **Averroist** monopsychism and denial of God's knowledge of particulars.
 - Against necessitarian emanation; affirms contingency of creatures and freedom of divine will.
 - Rejects both crude voluntarism and occasionalism; upholds intellectualist account ordered by goodness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Consolidation of **esse/essentia** distinction; God as **actus purus** and **ipsum esse subsistens**.
 - Clear deployment of **per se** vs **per accidens** causal series; **final causality** as pervasive.
 - Mature articulation of **analogy** vs univocity/equivocity in divine names.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical in Thomist schools; echoed in **Vatican I** on natural knowability of God.
 - Reformed scholastics (e.g., Junius, Polanus, Turretin) draw on arguments for God, simplicity, providence, secondary causes.
 - Resourced in analytic Thomism and classical theism debates (simplicity, immutability, providence).

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of **reasoned apologetics** that neither overclaims for reason nor retreats from metaphysics.
 - Conceptual grammar for cross-loci coherence: God, creation, providence, Christ, and grace interlock.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Preambula fidei (preambles of faith)**: truths about God demonstrable by reason (e.g., existence, simplicity).
- **Mysteria fidei (mysteries of faith)**: truths exceeding reason (Trinity, Incarnation), non-contradictory but known by revelation.
- **Ipsum esse subsistens**: God as subsistent act of being itself, not a member of a genus.
- **Actus purus**: pure actuality without potency; grounds immutability and simplicity.
- **Divine simplicity**: no composition in God (form/matter, essence/existence, act/potency); attributes identical with essence.
- **Analogy of names**: predicates apply to God and creatures neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically.
 - Contrasts with univocity (Scotist) and equivocity (skeptical).
- **Essence-existence distinction**: in creatures essence is distinct from act of existence; in God they are identical.
- **Primary/secondary causality**: God as first cause sustaining creaturely causes without competition.
- **Final causality**: all agents act for an end; underwrites teleology and ethics.
- **Providence**: wise ordering of all things to their ends; compatible with contingency and freedom.
- **Beatitudo (beatitude)**: ultimate end of rational creatures in the vision of God.
- **Creation ex nihilo**: affirmed by revelation; reason shows dependence of being on first cause though not temporal beginning.
- **Knowledge and will in God**: God knows and wills creatures without change or composition; knows particulars as their cause.
- **Motives of credibility**: miracles, prophecies, the Church's growth and sanctity as rational supports for revelation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source** for classical theism (simplicity, immutability, analogy) in Theology Proper and Trinitarian grammar.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking providence/secondary causes to Soteriology, sacramental causality, and human freedom.
 - **Polemic resource** against naturalism, occasionalism, and theistic personalism; clarifies creation and Christological fittingness.
 - **Methodological template** for integrating natural theology with revealed doctrine in teaching and apologetics.
