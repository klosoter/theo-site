### TITLE
The Triune Identity: God According to the Gospel (1982) - Robert W. Jenson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1982 amid late-20th-century debates over Barthian retrieval, narrative theology, and renewed trinitarian studies.
 - Situated in ecumenical Lutheran/Reformed conversation seeking to re-anchor doctrine in scriptural gospel-event rather than abstract metaphysics.

- **Central thesis**
 - **God's identity is essentially triune and is known only in the gospel event**: who God is (ontological identity) is constituted by God's self-revelation as Father, Son and Holy Spirit (economic revelation). Doctrine should therefore proceed from the gospel's narrative grammar.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of classical, metaphysical descriptions of God (abstract attributes detached from history).
 - Recovery of trinitarian identity via the **economic Trinity**: the relations revealed in Christ and the Spirit are constitutive of divine being.
 - Reworking Barthian emphasis on revelation into a constructive account: the revealed acts are not merely witness to an ineffable inner being but instantiate God's very identity.
 - The doctrine of God is thus theological history: God is who he is because of the relational events (Fatherhood in sending, Sonship in being sent, Spirit in procession and mission).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustinian patripassian and classical Augustinian/Aquinian frameworks by corrective.
 - Deep interaction with Karl Barth - reformulating Barth's insistence on revelation as normative for doctrine (see **Barth's Reformulation**).
 - Explicit attention to modern systematic heuristics such as **Rahner's Rule** (the relation between economic and immanent Trinity) while contesting its abstraction.
 - Uses Scripture, early creeds, and contemporary trinitarian scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity (central)**; closely connected: revelation, Christology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, eschatology, and the problem of divine attributes.

- **Closing line**
 - Jenson's theological center of gravity: **the gospel event names and constitutes the Trinity; doctrinal talk of God must be gospel-shaped rather than metaphysically prior.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of **narrative/economic** over speculative ontological depictions: identity = relational event rather than static substance.
 - Theology as **historical-linguistic**: doctrine inherits the grammar of God's acts.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects what he sees as two errors:
 - Classical metaphysics that isolates attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) from the revelatory story.
 - A one-sided modernism that reduces God to ethical or impersonal structures.
 - Recasts Barth: retains Barth's revelation-primacy but pushes further to assert that revelation **constitutes** divine being rather than merely exposing it.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Uses **"identity"** as theological pivot: God's being is not a static substance but a self-differentiating identity disclosed in the Father-Son-Spirit relations.
 - Emphasizes grammar of predication: predicates of God must be read within triune relational context.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong impact on late-20th and early-21st century trinitarian renewal-widely used in ecumenical settings and by theologians seeking to marry Barthian revelation with constructive systematic theology.
 - Criticized by defenders of classical attributes for perceived relativization of divine simplicity and immutability.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a sustained model for teaching trinitarian doctrine where Scripture's narrative is normative.
 - Provokes renewed interrogation of how classical attributes are integrated with revelatory claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Triune identity**
 - God's selfhood as Father, Son, Spirit; identity is constituted by relational event rather than an abstract essence.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - The mode of God's self-revelation in history; for Jenson, constitutive of divine being.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - Internal life of God; Jenson insists it cannot be spoken of apart from economic revelation (dialogue with **Rahner's Rule**).

- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The axiom linking economic and immanent Trinity ("what is said of God in revelation is true of God in himself"); Jenson uses and critiques it, insisting revelation does more than analogically refer to an inaccessible inner life.

- **Barth's Reformulation**
 - Barthian insistence on revelation as normative; Jenson adopts this but extends it to assert revelation as constitutive of identity.

- **Divine simplicity**
 - Classical doctrine that God is metaphysically simple; Jenson questions its utility when detached from triune relations (see **Simplicity, Aseity, Immutability, Impassibility**).

- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence; reinterpreted relationally so aseity is lived in triune sending and being sent.

- **Immutability**
 - Traditional attribute of unchangeableness; for Jenson, to be recast in light of God's dynamic relational life revealed in history.

- **Impassibility**
 - Classical denial of divine suffering; Jenson engages implications of Christ's passion for talk of God's suffering and relational vulnerability.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling of the Persons; operative for explaining identity without collapsing distinction.

- **Revelation-as-event / narrative theology**
 - Theology proceeds from the gospel story; doctrinal predicates derive meaning from narrative contexts.

- **Person / relations of origin**
 - Distinctions of Father, Son, Spirit are real relational identities that constitute divine being.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in trinitarian retrievals that prioritize revelation and narrative.
 - As a **polemic** against decontextualized classical attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading doctrinal loci through gospel events rather than abstract metaphysics.
