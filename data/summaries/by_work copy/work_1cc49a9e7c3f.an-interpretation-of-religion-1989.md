### TITLE
An Interpretation of Religion (1989) - John Hick

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century philosophy of religion and comparative theology. Hick writes as a philosopher-theologian influenced by Kantian critical philosophy, pluralism debates, and post-Enlightenment religious studies. The book consolidates decades of work on religious pluralism, epistemology of religion, and theodicy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Religious traditions are diverse, culturally conditioned responses to a single ultimate reality (the "Real"); classical exclusivist claims must be reinterpreted. The problem of evil and divine justice is addressed by reframing God's purposes: suffering is instrumental in "person-making" (soul-making) rather than retributive punishment.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Human cognitive and religious categories are limited: we apprehend the Real only phenomenally.
 - God (the Real) deliberately preserves an **epistemic distance** so that genuine moral and religious response is possible.
 - Religious traditions provide symbolic, culturally mediated means of responding to the Real; no single tradition exhausts salvific truth.
 - Theodicy: suffering contributes to moral and spiritual development; ultimate justice is eschatological - final transformation and reconciliation rather than temporal retributive balancing.
 - Eschatological hope supports a universalizing outcome: given infinite divine purpose and corrective process after death, eventual universal salvation is plausible.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Kantian epistemology (noumenon/phenomenon), Irenaeus (soul-making), critiques Augustinian/Calvinist retributive theodicies, engages William James, Tillich, Wittgensteinian ideas about religious language, and opponents in exclusivist theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (notions of salvation and universalism), theodicy and divine justice, religious epistemology (knowledge of God), revelation (non-propositional encounter with the Real), anthropology (person-making), eschatology (final justice).
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically the book centers on a Kant-informed pluralist vision: God as the Real who permits epistemic distance so humans can be morally formed, with suffering explained as instrumental to ultimate divine justice and human maturation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Epistemic distance** as a moral-theological principle: divine hiddenness is necessary for authentic freedom and moral development.
 - Recasting **divine justice** away from retributive calculus toward developmental, eschatological rectification (soul-making leading to eventual restoration).
 - Integration of comparative religion with systematic theodicy - pluralism and theodicy are treated as mutually informing.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects classical Augustinian/Calvinist theodicies that appeal primarily to original sin and retributive punishment.
 - Rehabilitates Irenaean soul-making as a superior explanatory framework for the coexistence of a loving God and pervasive suffering.
 - Challenges exclusivist soteriologies that claim propositional monopoly on salvation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "The Real" (noumenal ultimate) employed systematically as the referent of all authentic religious experience.
 - "Pluralistic hypothesis" formalized as an interpretive principle rather than mere toleration.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in interreligious dialogue, religious studies, and liberal theology; widely discussed and debated in contemporary theodicy literature.
 - Criticized by conservative and some Reformed theologians for relativizing incarnation/atonement and for its universalist implications.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for connecting religious pluralism to theodicy and soteriology; a staple resource for courses on philosophy of religion, comparative theology, and modern theodicy debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The Real**
 - Hick's designation for the ultimate noumenal reality that transcends all cultural descriptions; object of genuine religious response.
- **Epistemic distance**
 - The deliberate hiddenness of God that preserves human freedom and makes genuine moral choice possible.
- **Pluralistic hypothesis**
 - The view that world religions are various authentic responses to the same ultimate reality, not mutually exhaustive truth-claims.
- **Religious pluralism**
 - The comparative-theological stance endorsing the validity of multiple religious paths to the Real; normative in Hick's scheme.
- **Soul-making theodicy**
 - Theodical account deriving from Irenaeus: suffering is permitted as a means for moral and spiritual development (person-making).
- **Eschatological justice**
 - Final rectification and full realization of justice in the eschaton; temporal suffering will be harmonized in ultimate outcomes.
- **Universal salvation (universalism)**
 - Hick's hopeful conclusion that divine purposes and corrective post-mortem processes plausibly yield eventual salvation for all.
- **Symbolic religious language**
 - Hick's insistence that religious claims are often non-literal but truth-bearing as symbols pointing to the Real.
- **Noumenon / Phenomenon (Kantian frame)**
 - Distinction used to show that the Real (noumenon) is not directly objectified by human concepts (phenomena are culturally shaped).
- **Person-making / moral formation**
 - The telos of human life under Hick: becoming responsible, mature moral agents through encounters with suffering and religious practice.
- **Comparative-theological method**
 - Methodological posture treating traditions sympathetically and critically as culturally mediated encounters with the Real.
- **Corrective / soteriological process**
 - Post-mortem opportunities and divine correction are part of Hick's account of how ultimate justice and restoration are achieved.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a defining source for modern **religious pluralism** and the "pluralistic hypothesis."
 - As a polemical alternative to classical **retributive theodicy** and exclusivist soteriology.
 - As a conceptual pivot in interdisciplinary work linking **epistemology, ethics, and eschatology** (useful in theodicy and comparative theology syllabi).
