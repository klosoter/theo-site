### TITLE
**The Plan of Salvation** - a Reformed taxonomy and defense of God-centered, covenantal, monergistic salvation

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Modern Protestant milieu, post-Reformation debates sharpened by Tridentine Catholicism, Arminian/Wesleyan synergism, liberal Protestant moralism, and revivalist populism. Often associated with confessional Reformed clarification against both sacramentalism and subjective pietism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Among competing accounts of how God saves sinners, only a **monergistic, Christ-centered, covenantal, and Spirit-applied plan** coheres with Scripture, human inability, and doxological purpose. The work classifies rival plans by how grace is mediated, how the will operates, and the scope of divine intention.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Axiom:** God saves sinners; sin entails guilt and moral impotence, requiring divine initiative.
 - **Autosoterism vs. heterosoterism:** Self-salvation schemes (moralism, rationalism) collapse under sin; true salvation is of the Lord.
 - **Mediate vs. immediate grace:** 
 - **Sacerdotalism:** Church and sacraments as conduits that cause grace.
 - **Evangelical plan:** Spirit works **immediately** on the soul, using means but not bound by them.
 - **Synergism vs. monergism:** 
 - Synergism conditions grace on human will.
 - Monergism teaches **effectual calling/regeneration precedes faith**, ensuring faith as its fruit.
 - **Particularism vs. universalism:** 
 - Divine intention: definite atonement and unconditional election vs. universal intention that fails to save.
 - **Covenantal frame:** Pactum salutis, covenant of works/grace, New Covenant fulfillment in Christ; federal headship of Adam and Christ.
 - **Christology and atonement:** Substitutionary, penal, definite; union with Christ structures all benefits.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments:** True means of grace, not grace-causing; Word and sacrament under the Spirit.
 - **Ordo salutis to telos:** Calling, regeneration, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, glorification; assurance grounded in divine promise and Spirit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine; medieval scholasticism; Trent; Luther, Calvin; Arminius, Wesley; Protestant Liberalism (Schleiermacher, Ritschl); Reformed confessions (Dort, Westminster).
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture and revelation; Trinity and divine decree; anthropology and sin; Christology; pneumatology; covenant theology; church and sacraments; eschatology.
- **Closing line:** God **purposes, accomplishes, and applies** salvation to a particular people in Christ by the Spirit through ordained means, so that all glory is of grace alone.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - A crisp **taxonomy**: autosoterism vs heterosoterism; sacerdotal vs evangelical; synergism vs monergism; universal vs particular intent.
 - Strong claim that **regeneration is effectual and logically prior** to saving faith.
 - **Immediate operation of the Spirit** alongside instituted means; sacraments are instruments, not efficient causes.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **sacerdotal causality** of grace; against **Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian** anthropology; against **unlimited-intention** atonement that leaves God willing what is never realized.
 - Nuances Lutheran and Arminian accounts where faith is made the condition that moves God.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of **autosoterism**, **sacerdotalism**, **particularism**, and **immediate grace** as mapping terms.
 - Tight linkage of **federal theology** with the ordo salutis and divine intention.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed catechesis and seminary surveys to orient soteriology and ecclesiology.
 - Provokes pushback from sacramental and ecumenical theologians for perceived reductionism; appreciated for clarity by evangelical and confessional readers.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Helps students identify the **true decision points** in salvation debates.
 - Demonstrates the **systemic coherence** of Reformed soteriology across exegesis, dogmatics, and practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Autosoterism:** Any plan in which the human subject saves self by moral effort, reason, or experience; rejected due to total inability.
- **Heterosoterism:** Salvation wholly from God; grace as source, not supplement.
- **Sacerdotalism:** Church/sacraments as efficient causes of grace; contrasted with instrumental means.
- **Evangelical plan:** Spirit applies redemption **immediately** to individuals through Word and sacraments as instruments.
- **Monergism:** God alone effects regeneration; faith is a gift and result, not a prior condition.
- **Synergism:** God and human will cooperate; grace made contingent on prior human response.
- **Particularism:** Definite divine intention and election; atonement effective for the elect.
 - Contrasts with **universalism** or universal intention that does not secure salvation.
- **Immediate vs. mediate grace:** Spirit works directly on the soul vs. grace caused through institutional means.
- **Federal headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; imputation of guilt and righteousness.
- **Covenant of grace:** One saving covenant administered across redemptive history, culminating in the New Covenant.
- **Effectual calling:** Inward, powerful summons that creates what it commands.
- **Regeneration:** New birth antecedent to faith; inaugurates union with Christ.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration on the basis of Christ alone, received by faith alone.
- **Means of grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer; instruments the Spirit uses, not autonomous channels.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional map** in soteriology, clarifying core options and commitments.
 - As a **polemic touchstone** in doctrine of sin, exposing the inadequacy of moralism and synergism.
 - As an **ecclesiological guide**, distinguishing means from causes in sacramental theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology, the ordo salutis, and eschatological assurance.
