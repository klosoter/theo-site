### TITLE
The Eucharistic Words of Jesus - Joachim Jeremias

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century New Testament scholarship (postwar Germany). Jeremias writes from a Lutheran, historical-critical milieu that emphasizes Aramaic background and Second Temple Judaism; reacts to form-criticism and to confessional sacramental debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reconstruct the original meaning and function of Jesus' eucharistic utterances (institutional words) in their Jewish-Passover and Aramaic matrix to determine what Jesus intended by "This is my body" and related formulas - and thereby clarify the theological claims about Christ's presence and the sacrament's character.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reconstruct the Aramaic and Jewish liturgical context of the Last Supper (Passover seder forms, blessing formulas, metonymic speech-acts).
 - Analyze the Synoptic and Pauline texts (especially Mark, Matthew, Luke, and 1 Corinthians 11) for linguistic and ritual syntax that points to an original Semitic idiom.
 - Argue that Jesus' words are eschatological reinterpretations of Passover elements: the bread and cup point to his impending death and the coming kingdom.
 - Maintain a **sacramental realism**: the words effect a real presence tied to Jesus' eschatological self-giving, but not reducible to medieval metaphysical categories.
 - Examine early church praxis (e.g., fencing the table, admission rules) as responses to the words' implications for communal identity and discipline.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Synoptic evangelists, Paul (1 Cor 11), Jewish liturgical texts (Haggadah materials), Rabbinic parallels, some Dead Sea Scroll background; theological interlocutors include medieval scholastics (e.g., Aquinas), Reformers (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli), and modern scholars (form-critics, Bultmannian lines).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (presence of the risen Christ), sacramentology (nature and efficacy of sacraments), covenant/meal theology, eschatology (kingdom fulfillment), ecclesiology (table fellowship, discipline).
- **Closing line:** Jeremias situates the eucharistic words as an Aramaic, Passover-rooted, eschatological speech-act: they both signify and effect Christ's saving self-giving within covenantal meal practice, grounding sacramental presence in Jesus' prophetic reinterpretation rather than later metaphysical formulations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **Aramaic idiom** and Jewish ritual background as decisive for meaning.
 - Framing the words primarily as **eschatological reinterpretation** of Passover rather than purely instituting formula or purely symbolic memorial.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against scholastic/metaphysical accounts that detach words from their ritual and linguistic context (e.g., transubstantiation as philosophical overlay).
 - Nuanced correction of extreme memorialism (Zwinglian reduction): Jeremias affirms a real, sacramental presence grounded in Jesus' words and eschatological promise.
 - Engagement with Bultmannian demythologizing: preserves historical-linguistic concrete reference while avoiding uncritical literalism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Use of speech-act and ritual-language categories applied to Jesus' sayings (e.g., blessing-formula, metonymic identification).
 - Repeated attention to the idiomatic use of demonstratives and possessives in Aramaic as theological keys.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in mid-to-late 20th century sacramental studies, ecumenical dialogues, and historical-Jesus research.
 - Adopted by many as a corrective against purely symbolic or overly philosophical treatments; engaged critically by Reformed scholars but often appreciated for its careful exegesis.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies rigorous integration of language, ritual, and theology.
 - Provides a hermeneutical bridge between historical exegesis and systematic sacramental reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eucharistic words:** The specific sayings of Jesus at the meal; Jeremias reconstructs their original force in Aramaic.
- **Aramaic idiom / ethology:** The importance of Semitic grammar and demonstratives for interpreting "this" and "it is."
- **Passover / seder context:** The feast framework that shapes Jesus' reinterpretive action and language.
- **Blessing-formula:** Jewish liturgical speech-acts that Jeremias sees as antecedent templates for Jesus' words.
- **Eschatological meal:** Theological category locating the Last Supper as anticipation/realization of the kingdom.
- **Sacramental realism:** Jeremias' stance that the words effect genuine presence grounded in Christ's eschatological action (distinct from scholastic metaphysics).
- **Metonymic/representational speech:** How "this is my body" can function as representative/participatory language rather than strict ontological transmutation.
- **Anamnesis / memorial:** Memory-language recalibrated: not mere recollection but liturgical making-present of eschatological reality.
- **Fencing the table:** Early church practice of restricting admission; Jeremias reads this as ecclesial safeguarding of covenant meal.
- **Admission / discipline:** Criteria and practices for who may partake, interpreted in light of covenant fidelity and eschatological readiness.
- **Institution narrative:** The Gospel accounts as ritual-embedded reports, recoverable to a historical instituting act.
- **Covenant meal:** Theological lens linking Passover, Last Supper, and ecclesial communion.
- **Presence of Christ:** Theological locus: how Jesus is present in/through the elements by his word and eschatological promise.
- **For you / for many:** Pauline and Synoptic phrases considered in their sacrificial and covenantal sense.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reconstructing Jesus' sayings from Semitic and ritual contexts.
- As a **polemic resource** against reductive memorialism and against uncritical adoption of medieval metaphysical categories.
- As a **definition source** for sacramental realism that is historically grounded and theologically moderate - a pivot between confessional extremes.
