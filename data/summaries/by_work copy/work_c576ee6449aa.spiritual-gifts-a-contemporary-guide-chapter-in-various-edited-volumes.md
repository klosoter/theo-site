### TITLE
**Spiritual Gifts: A Contemporary Guide** - D. A. Carson (chapter appearing in various edited evangelical volumes; late 20th-early 21st century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in an era of heightened charismatic renewal and heated academic debate (post-1970s onward).
 - Situated within conservative evangelical/Reformed scholarly milieu that prizes careful exegesis and pastoral prudence.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How should the church understand, evaluate, and regulate spiritual gifts in light of Scripture, church history, and contemporary experience? Carson aims to mediate between uncritical charismatic enthusiasm and reductionist cessationism.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of key texts (1 Corinthians 12-14; Romans 12; Ephesians 4; Acts passages) to determine normative practice.
 - Historical-theological survey: examines patristic, medieval, and Reformation attitudes toward gifts to calibrate contemporary claims.
 - Theological criteria: proposes tests (apostolicity, conformity to Scripture, edification, order) to evaluate purported gifts.
 - Pastoral applications: guidelines for congregational practice, leadership oversight, and disciplining excesses.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary continuationists (e.g., Wayne Grudem, Gordon Fee in some contexts) and classical cessationists (e.g., B. B. Warfield, John MacArthur), while drawing on church fathers and Reformers for historical perspective.
 - Uses canonical texts as primary evidence; interacts with recent exegetical and systematic treatments.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (nature and operation of the Spirit)
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (authority and sufficiency; testing new utterances)
 - **Ecclesiology** (order, worship, pastoral oversight)
 - **Apostolicity and canon** (role of apostolic signs and the close of special revelation)
- **Closing line**
 - Carson's center of gravity: *the Spirit continues to empower the church, but charismatic phenomena must be disciplined by Scripture, tested by apostolic norms, and regulated for the church's orderly edification.*

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on methodological humility: prioritize biblical exegesis and church-historical patterns over contemporary anecdote.
 - Distinguishes functional continuation (gifts as ongoing) from demonstrative continuation (signs as normative today).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against wholesale cessationism that neglects observable contemporary ministry gifts.
 - Critiques uncritical continuationism that elevates experience above canonical test and church order.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies categories such as **ordinary/ongoing** vs **extraordinary/sign** gifts and stresses the epistemic role of apostolic authentication.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical seminaries as a balanced, pastorally sensitive model; used by both sides as a tempering resource.
 - Influential in forming many conservative evangelical pastors who accept some charismatic manifestations but insist on strict testing.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable bridge between scholarship and parish practice: exegetical rigor married to pastoral prudence makes it a staple for teaching and ecclesial policy-making.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism**
 - The view that spiritual gifts (including miraculous/revelatory gifts) continue after the apostolic age; Carson treats it with qualified acceptance.
- **Cessationism**
 - The claim that certain gifts ceased with the apostles; Carson critiques simple formulations while acknowledging historical arguments for limited cessation.
- **Sign gifts / extraordinary gifts**
 - Gifts like tongues, healings, and miracles often understood as authentication of apostleship; Carson emphasizes cautious assessment of claims.
- **Ordinary/ongoing gifts**
 - Gifts tied to church ministry (teaching, pastoring, helps) that are clearly normative for all ages.
- **Prophecy (ecclesial vs. canonical)**
 - Distinguishes prophetic speech within congregational edification from canonical revelation; insists the former must be subordinate to Scripture.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Test for normative revelation: apostolic origin/authentication matters for public acceptance of extraordinary gifts.
- **Canon and sufficiency of Scripture**
 - Scripture is final normative standard; alleged new revelation must be tested against it.
- **Discernment / testing the spirits**
 - Practical criteria (doctrine, fruit, order, accountability) for evaluating claimed gifts.
- **Pneumatological restraint**
 - Emphasis on the Spirit's sovereignty but within ordained means and institutional checks.
- **Edification and order**
 - Primary biblical purposes for gifts in public worship (especially in 1 Corinthians 14).
- **Phenomenology vs theology**
 - Distinguishes descriptive accounts of phenomena from normative theological claims.
- **Historical theology**
 - Use of patristic and Reformation witnesses to contextualize contemporary claims.
- **Pastoral prudence**
 - Guidelines for leaders to prevent abuse and to nurture legitimate gifts.
- **Canonical finality**
 - The conviction that the closure of special revelation limits the status of modern "prophecy."
- **Extraordinary authentication**
 - The idea that certain miracles functioned to verify apostolic message.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians and discerning normative worship practice.
- As a **polemic and corrective** against both charismatic excess and rigid cessationism-used in sermons, polity documents, and seminary courses.
- As a **definition source** to clarify terms (sign/ordinary gifts) and to craft testing procedures for congregational oversight.
