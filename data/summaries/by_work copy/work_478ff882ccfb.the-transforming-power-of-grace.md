### TITLE
The Transforming Power of Grace - Thomas C. Oden 
(Placed within Oden's late-20th-century retrievalist, Wesleyan-Methodist, and patristic-oriented theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th-century theological reaction to liberal moralism, existentialist/neo-orthodox streams, and an increasing interest in patristic and classical consensual theology (Oden as a leader in the paleo-orthodoxy movement). 
 - Pastoral-theological aim: recover an account of grace that serves both doctrine and Christian formation in contemporary church life.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Christian grace is not merely forensic or legal; it is intrinsically transformative - restorative of human nature, will, and habits - and must be understood within the life of the church, sacraments, and spiritual formation.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnosis: Modern theology and culture have attenuated the power of grace by reducing salvation to ethics or abstract justification. 
 - Retrieval: Patristic and classical sources present grace as therapeutic, sacramental, and habit-forming. 
 - Synthesis: A doctrinal account that unites **justification** and **sanctification**, prevenient and sustaining divine action, and ecclesial means (preaching, sacraments, disciplines) as the channels of transforming grace. 
 - Application: Practical implications for pastoral care, worship, and moral formation - grace works through accessible ecclesial practices to make believers "genuinely human."

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Heavy appeal to Church Fathers and medieval consensus; constructive engagement with Reformers (Luther, Calvin), Wesleyan emphases (prevenient and sanctifying grace), and critique of modern theologians who marginalize classical notions. 
 - Implicit and explicit contrast with Pelagian/semi-Pelagian tendencies, liberal moralism, and some forms of reductionist forensic readings.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Grace (prevenient, justifying, sanctifying), sin (disorder, bondage), justification and sanctification (integrated), sacramental theology (means of grace), ecclesiology (the church as mediator), anthropology (restoration of the will and virtues), pastoral theology and spiritual disciplines.

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** 
 - Grace is the church-mediated, divine power that therapeutically restores human nature and formation, uniting justification and sanctification in a life-changing reality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Stresses grace as therapeutic and habit-forming rather than merely juridical; emphasizes restoration of human nature and virtues. 
 - Strongly ecclesial: grace primarily operates through the church's life, sacraments, preaching, and disciplines.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Corrects liberal theology's reduction of Christianity to ethicalism and private piety. 
 - Challenges readings that isolate forensic justification from sanctifying grace; opposes Pelagian or semi-Pelagian minimizations of divine prevenient action. 
 - Pushes back on neo-orthodox ruptures with tradition by restoring continuity with patristic consensus.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframing "transforming power" as a technical pastoral-theological category linking soteriology, sacrament, and moral formation. 
 - Reintegrates language of "therapeutic" salvation (healing, habituation) into mainstream Protestant discourse.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Influential in Methodist/Wesleyan circles and among those in the paleo-orthodox/ecumenical retrieval movement. 
 - Adopted by pastors and teachers seeking a balanced soteriology that fosters spiritual formation; prompted renewed interest in patristic sources among Protestants.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a model for integrating doctrine and practice; valuable for preaching, pastoral care, sacramental theology, and curriculum that seeks to form Christian character rather than only instruct belief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Grace (transforming):** Divine, restorative power that changes the whole person - intellect, will, and habit. 
- **Prevenient grace:** God's initiating, enabling action that opens human responsiveness (Wesleyan resonance). 
- **Justification:** Declared rightness by God, held in tension with but not isolated from sanctifying grace. 
- **Sanctification:** Progressive moral and spiritual transformation shaped by habitual grace and church practices. 
- **Therapeutic model:** Salvation conceived as healing of disorder rather than solely legal remedy. 
- **Means of grace:** Preaching, sacraments, prayer, and disciplines as concrete channels of transformative grace. 
- **Ecclesial mediation:** The church as the primary locus where grace is administered and formed. 
- **Habit and virtue:** Classical moral psychology that locates transformation in the reformation of habits. 
- **Anthropology (genuinely human):** Human flourishing understood as restored image-bearing in relation to God. 
- **Patristic retrieval:** Use of early consensual theology to correct modern distortions. 
- **Anti-Pelagian stance:** Emphasis on dependence upon divine initiative against human merit-centered accounts. 
- **Forensic-soteriological integration:** Effort to hold forensic justification and transformative sanctification together.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for expansive, ecclesial accounts of grace in systematic and pastoral theology. 
 - As a **polemic** against liberal moralism and reductionist forensic-only soteriologies. 
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** for preaching and formation that links sacramental practice to moral transformation.
