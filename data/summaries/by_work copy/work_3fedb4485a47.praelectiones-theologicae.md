### TITLE
**Praelectiones Theologicae** - William Whitaker (1548-1595). 
Lecture-series / posthumous collected lectures; principal treatment in Protestant scholastic language of the late Tudor Cambridge school. Topic emphasized here: **Self Attestation and Authority of Scripture**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Cambridge; Whitaker as Master of St. John's and leading English Reformed scholastic. Work shaped by post-Reformation controversies with Roman Catholics (Jesuits and Counter-Reformation apologists) and by consolidation of Reformed confessional theology in England.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is God-breathed, in itself authoritative and self-authenticating; the Church's authority and tradition are derivative, not constitutive, of Scripture's infallible normativity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic scholastic disputation: definitions, objections, responses, and loci-based proofs.
 - Major moves:
 - Define inspiration and canonicity: Scripture is divinely authored (inspiratio divina) and thus truly Word of God (verba Dei).
 - Establish **self-attestation** (testimonium internum): the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit qualifies Scripture as authoritative for faith and life.
 - Provide external confirmations (probatio externa): prophetic fulfillment, miracles, antiquity, and ecclesial reception as attendant signs, not constitutive causes, of canonicity.
 - Answer the circularity objection: Distinguish the Spirit's immediate testimony to the believer from a mere inferential proof that presupposes scriptural authority.
 - Polemic against Roman claims: the papal magisterium and tradition cannot impart primary authority equal to or above Scripture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine, Calvin, Bucer, and Reformed authorities; engages scholastic categories (Aquinas, Thomas' method) largely to refute Romanist positions (Jesuit apologists like Stapleton and Bellarmine-type arguments).
 - Scripture and Patristic citations used to ground claims; appeals to classical scholastic logical forms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, canonicity, perspicuity and sufficiency of Scripture, ecclesiology (magisterial authority), hermeneutics, and epistemology of faith (Spirit-witness).
- **Closing line**
 - Whitaker centers the theological gravity on **Scripture as divinely authored and self-authenticating**, with the Spirit's interior witness and external signs vindicating its normative authority against ecclesial usurpation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Forceful articulation of the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit as non-redundant and epistemically decisive for the believer's reception of Scripture.
 - Clear separation of *constitutive* versus *confirmatory* roles for Church tradition and magisterium.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic insistence on an infallible ecclesial magisterium; reframes Aquinas-style appeals to ecclesial authority as secondary to God's Word.
 - More scholastically rigorous than many earlier Reformers (e.g., Calvin's more pastoral tone), offering systematic rebuttals to contemporary Catholic casuistry.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines the scholastic deployment of "testimonium internum" and "probatio externa" within a Reformed epistemology of revelation.
 - Tight delineation of circularity objections and a methodological response that preserves both experiential Spirit-witness and rational apologetic signs.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in English Reformed academic circles and later Protestant scholasticism; used pedagogically in Cambridge and by Puritan theologians defending sola Scriptura.
 - Served as a polemical model against Counter-Reformation claims; less cited in modern evangelical circles but important for historical-theological study.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching the epistemology of revelation, defense of Scriptural authority, and how to marry internal spiritual testimony with external apologetic proofs in theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation (testimonium internum)** - the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit that authenticates Scripture to the believer; central epistemic claim.
- **Probatio externa (external attestation)** - prophecy, miracles, antiquity, and ecclesial reception as confirmatory signs, not the primary cause of authority.
- **Inspiratio divina (inspiration)** - Scripture as God-breathed; basis for infallibility and normative status.
- **Verba Dei (words of God)** - phrasing to assert divine authorship and verbal reliability.
- **Perspicuity (claritas scripturae)** - Scripture's sufficiency and relative clarity for essentials of faith; defended against both anti-intellectual obscurantism and alleged obscurity claims of Rome.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture (sufficere)** - Scripture contains what is necessary for salvation and doctrine; tradition supplements but does not supersede.
- **Canon (canonicitas / canonization)** - criteria and recognition of canonical books; Whitaker treats canonicity as grounded in divine origin with human recognition.
- **Magisterium / ecclesial authority** - defined as derivative; denied an independent constitutive role in making Scripture authoritative.
- **Circularity objection** - the claim that using Scripture to prove Scripture is viciously circular; Whitaker's reply: the Spirit's witness and non-inferential signs break the viciousness.
- **Sensum literalis** - emphasis on literal-sense reading within proper hermeneutical rules as safeguard against ecclesial fiat.
- **Traditio (tradition)** - treated as valuable but subordinate and confirmatory.
- **Spiritus Sanctus testimony** - practical, experiential guarantee of Scripture's truth to believers; epistemic bridge between revelation and assent.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed doctrines of inspiration and self-attestation.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Catholic magisterial claims and for sola Scriptura.
 - As an **exegetical and methodological model** showing how internal testimony and external proofs are integrated in doctrinal loci on revelation and hermeneutics.
