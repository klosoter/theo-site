### TITLE
Image of God (Imago Dei) - Catherine L. McDowell, entry in The Lexham Bible Dictionary

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical reference entry (Lexham Bible Dictionary; 21st-century biblical-theological milieu). Oriented to succinct, scholarship-informed summary for pastors, students, and researchers; aims to synthesize biblical, historical, and theological conversation rather than advance a single novel thesis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** "Image of God" is a multi-dimensional biblical concept best understood by integrating ancient Near Eastern background, Genesis context, and New Testament fulfillment; competing explanatory models (substantive, functional, relational, etc.) each capture aspects of the data but none alone exhaust the biblical witness.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Exegetical survey:** close attention to Genesis 1:26-27 and related texts (Gen 5:1; 9:6; Ps/Prov echoes; NT allusions such as 1 Cor 11:7, James 3:9).
 - **Background:** situates Israelite language in ANE milieu where kings function as divine representatives (royal/functional parallels illuminate Genesis usage).
 - **Typology of interpretations:** lays out major scholarly categories (substantive/ontological, functional/representative, relational, and structural/capacity models), assessing strengths and limits of each against the biblical data.
 - **Theological implications:** traces ramifications for anthropology, sin (distortion vs. loss), Christology (Christ as true image/fulfillment), soteriology (restoration), ethics, social justice, and ecclesiology (corporate aspects).
 - **Synthesis and pastoral application:** favors an integrated reading that highlights vocation (representation), relationality (to God and others), and eschatological restoration in Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** biblical texts, Septuagintal usage (eikon), ANE parallels (royal image motifs), patristic and medieval readings (Augustine/Aquinas as historical touchpoints), Reformation emphases (e.g., Calvin on corrupted yet retained image), and contemporary evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** creation, anthropology, sin and depravity, Christology (image of God embodied in Christ), soteriology (restoration), ecclesiology (corporate image-bearing), ethics (human dignity, justice).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The imago Dei should be read as a biblically grounded, multifaceted theological category that unites human vocation (divine representation), relationality, and eschatological restoration in Christ rather than a single static property.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the **functional/royal** aspect rooted in ANE contexts alongside relational and substantive elements - the image as vocation to represent God.
 - Gives proportionate weight to biblical witness over later philosophical (substance-based) metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Challenges a solely **substantive/ontological** reduction (reason, soul, or substance alone) as insufficient to explain Genesis 1.
 - Counters readings that treat the image as entirely lost in sin; instead affirms **distortion but continuity**, enabling ethics and responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Promotes integrative language (e.g., **functional-relational synthesis**) to avoid false dichotomies between "what we are" and "what we do."
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Functions as a mainstream evangelical reference synthesis - widely used for teaching, sermon preparation, and entry-level research rather than as a programmatic monograph.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clear, balanced overview that aids pastors and students in moving from exegesis to doctrine and practice; useful as an authoritative starting point for deeper study.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** the biblical designation for human distinctiveness and vocation grounded in Genesis 1:26-27.
- **Likeness:** textual partner to "image"; theological nuance debated (likeness as moral/ethical conformity or as intensification of image).
- **Substantive model:** defines image as intrinsic attributes (reason, will, soul); strengths: explains dignity; limits: underplays vocation and context.
- **Functional (royal/representative) model:** reads image as office/role (ruling, stewarding) - strongly supported by ANE royal parallels.
- **Relational model:** locates image in relationships (to God, to others); emphasizes sociality and Trinitarian resonance.
- **Structural/capacity model:** ties image to capacities (language, moral agency, relationality) that enable representation.
- **Distortion (by sin) vs. loss:** theological distinction-sin damages the image but does not annihilate human personhood or moral responsibility.
- **Christ as true Image:** NT theme (e.g., Colossians; 2 Corinthians) portraying Christ as the fulfillment and restoration of the image.
- **Corporate image-bearing:** idea that Israel/the church corporately embody God's image; links individual and communal dimensions.
- **Eschatological restoration:** final renewal where the image is fully realized in redeemed humanity.
- **Ethical implications:** grounding for human dignity, human rights, and justice obligations.
- **Septuagint/eikon:** Greek translation influences New Testament reception and theological nuance.
- **ANE royal imagery:** background motif that illuminates Genesis' likely connotations of representation and stewardship.
- **Personhood & status:** how imago Dei functions in debates about life, disability, gender, and bioethics.
- **Image-bearer:** common shorthand emphasizing moral and social consequences of imago Dei.

How this entry is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: concise, balanced definition for teaching and sermon work.
- As an **exegetical model**: supplies ANE and textual cues to prefer an integrated functional-relational reading.
- As a **theological pivot**: links biblical anthropology to Christology and ethics (esp. human dignity and social justice).
