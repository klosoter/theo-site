### TITLE
"The Holy Spirit and the Life of Jesus" - Gordon D. Fee (essay in The Holy Spirit and Christian Origins, ed. Graham N. Stanton et al.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th-century New Testament scholarship; evangelical and Pentecostal-informed exegesis situated within historical-critical method. Responds to renewed scholarly interest in early Christian pneumatology and in bridging New Testament exegesis with systematic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The Holy Spirit is constitutive for Jesus' messianic identity and ministry, not merely for the post-resurrection church. The Spirit anoints, empowers, and is the agent of Jesus' life, ministry, and vindication (resurrection), thereby grounding a pneumatological dimension to Christology and resurrection theology.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):**
 - Exegetical demonstration that Gospel and Pauline texts portray the Spirit as present at key moments: birth, baptism, public ministry, and vindication.
 - At Jesus' baptism the Spirit's descent functions as **anointing** and inauguration of messianic mission.
 - The Spirit's presence explains Jesus' prophetic activity, exorcisms, teaching authority, and empowerment for ministry.
 - The resurrection and vindication of Jesus are presented in Scripture as intimately connected with divine Spirit-action; resurrection is not merely the Son's act but involves the Spirit as agent of new life.
 - Theological synthesis arguing continuity between the Spirit's role in Jesus and the Spirit's role in the church-yet preserving distinctions between incarnate Son and Spirit.
 - Rebuttal of readings that confine the Spirit's decisive activity to Pentecost or that marginalize Spirit in pre-resurrection Christology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary engagement with canonical New Testament texts (Gospels, Acts, Paul). Dialogues with contemporary New Testament scholars and with traditions minimizing the Spirit's role in Jesus' own life.
- **Doctrines treated:**
 - **Pneumatology**, **Christology**, **resurrection theology**, **revelation**, and implicitly **Trinity** (relations and distinctions between Son and Spirit).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):**
 - The Spirit is not an ancillary gift later bestowed upon believers; rather, the Spirit is the divine agent whose action in and through Jesus inaugurates God's new creation and grounds both Jesus' messianic identity and his vindication in resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the Spirit is central to Jesus' own identity and ministry (anointing at baptism, empowerment for mission, agent in resurrection/vindication).
 - Integration of historical-critical exegesis with pneumatological theology - reading texts for both descriptive and normative theological significance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Challenges approaches that restrict decisive Spirit-action to post-resurrection Pentecost narratives.
 - Counters Christologies that isolate the Son's agency in resurrection, reintroducing the Spirit as co-agent in God's creative redemptive act.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes language of **anointing/inauguration** and **Spirit-as-agent-of-new-creation** when discussing Jesus' life and vindication.
 - Uses ecclesial pneumatology as interpretive lens for pre-Pentecost Jesus-material without collapsing distinctions between incarnate Son and Spirit.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and Pentecostal circles as a corrective against binitarian or proto-adoptionist readings; taken seriously across traditions for careful exegesis linking pneumatology and Christology.
 - Influential for contemporary debates about continuity between Jesus' Spirit-endowment and the Spirit's gift to the church.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models careful text-to-doctrine work: how close reading of Gospel and Pauline texts can reshape systematic accounts of the Spirit and resurrection.
 - Serves as a concise primer for linking Jesus' ministry to broader pneumatological themes in Christian origins.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anointing (baptismal anointing):** Spirit's descent at baptism marks inauguration of Jesus' messianic mission.
- **Inauguration:** The beginning of Jesus' public ministry as initiated by Spirit-bestowal.
- **Empowerment:** The Spirit as the source of Jesus' authority for teaching, exorcism, and prophetic action.
- **Agent of Resurrection:** The Spirit functions as the divine agent in Jesus' vindication and the new-creation act of raising him.
- **New-creation language:** The Spirit's activity is described in terms that echo creation motifs-bringing life where there was death.
- **Continuity/Discontinuity:** Continuity between Spirit's role in Jesus and in the church; maintains ontological distinction between Son and Spirit.
- **Pneumatological Christology:** The approach that reads Christology through the lens of pneumatology rather than treating the Spirit as merely derivative.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The Spirit signals the in-breaking of the eschatological age in Jesus' ministry.
- **Vindication:** Divine confirmation of Jesus (resurrection) as linked to Spirit-action, not merely human reassertion.
- **Exorcism and authority:** Uses Spirit-language to explain Jesus' power over demons and his authoritative teaching.
- **Baptism narrative function:** Acts as theological hinge linking identity and mission via Spirit.
- **Trinitarian implications:** While not systematic trinitarian theology, the essay pushes for integrating Spirit's role into Trinitarian readings of Jesus' life.
- **Historical-critical use:** Model of reading textual data for theological claims, balancing historical context and doctrinal import.
- **Pastoral/ethic implications:** Implicit resources for understanding Christian empowerment and mission as rooted in the same Spirit that enabled Jesus.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for linking Gospel texts to pneumatology and resurrection theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching that restores the Spirit to central place in Christology and the doctrine of resurrection.
- As a **polemic resource** against readings that marginalize the Spirit before Pentecost.
