### TITLE
**An Introduction to Systematic Theology** - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting and publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Westminster Seminary lectures and syllabi, forged against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy, and old Princeton evidentialism. Rooted in Dutch Reformed theology (Kuyper, Bavinck) yet distinctive in method. Published for wider use later via P&R.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Christian theism is a self-contained, self-attesting system** grounded in the ontological Trinity. All human knowledge is **analogical and covenantal**, not autonomous. **Dogmatics and apologetics are one task**, beginning with God as principium and Scripture as self-attesting revelation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prolegomena: nature of theology as a redemptive-historical, covenantal science; the necessity of system.
 - Principia: God as principium essendi; Scripture as principium cognoscendi; the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.
 - Revelation and Scripture: inspiration, authority, clarity; rejection of neutrality and of analogia entis.
 - God and Trinity: **ontological Trinity** as metaphysical foundation for unity and diversity, logic, and predication.
 - Creation, providence, and covenant: the Creator-creature distinction; covenantal context for all knowledge.
 - Christology and soteriology: the incarnate Logos as climactic revelation and Redeemer; knowledge restored ethically in Christ.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: the church as covenant community under the Word; sacraments as signs within the self-attesting system.
 - Eschatology: consummation as fulfillment of the divine plan that grounds history and meaning.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively engages Calvin, Augustine, Kuyper, Bavinck; confessional standards. Critiques Aquinas and Roman Catholic natural theology, Kant and idealism, Warfieldian evidentialism, and especially Barth and Brunner. Dialogues with contemporary science and philosophy via a transcendental critique.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; doctrine of God and Trinity; creation and providence; covenant; Christology; hamartiology; soteriology; church and sacraments; last things. All refracted through prolegomena on method.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity is the **self-attesting Triune God** who covenants to reveal and redeem in Christ through Scripture, such that every fact is what it is by His plan and must be interpreted accordingly.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Presuppositional method** and **transcendental argument**: Christian theism is the precondition for intelligibility.
 - **Analogy of knowledge**: human knowledge is ectypal, derivative, and covenantally situated.
 - **Antithesis and common grace** held together: ethical opposition to unbelief with real, non-neutral contact points.
 - **Trinitarian metaphysic**: unity and diversity grounded in the ontological Trinity, not abstract logic.
 - **System-consciousness**: theology must be a comprehensive, confessional system.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **autonomous reason** and neutral common ground; revises Princeton evidentialism.
 - Against **analogia entis** and Roman Catholic natural theology as independent pathway to God.
 - Against **Barthian** dialectic and Christomonism that dissolves historical objectivity and Scriptural self-attestation.
 - Nuances Kuyper by sharpening the transcendental critique and principial method.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Self-attesting Christ of Scripture**, **principium essendi/cognoscendi**, **limiting concepts**, **concrete universal**, **Christian-theistic proof**, **point of contact** redefined covenantally.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical in Westminster and broader Reformed apologetics. Developed by Frame, Bahnsen, Oliphint. Debated with Gordon Clark on analogy and paradox. Critiqued by Thomists and classical apologists; engaged by analytic theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Stabilizes a **Trinitarian, covenantal prolegomena**; integrates apologetics with dogmatics; protects the **Creator-creature distinction** while energizing constructive work across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principium essendi** and **principium cognoscendi**
 - God Himself as the ground of being and knowledge; Scripture as the authoritative means of knowing Him.
- **Self-attestation**
 - Scripture and Christ bear their own divine credentials; no higher tribunal judges revelation.
- **Presupposition**
 - Basic, pre-theoretical commitment to the triune God and His Word that governs all reasoning.
- **Transcendental argument**
 - From the conditions of intelligibility to the truth of Christian theism; not mere probability but necessity.
- **Analogical knowledge**
 - Our thoughts correspond truly yet creaturely to Gods archetypal knowledge; avoids univocity and equivocity.
- **Creator-creature distinction**
 - Absolute ontological difference regulating all theology and epistemology.
- **Archetypal vs. ectypal knowledge**
 - Gods comprehensive self-knowledge vs. our finite, covenantally mediated knowledge.
- **Ontological Trinity vs. economic Trinity**
 - The former grounds reality and rationality; the latter is the history of revelation and redemption.
- **Antithesis**
 - Ethical-religious opposition of belief and unbelief in all domains, not only in the church.
- **Common grace and point of contact**
 - Shared creaturely situation and restraint of sin provide contact, yet never neutrality.
- **Covenantal revelation**
 - God relates and reveals as Lord to vassal; knowledge is obedient, not autonomous.
- **System**
 - Doctrines cohere within the plan of God; facts are already interpreted by God.
- **Concrete universal and limiting concept**
 - Trinity as the true universal that gives place to particulars; limiting concepts mark creaturely finitude.
- **Ethical suppression**
 - Unbelievers know God yet suppress the truth in unrighteousness, per Romans 1.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for prolegomena and principia in Reformed dogmatics.
 - As a **polemical framework** against neutrality, natural theology, and neo-orthodoxy.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** grounding Christology, Trinity, covenant, and eschatology in a unified system.
 - As a **methodological template** integrating exegesis, confession, and transcendental critique.
