### TITLE
Resurrection and Moral Order: An Outline for Evangelical Ethics - Oliver O'Donovan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the late 20th century amid renewed evangelical interest in public theology and ethics; an Anglican voice shaped by Reformed covenantal concerns and conversation with continental and British political theology.
 - Engages broader debates categorized under *Christ and Culture in Eschatological Perspective* - locating Christian ethics within eschatology rather than purely cultural adaptation or privatized morality.

- **Central thesis**
 - The resurrection of Jesus provides the ontological and juridical ground for a public **moral order**: Christian ethics must be articulated by the fact of Christ's vindication and lordship, which reorders social life, law, and vocation toward God's eschatological rule.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: modern moral reasoning (secular liberalism, moral voluntarism, or privatized piety) fractures the coherence of public moral order.
 - Grounding: the resurrection is not merely soteriological consolation but the decisive act that institutes a moral reality - it establishes Christ's authority and the future judgment that defines good and evil.
 - Normativity: moral norms derive authority from covenantal relationship under Christ, not from autonomous human reason or contingent social contract.
 - Application: this theological grounding yields distinctive prescriptions for church life, social institutions, law, and politics - i.e., how the **Church and Kingdom** relate and how Christians should comport themselves in public.
 - Resolution: ethics becomes a disciplined witness to the resurrected Lord that shapes public order by appeal to divine justice, vocation, and covenantal duties.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Deploys resources from Augustine and the medieval moral-legal tradition (natural law motifs), engages Barthian and Reformed emphases on Christ's lordship, and critiques modern political theory (liberalism and some forms of secular social ethics).
 - Dialogues with contemporaries in political theology and evangelical ethics; contrasts with both liberationist and secular humanist ethical schemes.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Resurrection**, **Eschatology**, **Christology**, **Covenant**, **Ecclesiology**, **Political Theology** (church/state), **Law and Judgment**, and implicates Natural Law themes without reducing ethical authority to autonomous reason.

- **Closing line**
 - Ethics must be reconceived as the public ordering of life in response to the resurrectional lordship of Christ - a covenantal, eschatologically anchored moral order that governs church, home, and polis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the resurrection as the constitutive ground of moral and social reality, not merely as personal salvation or future hope.
 - Marries juridical language (order, law, judgment) with eschatological theology to account for public norms.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects voluntarist or pietistic approaches that render ethics inward and privatized.
 - Challenges liberal secularism that detaches moral order from divine judgment; resists purely narrative or virtue-only ethics (e.g., Hauerwasian tendencies) by affirming objective moral authority grounded in Christ.
 - Differs from liberationism by emphasizing covenantal impartiality of judgment and the formative rather than merely emancipatory role of church witness.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes the phrase **"moral order"** as an eschatologically instituted social reality.
 - Emphasizes **vindication** and **judicial lordship** of Christ as ethical categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in evangelical and Reformed academic circles as a seminal modern formulation of Christian public ethics.
 - Influenced debates on church-state posture and evangelical engagement in politics; critiqued by pluralist and radical theologians for alleged juridicism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a rigorous bridge between doctrine and social ethics; indispensable for courses on political theology, church and state relations, and evangelical ethics grounded in creedal doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection** - the ontological event that vindicates Christ and establishes the basis for moral authority.
- **Moral Order** - the public, objective ordering of relationships and institutions grounded in Christ's lordship.
- **Eschatology** - not an optional future clause but the horizon that defines ethical norms and judgment.
- **Covenant** - relational framework for duties and social obligations; ethics as covenantal fidelity.
- **Kingdom of God** - both present lordship and future consummation organizing social vision; mediates relation of **Church and Kingdom**.
- **Law and Judgment** - juridical imagery used to describe how God's authority shapes norms and social accountability.
- **Vocation** - social callings (family, work, polity) seen as sites for ethical enactment under the resurrectional order.
- **Public Order / Common Good** - a theological account of societal goods anchored in Christ's reign, not merely secular consensus.
- **Natural Law (qualified)** - reappropriated as discernible ordering of creation interpreted through covenantal and eschatological lenses, not autonomous rationalism.
- **Church** - covenant community called to witness and embody the moral order; distinct from but witness-bearing to civil institutions.
- **State** - legitimate role in ordering life, but subordinate to divine judgment and the church's prophetic vocation.
- **Vindication** - emphasis on Christ's vindication as the decisive verdict that grounds moral truth claims.
- **Public Witness** - the church's activity of shaping social norms by testimony to the resurrection.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for evangelical ethics that root moral norms in Christ's resurrection.
 - As a **polemic** against secular moral autonomy, pietistic privatism, and some radical liberationist readings in political theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for thinking about **church-state relations** and the church's role in shaping public order under eschatological judgment.
