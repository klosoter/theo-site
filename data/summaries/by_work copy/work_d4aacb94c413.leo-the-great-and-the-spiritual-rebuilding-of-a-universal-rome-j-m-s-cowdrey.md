### TITLE
Leo the Great and the Spiritual Rebuilding of a Universal Rome - J. M. S. Cowdrey (study of Pope Leo I, "Leo the Great")

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-5th century Rome: collapse of Western imperial structures, barbarian incursions, ecclesial instability.
 - Theological milieu: post-Cyrillian debates, Eutychian monophysitism, lead-up to and aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon (451).
 - Cowdrey's modern study situates Leo's theology within his program of restoring Rome's moral, spiritual, and institutional authority.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Leo fused doctrinal clarity (notably the Chalcedonian articulation of two natures in Christ) with a program of "spiritual rebuilding" that reconstituted Rome as a unifying, universal ecclesial centre.
 - Doctrine serves ecclesial and pastoral ends: correct Christology is the means to ecclesial unity and pastoral resilience.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical reconstruction of Leo's papacy: pastoral initiatives, administrative reforms, and rhetorical strategies.
 - Theological analysis of Leo's major texts (sermons, letters, the Tome) showing how Christological definition undergirds claims to universal jurisdiction and pastoral governance.
 - Examination of reception: Chalcedon's acceptance of the Tome and subsequent tensions with Eastern monophysitism and Byzantine politics.
 - Conclusion: Leo's synthesis of theology and pastoral administration created a paradigm for a "universal Rome" sustained by doctrinal authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Pope Leo I (Leo the Great) - sermons, letters, the Tome to Flavian; acts of Chalcedon.
 - Interlocutors: Cyril of Alexandria, Dioscorus, Eutyches, Flavian of Constantinople, imperial actors (Marcian, Pulcheria).
 - Secondary: Cowdrey's interpretive apparatus emphasizing institutional and rhetorical dimensions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology: **Chalcedonian Definition**, hypostatic union, two natures in one person.
 - Ecclesiology: papal primacy, universal jurisdiction/auctoritas of Rome.
 - Pastoral theology: charity, liturgy, clerical discipline, social welfare as elements of spiritual rebuilding.
 - Canonical/legal rhetoric: use of juridical language to secure doctrinal and institutional outcomes.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Leo's articulation of the Chalcedonian two‑natures doctrine is deployed not merely as abstract theology but as the hinge by which Rome reclaims moral authority and ecclesial unity - theology shaped as pastoral and institutional reform.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats papal authority as both doctrinal guarantor and practical organizer of urban Christian life; theological definition and social reform are inseparable.
 - Framing Rome's universality in moral-spiritual, not merely imperial, terms.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond earlier pastoral pontiffs by integrating a systematic juridical rhetoric with theology; more assertive about universal jurisdiction than many contemporaries.
 - Positions Leo against monophysite reductionism: insists on full reality of both natures without division of the one person.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The Tome as a model of authoritative doctrinal communication: crisp, juridical, pastorally motivated.
 - Use of legal and administrative metaphors (auctoritas, jurisdiction, office) to ground theological claims.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate: Chalcedon credited Leo's Tome as decisive; strengthened Roman claims in West.
 - Long-term: major influence on medieval papalism and Western Christology; contested in Eastern, monophysite, and later Reformation contexts.
 - Cowdrey's study reframes Leo for modern scholars as an architect of ecclesial reconstruction, not only a doctrinalist.

- **Enduring value**
 - Shows how precise Christological definitions function within ecclesial polity and pastoral care.
 - Useful exemplar for studies linking doctrine, authority, and social ministry; a case study in doctrinal formation under crisis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tome of Leo**
 - Leo's letter to Flavian; authoritative exposition of Christ's two natures accepted at Chalcedon.
- **Chalcedonian Definition**
 - Conciliar formula endorsing "two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably" in one person; central doctrinal pivot in the study.
- **Two Natures / Hypostatic Union**
 - Technical Christological claim Leo defends and deploys as the ontological basis for salvation and ecclesial unity.
- **Monophysitism / Eutychianism**
 - Opposing position Leo counters; used by Cowdrey to show Leo's polemical and pastoral strategy.
- **Una persona (one person)**
 - Emphasizes personal unity of Christ; Leo guards against Nestorian separation while rejecting mixture.
- **Auctoritas / Primacy**
 - Roman office-language Leo uses to claim doctrinal and pastoral leadership for Rome.
- **Universal Rome**
 - Not merely geopolitical Rome but a moral-spiritual center for the Church; Leo's reconstruction target.
- **Pastoral rebuilding**
 - Combined program of charity, liturgy, clerical reform, and rhetorical consolidation to restore ecclesial life.
- **Conciliar reception**
 - Chalcedon as the institutional moment that canonically received Leo's Christology.
- **Juridical rhetoric**
 - Legal metaphors and administrative idiom used to secure doctrinal outcomes and governance.
- **Soteriological implications**
 - Leo links correct Christology to the reality of salvation (what Christ is determines what Christ accomplishes).
- **Ecclesial unity**
 - The goal toward which doctrinal precision and papal authority are oriented.
- **Liturgical and charitable praxis**
 - Concrete means of "rebuilding" Rome's spiritual and social fabric.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Chalcedonian two‑natures formulations and their pastoral import.
 - As a **polemic model** against monophysitism and for papal doctrinal authority.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** showing how theological definition informs liturgical, charitable, and administrative reform.
