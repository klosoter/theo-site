### TITLE
**Classical Theism, Classical Christian Theism, and the Importance of God's Simplicity** - James E. Dolezal (Themelios, 2019)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed milieu (Themelios journal, 2019). Dialogue occurs amid renewed interest in metaphysical theology within analytic and confessional Protestant circles and controversies over open theism, process thought, and pastoral resistance to classical metaphysics.
- **Central thesis**
 - **God's metaphysical simplicity is not an optional extra but central to classical Christian theism**: it secures aseity, unity of attributes, and the coherence of orthodox doctrines such as divine immutability, impassibility, and the personal unity of God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of classical theism as a package of metaphysical claims about God (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
 - Historical-theological defense: shows continuity from patristic and medieval theologies through Reformation articulations that substantiate the classical frame.
 - Philosophical-theological defense: argues that denying simplicity creates incoherence or theological loss (fragmentation of God, undermining aseity, problems for divine worship and providence).
 - Pastoral and exegetical considerations: reconciles classical claims with biblical language (anthropomorphisms, passions language) by distinguishing analogical speech and accommodations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on **patristic and medieval** resources (Augustine, Aquinas) and **Reformation** formulations (general Calvinist tradition).
 - Interacts with contemporary critics of classical metaphysics (briefly references modern philosophical and pastoral objections; analytic theologians and open-theism proponents by type rather than exhaustive engagement).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Simplicity, Aseity, Immutability, Impassibility** (primary).
 - Ancillary discussion: divine attributes, revelation and language about God, the Trinity insofar as simplicity bears on divine unity and persons.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: **Divine simplicity is indispensable to a coherent, worship-worthy Christian doctrine of God; to relinquish it is to risk diluting God's transcendence, unity, and divine-initiative in salvation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presents simplicity not as an abstruse metaphysical ornament but as the linchpin for multiple central doctrines (aseity, immutability, impassibility) and for pastoral concerns about God's reliability and holiness.
 - Emphasizes historical continuity: classical metaphysics as integral to orthodox biblical reading, not merely a philosophical import.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against modern tendencies to privatize or fragment divine attributes (e.g., treating attributes as separable properties or as merely relational roles).
 - Counters open theism and process-relational proposals by showing how non-simplicity undercuts God's metaphysical independence and unified agency.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Relates simplicity tightly to **aseity** (self-existence) and frames simplicity as metaphysical ground rather than an optional metaphysical hypothesis.
 - Reinforces the distinction between God's incomprehensibility in essence and the intelligibility of attributes as true but undivided.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received among advocates of classical theism within Reformed and confessional evangelicalism; used as a clear, accessible statement defending traditional metaphysical commitments.
 - Provoked critique from those prioritizing scriptural narratives of divine passibility and from some philosophical theologians skeptical of metaphysical simplicity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective in systematic theology courses and seminars where students encounter modern critiques of classical metaphysics; valuable as a concise defense linking doctrine, worship, and metaphysics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God is without composition; attributes are identical to divine essence rather than distinct parts.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; simplicity undergirds aseity by preventing dependence on constituents.
- **Immutability**
 - God does not undergo essential change; tied to simplicity because change presupposes compositionality.
- **Impassibility**
 - God does not undergo passive emotional alteration as creatures do; defended as consistent with biblical accommodation once simplicity is affirmed.
- **Divine Attributes**
 - Treated as unified manifestations of one simple divine essence (omniscience, omnipotence, goodness).
- **Anthropomorphic/Accommodative Language**
 - Scriptural talk of God's emotions/actions is regarded as analogical and accommodative, not literal pointers to metaphysical change.
- **Ontological Identity (of attributes)**
 - The claim that attributes are not ontologically distinct components but are identical with God's one being.
- **Classical Christian Theism**
 - The marriage of classical metaphysical claims (simplicity, impassibility, etc.) with specifically Christian convictions (Trinity, revelation).
- **Metaphysical Composition**
 - The contrast term: denying composition in God to avoid parts, potentiality, or dependence.
- **Theological Coherence**
 - Simplicity is presented as a coherence-maker for doctrines of providence, worship, and divine initiative.
- **Analogy of Being**
 - Used to explain how creatures participate in attributes without reducing God to creaturely categories.
- **Scriptural Hermeneutics**
 - Method: take biblical language seriously but interpreted through the theological grid that privileges simplicity for doctrinal coherence.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for course treatments of divine simplicity and allied attributes.
 - As a **polemic resource** against open theism/process theology and against theological tendencies that dilute divine transcendence.
 - As an **exegetical model** to read anthropomorphic texts analogically rather than literalistically.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology linking metaphysics to pastoral concerns about God's reliability and holiness.
