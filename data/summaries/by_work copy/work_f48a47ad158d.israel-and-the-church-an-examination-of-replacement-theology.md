### TITLE
Israel and the Church: An Examination of Replacement Theology - David L. Turner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical scholarship amid renewed debate over the relationship of Israel and the church. Responds to both classical covenantal/supersessionist readings (common in much Western theology) and to reactionary dispensationalist positions. Situated in post-Holocaust sensitivity to Jewish-Christian relations and in growing scholarly attention to Israel in Pauline studies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Turner examines whether the New Testament supports *replacement theology* (supersessionism) - the claim that the church has wholly replaced ethnic Israel as the covenant people - and argues for a theologically nuanced position that affirms continuity of God's one redemptive plan while resisting simplistic replacement.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of historical roots and varieties of replacement theology in patristic, medieval, and Reformation traditions.
 - Exegetical analysis of key New Testament texts often appealed to in the debate:
 - Paul (esp. Romans 9-11; Galatians 3)
 - Jesus' teachings (e.g., vineyard parables, Gospel pericopes on kingdom/fulfillment)
 - Hebrews and Revelation on covenantal fulfillment and prophetic destiny
 - Doctrinal synthesis weighing **covenant continuity** (God's promises persist) against **covenant discontinuity** (the church's unique identity and the New Covenant realities).
 - Assessment of theological and pastoral implications: ecclesiology, election, eschatology, and Jewish-Christian relations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classic supersessionist voices (broadly construed from patristic and post-Reformation theology), modern proponents of dispensationalism as foil, New Testament exegetical scholarship on Paul and Hebrews, and contemporary critics concerned with Jewish-Christian history.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant (Abrahamic, Mosaic, New), election, typology and fulfillment, Christology (fulfillment motif), ecclesiology (identity of the church), eschatology (restoration of Israel), revelation in Scripture.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Turner presses for a biblically faithful middle path: affirm God's covenant faithfulness to Israel and the unity of redemptive history while distinguishing the church's place in the economy of salvation - fulfillment without facile obliteration of Israel's ongoing theological status.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Careful canonical and Pauline exegesis deployed against both naïve supersessionism and simplistic replacement refutations.
 - Emphasis on **promise-perseverance**: divine promises to Israel remain integral to God's plan even when their present form is mediated through Christ and the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects classic supersessionism by insisting that NT texts (especially Romans 9-11) envisage a continued role for ethnic Israel (e.g., remnant, future repentance/restoration).
 - Contrasts with dispensationalism by refusing sharp ontological bifurcation of Israel and church; insists on theological continuity and unified covenantal story.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Advocates precise distinction between *fulfillment* (realization of promises in Christ) and *abolition* (nullifying prior promises) - arguing the NT favors the former.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted in evangelical circles as a measured critique of supersessionism; useful for those seeking a responsible middle position.
 - Cited in discussions on Jewish-Christian relations and in treatments of Pauline theology; has moderate scholarly influence rather than paradigm-shifting.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a balanced exegetical resource for teaching Romans 9-11 and for courses on covenant theology, ecclesiology, and Jewish-Christian dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Replacement Theology / Supersessionism:** The claim that the church has fully replaced Israel as God's covenant people; Turner evaluates and largely rejects simplistic forms.
- **Israel (ethnic vs. covenantal):** Distinguishes Israel as an ethnic people with covenant promises from the broader covenant people concept that includes Gentile believers.
- **Church (ekklesia):** The gathered people of God in Christ; related to but not simply identical with Israel.
- **Covenant(s):** Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New Covenant - Turner stresses continuity of divine promises while recognizing New Covenant fulfillment in Christ.
- **Election:** God's choosing of a people; used to analyze communal and individual dimensions in Paul and how they bear on Israel/church relations.
- **Fulfillment (telos):** The New Testament motif that Christ fulfills prior revelations without always annulling prior promises.
- **Typology:** Old Testament persons/events as types fulfilled in Christ; Turner uses typology to show continuity, not replacement.
- **Remnant:** Pauline and prophetic motif indicating a faithful subset of Israel that preserves covenant continuity.
- **Romans 9-11:** Central exegetical locus; Turner treats these chapters as decisive for a non-replacement, non-segregationist reading.
- **Continuity vs. Discontinuity:** A thematic pair used to chart how much of Israel's identity and promises persist in the church era.
- **Eschatological restoration:** Discussion of possible future restoration of Israel consistent with NT hope (esp. Romans 11).
- **Typological fulfillment vs. legal abrogation:** Turner's preferred distinction for interpreting fulfillment statements.
- **New Covenant identity:** How the church participates in promises inaugurated by Christ while not erasing ethnic Israel's place.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for moderate critiques of supersessionism in seminaries and church leaders.
 - As a **polemic** resource against both uncritical replacement theology and overstated dispensational separation.
 - As an **exegetical model** particularly for handling Romans 9-11 and for integrating Pauline theology into covenantal frameworks.
