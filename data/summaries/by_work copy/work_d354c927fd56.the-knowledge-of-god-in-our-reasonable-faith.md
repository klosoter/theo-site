### TITLE
**The Knowledge of God** (in Our Reasonable Faith) - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Dutch Neo-Calvinism; Bavinck condenses his Reformed Dogmatics (Magnalia Dei) against post-Kantian skepticism and liberal Protestantism.
 - Milieu: retrieval of classic Reformed orthodoxy in conversation with modern philosophy and science.

- **Central thesis**
 - **God is truly knowable yet incomprehensible**: our knowledge is real, covenantal, and analogical, grounded in **revelation**; **Scripture (externum) and the Spirit (internum)** are the principia of theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Knowability and incomprehensibility: God transcends creation but makes himself known; we know God by **analogy** as **ectypal** receivers of his **archetypal** self-knowledge.
 - **General revelation**: creation, providence, and conscience disclose God; a universal **sensus divinitatis** persists, yet **sin** suppresses and distorts it.
 - **Special revelation**: the historical-redemptive self-disclosure culminating in Christ, inscripturated by **organic inspiration**; the Spirit illumines the church to acknowledge Scripture.
 - **Principia and method**: God is the **principium essendi** of theology; **Scripture** the **principium cognoscendi externum**, the **Spirit** the **internum**; theistic proofs are **confirmatory testimonia**, not foundations.
 - **Covenantal and eschatological context**: knowledge of God is personal and ethical, flourishing within the covenant; now by faith, then by sight in eschatological fulfillment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Augustine, Calvin, Junius (archetypal/ectypal), Reformed orthodox, elements of Aquinas and Anselm.
 - Critically engaged: Kant, Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Hegel; Roman Catholic nature-grace schema; rationalism and empiricism; deism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general/special), **Scripture and inspiration**, **Gods knowability and attributes by names**, **image of God and religion**, **sin and noetic effects**, **faith and illumination**, **covenant and eschatology**.

- **Center of gravity**
 - The God who is infinitely beyond us freely binds himself to us in covenantal revelation, so that we truly know him in Christ through the Spirit by Scripture, unto the beatific vision.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Organic revelation/inspiration** and the **organism of truth**: unity-in-diversity across redemptive history and Scripture.
 - **Principial architecture** (essendi/cognoscendi; externum/internum) holding together objectivity and spirituality of knowledge.
 - **Covenantal, personal knowledge** over mere abstraction; religion as life coram Deo.
 - **Both/and** instincts: transcendence/immanence, general/special revelation, catholicity/particularity.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against **Kantian agnosticism** and **liberal subjectivism**: revelation yields objective truth.
 - Against **rationalism/deism**: God is not a postulate but the living covenant Lord.
 - Against a strong **analogia entis**: insists on **analogical** yet revelational predication anchored in God's self-communication.
 - Against **pure evidentialism**: theistic proofs function as **confirmations**, not autonomous foundations.

- **Conceptual contributions**
 - Retrieval and sharpening of **archetypal/ectypal** distinction; **accommodation** without skepticism.
 - Clarifies **noetic effects of sin** with room for **common grace**.
 - Eschatological orientation: **faith to sight** frames theological epistemology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard reference in Reformed dogmatics; formative for Neo-Calvinist and presuppositional currents (while distinct from Van Til).
 - Widely used for integrating **Bibliology**, **Covenant**, and **Theology Proper** in a single methodological vision.

- **Enduring value**
 - Catechetical clarity with academic rigor; bridges historical orthodoxy and modern concerns; provides a stable scaffold for exegesis, doctrine, and piety.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Knowability and incomprehensibility**: God can be truly known yet never comprehended or circumscribed.
- **Archetypal vs. ectypal knowledge**: God's self-knowledge vs. our creaturely, accommodated participation in it.
- **Analogical knowledge**: true predication without univocity or equivocity; grounded in revelation.
- **General revelation**: God's disclosure in creation, providence, and conscience; real yet suppressed by sin.
- **Sensus divinitatis / semen religionis**: innate awareness of God present in all humans.
- **Special revelation**: redemptive-historical self-disclosure culminating in Christ; normed by Scripture.
- **Organic inspiration / revelation**: God superintends authors and history as an organism, not a mechanical dictation.
- **Principium essendi**: God as the ontological ground of theology.
- **Principium cognoscendi**
 - **Externum**: Holy Scripture as the external cognitive principle.
 - **Internum**: The Holy Spirit's internal testimony enabling reception.
- **Noetic effects of sin**: sin's darkening of understanding; explains error and idolatry.
- **Common grace**: preserves and restrains, allowing true though partial insights outside the church.
- **Covenantal knowledge**: relational, obedient knowing within God's covenant.
- **Theistic proofs as testimonia**: signs that corroborate revelation rather than compel belief.
- **Accommodation**: God speaks anthropomorphically and historically for our capacity.
- **Eschatological consummation**: present knowledge by faith perfected in the vision of God.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **methodological and definitional source** for revelation, Scripture, and theological epistemology.
 - As a **polemic framework** against agnosticism, liberalism, and overreaching natural theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology, sin's noetic effects, and eschatological fulfillment.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Ps 19, Rom 1, Heb 1 within an organic-revelatory paradigm.
