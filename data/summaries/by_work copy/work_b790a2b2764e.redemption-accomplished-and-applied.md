### TITLE
**Redemption Accomplished and Applied** (1955), John Murray 
A classic Westminster Reformed account of the work of Christ and the Spirit, pairing the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption with its ordered application to the elect.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post-WWII Reformed resurgence at Westminster Theological Seminary; confessional Presbyterian retrieval amid liberal Protestantism and rising neo-orthodoxy.
 - Engages biblical-theological exegesis and classic Reformed dogmatics; responds to moral-influence, governmental, and universalist atonement theologies.
- **Central thesis**
 - Redemption is objectively accomplished by Christ in history and effectually applied by the Holy Spirit to those united to Christ; the atonement is definite, priestly, and perfect, and salvation benefits flow in an ordered, Spirit-wrought sequence grounded in union with Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: **Accomplished**
 - Necessity: atonement required by divine justice and holiness.
 - Nature: substitutionary, sacrificial, priestly work culminating in the cross and resurrection; includes Christ's active and passive obedience.
 - Perfection: sufficiency and finality of Christ's once-for-all offering; unity of oblation and intercession.
 - Extent: **definite atonement** - Christ died to secure, not merely make possible, the salvation of the elect.
 - Part 2: **Applied**
 - Union with Christ as the comprehensive bond in which all benefits are given.
 - Ordo salutis (logical order): effectual calling -> regeneration -> faith and repentance -> justification -> adoption -> sanctification (definitive and progressive) -> perseverance -> glorification.
 - Emphasis on the Spirit's efficacious agency; faith as instrument of justification; repentance inseparable from faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Scripture (Romans 3-8; John 10, 17; Hebrews 2, 7-10), Calvin, Owen, Turretin, Reformed confessions.
 - Critically: Abelard (moral influence), Grotius (governmental), Amyraldians, Arminians, universalists; C. H. Dodd on expiation vs propitiation; aspects of Barthian universalizing tendencies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology:** exegetical method; lexical and canonical argumentation.
 - **Christology:** person and priestly office; active/passive obedience; atonement terms.
 - **Trinity:** harmony of Father's election, Son's redemption, Spirit's application.
 - **Covenant theology:** federal headship; representation; unity of the covenant of grace.
 - **Soteriology:** ordo salutis; union with Christ; justification by imputed righteousness; sanctification; perseverance.
 - **Pneumatology:** effectual calling, regeneration, sanctification.
 - **Eschatology:** glorification; consummation of redemption.
- **Closing line**
 - The book's center of gravity: the triune God effectually brings his elect into saving union with Christ through a perfect, priestly, substitutionary atonement, applied by the Spirit in a coherent order to the glory of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp distinction yet organic unity between redemption accomplished and redemption applied.
 - Strong defense of **propitiation** and **definite atonement**; stress on the unity of sacrifice and intercession in Christ's priesthood.
 - Union with Christ as the matrix of all benefits; faith and repentance as inseparable graces.
 - Early articulation of **definitive sanctification** alongside progressive growth.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Rejects merely governmental or moral-influence atonement; opposes hypothetical universalism and general redemption.
 - Clarifies that justification is purely forensic, not transformative; distinguishes adoption as a discrete benefit.
 - Guards ordo salutis as logical, not necessarily temporal, maintaining personal, Christological focus.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the paired schema: accomplished vs applied.
 - Presses for translating hilasterion and cognates as **propitiation**, against reduction to expiation.
 - Prefers **definite atonement** over limited atonement to stress design and efficacy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Seminary-standard in Reformed circles; catechetical and pastoral use due to clarity and brevity.
 - Main foil for 4-point Calvinists, universalists, and some Barthians; resource in debates on justification and imputation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of exegetically grounded dogmatics; coherent triune soteriology; pedagogically crisp account of the ordo salutis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement**: Christ's substitutionary, sacrificial work satisfying divine justice to reconcile sinners to God.
- **Propitiation**: Godward appeasement of wrath by Christ's blood; contrasted with mere expiation.
 - Against C. H. Dodd's expiation-only view; retains personal and judicial dimensions.
- **Redemption**: Liberation by payment of a price; objective accomplishment in history.
- **Reconciliation**: Change of relation from enmity to peace; effect of the cross.
- **Definite atonement**: Intent, design, and achievement limited to the elect; ensures application.
- **Active and passive obedience**: Christ's lifelong law-keeping and penal suffering imputed to believers.
- **Union with Christ**: The encompassing bond in which all benefits are applied.
- **Effectual calling**: The Spirit's efficacious summons producing response; distinguishes external/internal call.
- **Regeneration**: Monergistic new birth; logically prior to faith's exercise.
- **Faith and repentance**: Twin graces; faith alone as instrument of justification; repentance inseparable.
- **Justification**: Forensic declaration on the basis of Christ's righteousness imputed; not by works.
- **Adoption**: Distinct legal-relational benefit conferring sonship and inheritance.
- **Sanctification**: Definitive break with sin's dominion and progressive renewal by the Spirit.
- **Perseverance**: God's preservation of the saints unto final salvation.
- **Glorification**: Eschatological completion at Christ's return; bodily resurrection.
- **Priesthood of Christ**: Unity of oblation and intercession securing the elect's salvation.
- **Federal headship**: Representational structure in Adam and Christ; undergirds atonement and imputation.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definition-source and conceptual map for atonement terms and the ordo salutis across loci.
 - As a polemical standard against universal atonement, moral-influence, and anti-forensic trends.
 - As an exegetical model in Romans 3-8, John 10, 17, Hebrews 7-10 for Christology and soteriology.
 - As a conceptual pivot integrating Trinity, covenant, and union with Christ in systematic teaching.
