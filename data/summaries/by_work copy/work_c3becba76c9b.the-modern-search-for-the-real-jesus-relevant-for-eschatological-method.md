### TITLE
The Modern Search for the Real Jesus - Robert B. Strimple

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century Reformed response to the "modern quest" for the historical Jesus: rise of historical-critical scholarship, demythologizing programs (e.g., Bultmann), and renewed interest in Jesus' eschatological claims.
 - Situated within conservative Reformed academic circles seeking to defend a canonical, Christocentric reading of Scripture against both liberal critical and popular literalist impulses.

- **Central thesis**
 - The modern quest often misconstrues Jesus by excluding the canonical-apocalyptic and covenantal frameworks in which his words and works belong; a proper eschatological method recovers a Christ-centered, inaugurated-but-not-yet eschatology that reframes Revelation 20 and millennium debates.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of modern critical approaches: shows how historical-critical and demythologizing methods strip Jesus of his covenantal and apocalyptic vocation.
 - Recovery of a theological-hermeneutic: argues for a canonical-covenantal method that reads Gospels and Apocalypse together, privileging Christological and redemptive-historical categories.
 - Exegetical application to Revelation 20: reads the "thousand years," the binding of Satan, the "first resurrection," and final judgment within an inaugurated eschatology rather than purely futurist or strictly literal frameworks.
 - Doctrinal and pastoral consequences: defends a Reformed eschatology that resists dispensational literalism while avoiding reductionist spiritualization.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with figures representing the modern quest (e.g., Bultmann, Schweitzer, Dodd) and with representatives of millennial positions (classical premillennialists, dispensationalists, amillennialists, postmillennialists).
 - Draws on Reformed resources (covenant theology, redemptive-historical exegesis) to counter both liberal and popular readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and apocalyptic literature; Christology; eschatology (inauguration, consummation); covenant theology; Scripture and hermeneutics; resurrection and final judgment.

- **Closing line**
 - Advocates a covenantal, Christ-centered eschatological method that reads Revelation 20 as canonical apocalyptic: symbolic of Christ's present reign and the inaugurated-but-not-yet character of the consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on reading apocalyptic through redemptive-historical and covenantal lenses rather than isolating it as an autonomous chronological roadmap.
 - Balances respect for apocalyptic symbolism with rigorous exegesis-neither wholesale allegorizing nor naive literalism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal demythologizing that evacuates Jesus' eschatological claims of prophetic and soteriological force.
 - Counters dispensational literalism and futurist-only readings of Revelation 20 by integrating present reality (Christ's reign, binding of Satan) with future consummation.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Promotes an "eschatological-covenantal hermeneutic" (phrase used descriptively) that treats millennium motifs as expressions of inaugurated eschatology within covenant history.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries and conservative evangelical circles as a corrective to dispensational and liberal extremes.
 - Less influential in broader academic biblical studies where critical-historical and literary approaches dominate, but used as a pastoral and doctrinal resource.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for marrying systematic theology and careful exegesis on millennial questions; useful for teaching Revelation 20 within a covenantal framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Modern Quest for the Historical Jesus**
 - The movement to reconstruct Jesus apart from confessional claims; Strimple diagnoses its methodological limits for eschatology.

- **Historical-Critical Method**
 - Critical tools that often abstract Jesus from covenantal context; critiqued for producing truncated eschatologies.

- **Demythologization**
 - Bultmannian program to remove "myth" from faith; Strimple argues it undercuts New Testament eschatological truth.

- **Canonical-Covenantal Hermeneutic**
 - Reading Scripture as unified redemptive history under covenant promises; core methodological recommendation.

- **Inaugurated Eschatology**
 - "Already/not-yet" model: Christ's kingdom is present in seed form and awaits consummation; central to his reading of Revelation 20.

- **Revelation 20 (the Millennium)**
 - Interpreted as largely symbolic of Christ's present victory and binding of Satan, the reality of the "first resurrection" as spiritual or representative, with ultimate literal consummation retained.

- **Binding of Satan**
 - Viewed as the present curtailment of Satan's power enabling gospel witness, not the total eradication until the end.

- **First Resurrection**
 - Read typologically/inaugurally (spiritual life of the redeemed, victory in Christ) while preserving hope in bodily resurrection at the end.

- **Millennial Views (amillennial, premillennial, postmillennial)**
 - Strimple positions himself against both naïve literal dispensational premillennialism and reductive spiritualization; favors an amillennial/inaugurated framework but interacts respectfully with other views.

- **Apocalyptic Symbolism**
 - Treated as theological imagery analogous to covenantal motifs-requires canonical correlation, not free allegory.

- **Christocentric Exegesis**
 - Prioritizes Christ as the interpretive key for apocalyptic visions.

- **Scripture Authority**
 - Upholds the unity and divine authority of Scripture against fragmenting critical reconstructions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for a covenantal, inaugurated eschatology that informs reading of Revelation 20.
- As a **polemic resource** against dispensational futurism and demythologizing trends.
- As an **exegetical model** in seminary courses for integrating Revelation 20 with Gospel theology and redemptive-history.
