### TITLE
The Missional Church: Ecclesiological Implications of the Cultural Mandate - Michael W. Goheen (various articles)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed missional renewal. Situated within renewed interest in missiology, the missio Dei, and debates over sacred/secular bifurcation in North American and European Reformed circles. Dialogues with Newbigin, Wright, and Kuyperian heritage shape the conversation.
- **Central thesis:** The church's identity and practice must be derived from the biblical **cultural (creation) mandate** (Gen 1-2) read into continuity with the Great Commission; the church exists as a *sent people* to carry out God's creational mandate redeemed in Christ - not merely as an assembly for worship or private piety.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes biblical warrant: Genesis 1-2 as God's vocation for humanity (vocation + dominion) and Matthew 28 as its redemptive reorientation.
 - Argues for continuity: the cultural mandate is not abolished by the fall but redirected by redemption; mission includes cultural stewardship, human flourishing, and witness.
 - Reframes ecclesiology: church is defined by *sentness* (missio Dei) - its structures, worship, and sacraments are instruments of mission rather than ends in themselves.
 - Applies to praxis: vocation (work, arts, polity, science) is churchly participation in God's renewing work; critiques privatized faith and dualistic sacred/secular categories.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary Scripture: Genesis, the Gospels (esp. Matthew 28), Pauline and Johannine mission motifs.
 - Reformed sources: Calvin, Abraham Kuyper (lineage of cultural engagement), covenant theologians.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Lesslie Newbigin, Christopher J. H. Wright, general missiological corpus on missio Dei and contextualization.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (central), mission theology (missio Dei), creation (cultural mandate), covenant theology, Trinitarian sending (implicit/explicit), eschatology (kingdom as telos), anthropology (vocation), practical theology (church practice).
- **Closing line:** Goheen presses a theologically integrated vision: the church is inherently missional - a sent, vocational community embodying God's creational mandate now redirected and restored in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Reclaims the **cultural mandate** as foundational to ecclesial identity rather than peripheral social ethic.
 - Frames vocation as central to congregational life: ordinary work is churchly participation in God's mission.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Pushes back against two errors: (1) mission reduced to individualized evangelism, and (2) cultural engagement that neglects sin and redemption.
 - Corrects pietistic/privatizing tendencies by rooting public life in covenantal, creational responsibility.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Stresses the ontological priority of **sentness** - the church's being is defined by sending (missio Dei) as much as by worship or doctrine.
 - Reframes "dominion" language toward stewardship and flourishing rather than domination or triumphalism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and evangelical seminaries promoting missional ecclesiology and vocation studies.
 - Adopted by pastors and denominations seeking an integrated gospel that engages culture without capitulating to secular frameworks.
 - Critiques arise from those insisting on sharper distinctions between cultural mandate and Great Commission or fearing over-optimistic cultural transformation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies linkage between creation, redemption, and mission; supplies a robust hermeneutic for vocation-based discipleship and public theology.
 - Serves as a praxis-oriented bridge: theological grounding for church renewal, social engagement, and Christian vocation formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missio Dei:** God's sending activity that defines the church's identity; mission originates in the triune God and commissions the church as instrument and sign.
- **Cultural (Creation) Mandate:** Genesis 1-2 charge to steward creation; read as constitutive for human vocation and reoriented by Christ.
- **Vocation:** Daily callings (work, family, civic life) as arenas of ecclesial participation in God's renewing rule.
 - Contrasts with vocation as merely private career or secular activity.
- **Dominion:** Reinterpreted as responsible stewardship and cultivation, not exploitative control.
- **Sentness / Sent Community:** Terminology highlighting the church's ontological status as sent; ecclesiology centered on outgoing mission.
- **Mission vs. Evangelism:** Mission is broad (cultural, social, witness); evangelism is an essential but not exclusive dimension.
- **Missional Ecclesiology:** Ecclesiological model that derives church structures and practices from its missionary calling.
- **Creation-Fall-Redemption-Restoration schema:** Framework used to show continuity of cultural mandate and telos in Christ.
- **Kingdom of God:** Eschatological horizon shaping mission; mission participates in inaugurating kingdom life across cultures.
- **Covenant:** Provides theological cohesion for communal vocation and continuity between Old and New Testament mission.
- **Trinitarian Sending:** Theological grounding for mission; sending flows from Father, Son, Spirit.
- **Contextualization / Incarnation:** Mission requires culturally intelligible witness and incarnational presence.
- **Stewardship / Human Flourishing:** Outcomes of faithful dominion and missional engagement.
- **Common Grace (implicit):** Grounds civil order and cultural goods as arenas for Christian participation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for missional ecclesiology and vocational theology in Reformed curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against privatized faith and the sacred/secular split, shaping church practice and public theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Genesis and the Great Commission to justify cultural engagement as redemptive stewardship.
