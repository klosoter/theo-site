### TITLE
The Crucifixion: Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ - Fleming Rutledge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2015 by Eerdmans; written by Fleming Rutledge, an Episcopal/Anglican priest and preacher with roots in evangelicalism and classical liturgical practice.
 - Engages late 20th-early 21st century theological debates: postliberal and historical-critical readings that demythologize the cross, nonviolent atonement proposals, and renewed interest in Christus Victor and patristic readings.
 - Aimed at pastors, preachers, and theological students seeking an exegetical-theological account grounded in church life.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The crucifixion is the decisive, theologically indispensable revelation of who God is - simultaneously the disclosure of divine love and divine judgment - and must be understood as both historically real and theologically revelatory against modern attempts to domesticate, soften, or secularize the cross.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Scriptural and theological framing - the cross as the climactic act in salvation history; attention to biblical motifs of sacrifice, wrath, and suffering.
 - Part II: Detailed exegesis - passion narratives, Old Testament backgrounds (suffering servant, sacrificial imagery), Pauline and Johannine interpretations; close reading of the cry of dereliction and other marks of abandonment.
 - Part III: Theological synthesis and pastoral/liturgical implications - the cross and the Trinity, the meaning of atonement language (propitiation/expiation/substitution), pastoral care for suffering, preaching the cross in worship.
 - Major moves: affirm the historicity and scandal of the crucifixion; retrieve classical atonement language while resisting reductive caricatures; show how the cross discloses both wrath and love; apply to preaching, liturgy, and social ethics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical witnesses (Gospels, Paul, Isaiah, Psalms), patristic and medieval theologians, Reformers (especially Calvinian motifs), and contemporary theologians (critical engagement with N. T. Wright, Gustav Aulén, and various liberal and nonviolent atonement proponents).
 - Frequent allusions to liturgical texts, hymns, poets, and artistic representations to illumine theological claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (incarnation, two natures, the person and work of the Son)
 - **Atonement** (penal substitution, Christus Victor, propitiation/expiation)
 - **Trinity** (the Son's suffering in relation to the triune life)
 - **Hamartiology** (sin, divine wrath)
 - **Soteriology and eschatology** (reconciliation, defeat of evil)
 - **Pastoral theology and liturgy** (preaching, worship, care for sufferers)

- **Closing line**
 - The crucifixion, for Rutledge, is the nonnegotiable center of Christian truth: the cross is where God's holiness and love meet in decisive judgment and redemptive self-giving.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on the coexistence of **divine wrath and divine love** in the cross; neither may be excised without theological incoherence.
 - Strong liturgical and pastoral immediacy - theology is practiced in preaching and worship, not merely abstracted.
 - Vivid attention to the **language of dereliction** (Jesus "forsaken") as theological index of theodicy and solidarity.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against theological trends that neutralize the cross (e.g., moral influence-only models, some nonviolent atonement proposals).
 - Nuances rather than abandons **penal substitution**: defends it against caricature while integrating Christus Victor and sacrificial imagery.
 - Critiques overly rationalistic attempts to make the cross palatable to modern sensibilities by demythologizing or domestication.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the cross as a **dialectical revelation**: simultaneous disclosure of God's judgment and mercy (less an innovation than a clarifying retrieval).
 - Uses liturgical/poetic resources to reframe doctrinal categories for preaching contexts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely praised across evangelical, Anglican, and Reformed circles for theological clarity and pastoral usefulness.
 - Criticized by some liberal and certain contextual theologians for reaffirming penal language and for perceived emphasis on divine wrath.
 - Has become a go-to resource in seminaries and preaching courses for integrating biblical exegesis with homiletic application.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of how to do theological exegesis that is simultaneously pastoral and ecclesial.
 - Resource for reclaiming the cross as doctrinally central without lapsing into sentimentality or abstraction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Crucifixion** - central historical event and theological locus; both enacted judgment and revealing love.
- **Atonement** - multifaceted: penal, sacrificial, victorious; Rutledge resists reduction to a single model.
- **Penal substitution** - affirmed in substantive terms but carefully qualified against moralistic or legalistic caricatures.
- **Christus Victor** - recovered as complementary: cross defeats cosmic powers, not an alternative to substitutionary language.
- **Divine wrath** - real and theologically necessary to account for holiness and judgment; not incompatible with love.
- **Propitiation / Expiation** - discussed exegetically; propitiation as appeasing divine wrath, expiation as cleansing sin - both brought into conversation.
- **Dereliction** - the cry of abandonment (e.g., "My God, my God") treated as theological center for suffering and identification.
- **Solidarity** - Jesus' participation in human suffering; the cross shows God's identifying with the forsaken.
- **Trinity** - cross is addressed theologically within Trinitarian relations: the Son's suffering is not a rupture in God but an intra-Trinitarian self-giving.
- **Sacrifice** - biblical sacrificial idioms used to explain substitution and covenantal restoration.
- **Holiness** - divine holiness as ground for divine wrath and for the necessity of atonement.
- **Redemption / Reconciliation** - outcomes of the cross: restoration of creation, defeat of evil, reconciliation of sinners.
- **Preaching / Liturgy** - Rutledge models how doctrinal claims about the cross are to be embodied and preached in worship contexts.
- **Witness / Exegesis** - close reading of passion texts as primary warrant for doctrinal claims.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional source for reclaiming the cross in preaching and pastoral formation.
 - As a polemical resource against nonviolent-only or demythologizing accounts of atonement.
 - As an exegetical model for integrating Passion narrative study with systematic theology and liturgical practice.
