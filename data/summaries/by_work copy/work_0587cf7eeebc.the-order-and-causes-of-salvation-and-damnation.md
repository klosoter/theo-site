### TITLE
**The Order and Causes of Salvation and Damnation** 
Author: **William Perkins**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 16th / early 17th century English Puritan-Reformed milieu; part of the popular Puritan theological corpus used in preaching and pastoral care. Perkins writes within Reformed scholastic method, oriented to pastoral application and Scripture-centred exegesis (notably Romans).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to explain the ordered divine decrees that produce both salvation (election) and damnation (reprobation), showing how God's absolute sovereignty coheres with human culpability and the ordinary means of grace.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of the eternal decree: God from eternity ordains the end (glory of his name) and the means (creation, fall, redemption) such that some are elected and some passed over.
 - Causal analysis: distinguishes God as the first efficient cause (author of the decree) from secondary causes (human wills, sin, means of grace) while denying that God is culpable for sin as its immediate cause.
 - Mechanics of application: how effectual calling, faith, justification, and sanctification follow in the ordered chain (Perkins uses the "golden chain" motif from Romans 8).
 - Pastoral outcomes: marks of election, assurance for the believer, warnings for the reprobate, and the role of preaching and sacraments as means.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Romans central), Augustine and Calvin as primary authorities; engages broadly with late medieval scholastic categories and the Reformed pastoral tradition; polemically counters Pelagian tendencies and anticipates debates later taken up by Arminians.
- **Doctrines treated:** divine decree, election, reprobation, providence, original and actual sin, grace (effectual calling), justification, perseverance, assurance, means of grace (preaching, sacraments), and moral responsibility.
- **Closing line:** Perkins situates predestination as an ordered, pastoral doctrine: God sovereignly ordains both salvation and damnation for his own glory while employing secondary causes and ordinary means so that human guilt and the preacher's ministry remain decisive in experience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on an *ordered* chain of divine causality linking decree to effectual calling and final glorification (the "golden chain" concretized for pastoral use).
 - Clear distinction between God's decretive causation and human voluntary agency-God ordains ends and permits means without being the proximate moral cause of sin.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - More pastoral and practical in tone than abstract scholasticism; resists speculative preoccupation with the metaphysical order of decrees at the expense of assurance and preaching.
 - Opposes Pelagian/ semi-Pelagian accounts that make human will decisive for salvation; anticipates arguments later used against Arminianism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of causal categories (efficient, permissive causes; decretive vs. preceptive will) in a popular theological handbook.
 - Operationalization of Romans 8 imagery into a diagnostic tool for assurance and exhortation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential among English Puritans and New England divines; formed part of the background to later Reformed orthodoxy in England and America.
 - Cited by subsequent Reformed pastors and theologians as a model of combining high doctrine with pastoral praxis.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models how to handle difficult doctrines (election/reprobation) with exegetical care and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Remains a primary historical source for Reformed treatments of predestination and for understanding Puritan pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination / Decree:** God's eternal ordinance determining ends and means; foundational causal principle in the work.
- **Election:** God's choosing of some to salvation, grounded in divine will and fulfilled through effectual calling and grace.
- **Reprobation:** God's passing over some to just condemnation; treated as decretive and compatible with human guilt.
- **Efficient cause (divine):** God as the first cause who ordains and executes the plan of salvation.
- **Permissive/secondary causes:** human wills, sin, means of grace as real causes within God's ordained order; used to protect human responsibility.
- **Effectual calling:** the Spirit's application of Christ's redemption to the elect, producing faith and conversion.
- **Assurance / marks of election:** faith, sanctification, perseverance, and sacramental/word evidences used pastorally to confirm a believer's status.
- **Golden Chain (Romans 8 motif):** employed as structural metaphor linking decree to glorification in stepwise causality.
- **Divine justice:** used to account morally for reprobation-God's verdict is just though inscrutable.
- **Means of grace:** preaching, sacraments, and prayer as ordinary instruments God uses within the ordered decree.
- **Compatibilist responsibility:** insistence that divine determinative causation and human culpability are both true and non-contradictory.
- **Exegesis of Romans:** scriptural anchor and exegetical model for the whole treatise.
- **Pastoral application:** doctrine folded into preaching, assurance, and church discipline.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for classical Reformed formulations of election and reprobation.
 - As a polemical resource against Pelagian/Arminian-style accounts of human initiative in salvation.
 - As an exegetical-pastoral model for reading Romans and applying predestination to preaching and assurance.
