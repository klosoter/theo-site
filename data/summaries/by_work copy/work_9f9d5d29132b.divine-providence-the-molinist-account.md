### TITLE
**Divine Providence: The Molinist Account - Thomas P. Flint**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Located within late 20th-early 21st century analytic theology and philosophy of religion; engages revived interest in Luis de Molina's seventeenth-century Jesuit solution to providence and freedom.
 - Aimed at both Catholic theological concerns (grace, predestination) and wider debates with Reformed compatibilists and contemporary libertarian theists (including Open Theism).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Molinism, as developed by Flint, offers a coherent account of divine providence that preserves **God's exhaustive foreknowledge and sovereign governance** while maintaining genuine **libertarian creaturely freedom**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of the **scientia media (middle knowledge)**: God knows what free creatures would do in any possible circumstance (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, CCFs).
 - Analysis of how God **chooses to actualize** one feasible world from among many on the basis of middle knowledge - thus securing providential outcomes without causal determinism of human choices.
 - Treatment of **divine will distinctions** (decretive vs. permissive; antecedent vs. consequent) and their relation to election, grace, and merit.
 - Responses to standard objections:
 - **Grounding objection**: whether CCFs have truth-makers independent of divine knowledge.
 - **Divine sovereignty objection**: whether Molinism weakens divine sovereignty or makes God dependent on creaturely freedom.
 - **Theodicy and providence**: Molinist resources for explaining divine permitting of evil.
 - Application to soteriological doctrines: foreknowledge and predestination, prevenient grace, and compatibilities with traditional Catholic formulations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary antecedent: **Luis de Molina** and the Jesuit tradition.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: **Alvin Plantinga**, **William Lane Craig**, **Peter van Inwagen**, Thomist and Reformed compatibilist writers, and proponents of **Open Theism**.
 - Scriptural engagement: biblical passages on foreknowledge, election, providence (e.g., Romans, Ephesians, Acts) treated as probabilistic exegetical data within the philosophical framework.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, foreknowledge, predestination, human freedom (libertarian), grace, divine omniscience, divine sovereignty, the problem of evil (permitting vs. causing).
- **Closing line**
 - Flint frames Molinism as a philosophically robust and theologically fertile middle path: it secures divine providence and salvific purposes while upholding authentic libertarian freedom and avoiding both determinism and the levelling of divine knowledge.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful technical defense of middle knowledge as explanatorily central rather than ancillary; attention to **how God uses CCFs in decision-making** about which world to actualize.
 - Integration of analytic modal semantics with classical theological categories (decree, will, providence).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Differentiates from classical Thomist determinism by denying that God's decree causally annihilates creaturely libertarian choice.
 - Counters Open Theism by retaining exhaustive divine foreknowledge while rejecting God as reactive or temporally limited.
 - Challenges simple compatibilist accounts by insisting that moral responsibility requires libertarian alternatives.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines the taxonomy of divine knowledge (natural, middle, free) and clarifies operational roles for each in providential planning.
 - Sharp articulation of the **actualization move**: not merely knowing counterfactuals but selecting a world on that basis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary debates on providence and foreknowledge; influential among Catholic and evangelical philosophers and theologians sympathetic to libertarian freedom.
 - Has become a standard reference against both deterministic predestinarian readings and Open Theist proposals.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a rigorous model that translates historical Molinism into contemporary analytic idiom; serves both as pedagogical exposition and a springboard for objections and refinements.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)** - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any possible circumstance (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom).
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)** - Propositions of the form "If S were in circumstance C, S would freely do A"; central truth-bearers in Molinist epistemology.
- **Actualization** - God's act of choosing which feasible possible world (given CCFs) to bring into existence.
- **Feasible/possible world** - Worlds compatible with divine nature and natural laws; the candidates among which God selects.
- **Decretive will vs. antecedent will** - Distinction between God's efficacious commands/ decrees and his antecedent desires or permissive will.
- **Libertarian free will** - The view that free actions are not determined by prior sufficient causes; morally significant alternatives are genuine.
- **Divine providence** - The governance of God that secures intended ends without necessitating deterministic causation of free acts.
- **Foreknowledge vs. predetermination** - Molinist separation of knowing what will happen from causing it; foreknowledge grounded in middle knowledge.
- **Grounding objection** - Challenge concerning the metaphysical basis (truth-makers) for counterfactuals.
- **Sovereignty worry** - Objection that Molinism makes God's choices depend on creaturely facts rather than divine will.
- **Permitting vs. causation of evil** - Molinist resources emphasize permission based on better global outcomes rather than direct causation by God.
- **Prevenient grace (in Catholic reception)** - Grace that enables free response; Molinism often used to model its compatibility with libertarian freedom.
- **Possible uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for middle knowledge in systematic theology and philosophy of religion.
 - As a **polemic weapon** against determinist/predestinarian and Open Theist positions.
 - As an **exegetical-conceptual model** for interpreting biblical texts on foreknowledge, providence, and election.
 - As a **teaching pivot** in graduate seminars on freedom, providence, and theodicy.
