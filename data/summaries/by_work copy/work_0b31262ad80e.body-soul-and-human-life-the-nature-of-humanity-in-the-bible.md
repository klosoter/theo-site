### TITLE
**Body, Soul, and Human Life: The Nature of Humanity in the Bible** - Joel B. Green

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century (2008). Engages contemporary debates in theological anthropology, biblical studies, and philosophy of mind amid rising interest in embodied theology and critiques of Cartesian dualism.
 - Moves between careful biblical exegesis, historical-theological survey, and critical engagement with modern philosophical positions (dualism, reductive materialism, emergentism).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible presents human beings as psychosomatic unities rather than composites of an immaterial soul and separate body; theological anthropology should affirm embodied personhood with resurrection as the eschatological fulfillment and vindication of that unity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of biblical language and thought (Hebrew and Greek) on terms like nephesh, ruah, psyche, and soma to show these primarily function as ways of speaking about whole, embodied persons, not separable substances.
 - Historical-theological reception: traces how Greek philosophy (Platonism) and later Christian interpretations (Patristic, medieval, Reformation) shaped a subject/object dualism foreign to much biblical usage.
 - Philosophical engagement: critiques modern Cartesian dualism and reductive physicalism and proposes a non-reductive, embodied model that preserves personal continuity and moral/relational dimensions.
 - Theological synthesis: situates incarnation and bodily resurrection as decisive for understanding human life - salvation concerns embodied persons, and eschatology restores the whole person.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical texts (Genesis, Psalms, Wisdom literature, Job, Prophets, Gospel & Pauline corpora) treated exegetically.
 - Historical interlocutors include Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin.
 - Contemporary conversation with philosophers of mind and theologians disputing dualistic and physicalist accounts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (nature of human personhood), creation, sin and death, incarnation, atonement implications, resurrection and eschatology, and practical ethical consequences for pastoral care and bioethics.

- **Closing line**
 - **Green's theological center of gravity: the Bible depicts human beings as embodied, psychosomatic persons whose redemption and destiny are bodily - thus theology must affirm embodied personhood and eschatological bodily restoration.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous philological and exegetical challenge to reading biblical "soul" language as evidence for Greek-style immaterial substance; emphasizes functional and relational uses of terms.
 - Places the incarnation and bodily resurrection at the heart of anthropological theology rather than treating them as addenda to an already defined soul-body ontology.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on Cartesian dualism prevalent in much Western theology and pastoral practice.
 - Also resists reductive physicalism that collapses personhood into mere biological processes, arguing instead for a non-reductive psychosomatic unity.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Operationalizes a robust notion of "psychosomatic unity" as both exegetical claim and theological category linking creation, sin, salvation, and eschatology.
 - Emphasizes linguistic/functionalist reading of biblical terms (nephesh/psyche/ruah) over metaphysical substance readings.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary theological anthropology, biblical theology courses, and pastoral ethics. Influential among those seeking a biblically grounded alternative to dualism and to materialist reductionism.
 - Used in ecumenical and evangelical contexts as a corrective to entrenched folk dualism in pastoral care and Christian ethics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, exegetically informed resource that reorients theological reflection toward embodied, relational, and eschatological categories; valuable for preaching, teaching, and interdisciplinary discussion with philosophy and bioethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - The central analytic term: human beings are unified wholes (psyche + soma) not compound substances.

- **Nephesh**
 - Hebrew term often rendered "soul"; Green reads it as referring to the living person or life-breath, not an immortal immaterial self.

- **Ruah / Spirit**
 - Functional and relational dynamics in biblical anthropology, tied to vitality, relational responsiveness, and divine-human interaction.

- **Psyche / Soma**
 - Greek terms in NT context showing overlapping functions for "soul" and "body"; NT authors treat persons as embodied agents rather than two independent substances.

- **Embodiment**
 - Emphasis on bodily constitution of identity, agency, moral responsibility, and religious life.

- **Incarnation**
 - Christological locus for rethinking human nature: God assumes embodied humanity, which dignifies the body.

- **Resurrection (bodily)**
 - Eschatological hinge: redemption of persons is bodily; continuity and transformation of embodied identity.

- **Anti-dualism**
 - Rejection of Cartesian substance dualism as extrabiblical and theologically problematic.

- **Non-reductive physicalism / holistic physicalism**
 - Philosophical posture compatible with Green's exegetical claims: matter constitutes persons without reducing personhood to mere biology.

- **Imago Dei**
 - Read relationally and vocationally, embodied in the social and moral capacities of whole persons.

- **Heart, mind, conscience**
 - Treated as dimensions/functions within a single embodied person rather than separate inner substances.

- **Sin and death**
 - Corporally and relationally situated; effects on whole persons, not merely on an immaterial soul.

- **Pastoral and ethical application**
 - Implicates care for bodies, medical ethics, grief, and practices of worship and sacraments tied to embodied life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an exegetical model for reading biblical anthropology (source for translations and lexical studies).
- As a polemic against both Cartesian dualism and reductive materialism in systematic theology and pastoral practice.
- As a conceptual pivot in ethics and pastoral theology to ground care for the body, bioethical stances, and sacramental theology.
