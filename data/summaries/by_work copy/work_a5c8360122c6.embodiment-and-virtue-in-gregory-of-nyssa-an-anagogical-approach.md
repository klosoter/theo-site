### TITLE
Embodiment and Virtue in Gregory of Nyssa: An Anagogical Approach - Hans Boersma

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary retrievalist study (late 20th/early 21st c.) by Hans Boersma, situated in renewed interest in patristic moral theology and sacramental/embodied approaches within Reformed and Anglican circles.
 - Engages the Cappadocian milieu, especially fourth-century ascetic and mystical streams typified by Gregory of Nyssa.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Gregory offers an **anagogical** reading of the Christian life in which embodied practices and virtues are constitutive of spiritual ascent toward deification (theosis); embodiment is not merely incidental but a sacramental locus of transformation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Gregory's anthropology: humans as embodied beings created for an ascending movement toward God.
 - Analysis of Gregory's moral language: virtues as habits enacted through bodily disciplines (asceticism, liturgy, sensual reorientation).
 - Methodological claim: anagoge (upward-leading imagination/interpretation) reads bodily life and Scripture as pointers to higher spiritual realities without denigrating materiality.
 - Apophatic and kataphatic balance: Gregory's use of negative theology reframes, rather than eliminates, the role of embodied virtue.
 - Constructive retrieval: Boersma draws implications for contemporary theology - moral formation, liturgy, and sacramental theology require re-embedding in an anagogical imagination.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Gregory of Nyssa (Life of Moses, On the Soul and Resurrection, Homilies on the Song of Songs, treatises on virginity and asceticism).
 - Secondary: Cappadocians broadly, Neoplatonic background (as foil), Augustine and later Western emphases on interiority, contemporary virtue ethicists and sacramental theologians (implicit interlocutors).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (embodied soul, created telos)
 - **Ethics/virtue** (habituation, ascetic formation)
 - **Theosis / soteriology** (participation in divine life)
 - **Exegetical method** (anagoge)
 - **Apophatic theology** and the limits of language about God
 - Incarnation implicitly grounds the positive valuation of embodiment.
- **Closing line**
 - Boersma situates Gregory's synthesis as a corrective to disembodied modern moralities: authentic Christian virtue is an anagogical, embodied apprenticeship in which bodily formation mediates participation in the divine life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **anagogy** as both hermeneutical key and moral-dispositional practice: reading and bodily practice converge to lift the whole person.
 - Treats virtues not as abstract traits but as embodied **habits** shaped by liturgy, ascetic discipline, and sacramental life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Platonic/dualistic tendencies that denigrate the body by showing Gregory's dialectic: body as instrument and image for transcendence rather than mere prison of the soul.
 - Contrasts with some Western emphases on interior cognition alone (e.g., certain Augustinian or proto-Protestant tendencies) by recovering formative external practices.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims and operationalizes **anagoge** beyond exegetical nostalgia - as a living theological imagination shaping praxis.
 - Frames **virtue** through a sacramental-ascetic lens: virtues are liturgicalized bodily capacities.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among neo-patristic and sacramental-revival scholars, and in contemporary debates over theological anthropology and moral formation.
 - Serves as a bridge for Reformed and Anglican theologians seeking to recover ascetic and liturgical resources without adopting Eastern ecclesial frameworks wholesale.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a paradigm to rethink moral theology as embodied formation; supplies conceptual tools for integrating liturgy, ascetic practice, and virtue ethics in contemporary ecclesial formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anagoge** - upward-reading; hermeneutic that moves from material/Scriptural particulars to spiritual fulfillment; central method and moral engine.
- **Embodiment** - the theological claim that the body is constitutive of personhood and spiritual ascent, not merely instrument or obstacle.
- **Virtue (habit)** - practiced dispositions; for Gregory these are cultivated bodily and liturgically, not purely intellectual.
- **Theosis / deification** - participation in divine life as the telos of virtue and embodiment.
- **Asceticism** - disciplined bodily practices re-ordered toward contemplation and love; formative rather than merely punitive.
- **Apophatic theology** - negative theology that preserves mystery while enabling transformative ascent when balanced with kataphatic practices.
- **Kataphasis** - positive affirmations of God mediated through sacramental and liturgical signs; complements apophaticism in Gregory's approach.
- **Sacramentality** - the world and bodily practices function as signs and means of grace in Gregory's scheme.
- **Anthropology (embodied soul)** - insists on psychosomatic unity: soul and body co-participate in salvation.
- **Liturgy as formation** - corporate worship structures and bodily acts form virtues by habituation.
- **Imagination (spiritual)** - anagogical imagination redirects senses and memory toward divine realities.
- **Neoplatonism (contextualized)** - philosophical backdrop reworked by Gregory to serve Christian telos rather than metaphysical escape.
- **Kenosis (implicit)** - Christ's condescension grounds the positive valuation of creaturely embodiment.
- **Moral pedagogy** - the church's role in shaping virtues via pedagogy of signs, texts, and practices.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for anagogical hermeneutics and an incarnational anthropology.
- As a **polemic** against secular dualism and reductive interiorist moralities.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading patristic texts that integrate ascetic practice with doctrine.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula on spiritual formation, liturgy, and virtue theory, especially within retrievalist and sacramental frameworks.
