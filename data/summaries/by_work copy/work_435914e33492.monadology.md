### TITLE
Monadology - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1714)
- Short treatise summarizing Leibniz's mature metaphysics and its implications for God, creation, and the problem of evil (linked to his Theodicy and Divine Justice).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early Enlightenment (1714); Leibniz writing amid disputes with Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Newtonians; follows and complements his Theodicy (1710).
 - Theological milieu: Protestant scholastic and natural-philosophical environment where metaphysics, providence, and divine justice are debated.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - World is composed of simple, immaterial, indivisible substances (monads) organised in a harmonious hierarchy created by God; this metaphysics undergirds a theodical claim: God, as necessary and perfect monad, chose the best of all possible worlds, thereby reconciling divine goodness and the existence of evil.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and axioms: monads are simple, without parts, non-spatial, windowless, and have perceptions and appetitions.
 - Hierarchy: from bare entelechies (simple perceptions) to rational souls and God as the Supreme Monad.
 - Dynamics: change is internal (appetition) rather than caused by external interaction; apparent causal relations are explained by pre-established harmony ordained by God.
 - Theodical move: given the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) and compossibility constraints, God freely chooses the best possible compossible set of monads and relations; evil arises as privation and as necessary consequence of the best overall order.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Responses to Descartes (interactionism), Spinoza (pantheism/necessitarianism), Malebranche (occasionalism), Locke (empiricism), and later interlocutors such as Clarke and Bayle.
 - Draws on scholastic categories (entelechy, privation) and Christian theism (creation ex nihilo, providence).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and creatureliness, divine simplicity and necessity, providence and foreknowledge, freedom and internal causation of the soul, the metaphysical account of evil (privation), and implications for divine justice.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Monadology is a metaphysical scaffolding for a rational theodicy: by positing a pluriform but divinely ordered realm of simple substances and invoking PSR and compossibility, Leibniz asserts that God's choice of this world manifests maximal perfection compatible with divine justice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Radical metaphysical atomism of non-extended, perceiving simples (monads) rather than material atoms or spatial points.
 - Emphasis on internal principles of change (appetition/entelechy) and representation: every monad mirrors the universe from its own point of view.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects Cartesian dualist interaction (no causal influx between substance types).
 - Opposes Spinozistic determinism by preserving real contingency and divine freedom (God chooses the best possible world).
 - Rejects Malebranchean occasionalism by attributing lawful coordination to divine preestablished ordering, not moment-by-moment divine intervention.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Monad" as unified bearer of perception and appetite; "windowless" monads; "pre-established harmony"; "compossibility" and optimization of worlds.
 - Systematic use of the Principle of Sufficient Reason and Identity of Indiscernibles in metaphysical theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant impact on metaphysics, early modern theology, and theodical discourse; influenced German Idealists and later theological engagements with divine providence and freedom.
 - Criticised by empiricists, skeptics (e.g., Hume), and Kant; used by some Protestant apologists to defend compatibilist theodicies, while others found Leibnizian optimism theologically contentious.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, rigorous model linking metaphysics with theodicy: useful for teaching the interplay of divine attributes, freedom, and the problem of evil; a durable conceptual resource for natural theology and philosophical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monad** - simple, indivisible substance; basic metaphysical unit with perceptions and appetitions.
- **Simple substance** - cannot be divided; contrasts with extended material parts.
- **Perception** - internal representation of the universe; graded from confused to distinct.
- **Appetition** - internal principle of change; explains transition between perceptions.
- **Entelechy** - self-actualizing form or principle within a monad; borrowed from scholasticism.
- **Windowless** - monads do not causally interact or receive impressions from outside; all relations are internally determined.
- **Pre-established harmony** - God coordinates monads at creation so their internal developments correspond without causal exchange.
- **Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)** - every fact has a reason; central to arguing God chose this world for the best reasons.
- **Identity of indiscernibles** - no two distinct monads have all properties in common; grounds individuation.
- **Compossibility** - mutual compatibility of possible entities/events; used to articulate why some worlds are possible and others not.
- **Best of all possible worlds** - theological-ethical claim that God selected the maximal overall perfection given compossibility constraints.
- **Privation theory of evil** - evil is lack or limitation, not a created positive entity.
- **God as Supreme Monad** - God is the necessary, infinite monad whose perceptions are creation-wide and whose choice grounds the order.
- **Divine justice / providence (Leibnizian)** - justice understood via optimal ordering and rational choice; natural laws and limited evils permitted because they contribute to maximal perfection.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for debates about substance, soul, and immateriality in theology.
 - As a **polemic tool** against pantheism, interactionist accounts, and occasionalism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** and model in theodicy discussions reconciling divine goodness, omniscience, and the existence of evil.
