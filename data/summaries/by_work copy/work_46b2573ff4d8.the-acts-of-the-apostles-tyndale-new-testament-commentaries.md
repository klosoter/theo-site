### TITLE
The Acts of the Apostles (Tyndale New Testament Commentaries) - I. Howard Marshall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th to early-21st century evangelical scholarship; Tyndale series aimed at pastors, students, and informed laity.
 - Marshall writes as a conservative-critical exegete engaging both historical-critical methods and confessional theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Acts narrates the unfolding of redemptive history through the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit: the Spirit is the decisive agent who continues Jesus' ministry, inaugurates the church, and drives mission to the Gentiles.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close, verse-by-verse exegesis oriented toward theological synthesis:
 - Prologue and program (Luke 1-2, Acts 1): continuity with Luke; promise of the Spirit.
 - Jerusalem witness and Spirit-empowerment (Acts 2-7): the Spirit authenticates the early kerygma.
 - Gentile mission and Spirit-guidance (Acts 8-15): decision at Antioch and Jerusalem Council as Spirit-directed covenant development.
 - Pauline journeys and ecclesial formation (Acts 16-28): missionary strategy shaped by pneumatology and providence.
 - Recurring method: historical exegesis → theological implication → pastoral application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Luke-Acts as literary unity; converses with modern commentators (e.g., F.F. Bruce, C.K. Barrett) and critical debates over historicity, sources, and Luke's theology.
 - Interacts with wider pneumatological scholarship and Pauline studies to situate Acts within redemptive history.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (primary): Spirit as continuing Christ's work; Spirit and mission.
 - **Ecclesiology**: birth and structure of the church; apostolic ministry.
 - **Christology** and **Soteriology**: resurrection witness and repentance/faith as response to Spirit-enabled proclamation.
 - **Eschatology**: inaugurated eschatology - the Kingdom present but awaiting consummation.
 - **Revelation & Scripture**: Luke as theological historiography; Scripture's role in mission and decision-making.
- **Closing line**
 - Marshall locates Acts theologically at the intersection of history and Spirit: the narrative shows how the risen Christ, by his Spirit, establishes and equips the church to bear witness to God's redemptive rule.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong exegetical insistence that the **Holy Spirit functions as the principal actor** in Acts' narrative economy - not an occasional force but the engine of redemptive history.
 - Balanced attention to both **historical reliability** and theological purpose of Luke-Acts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters overly skeptical reconstructions of Acts as theological fiction; resists reductionist form-critical readings that divorce narrative from history.
 - Offers a corrective to pietistic or individualistic pneumatologies by framing Spirit-activity corporate and mission-shaped.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Emphasizes **"Spirit in redemptive history"** as a lens: Spirit as historical agent, not merely charismatic phenomena or private experience.
 - Treats **baptism in the Spirit**, **charismata**, and **signs-and-wonders** as theologically integrated elements that authenticate mission and message.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries and churches as a reliable, readable commentary; respected for judicious use of critical tools without theological compromise.
 - Influential for pastors and biblical-theological courses on Acts and pneumatology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for combining careful exegesis with coherent theological synthesis about the Spirit's role in mission and church formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Acts (Luke-Acts unity)** - Treats Acts as continuation of Luke's Gospel; essential for understanding post-resurrection Spirit-work.
- **Holy Spirit / Pneumatology** - Central actor; empowers proclamation, guides mission, authenticates community.
- **Spirit in redemptive history** - The framing concept: Spirit as agent in God's progressive revelation and mission.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - Kingdom present in germ through Spirit-enabled witness; consummation still future.
- **Kerygma (witness / proclamation)** - Apostolic proclamation validated by Spirit-empowered signs and resurrection testimony.
- **Charismata / Gifts** - Expressions of Spirit's presence; functional for evangelism and church life, not ends in themselves.
- **Baptism in the Spirit** - Mark of initiation into the Spirit-empowered community; linked to conversion and commissioning.
- **Signs and wonders** - Confirmatory phenomena tied to mission and the defeat of spiritual opposition.
- **Apostolic authority / witness** - Authority derived from resurrection commission and Spirit-empowerment.
- **Mission (Jew-Gentile dynamic)** - Spirit-mediated expansion of the covenant people to the nations; resolution at Jerusalem Council shows Spirit-guided decision-making.
- **Narrative theology / historiography** - Luke as theological historian: selective reporting with doctrinal aims.
- **Conversion / Church formation** - Spirit forms believing communities, rituals (baptism, breaking of bread) sustain identity.
- **Providence** - Spirit and divine oversight coordinate missionary events without denying human agency.
- **Hermeneutical method: historical-grammatical exegesis** - Marshall's preferred tool for theological conclusions from Acts.
- **Use across loci**
 - As **definition source** for evangelical pneumatology (what the Spirit does in history).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts: integrate history, narrative theology, and theology of mission.
 - As a **pastoral-teaching resource** for preaching on the Spirit, mission, and church formation.
