### TITLE
New Testament Eschatology and the Problem of its Reception (essays) - C. H. Dodd

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th century British New Testament scholarship; reaction to pre-war Schweitzerian eschatology and contemporaneous existentialist readings (e.g., Bultmann). Dodd writes as part of a Cambridge scholarly tradition emphasizing historical-critical exegesis and theological reception.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the New Testament presents both an imminent apocalyptic expectation and a real, present manifestation of the eschaton in Christ; the historical problem is how the early church received and reinterpreted Jesus' imminent expectation when the Parousia was delayed.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose the problem: earliest proclamation expected imminent Parousia; delay created theological strain.
 - Distinguish types of New Testament eschatology: **realized** (eschaton present in Christ) vs. **consistent/apocalyptic** (imminent end).
 - Trace patterns of reception in the New Testament: how Paul, the Johannine tradition, and pastoral/epistolary material adapt expectations (ethical emphasis, sacramental and ecclesial presence, reinterpretations of prophecy).
 - Argue that creative theological reception (reinterpretation rather than mere abandonment) preserved eschatological meaning while modifying temporal expectation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Albert Schweitzer (consistent eschatology), Rudolf Bultmann (existential hermeneutics), contemporary Pauline and Johannine scholarship; Jewish apocalyptic background; patristic reception implicitly addressed.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (eschatological significance of Jesus), ecclesiology (church as eschatological community), revelation (eschatological revelation in Christ), soteriology (realized salvation), prophetic and apocalyptic hermeneutics.
- **Closing line:** Dodd locates the theological center of gravity in the New Testament tension between an **already-realized eschatological presence in Christ** and the **still-future consummation**, showing that the church's theological creativity in reception preserved eschatological hope without literalizing an impossible timetable.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **realized eschatology**: the eschatological age has been inaugurated in the person and ministry of Jesus, not merely deferred projection.
 - Focuses on **reception-history**: the early church's interpretive strategies are integral to understanding NT eschatology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges Schweitzer's portrayal of Jesus as only an apocalyptic prophet awaiting imminent end by arguing that New Testament witness also affirms present eschatological realities.
 - Offers an alternative to Bultmann's existentialist reduction by retaining historical, Christological content as locus of eschatological realization.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized (if not coined) the pairing of **realized vs. consistent** eschatology and highlighted the analytical usefulness of **"delay of the Parousia"** as a theological problem.
 - Emphasizes **reception** as an interpretive category within NT theology.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential for mid-century evangelical and academic debates about the "already/not yet" motif; fed later models of inaugurated eschatology (e.g., 20th-century evangelical theology).
 - Provoked critique from scholars (e.g., later Wrightian scholars) who argue Dodd underplays the future consummatory and judicial dimensions of the eschaton.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models careful balancing of historical-critical exegesis with theological interpretation.
 - Serves as a primary resource for discussing how Christian doctrine adapts to historical disappointment without losing eschatological orientation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Realized eschatology:** the claim that aspects of the eschaton (kingdom, salvation) are present in Jesus' ministry and in the church now.
- **Consistent eschatology:** the view (Schweitzer) that Jesus expected an imminent, cataclysmic end and that NT eschatology is uniformly apocalyptic.
- **Delay of the Parousia:** the historical-theological problem of why the expected imminent return did not occur and how the church responded.
- **Parousia:** the Second Coming; central temporal marker whose postponement drives reception changes.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / already-not-yet:** later synthesis arising from Dodd's insights; the eschaton is both present and future.
- **Reception-history (rezeptionsgeschichte):** focus on how early communities reinterpreted Jesus' message in light of historical developments.
- **Kingdom (of God) - present dimension:** kingdom as realized in Jesus' acts, authority, and presence.
- **Kingdom - future dimension:** consummation remaining to come; Dodd insists both dimensions coexist in NT witness.
- **Ethical reorientation:** how delay prompted emphasis on moral exhortation and perseverance.
- **Ecclesial/sacramental presence:** church life and sacraments as means by which the inaugurated eschaton is experienced.
- **Typological/prophetic reinterpretation:** re-reading Hebrew Scriptures to locate present eschatological fulfillment.
- **Apocalyptic expectation:** background motif of imminent divine intervention and judgment.
- **Hermeneutical creativity:** term for the theological strategies early Christians used to negotiate delay.
- **Christological locus of eschatology:** locating eschaton in person and action of Jesus rather than only future events.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the category "realized eschatology" and for framing the "delay of the Parousia" problem.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how to read Pauline and Johannine texts for both present and future eschatological claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over inaugurated/"already-not-yet" eschatology and in critiques of purely apocalyptic or purely existential readings.
- As a **polemic resource** against readings that eliminate the future consummation or over-spiritualize apocalyptic expectation.
