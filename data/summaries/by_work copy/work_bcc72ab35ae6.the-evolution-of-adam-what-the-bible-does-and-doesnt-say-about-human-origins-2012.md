### TITLE
The Evolution of Adam: What the Bible Does and Doesn't Say about Human Origins - Peter Enns (Brazos Press, 2012)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2012 amid renewed evangelical debate over evolution, human origins, and the status of Genesis 1-11.
 - Enns writes from an evangelical background but decisively critical of young-earth literalism and classical inerrancy; engages both popular creationist literature and academic biblical studies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible's witness to Adam is primarily theological/typological rather than a straightforward scientific or modern-historical report. Claims for a single biological first human as required by recent science are not compelled by Scripture; Christian doctrine (original sin, Christ as new Adam) can be rethought without insisting on a single ancestor in the biological sense.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Close reading of Genesis 1-11 in its Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) literary context - argues for genre-aware exegesis that recognizes theological intent over modern historiography.
 - Part 2: Examination of New Testament Adam-language (esp. Paul) - argues Paul uses Adam typologically, analogically, and Christologically rather than as a scientific anchor for human origins.
 - Part 3: Interaction with biological science - sketches compatibility with evolution and multi-regional/ancestral-population models for humans.
 - Part 4: Theological synthesis - proposes models for preserving doctrines (sin, representation) while accepting scientific findings; appeals to inspiration conceived in incarnational/accommodation terms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages ANE scholarship and literary approaches (e.g., John Walton), contemporary evangelical critics (young-earth proponents), evolution proponents, and Pauline scholarship on Adam (e.g., N. T. Wright dialogue implicit).
 - Builds on Enns's earlier work on inspiration (Inspiration and Incarnation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration, inerrancy, anthropology (image of God), original sin and federal headship, Christology (Christ as new Adam), Scripture's relation to science.
- **Site usage (explicit topical references)**
 - **Historicity And Federal Headship Of Adam:** Argues biblical texts support Adam as a theological representative; historical single-progenitor claim is not mandated by Scripture.
 - **Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11:** Advocates genre-sensitive reading of Genesis that allows integration with evolutionary science.
 - **Inspiration And Inerrancy:** Reiterates a non-inerrantist, incarnational account of Scripture's authority; Scripture conveys theological truth through culturally conditioned forms.
 - **Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy:** Uses incarnation as a controlling analogy - God communicates in human modes, limiting form to the audience's cultural-historical capacity.
- **Closing line**
 - Enns's theological gravity: preserve the Bible's theological authority and the doctrines of sin and redemption while relinquishing modern scientific expectations of Genesis; Scripture accommodates human cultural-linguistic horizons much as the Incarnation accommodated human nature.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that Genesis 1-11 be read by genre and ANE context, not by modern historiographical categories.
 - Repeated use of the **incarnation-accommodation** analogy as the hermeneutical key for understanding inspiration.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts with classical inerrancy and young-earth creationism by denying that Scripture must teach modern scientific facts to be authoritative.
 - Differs from some theistic-evolution writers by more sharply decoupling NT Adam-typology from a necessary biological monogenesis.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes "accommodation" as more than occasional pedagogical accommodation - as a pervasive feature of divine revelation shaping doctrine formation.
 - Frames Adam primarily as an **archetypal/federal** figure rather than necessarily a biological first parent.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely discussed across evangelical and academic circles; praised by many mainline and progressive evangelicals; criticized by conservative inerrantists.
 - Influential in conversations at BioLogos and among scholars seeking to conserve core Christian doctrine while accepting evolutionary science.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, readable model for integrating biblical exegesis with contemporary science without capitulating to scientism or undermining theological substance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam (historical vs. archetypal)** - Enns: Adam functions primarily as theological/archetypal representative in Scripture; historicity is not theologically indispensable.
- **Federal headship** - Retained as a theological category, reinterpreted to allow corporate or typological dimensions rather than strictly biological primacy.
- **Original sin** - Preserved as a theological diagnosis of human condition; Enns urges explanation that does not depend on a single first pair for metaphysical transmission.
- **Accommodation** - Central hermeneutical term: God expresses truth in culturally conditioned forms; Scripture's human forms are expected and theologically meaningful.
- **Incarnation analogy** - Key explanatory device: just as Christ assumed human limitations, Scripture assumes cultural-linguistic limitations.
- **Inspiration (non-inerrantist)** - Authority grounded in God's redemptive self-disclosure rather than in propositional, scientific accuracy.
- **Genre and ANE context** - Emphasizes reading Genesis with attention to ancient cosmology, etiologies, and narrative genres.
- **Genesis 1-11 (science interaction)** - Treated as theological mytho-historical literature that can coexist with evolutionary accounts of origins.
- **Typology (Pauline use of Adam)** - Paul's Adam-language is persuasive as typological, connecting Adam and Christ theologically rather than as a scientific claim about ancestry.
- **Evolutionary creation / theistic evolution** - Enns positions his work sympathetically within this broad family, though distinct in his hermeneutical emphases.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Reframed from inerrantist premises to an incarnationally mediated theological authority.
- **Historical reading vs. theological reading** - Distinguishes modern historical expectations from the Bible's theological aims.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for incarnational/accommodation models of inspiration.
 - As a **polemic** against young-earth inerrantism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-11 in ANE context.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic reflections on sin, representation, and the compatibility of Christian doctrine with evolutionary biology.
