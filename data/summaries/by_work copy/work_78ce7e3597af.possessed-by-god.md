### TITLE
Possessed by God: A New Testament Theology of Sanctification and Holiness - David G. Peterson (1995)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Anglican biblical-theological conversation (1990s). Responds to fragmentation in holiness studies by offering an integrated New Testament treatment grounded in exegesis rather than systematic pigeonholing.
 - Moves against pietistic individualism and moralistic accounts of sanctification; converses with contemporary NT scholars on pneumatology and Pauline theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents sanctification and holiness primarily as the result of God's possession of his people (through the Spirit and covenantal relationship), rather than merely human moral effort. Holiness is relational and participatory: believers are "possessed by God."

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey and lexical/theological study of NT sanctification language (Greek terms hagiazō, hagios, hagiosune, etc.).
 - Canon-wide treatment: Paul (especially), Luke-Acts, the Gospels, Hebrews, Johannine and Petrine literature - showing consistent themes:
 - God as possessive agent initiating sanctification.
 - The Spirit as the means and present power of holiness.
 - Union with Christ and participation as the ontological basis for holy living.
 - Eschatological fulfillment: holiness is both present possession and future consummation.
 - Argues for corporate and ecclesial dimensions of holiness alongside individual transformation.
 - Moves from exegesis to theological synthesis: integrate sanctification with justification, covenant, Spirit, church and eschatology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors are NT texts; engages contemporary interpreters of Pauline sanctification and pneumatology (Dunn, Wright implicitly present in concerns), and traditions emphasizing moralism (various pietistic/Wesleyan or revival movements by implication).
 - Draws on lexical studies, historical theology selectively to show continuity and contrast.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification and holiness (central)
 - Pneumatology (Holy Spirit as sanctifier)
 - Union with Christ / participation
 - Justification vs sanctification relation
 - Ecclesiology (corporate holiness)
 - Eschatology (already/not yet character)
 - Ethics as outflow of possession

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - The New Testament insists that true holiness is primarily the gift and possession of God inaugurated by Christ and enacted by the Spirit, so Christian sanctification is participation in God's possession rather than human achievement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The titular image - believers as "possessed by God" - reframes sanctification in ownership/relational rather than moral-volitional terms.
 - Emphasizes corporate, covenantal, and pneumatological dimensions equally; resists purely individualistic sanctification models.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects moralistic and therapeutic accounts that privatize holiness; challenges accounts that separate sanctification from Spirit-empowered union with Christ.
 - Pushes back on approaches that treat sanctification merely as progressive moral improvement or as identical to justification.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Highlights "possession" vocabulary across NT and reinterprets its theological weight for holiness discourse.
 - Refines the relation of "possession" to "participation" - possession as the relational ground enabling participatory holiness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded in evangelical seminaries as a model of biblical-theological treatment of sanctification; frequently cited in courses on the Holy Spirit and practical theology.
 - Influential among Reformed and Anglican readers for integrating pneumatology with covenantal holiness; used as corrective in debates over sanctification models.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Exemplifies careful NT exegesis moved responsibly into theological synthesis.
 - Valuable pedagogically for showing how lexical and canonical work can reorient doctrinal thinking; continues to serve as a go-to biblical-theological treatment on holiness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Possessed by God**
 - Central metaphor: God as owner/possessor who secures holiness for his people through Christ and Spirit.

- **Sanctification (hagiasmos, hagiazō, etc.)**
 - Technical NT terms mapped to theological categories: declarative, positional, progressive, and eschatological aspects.

- **Holiness (hagiosune)**
 - Ethical and ontological dimensions; not merely conduct but status in relation to God.

- **Holy Spirit / Pneumatology**
 - The agent who realizes God's possession; presence, empowerment, and internal transformation.

- **Union with Christ / Participation**
 - Ontological basis for sanctification; believers share in Christ's holiness by virtue of union.

- **Justification vs Sanctification**
 - Related but distinct: justification grounds the believer's status; sanctification is the Spirit-wrought possession and transformation that flows from it.

- **Eschatology (already/not-yet)**
 - Holiness is inaugurated by Christ's work and Spirit's presence, yet awaits consummation.

- **Covenant / Corporate dimension**
 - Holiness situated within covenantal people (church) rather than isolated individuals; communal obligations and identity emphasized.

- **Ethics as outflow**
 - Moral transformation is the fruit and evidence of being possessed, not the root cause.

- **Possession imagery (owner/possession; redeemed possession)**
 - Recurs across NT: God owns his people, redeems them as his possession, and calls them holy.

- **Sanctifying grace**
 - God's proactive and sustained work to render the possessed holy.

- **Moralism / Pietism (contrast)**
 - Target for critique: reduces sanctification to human effort or felt piety.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for New Testament-derived accounts of sanctification and holiness.
- As a **polemic** against moralistic and individualistic models of sanctification.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how to survey NT literature and integrate lexical, canonical, and theological data.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking pneumatology, union with Christ, and corporate ecclesial life in discussions of spiritual formation and ecclesial holiness.
