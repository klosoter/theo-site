### TITLE
Losing Our Virtue: Why the Church Must Recover Its Moral Vision - David F. Wells

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical context (post-1960s through 1990s), reacting to cultural secularization, therapeutic culture, and the consumerization of church life.
 - Milieu: conservative/Reformed-influenced evangelicalism concerned with institutional decline, loss of doctrinal seriousness, and weakened moral formation.
 - Used in scholarly and seminary conversations under topics: **Nature And Task Of Theology** and **Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer**.

- **Central thesis**
 - The contemporary church has lost a coherent *moral vision* because its theology, preaching, sacraments, and prayer practices have been so weakened or domesticated that Christian formation into virtue no longer occurs; recovery requires doctrinally robust ecclesial practices that shape character by grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: charts symptoms - moral confusion, episodic spirituality, moral mediocrity among Christians, and social ineffectiveness.
 - Cultural roots: traces influence of modernity, liberal theology, pietistic privatization, and market-driven church models.
 - Ecclesial anatomy: analyzes how preaching, sacraments, prayer, and catechesis have been altered or marginalized, producing defective formation.
 - Theological root causes: erosion of doctrine (sin, grace, covenant), fragmentation of theology from life, loss of a public moral imagination.
 - Prescription: renew theology as formative knowledge, recover preaching and sacramental practice as formative means of grace, reassert communal and covenantal discipline to restore virtue.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit contrasts with liberal theology, pietistic tendencies, and therapeutic culture; appeals to Reformational resources (Calvinic emphasis on corporate formation) and classical Christian moral theology.
 - Engages modern evangelical leaders and institutional trends as primary interlocutors rather than detailed academic interaction with continental or Barthian systems.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and the authority of Scripture (as formative truth).
 - Sin and human brokenness (diagnostic foundation).
 - Grace and sanctification (as communal, ecclesial work).
 - Church and covenant (as framework for moral formation).
 - Means of grace: preaching, sacraments, prayer (practical loci of formation).

- **Closing line**
 - Theological conviction must be reconstituted as ecclesial practice: without doctrine-formed preaching and sacramental, prayerful congregational life the church cannot recover the virtues that make Christian witness credible.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes *moral vision* the central hermeneutic: theology judged by its capacity to form character, not merely to explain doctrine or secure individual piety.
 - Prioritizes institutional and communal formation (church practices) over individualistic models of holiness.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic privatization (faith as private feeling) and liberal privatism (morality untethered from doctrinal truth).
 - Challenges revivalistic/consumerist evangelicalism that privileges experience, program, or market success over formative preaching and sacramental depth.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Operationalizes "moral vision" as both cognitive (what Christians are taught to believe about God, sin, and the world) and formative (practices that cultivate virtues).
 - Frames the means of grace as institutional practices that must be doctrinally saturated to produce durable virtue.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative and Reformed-leaning seminaries and pastoral formation programs as a provocation to renew ministry practices.
 - Sparked debates: praised for incisive diagnosis and pastoral urgency; critiqued by some as nostalgic or insufficiently attentive to social-structural causes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clarifying corrective about the relation of doctrine and practice and remains a go-to text for courses on pastoral theology, ecclesiology, and moral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Moral vision** - integrated view of reality that shapes moral perception and action; the book's operative aim.
- **Means of grace** - preaching, sacraments, and prayer as vehicles by which God forms virtue in the church.
 - Emphasizes institutional efficacy over mere symbolic or optional status.
- **Theological seriousness** - commitment to doctrine as formative knowledge, not merely propositional information.
- **Formation** - long-term, communal process of virtue cultivation rooted in ecclesial practices.
- **Moral mediocrity** - the observed state of compromised Christian witness in contemporary churches.
- **Consumer Christianity** - church-as-market model that undermines discipline and doctrinal fidelity.
- **Privatization of faith** - trend reducing Christianity to private piety, weakening public moral witness.
- **Covenantal church** - the ecclesial structure Wells appeals to for communal responsibility and discipline.
- **Sin and grace** - central doctrinal pair used to diagnose failure and frame recovery; sin explains decay, grace provides formative power.
- **Preaching as formative** - homiletics that aims to reshape life, not merely inform or motivate.
- **Sacramental recovery** - reclaiming baptism and the Lord's Supper as formative, communal acts.
- **Prayer as discipline** - prayer conceived as corporate practice that reorients affections and shapes virtue.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source and critique in courses on the **Nature And Task Of Theology**: argues that theology's task includes formative moral vision, not only intellectual assent.
 - As a practical and polemical resource in studies of **Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer**: used to justify renewed emphasis on preaching, sacramental practice, and corporate disciplines as loci of sanctification.
