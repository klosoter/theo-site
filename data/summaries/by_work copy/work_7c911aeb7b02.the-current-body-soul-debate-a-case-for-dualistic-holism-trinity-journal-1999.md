### TITLE
**The Current Body-Soul Debate: A Case for Dualistic Holism** - John W. Cooper (Trinity Journal, 1999)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century resurgence of analytic philosophy of mind intersecting evangelical theology.
 - Responds to rising materialist/reductive accounts of persons and renewed interest in classical and Thomistic alternatives within Christian scholarship.
 - Situated in an evangelical theological journal addressing pastoral and doctrinal concerns (resurrection, immortality, imago Dei).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Advocates **dualistic holism**: humans are fundamentally unified psychosomatic persons constituted by an immaterial soul and a bodily constitution, resisting both reductive materialism and crude Cartesian atomism.
 - Seeks to preserve biblical commitments (bodily resurrection, personal continuity, immortality) while giving a philosophically credible account of mental causation and personhood.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses failures of opposing positions:
 - **Reductionist/materialist accounts** fail to account for subjective consciousness, moral agency, and personal identity across radical bodily change.
 - **Cartesian substance dualism** tends to generate an implausible separability (the "ghost in the machine") and underestimates embodied character of human life.
 - Positive proposal:
 - Define person as a single substance in which an immaterial soul is the principle of life and personal identity, yet essentially embodied - the soul and body form an ontological whole.
 - Argues for interactive relations: mental states are non-reducible but causally efficacious in a psychosomatic unity.
 - Uses biblical-theological evidence (resurrection narratives, Pauline anthropology, early church consensus) to show biblical anthropology requires both soul-distinctness and bodily continuity.
 - Philosophical support:
 - Appeals to problems of mental causation and explanatory gaps to reject reductive identity theories.
 - Offers conceptual frameworks for personal persistence compatible with resurrection continuity (soul as bearer of personal identity, body as constitutive of personhood in history).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with:
 - Materialist/reductive theorists in philosophy of mind (analytic debates on identity and supervenience).
 - Classical sources (Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas) and modern dualists (Descartes) - not to endorse uncritically but to contrast strengths and weaknesses.
 - Biblical and patristic testimony regarding death, soul, and resurrection.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (human nature, personhood)
 - **Eschatology** (resurrection, immortality)
 - **Christology/Incarnation** (implicit analogies concerning unity of divine and human natures inform methodological parallels)
 - **Soteriology** (implications for salvation as involving whole-person redemption)

- **Closing line**
 - Cooper contends that **dualistic holism** best secures biblical and philosophical commitments: human persons are immaterially grounded yet essentially embodied wholes, vindicating both personal immortality and bodily resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The phrase and programmatic stance of **dualistic holism**: insists on immaterial soulhood without abandoning the radical unity and embodied dependency of persons.
 - Strong integration of analytic problems (mental causation, identity) with theological priorities (resurrection continuity, imago Dei).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Cartesian excesses by reasserting bodily constitutiveness of personal identity.
 - Critiques reductionist-materialist accounts for failing pastoral and doctrinal needs (assurance of resurrection, moral responsibility).
 - Positions itself distinct from classical hylomorphism by maintaining a clearer ontological distinction of soul as immaterial while still insisting on psychosomatic unity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes the label **"dualistic holism"** as a middle path, operationalizing it for evangelical theological anthropology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelical and conservative Protestant theologians seeking a robust non-reductive account of persons.
 - Cited in subsequent discussions on resurrection theology, Christian anthropology, and debates with physicalist philosophers of mind.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, accessible bridge between analytic philosophy of mind and biblical-theological commitments.
 - Useful model for classrooms and pastoral settings where both philosophical rigor and doctrinal fidelity are demanded.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dualistic holism** - Primary thesis: ontological duality (soul distinct) plus ontological/functional unity (person as embodied whole).
- **Psychosomatic unity** - The human person as an integrated soul-body unity; not mere aggregate.
- **Substance dualism** - Classical view of soul as distinct substance; Cooper refines rather than rejects.
- **Hylomorphism** - Aristotelian form-matter schema; used contrastively to clarify Cooper's distinct dualistic-holistic posture.
- **Materialism / reductionism** - Opposing position critiqued for explanatory and theological inadequacy.
- **Mental causation** - Central philosophical problem: how non-reducible minds can have causal efficacy; Cooper affirms causally efficacious immaterial mental states within psychosomatic unity.
- **Personal identity** - Treated as essentially tied to an immaterial soul that secures continuity, while bodily continuity remains constitutive for resurrected life.
- **Resurrection continuity** - Theological desideratum: Cooper argues dualistic holism best preserves both personal continuity and bodily resurrection.
- **Imago Dei** - Used to argue for substantive uniqueness of human persons beyond mere physical complexity.
- **Immortality** - Distinguishes between inherent immortality of soul and eschatological bodily life; Cooper affirms personal survival as compatible with embodied resurrection.
- **Ontological priority** - Rejects strict material priority; asserts soul as ontologically central to personhood while not detachable from embodied existence.
- **Interactionism** - Endorses a form of mind-body interaction consistent with non-reductive mental causation.
- **Explanatory gap** - Philosophical problem cited against reductionist accounts.
- **Biblical anthropology** - Methodological locus where scripture constrains philosophical theorizing.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the term "dualistic holism" in theological anthropology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductive materialism in philosophy-of-religion contexts.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline and resurrection texts with an eye to personhood continuity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses pairing analytic philosophy of mind with evangelical doctrine on human nature.
