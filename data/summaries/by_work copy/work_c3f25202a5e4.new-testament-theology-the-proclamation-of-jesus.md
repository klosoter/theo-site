### TITLE
New Testament Theology: The Proclamation of Jesus - Joachim Jeremias

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century German Protestant scholarship (post‑war historical‑critical environment); English translation appeared in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Jeremias writes as a New Testament exegete steeped in Palestinian‑Jewish background studies and form/ tradition criticism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament's theological center is the kerygma - the proclamation of Jesus - not abstract system building. Theology must arise from the proclamation of Jesus Christ (his person, words, death, resurrection, and ongoing presence).
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Jeremia s proceeds from the proclamation (kerygma) as the primary theological datum.
 - Trace how the proclamation shapes Christology, soteriology, eschatology, and ecclesiology across NT genres.
 - Reconstruct Jesus' message against its Palestinian Jewish background and early church usage.
 - Treat sacramental and communal practice as expressions of the kerygma (e.g., Lord's Supper as enacted proclamation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages form/tradition critics and historical‑Jesus scholars (implicit and explicit contrasts with Bultmannian existentialism).
 - Uses Synoptic traditions, Pauline letters, Johannine material, early liturgical evidence and Palestinian Jewish parallels.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (Jesus as content and center of proclamation), **Kingdom of God**, **Eschatology/Parousia**, **Soteriology**, **Sacramental theology** (Lord's Supper presence and practice), **Ecclesiology** (koinonia, fencing/admission), and revelation as event rather than abstract proposition.
- **Closing line**
 - Theology that takes the New Testament seriously must follow the proclamation of Jesus as event and word - the kerygma shapes doctrine, worship, and boundary practices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Kerygma as methodological and theological priority**: Jeremias insists the proclamation is both the primary source and proper form of New Testament theology.
 - **Palestinian‑grounded exegesis**: frequent use of Aramaic idioms and Jewish praxis to recover the concrete meaning of sayings and rites.
 - **Praxis‑centric sacramental reading**: reads the Lord's Supper as enacted proclamation, communal presence, and eschatological meal rather than metaphysical speculation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against purely existential or demythologizing readings (e.g., radical Bultmannian reductions) by restoring historicity and liturgical embodiment to the kerygma.
 - Counters overly systematizing dogmatics by returning doctrine to the church's proclaiming life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reorients NT theology vocabulary around **proclamation** rather than abstract categories - theology as interpretive response to kerygmatic speech‑act.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected across evangelical and mainline circles as a readable, historically informed NT theology; used in sacramental debates for its balanced, practice‑oriented treatment.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a theologically serious, exegetically disciplined way to let proclamation drive doctrine; valuable for preaching, sacramental theology, and ecclesial formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma (proclamation)** - central datum; theology must be built from the church's proclaiming of Jesus.
- **Kingdom of God** - principal content of Jesus' proclamation; interpreted historically and eschatologically.
- **Christology** - emerges from proclamation: Jesus' person and work proclaimed as saving reality.
- **Eucharist / Lord's Supper** - read as communal proclamation and eschatological meal; sacramental presence is the proclamation made visible.
 - **Presence of Christ** - Jeremias emphasizes a real, communally mediated presence (spiritual/eschatological) rather than scholastic metaphysics.
- **Anamnesis** - the memorial character of the meal as active proclamation of past event into present salvation.
- **Parousia / Eschatology** - shapes communal identity and practices; kerygma points toward inaugurated yet awaiting Kingdom.
- **Koinonia (fellowship)** - ecclesial life structured by proclamation and sacramental sharing.
- **Fencing and admission** - boundary practices for the table; Jeremias notes early discipline as eschatological demarcation - who may partake expresses belonging to the proclaimed community.
- **Palestinian Judaism** - contextual matrix used to elucidate Jesus' sayings and early rituals.
- **Form and tradition criticism** - methodological backbone for tracing proclamation across communities.
- **Revelation as event** - revelation is proclamation enacted in history, not merely doctrinal proposition.
- **Narrative‑historical method** - combining narrative reconstruction with theological interpretation.
- **Table fellowship** - social and theological locus for proclamation, presence, and discipline.
- **Sacramental realism (qualified)** - affirms objective encounter with Christ in the meal while avoiding metaphysical jargon.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for linking proclamation, practice, and doctrine in NT studies.
- As a **definition source** for kerygma‑centered theology and for reading the Lord's Supper as enacted proclamation.
- As a **polemic resource** against depersonalized systematics and overly existential demythologizing approaches.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology and ecclesiology: grounds debates over **presence of Christ**, **table fencing**, and **admission** in the NT proclamation.
