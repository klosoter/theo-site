### TITLE
Union with Christ in the New Testament (2013) - Grant Macaskill

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Monograph published 2013 in the context of renewed New Testament interest in soteriology and participation language.
 - Aimed at bridging careful NT exegesis and systematic/doctrinal concerns in Reformed and broader evangelical scholarship.
 - Responds to late 20th-early 21st century debates (Sanders, Dunn, Wright, Hays) about Paulinism, justification, and participation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents **union with Christ** as a central, multi-dimensional reality of salvation; this union is primarily effected and sustained by the **Spirit** and is more than a mere forensic status - it is existential, ecclesial, sacramental and eschatological participation in Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lexical and syntactical survey of key NT phrases (eg. "in Christ", "with Christ", "joined to", "participation/koinonia").
 - Detailed exegesis of major loci: Pauline corpus (Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians), Johannine writings (esp. pneumatology and abiding imagery), and select synoptic and early catholic texts.
 - The Spirit is argued to be the primary agent who unites believers to Christ (not merely a subsequent indwelling), linking pneumatology to union-soteriology.
 - Integrates sacramental signs (baptism, Eucharist) and ecclesiology (body/head, vine/branches) as constitutive of how union is experienced and narrated.
 - Concludes by rehearsing theological implications for doctrine of justification, sanctification, and eschatology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Paul and John (NT texts).
 - Secondary interlocutors: scholarly voices such as James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright, Richard Hays, and recent Reformed systematicians (e.g. Murray, Bavinck) who treat union doctrinally.
 - Patristic and later Reformed reception occasionally referenced to show continuity and contrasts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central), Christology, Soteriology (justification and sanctification), Ecclesiology, Sacramentology, Eschatology, Covenant theology (implicit and explicit strands).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Macaskill proposes that union with Christ, effected by the Spirit, is the hermeneutical and soteriological center of the New Testament - a participatory, ecclesial, and sacramental reality that must shape theology beyond a purely forensic paradigm.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, sustained claim that the **Spirit is the indispensable agent of union** - not an add-on but the means by which believers are actually "in Christ."
 - Presents union as **multifaceted: relational, ontological (participation), sacramental, and eschatological**, resisting reduction to a single metaphor or category.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that reduce Pauline soteriology to only forensic/legal categories (strictly justification-by-declaration).
 - Pushes back against accounts that treat "in Christ" language as merely positional or metaphorical without ontological participation.
 - Dialogues critically with scholars who treat pneumatology as secondary to Christological formulations of salvation.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Emphasizes the semantic field of **koinonia/participation** and the priority of pneumatological verbs and imagery for understanding union.
 - Favors a **participationist** framing (believers participate in Christ's death, resurrection, life) rather than exclusivist forensic vocabulary.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in recent Reformed and evangelical treatments of union theology; influential for theologians seeking NT-based rehabilitation of union as doctrinal center.
 - Used by systematicians to re-anchor doctrinal treatments of soteriology and sacrament in NT exegesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological model for connecting close exegesis with doctrinal theology, especially for pneumatology-union integration.
 - A corrective resource for pastors and theologians wanting a robust, NT-grounded doctrine of union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - central category; multi-dimensional reality of being joined to Christ in death, resurrection, life.
- **In Christ / In him** - primary NT locution; Macaskill reads it as existential participation, not merely positional wording.
- **Koinonia (participation / communion)** - social and participatory concept framing corporate belonging and shared life with Christ.
- **Spirit as agent / Spirit and union with Christ** - the Spirit effects, constitutes, and sustains union; pneumatology is foundational for union-soteriology.
- **Baptism into Christ** - sacramental rite as the normative sign and means by which union is enacted and articulated.
- **Eucharist / sacramental participation** - the meal as ongoing expression and means of sustaining unional life.
- **Head/body imagery** - ecclesiological metaphor showing organic, constitutive unity with Christ as head.
- **Christ's death/resurrection participation** - soteriological content: believers share in Christ's saving work, not just its forensic benefits.
- **Eschatological present** - union is both present reality (already) and future consummation (not yet).
- **Justification and participation** - reframes justification within participatory union (legal declaration and participatory incorporation are related but distinct).
- **Sacramentality** - Macaskill emphasizes the concrete mediated means (baptism, Eucharist) through which union is given and experienced.
- **Covenantal language** - used to connect NT union themes with covenant theology without collapsing participation into only covenant status.
- **Abiding / perichoresis implications** - relational indwelling language used to describe ongoing mutuality between Christ, Spirit, and believer.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar for tracing "in Christ" language and pneumatological data across NT corpus.
 - As a **definition source & polemic**: foundational citation in systematic treatments defending a participatory, Spirit-centered account of union against forensic-only accounts.
