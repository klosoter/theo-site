### TITLE
**God in Creation: An Ecological Doctrine of Creation** (1985; Eng. 1985) - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Late 20th-century turn from political theology to ecological theology amid nuclear/ecological crises.
 - Continues Moltmanns trinitarian project (after The Trinity and the Kingdom), engaging Orthodoxy, Jewish thought, and modern science.
- **Central thesis**
 - A **trinitarian, panentheistic** doctrine of creation: God indwells creation in the **Spirit** (Shekinah), creation exists **in** God yet remains distinct, and the **Sabbath** is creation's goal and form of divine indwelling.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of classical theisms distance and dominion paradigms; retrieval of biblical and patristic motifs (Wisdom, Spirit, perichoresis).
 - **God's kenosis and space-making**: through self-limitation (zimzum), God grants creaturely freedom; perichoretic love grounds divine immanence without collapse into pantheism.
 - **Sabbath and Shekinah**: the seventh day is the telos of creation, God dwelling with creation in restful communion; creation as God's home.
 - **Pneumatological ontology**: the Spirit as the energy/field of life, the bond of the community of creation; providence as lifegiving presence rather than sheer control.
 - **Anthropology within the community of creation**: imago Dei as relational, priestly, and ecological vocation; dominion reinterpreted as service and communion.
 - **Sin and evil**: violence against the community of creation; natural evil and chaos within a creation granted relative autonomy; God suffers with creation.
 - **Eschatology**: new creation as consummated Sabbath; resurrection hope for all creatures; continuity/discontinuity framed by Spirit's renewing indwelling.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture (Gen 1-2; Ps 104; Prov 8; Rom 8; Col 1); Jewish traditions (Shekinah; Lurianic **zimzum**).
 - Patristic/medieval: Irenaeus, Athanasius, Maximus, Augustine, Aquinas.
 - Reformation and modern: Luther, Calvin, Barth, Pannenberg; dialogue with **process** thought (Whitehead/Hartshorne), Schelling, Hegel; conversation with natural sciences.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation in/through creation (pneumatological natural knowledge), **Trinity**, **creation ex nihilo** and continua, providence, anthropology and **imago Dei**, sin, covenant with all flesh (Noah), Sabbath, sacramentality/temple, theodicy, eschatology/new creation.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Creation as the indwelt home of the triune God, ordered to Sabbath communion in the Spirit, freeing and dignifying all creatures within a perichoretic love.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Sabbath as telos** of creation; not an appendix but the crown shaping time, worship, and ecology.
 - **Perichoretic panentheism**: in him we live and move; strict Creator-creature distinction retained while affirming real divine indwelling.
 - **Shekinah-Spirit** as lifegiving presence; cosmic temple theology.
 - **Community of creation** decentering anthropocentrism; ecological ethics as doctrinal entailment.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **classical omnipotence-as-control**: favors **kenotic power** and divine self-limitation.
 - Against deism and mechanism: emphasizes **immanence** and creaturely agency upheld by Spirit.
 - Against readings of dominion as domination: re-reads Gen 1-2 via priestly stewardship and communal reciprocity.
 - Engages but does not adopt **process** theism: rejects divine passibility-as-dependence while affirming divine suffering in love.
 - Nuances **Barth**: supplements christocentrism with robust pneumatology and attention to nature.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of **zimzum** in Christian doctrine of creation.
 - **Field/energy** metaphors for Spirit's presence.
 - **Ecological covenantal** reading (Noah; all flesh) and Sabbath as covenantal sign of creation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational in ecological theology, constructive trinitarianism, and creation care ethics.
 - Mixed Reformed reception: praised for Sabbath and covenant-of-creation emphases; critiqued for panentheistic idiom vis-a-vis simplicity/impassibility.
 - Stimulates dialogue with Orthodox sacramental cosmology and Jewish thought.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a **doctrinal grammar** for integrating Trinity, creation, ecology, and worship.
 - Provides categories to teach providence and theodicy without collapsing creaturely freedom or divine love.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Panentheism (perichoretic)**: creation is in God; avoids pantheistic identity and deistic separation.
 - Contrast: pantheism (identity) vs classical deism (distance).
- **Sabbath**: goal and form of creation; God's restful indwelling; ethical rhythm for human and nonhuman life.
- **Shekinah**: God's indwelling glory/presence; taken as pneumatological mode of immanence.
- **Kenosis**: divine self-emptying; shapes creation (space-making) and providence (non-coercive love).
- **Zimzum (tsimtsum)**: Jewish motif of divine contraction; heuristic for God's granting creaturely space.
- **Perichoresis**: trinitarian mutual indwelling grounding God-world relationality.
- **Community of creation**: all creatures in relational interdependence before God; basis for ecological ethics.
- **Imago Dei (relational/priestly)**: humanity as representative within creation, not sovereign over it.
- **Providence (pneumatological)**: Spirit's vivifying presence and cooperation; beyond mere concursus as control.
- **Creatio ex nihilo et continua**: origin and ongoing dependence; secured without collapsing freedom.
- **Theodicy / divine suffering**: God suffers with creation; evil framed within risk of freedom and hope of renewal.
- **Cosmic temple / sacramentality**: creation as the dwelling-place of God; liturgical/ecclesial implications.
- **Wisdom/Sophia**: biblical motif linking God's delight and artistry in creation; coordinates with Spirit.
- **Eschatological new creation**: consummated Sabbath; resurrection as pledge of material redemption.
- **Covenant with all flesh**: Noahic covenant universalized; grounds non-anthropocentric moral claims.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for ecological doctrine of creation and panentheistic grammar.
 - As a **polemic** against domination paradigms and control-based providence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for Sabbath theology, creation care, and covenant with all creatures.
 - As an **integration model** linking Trinity, pneumatology, anthropology, and eschatology across loci.
