### TITLE
**Bruce A. Ware, "Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility: Biblically and Theologically Inseparable," in Still Sovereign (2000).**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical defense of classical providence and compatibilist freedom.
 - Written amid renewed debate with Molinism (middle knowledge) and open theism; contributes to conservative Reformed responses to contemporary alternatives.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Divine sovereignty and human moral responsibility are both fully taught in Scripture and cannot be separated without serious theological cost.** Ware argues for classical compatibilism: God ordains and determines human choices while humans act willingly and are genuinely responsible.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural survey: texts (e.g., Romans 9, Acts 2:23, Ephesians 1:11, various OT passages) show both divine ordination and human culpability affirmed together.
 - Conceptual exposition: explicates compatibilist account of human freedom (willing desire + causal responsibility) vs. libertarian alternatives.
 - Critical engagement with Molinism:
 - Identifies Molinism's middle knowledge as an attempt to preserve libertarian freedom while keeping divine providence.
 - Argues middle knowledge makes God dependent on creaturely counterfactuals, thereby undermining biblical decree language and biblical portrayals of divine initiative.
 - Pastoral and theological implications: implications for prayer, evangelism, assurance, and theodicy when sovereignty and responsibility are rightly held together.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Main interlocutors: proponents of Molinism (e.g., William Lane Craig and Molina tradition generally) and, implicitly, open theists and libertarian defenders of free will.
 - Scriptural exegesis and Reformed doctrinal tradition (Augustine, Calvin, classic Reformed confessions) used as primary resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine decree, predestination/election, human freedom and responsibility, sin and divine permission/ordination, soteriology (implications), and theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - **Ware's theological center of gravity: the biblical witness requires a robust, non-contradictory synthesis in which God's comprehensive sovereign decree and genuine human moral responsibility cohere - a compatibilist posture that rejects middle knowledge as theologically defective.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that the two truths (sovereignty and responsibility) are *inseparable* in biblical thought; not merely compatible but woven together in Scripture's own language and logic.
 - Emphasis on the priority of divine decree language (God as active ordainer) rather than construing providence primarily as reactive selection among creaturely possibilities.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct corrective to Molinism: Ware stresses that middle knowledge implicitly reduces divine decree to contingency upon creaturely libertarian counterfactuals and thus is less biblical.
 - Rejects libertarian formulations that obligingly sever divine determinative causality in order to preserve libertarian freedom.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies compatibilist vocabulary for contemporary debate (e.g., distinguishing kinds of freedom, specifying how "willing" acts can be both caused and morally responsible).
 - Reasserts classical Reformed categories in contemporary idiom to address modern objections.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical defenses of compatibilism; used in pastoral, academic, and apologetic settings to rebut Molinist and open-theist positions.
 - Contributed to shaping subsequent defenses of classical sovereignty within American Reformed theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Clear model of integrating biblical exegesis with systematic argumentation on freedom and providence.
 - Useful pedagogically as a compact, polemically engaged articulation of compatibilist orthodoxy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's absolute, efficacious rule and ordaining decree over all events.
- **Human responsibility** - Moral accountability of persons for sinful and moral choices despite divine ordination.
- **Compatibilism** - The view that God's causal determination of choices is compatible with genuine human responsibility.
- **Libertarian freedom** - Freedom defined as uncaused alternative possibilities; Ware argues this is incompatible with biblical decree.
- **Middle knowledge (middle knowledge/Molinism)** - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any circumstance (counterfactuals); Ware critiques it for making God dependent on creaturely counterfactuals.
 - Contrast: Ware sees middle knowledge as weakening the biblical doctrine of decree.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** - Hypothetical propositions about what free agents would do; key locus of dispute with Molinists.
- **Divine decree/foreordination** - God's intentional, efficacious counsel by which all events come to pass.
- **Providence** - God's ongoing governance of creation, including concurrence and permission of sin.
- **Causal responsibility** - Explanation of how actions can be causally produced by motives/causes yet be morally blameworthy.
- **Permissive will vs. decretive will** - Distinction underscored to show God permits sin but also can ordain sinful events without being the author of sin.
- **Soteriological implications** - How sovereignty and responsibility inform election, calling, and assurance.
- **Biblical exegesis model** - Emphasis on reading texts (e.g., Romans 9, Acts 2:23) as simultaneous attestations to both sovereignty and culpability.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against Molinism/middle knowledge, articulating perceived theological pitfalls.
- As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed compatibilism and for teaching the coherence of decree and responsibility.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how to read key Pauline and apostolic texts to sustain classical providence.
