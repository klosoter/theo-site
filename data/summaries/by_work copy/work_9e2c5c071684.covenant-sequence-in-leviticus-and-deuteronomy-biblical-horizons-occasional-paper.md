### TITLE
Covenant Sequence in Leviticus and Deuteronomy (Biblical Horizons Occasional Paper) - James B. Jordan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-century Biblical Horizons series; situated within the broader milieu of post‑Reformation covenant theology, Christian Reconstructionist and Federal Vision conversations, and a rising interest in canonical and covenantal readings of the Pentateuch.
- **Central thesis:** Leviticus and Deuteronomy form a deliberate covenantal sequence in which cultic, juridical, and social dimensions of Israelite life are articulated and progressively organized; reading these books together exposes a single, corporate covenant polity that grounds Israelite identity and anticipates Messianic fulfillment.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Leviticus functions as the **cultic-covenantal constitution**: laws, sacrifices, purity regulations, and priestly ordinances configure corporate holiness and boundary markers for the covenant people.
 - Deuteronomy functions as the **renewal and public treaty**: rearticulation of covenant obligations in a suzerain‑vassal treaty idiom focused on national administration, monarchy, and covenant fidelity.
 - Together they display a sequence from ritual/priests (Levitical order) to public law and polity (Deuteronomic exhortation), showing continuity rather than fragmentation between cultic and civil spheres.
 - Typological/eschatological move: these structures point forward to Christ and the church as the covenant community that inherits and transforms Israel's covenant institutions.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged:** draws on treaty‑covenant models (Kline and Hittite suzerainty literature), canonical critics, and traditional Reformed covenant theologians; implicitly addresses dispensationalists and those separating cultic and moral law.
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant theology, law (ceremonial/civil/moral integration), atonement and sacrifice, ecclesiology (corporate identity and polity), typology/fulfillment, revelation (canonical shape).
- **Closing line:** Jordan's theological center of gravity is **covenantal continuity**-Sinai's legal‑cultic matrix is the formative constitution for Israel (and, analogically, the church), with Leviticus and Deuteronomy forming a purposeful sequence that anchors corporate, sacramental, and typological interpretation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Emphasizes **sequence** (not mere collection): Leviticus → Deuteronomy as a staged covenant constitution rather than isolated law codes.
 - Treats the cultic system as juridical and constitutional, not merely ritualistic.
 - Strong accent on corporate, national covenant identity (monocovenantal posture).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against readings that segregate "ceremonial" law from "moral" law; resists dispensational bifurcation of Israel and church.
 - Refines Klinean treaty models by stressing ceremonial/priestly elements as integrative rather than incidental.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Uses language of "covenant sequence" and "cultic constitution" to reframe Leviticus as foundational to Israelite polity.
 - Deploys monocovenantal categories to argue for one unfolding covenant economy across redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in circles sympathetic to Federal Vision, Christian Reconstruction, and canonical covenant readings; used by pastors and scholars favoring integrated covenant polity.
 - Criticized by mainstream Reformed and evangelical scholars for perceived ecclesiological overreach and for association with controversial Federal Vision claims.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provocative exegetical model encouraging canonical, liturgical, and polity readings of the Pentateuch.
 - Useful corrective to fragmented treatments of law; stimulates discussions on sacramentality and corporate identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant sequence:** the argumentative and canonical progression from Levitical cult to Deuteronomic public covenant.
- **Cultic constitution:** the idea that priestly ordinances function as a polity‑forming legal framework.
- **Monocovenantalism:** theological stance affirming one overarching covenant people across redemptive history (Israel → church continuity).
- **Suzerain‑vassal / treaty model:** diplomatic structure used to interpret Deuteronomy as a covenant treaty document.
- **Corporate personality:** corporate identity of Israel as a single covenant entity with collective responsibilities and penalties.
- **Ceremonial‑civic integration:** refusal to sharply divide cultic/ceremonial laws from civil/moral obligations.
- **Typological fulfillment:** reading Israel's institutions as shadows that point to Christ and the church's covenant life.
- **Covenant renewal:** rhetorical and ritual motifs of recommitment (central in Deuteronomy) that govern national reformation.
- **Sacrificial atonement (ritual juridical function):** sacrifice as both cultic worship and legal means of corporate atonement.
- **Boundary/clean‑unclean symbolism:** social and theological markers for inclusion in the covenant community.
- **Canonical context:** treating Leviticus and Deuteronomy within the final shape of the Pentateuch as formative.
- **Polity/sacramental theology:** implications for church governance and sacramental practice derived from Israelite covenant forms.
- **Lex talionis in corporate terms:** punitive structure that maintains covenant order in a corporate setting.
- **Redeemer‑king motif:** connection of covenant law to Messianic kingship and eschatological restoration.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Leviticus and Deuteronomy canonically and as a programmatic covenant sequence.
- As a **definition source / polemical tool** in debates against dispensational separation and for monocovenantal readings.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for discussions of ecclesiology, sacramental polity, and the continuity of law and covenant in Reformed thought.
