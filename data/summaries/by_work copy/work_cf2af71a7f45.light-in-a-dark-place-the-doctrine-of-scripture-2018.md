### TITLE
Light in a Dark Place: The Doctrine of Scripture (2018) - John S. Feinberg

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2018 within conservative Reformed-evangelical circles; written by an analytic-minded theologian trained in both systematic theology and philosophy.
 - Responds to late 20th-21st century pressures on the doctrine of Scripture: historical-critical skepticism, postmodern hermeneutics, neo-orthodoxy, and internal evangelical disputes over inerrancy and authority.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the authoritative, reliable, God‑given "light" that can correct and guide fallen human reason and will. The book defends classical Protestant commitments (inspiration, authority, sufficiency, perspicuity, canonicity) while showing how Scripture addresses human moral and cognitive darkness (including sin and corrupted will).

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Traces biblical and theological bases for revelation and inspiration, defending a robust propositional view of biblical testimony.
 - Articulates Scripture's authority and sufficiency for faith and life, arguing that divine illumination and the Spirit‑enabled reading are necessary because of human sinfulness.
 - Treats hermeneutical principles: literal/grammatical interpretation, theological-linguistic coherence, and the role of historical context.
 - Applies doctrine of Scripture to pastoral and apologetic concerns: how Scripture negates idolatry of autonomy and reforms the will.
 - Concludes with implications for church life, preaching, and theological method.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on classical Protestant writers (e.g., B. B. Warfield, Calvin), contemporary evangelical scholars, and analytic philosophers of religion.
 - Positions itself against theological liberalism, some postliberal/postmodern approaches, and views that downgrade propositional content of Scripture.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, perspicuity, inerrancy/authority, canon, illumination, hermeneutics; intersects with anthropology (sin), soteriology (regeneration), and epistemology (divine testimony).

- **Closing line**
 - Feinberg locates Scripture as the decisive, Spirit‑mediated light that exposes sin, reforms the will, and grounds Christian knowledge in a dark age of epistemic and moral confusion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The central metaphor - Scripture as "light in a dark place" - frames doctrine as both epistemic (knowledge) and moral (confronting sin).
 - Strong integration of analytic precision with pastoral concern: careful argumentation plus attention to how sin impairs reading and assent.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against anti-propositional or purely narrative readings that sideline doctrinal truth-claims.
 - Critiques both liberal reductionism and caricatured fundamentalism by holding to inerrant authority while insisting on responsible hermeneutics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the noetic‑moral dimension of Scripture's role: Scripture not only tells but heals ways of knowing distorted by sin.
 - Frames illumination as cooperative: Spirit-enabled assent that interacts with human faculties weakened by sin and shaped by received testimony.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, contemporary restatement of classical doctrines of Scripture.
 - Adopted as a teaching and apologetic resource for pastors and seminary students; cited in debates over inerrancy and biblical authority.

- **Enduring value**
 - A concise, accessible synthesis that connects doctrine of Scripture to pastoral practice and to doctrines of sin and human freedom; valuable for doctrine, hermeneutics, and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation**
 - Divine self‑disclosure embodied in Scripture; both propositional and personal (Word and Word‑Incarnate correlated).
- **Inspiration**
 - The Holy Spirit's superintendence producing Scripture's divine authority and trustworthiness.
- **Inerrancy / truthfulness**
 - Scripture as reliable in all that it affirms; Feinberg defends robust truth‑claims against skeptical readings.
- **Authority**
 - Scripture's normative rule over belief, conscience, and the reformation of the will.
- **Sufficiency**
 - Scripture contains all necessary knowledge for salvation and godly living; complements but does not replace other sources of knowledge.
- **Perspicuity (clarity)**
 - Core teachings are accessible to ordinary readers when Scripture is read in faith and under the Spirit's guidance.
- **Illumination**
 - The Spirit's enabling of understanding and assent; crucial because of human sin's effects on cognition.
 - Directly tied to the topic of Sin And Free Will: sin impairs understanding and will, so illumination helps correct noetic blindness and willful resistance.
- **Canon**
 - The closed corpus of authoritative Scripture; criterion for theological claims.
- **Hermeneutics**
 - Grammatical-historical method with theological synthesis; resists relativistic readings.
- **Noetic effects of sin**
 - Sin distorts intellect and will; Scripture functions diagnostically and therapeutically.
- **Free will**
 - Treated within a Reformed frame: human responsibility and constrained freedom; Scripture judges and reshapes the will via grace.
 - Feinberg's approach presumes compatibilist-style accountability (will is real but affected by sin and sovereign grace).
- **Propositional revelation**
 - Emphasis on truth‑bearing statements grounded in divine authorship.
- **Pastoral application**
 - How Scripture ministers to the sinner's cognition and volition; central to preaching and catechesis.

- How this work is used across loci
 - **Definition source**: Clear statement of classic evangelical/Reformed doctrine of Scripture for systematic theology syllabi.
 - **Polemic**: Resource against anti‑propositional and liberal readings of Scripture.
 - **Exegetical model / pastoral theology**: A bridge between careful hermeneutic method and pastoral concern for the reader's sinful will and need for illumination.
