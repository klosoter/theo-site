### TITLE
Repent or Perish - John H. Gerstner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th-century Reformed evangelical context; Gerstner wrote as a confessional Presbyterian theologian and homiletician reacting against pietistic decisionism, theological liberalism, and diluted evangelism.
 - Pastoral-polemical tract aimed at clergy and evangelists as much as lay readers; shaped by historic Calvinism and revival-era emphases.
- **Central thesis**
 - Repentance is an uncompromising, immediate divine demand whose neglect results in eternal perdition; genuine repentance presupposes sovereign, effectual grace because fallen humans are totally depraved and unable to repent on their own.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: human sinfulness is total - moral corruption extends to will and affections (Total Depravity / Total Inability).
 - Command: Scripture continuously and authoritatively commands repentance now - it is not optional nor merely evidential.
 - Means: Only sovereign, effectual grace effects true repentance (sovereign calling, regeneration).
 - Promise and threat: The refusal to repent draws God's final condemnation - clear connection to Final Judgment and Eternal States.
 - Practical: Pastors must preach law and gospel distinctly, warn of hell, and call for repentance without minimizing grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Roots in Calvin, the Reformed confessions, Puritan homiletics, and Jonathan Edwards; dialogical opposition to Arminian/decisionist emphases, liberal reinterpretations of judgment, and universalist tendencies.
 - Scripture is primary authority; uses historical orthodox exegesis and pastoral examples.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (total depravity, inability, effectual calling, regeneration, justification)
 - Eschatology (final judgment, eternal states, hell)
 - Homiletics and pastoral theology (law/gospel distinction, evangelistic method)
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: the necessity of repentance grounded in both the depth of human depravity and the certainty of final judgment, redeemed only by sovereign grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Unapologetic insistence that preaching must both provoke repentance and teach sovereign grace; urgency without moralism.
 - A pastoral theology that refuses to privatize or domesticate the doctrine of hell: eschatological warning is integral to evangelism.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters decisionism that treats conversion as humanly initiated; counters liberal and universalist trends that neutralize final condemnation.
 - Reclaims Puritan clarity on repentance against modern sentimentalism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tight pairing of "repentance" and "perish" as a paradigmatic framing: repentance is not merely evidence of grace but the commanded, present duty whose refusal brings perdition.
 - Emphasizes "inability" not as impotency to act morally in general but as incapacity to will true turning to God without sovereign regenerative work.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a homiletical model and polemic; prized for clarity and pastoral bluntness.
 - Criticized by Arminian and progressive theologians for alleged determinism and for emphasis on hell in evangelical practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact manual linking historic Reformed soteriology to urgent pastoral practice; valuable for homiletics, evangelistic strategy, and soteriological instruction.
