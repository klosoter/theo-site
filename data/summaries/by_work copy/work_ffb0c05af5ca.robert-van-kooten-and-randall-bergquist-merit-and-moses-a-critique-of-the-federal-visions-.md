### TITLE
Robert van Kooten and Randall Bergquist (eds.), Merit and Moses: A Critique of the Federal Vision's Covenant Theology - review/essay by **Andrew M. Elam**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed controversy over the **Federal Vision (FV)** movement; debates in PCA/OPC and broader evangelical-Reformed fora about covenant, justification, sacraments, and ecclesiology.
 - The volume collects confessional Reformed responses; Elam's essay situates within a post-FV corrective literature that appeals to historic Reformed standards (Westminster, classical Calvinism).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - FV's reconfiguration of covenantal relations - especially claims about **merit** (in Christ and in covenant life) and a **republication** of the covenant of works in Moses - undermines the Reformed doctrine of **justification by faith alone** and collapses the forensic-imputational distinction between justification and sanctification.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Precise statement of FV positions: how key proponents articulate **merit**, **covenant faithfulness**, and the Mosaic covenant.
 - Historical-theological examination: contrast FV claims with classical Reformed formulations (Calvin, Westminster Standards, Covenant of Works/Grace schema).
 - Exegetical critique: key Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians), and covenant texts (Deuteronomy, Leviticus), showing FV reading forces problematic conflations of law/gospel.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: demonstrate how FV semantics (merit, faithfulness) generate pastoral and soteriological confusion - e.g., grounds of assurance, nature of sacraments, church membership/discipline.
 - Pastoral/ecclesial implications: critique of sacramental and disciplinary practices that flow from FV anthropology and covenant theory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages FV proponents (movement leaders and spokesmen) and their interpreters; dialogues with classical Reformed theologians (Calvin, Westminster divines), and modern critics.
 - Scriptural warrant marshalled from Pauline epistles, Pentateuchal covenant texts, and pastoral epistles.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant theology**, **justification**, **imputation vs impartation**, **merit**, **Mosaic covenant/republished covenant of works**, **sanctification**, **sacraments/ecclesiology**, and **assurance**.
- **Closing line**
 - Elam locates the book's theological center of gravity: a vigorous defense of forensic justification and confessional covenant theology against an FV revision that risks confusing merit, obedience, and the ground of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp focus on the language of **merit**: careful parsing of whether FV attributes "merit" to believers' covenant obedience, to Christ's active obedience, or to covenant relationship - and why each option threatens sola fide.
 - Emphasis on continuity with **confessional formulations** as the corrective measure, not merely ad hoc exegetical rebuttal.
- **Corrections/contrasts to FV**
 - Reasserts a two-covenant framework functionally (covenant of works vs. covenant of grace) while guarding against collapsing forensic and moral dimensions of salvation.
 - Rejects **republication** claims that read the Mosaic covenant as a re-imposition of works-pronouncements for covenant standing.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Distinguishes **merit (condign, intrinsic)** vs **reward/disciplinary fruit** vs **Christ's alien righteousness (imputed merit)** - aiming to clarify debate-loaded vocabulary.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by confessional opponents of FV as a succinct exegetical and systematic resource; used in denominational reports and seminary syllabi addressing post-FV controversies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined interplay of history, exegesis, and confessional theology; useful for teaching on covenant theology, justification, and controversies around law/gospel distinctions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal Vision (FV)** - movement critiqued; shorthand for a cluster of covenantal & ecclesiological proposals that emphasize covenant faithfulness and communal covenantal identity.
- **Merit** - central contested term; Elam distinguishes:
 - **Christ's merit** (alien/active obedience imputed to believers),
 - **merit as reward** (appropriate fruit of obedience), and
 - **merit as ground** (illegitimately ascribed to believer's covenant obedience).
- **Covenant of Works** - classical Reformed category; Elam defends its role as prelapsarian covenant and as doctrinal foil to FV republication claims.
- **Covenant of Grace** - single covenant centered in Christ; Elam insists FV threatens its forensic character.
- **Republication** - the thesis that Mosaic law republishes the covenant of works; Elam critiques its exegetical and theological force.
- **Imputation vs Impartation** - forensic transfer of righteousness (imputation) contrasted with sanctifying presence/effect (impartation); Elam defends clear distinction.
- **Justification** - forensic declaration by God; treated as non-merit-based and sola fide; Elam defends this against FV's faithfulness emphases.
- **Sanctification** - progressive, covenantal obedience; Elam argues FV blurs its relation to justification.
- **Faith vs Faithfulness** - faith as trust counted for righteousness vs faithfulness as covenantal perseverance; central to dispute over grounds of justification.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - locus for republication debate; Elam reads it functionally as covenant law within salvation-history but not as reinstitution of works-grounded standing.
- **Forensic language** - Elam insists on retaining forensic/doctrinal vocabulary in soteriology.
- **Assurance** - treated as doctrinal casualty if merit/faithfulness displace sola fide.
- **Sacraments & Ecclesiology** - examined as institutional consequences of covenant theology.
- **Works Principle** - the idea that obedience can ground covenant standing; rejected when applied to justification.

How this work is used:
- As a **polemic** and confessional corrective against FV.
- As a **definition source** for confessional distinctions (imputation, merit, republication).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and Mosaic covenants within classical Reformed theology.
- As a **teaching aid** for seminary courses on covenant theology and controversies.
