### TITLE
**Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview** - Meredith G. Kline (developed from mid-late 20th c. lecture notes; first published 2000; rev. 2006). A Vosian Reformed biblical-theological reading of Genesis as the covenantal prologue to the kingdom of God.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Emerges from Westminster/Gordon-Conwell classrooms within conservative Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Engages ANE treaty studies and Vosian redemptive-historical method; counters dispensational and theonomic trajectories; debates creationism and Mosaic covenant frameworks.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis functions as the canonical prologue to the divine kingdom: creation is a temple-prologue under a covenant of works, the fall entails common grace history, and the Abrahamic-Mosaic economies constitute a typological theocracy intruding the final judgment and rest. Christ, the last Adam, consummates the covenantal kingdom eschatologically.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Creation as temple: the Glory-Spirit theophany, Sabbath as eschatological sign, image-son kingship under covenant.
 - Probation and covenant of works: sanctions focused in the tree-testing; merit-principle defined archetypically in Adam and eschatologically in Christ.
 - Fall and common grace: Noahic covenant establishes a restrained civil-cultural order distinct from the holy redemptive kingdom.
 - Patriarchal promises: oath, circumcision as judgment-consecration sign; typology and election by grace.
 - Mosaic theocracy: republication of works principle for Israel s tenure in the land; holy war as intrusion ethics; Decalogue and treaty form.
 - Typology to Christ: temple-mountain motif, priest-king office, new creation Sabbath consummation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive: Geerhardus Vos, Calvin, Westminster Standards; ANE treaty scholars (Mendenhall, McCarthy).
 - Critical dialogue: Dispensationalism (disjunctions), Theonomy (civil law continuity), Young-earth literalism (calendar-day readings), various anti-merit proposals within Reformed circles.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology and canon (treaty-canon form).
 - Covenant theology (works, grace, common grace; republication).
 - Anthropology and creation (imago Dei, cultural mandate, upper/lower register cosmology).
 - Eschatology (Sabbath rest, intrusion, typology, new creation).
 - Christology (second Adam, active obedience, temple fulfillment).
 - Soteriology (law-gospel, imputation, oath-sanctions).
- **Closing line**
 - The book s center of gravity: God the Suzerain advances his temple-kingdom by covenant from protological glory to eschatological consummation in Christ, with Israel s theocracy as a time-bound typological intrusion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Glory-Spirit** as archetypal theophany shaping temple, Sabbath, and eschatology.
 - **Temple-mountain** cosmology of Eden and Zion unifying Scripture.
 - **Canonical/treaty prologue**: Genesis and Exodus 20 as covenantal prologue frames.
 - **Republication** of the works principle at Sinai for typological land tenure.
 - **Intrusion ethics**: holy war and imprecations as provisional anticipations of final judgment.
 - **Upper/lower register** and **framework** reading of creation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **theonomy**: Mosaic civil sanctions are non-transgenerational intrusions.
 - Against **dispensationalism**: one redemptive plan; Israel s typology leads to Christ.
 - Against **flattened nature-grace** or transformationalist conflations: distinguishes **common grace** culture from holy kingdom.
 - Clarifies **merit**: affirms a real works principle for Adam and Christ while safeguarding sola gratia in redemption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Intrusion ethics; republication; Glory-cloud; oath-sign; canonical prologue; upper/lower register; ordeal by judgment.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Westminster West circles (law-gospel, two kingdoms, typology); catalyzed OPC/PCA discussions on republication.
 - Contested by theonomic and some neo-Calvinist and young-earth sectors; widely mined for temple and covenant exegesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - A dense, cohesive template for reading Genesis and the Mosaic economy; equips pastors and scholars to relate covenant, temple, Sabbath, and eschatology to Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Glory-Spirit (Glory-cloud)**: Archetypal theophany that structures temple presence, guidance, and judgment; from Eden to Sinai to Christ and Pentecost.
- **Temple-mountain**: Eden, Zion, and the eschatological mount as one architectural-theological line; sacred space as cosmos-in-miniature.
- **Covenant of works**: Adamic probation under a works principle oriented to eschatological Sabbath life; fulfilled by Christ s active obedience.
- **Republication**: Mosaic re-expression of the works principle, not for eternal salvation, but for Israel s typological land tenure and theocratic order.
 - Distinguish: salvific grace runs through all ages by promise; works principle regulates the theocracy s typology.
- **Common grace covenant (Noahic)**: Post-fall stabilization of history and culture, securing a non-holy civil sphere distinct from redemptive kingdom holiness.
- **Intrusion ethics**: Provisional in-breaking of final judgment/holiness in Israel s holy war and sanctions; non-normative for common civil ethics.
- **Oath-sign**: Sacramental signs as oath-sanctions (e.g., circumcision as curse-consecration) sealing covenant commitments.
- **Canonical/treaty prologue**: Genesis (with Exod 20:2) as God s historical prologue identifying the Suzerain and his benefits as the basis for covenant stipulations.
- **Upper/lower register**: Distinction between the archetypal divine register and the creaturely historical register; undergirds framework reading of Gen 1.
- **Framework interpretation**: Literary-architectural structure of the creation week to teach temple and time theology rather than strict chronology.
- **Ordeal by judgment**: Flood, exodus plagues, and holy war as divine trials prefiguring final judgment.
- **Sabbath eschatology**: Seventh day as sign of consummation; drives biblical theology from creation to new creation.
- **Typology**: God-ordained correspondences from patriarchal and Mosaic forms to Christ and the church; Israel as microcosm-kingdom.
- **Image-son kingship**: Humanity as vicegerent under covenant, oriented to consecrated dominion in communion with God.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for covenant structures (works/grace/common grace) and treaty-canon bibliology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Genesis, temple, Sabbath, and Mosaic law within redemptive history.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for law-gospel, republication, and two-kingdoms distinctions in ethics and ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic touchstone** against theonomy, dispensationalism, and strict young-earth chronologies.
