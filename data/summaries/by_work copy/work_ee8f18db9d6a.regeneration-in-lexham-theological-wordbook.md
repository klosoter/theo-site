### TITLE
Regeneration - Lexham Theological Wordbook (entry by James M. Hamilton Jr.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed milieu; part of the Lexham Theological Wordbook project (popular reference for pastors, students, and scholars).
 - Author James M. Hamilton Jr.: biblical-theological scholar emphasizing canonical and NT usage; writes within conservative, Reformed-evangelical horizons.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Regeneration is the Spirit's sovereign, decisive impartation of new spiritual life to the dead sinner - the necessary ontological reversal that makes faith and repentance possible.
 - Distinguishes regeneration from related soteriological categories (faith, justification, sanctification, indwelling) to correct popular conflations.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Lexical and biblical survey: tracks Hebraic and Greek language (e.g., "born again/born from above," palingenesia, "quickened") and canonical loci (John 3; Titus 3:5; Ephesians 2; 2 Corinthians 5).
 - Theological synthesis: regeneration as Godward action by the Holy Spirit, not merely a human decision or moral improvement.
 - Regeneration precedes and enables saving faith in the Reformed ordering of salvation (ordo salutis) presented.
 - Explains how regeneration relates to indwelling: regeneration is the bringing-to-life; indwelling is the resultant (and ongoing) presence of the Spirit.
 - Pastoral implications: emphasizes necessity of God-initiated new birth for genuine conversion and assurance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Bible passages: John 3; Titus 3:5; Ephesians 2:1-5; Romans 8; 2 Corinthians 5; 1 John.
 - Historical touchpoints: Augustine/Calvin (sovereignty of grace), Reformed ordo salutis tradition; contrasts with Wesleyan/Arminian emphases on prevenient grace and human cooperation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (the Spirit's agency)
 - Soteriology (regeneration within the ordo salutis; relation to faith, repentance, justification)
 - Anthropology (deadness in sin; new nature)
 - Ecclesiology and pastoral theology (assurance, conversion ministry)

- **Closing line**
 - Regeneration, as Hamilton frames it, is the Spirit's sovereign act that ontologically recreates the sinner so that faith, repentance, and union with Christ can occur - the foundational reversal on which all other elements of saving grace rest.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strongly biblico-theological: grounds definition in canonical and lexical patterns rather than primarily in systematic categories.
 - Clear care to separate regeneration from indwelling and other soteriological moments without severing their functional relationship.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects common evangelical conflation that treats regeneration as identical with conversion or as simply an experiential turning of the will.
 - Contrasts with Wesleyan/Arminian models that place prevenient grace or human response prior to the new birth in the causal sequence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced wording emphasizing regeneration as "ontological quickening" - a technical way to mark it as a substantive impartation of life (not merely relational or forensic change).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and broader conservative evangelical circles as a compact, pastorally useful, and exegetically attentive entry.
 - Frequently cited in teaching contexts for clear distinctions within the ordo salutis and for pastoral clarity on new birth language.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to flattening of soteriological categories; solid bridge between biblical exegesis and systematic usage for classroom and pulpit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regeneration (palingenesia; new birth)**
 - The Spirit's act of imparting new spiritual life to the dead sinner; foundational ontological change.

- **New birth / born again (anothen / gennao)**
 - Johannine language emphasizing being "born from above" and the necessity of being "born of the Spirit" (John 3).

- **Quickening**
 - Scriptural idiom (Eph 2:1,5) denoting being made alive; used to underscore vivification rather than mere reform.

- **Holy Spirit (agent of regeneration)**
 - The divine actor who effectuates the new creation; distinct from moral influence or merely inspiring.

- **Indwelling (of the Spirit)**
 - The Spirit's abiding presence in believers; related to but distinguishable from the initial act of regeneration-regeneration brings life, indwelling is ongoing presence and relationship.

- **Ordo salutis / effectual calling**
 - Placement of regeneration in the Reformed order: effectual calling and regeneration precede and enable faith and repentance.

- **Conversion**
 - Complex of faith, repentance, and turning; regeneration is treated as the enabling root rather than synonymous with conversion.

- **New creation**
 - Pauline motif (2 Cor 5:17) used to articulate the qualitative change that regeneration effects in a person.

- **Prevenient grace (contrast)**
 - Term used to contrast Arminian/Wesleyan emphasis that graces enabling response precede regeneration; Hamilton argues for divine precedence.

- **Assurance and witness of the Spirit**
 - Practical consequence: regeneration grounds pastoral assurances (see Romans 8, 1 John).

- **Titus 3:5 (washing of regeneration)**
 - Key locus for linking regeneration to renewal and sanctifying work of the Spirit.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source**: concise, biblically rooted definition for theological dictionaries, classroom lectures, and sermon outlines.
- **Exegetical model**: model for reading New Testament texts on new birth as ontological vivification by the Spirit.
- **Polemic/pedagogical tool**: frequently cited in debates with Arminian/Wesleyan accounts to defend regeneration-first ordering and the necessity of sovereign Spirit-work.
