### TITLE
**Anselm of Canterbury, Monologion (c. 1076): A rational ascent from participated goods to the simple Triune Good**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context.** Written at the Abbey of Bec at his monks request; early scholastic, monastic milieu in 11th-century Normandy; paired with the later Proslogion. Method: arguments sola ratione, bracketing Scripture while remaining within catholic orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem.** From the graded plurality of goods we can reason to a single **Supreme Nature** that is **Goodness Itself**; its attributes follow from its supremacy and simplicity; creation is by participation in divine ideas; the Trinity is intelligible by Word and Love without denying unity.
- **Core argument or structure.**
 - From degrees of goodness and being to one **Good Itself** and **Being Itself** as the source of all participated goods.
 - From supremacy to **simplicity, aseity, eternity, immutability, omnipotence, omniscience**; predications are many, but reality is one.
 - **Exemplarism:** creatures exist through participation in divine ideas; creation is ex nihilo and ordered to the Supreme Good.
 - **Trinity via psychological analogy:** the Supreme Mind conceives a perfect **Word** (Son) and breathes **Love** (Spirit); processions are real relations within the one essence.
 - **Truth, justice, mercy** are harmonized in God; divine goodness is self-diffusive and rectifying.
 - Ethical and contemplative telos: beatitude arises from loving the Supreme Good.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors.** Heavily Augustinian (mind-word-love, exemplar ideas); engages Boethian metaphysics; uses Neoplatonic participation; background consonant with Nicene and Chalcedonian orthodoxy, though Scripture is not the argumentative base.
- **Doctrines treated.** Existence and knowability of God; divine simplicity and perfections; creation and participation; Trinity (including a rational ground for the filioque); nascent Christology by way of Word theology; divine justice and mercy in nuce.
- **Closing line.** The work centers on this claim: **reason can ascend from participated goods to the one, simple Triune Good whose self-knowledge and love ground all being and beatitude.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations.**
 - Sola ratione meditation ordered to faith seeking understanding.
 - Argument from **gradation** to a necessary, most-high Good.
 - Strong **simplicity**: attributes are not parts; perfections are identical with the divine essence.
 - **Psychological analogy** for the Trinity: Word and Love as eternal processions.
 - **Exemplarism**: divine ideas in the Word pattern creation.
- **Corrections or contrasts.**
 - Corrects Platonism by locating forms in God, not alongside God.
 - Guards against tritheism by rooting plurality in relations of origin within simplicity.
 - Clarifies omnipotence as inability to defect; not a will above reason, but rectitude.
 - Distinct from Proslogion: many convergent arguments rather than a single argument.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations.**
 - Supreme Nature, Good Itself; participation idiom harnessed to simplicity.
 - Generation vs creation distinction sharpened to protect consubstantiality.
 - Justice-mercy harmony that seeds later satisfaction logic.
- **Reception and influence.**
 - Foundational for Latin natural theology; mined by Lombard, Bonaventure; nuanced by Aquinas.
 - Cited in Reformed orthodox accounts of **simplicity, aseity, exemplar ideas**, and as a rational support for the **filioque**.
 - Serves as metaphysical scaffold for Christology and for Cur Deus Homo on atonement.
- **Enduring value.**
 - Durable template for arguing **existence and knowability of God**.
 - Teaches how to speak many perfections of the one simple God.
 - Offers a rational, creed-consonant sketch of Trinity and Word that supports **Chalcedon** and Christological impeccability.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Supreme Nature / Highest Good.** Necessary, maximal being from which all finite goods derive.
- **Good Itself vs good by participation.** God is per se goodness; creatures are good insofar as they share in Him.
- **Simplicity.** God is not composed; essence identical with attributes.
 - Plural predications name one reality under multiple aspects.
- **Aseity / Necessary existence.** From Himself, of none; cannot not be.
- **Exemplarism / Divine ideas.** Created things patterned by archetypes in the divine Word.
- **Word (Verbum).** Gods perfect self-understanding; the Son, eternally generated, consubstantial.
- **Love / Spirit.** Personal Love proceeding from Father and Son; rational basis for the **filioque**.
- **Generation vs creation.** Eternal begetting within God is not making; safeguards homoousios.
- **Truth and rectitude.** Right order of intellect and will; in God identical with His essence.
- **Justice and mercy.** Non-competitive perfections; ground later accounts of satisfaction and pardon.
- **Omnipotence and impeccability.** Non posse peccare as perfection; underwrites the impeccability of the incarnate Word.
- **Impassibility and hypostatic union.** A simple, immutable Word can assume a human nature without change, preserving two natures in one person.
- **Two natures, one person.** Word theology coheres with the **Chalcedonian** Definition.
- **Knowability by reason.** Analogical, limited; confirms and clarifies the ecumenical creeds.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Theology Proper: definitional source for simplicity, aseity, attributes, exemplar causality.
 - Trinity: conceptual pivot for relations of origin and filioque within unity.
 - Christology: metaphysical ground for hypostatic union and Christ s impeccability consonant with Chalcedon.
 - Atonement: prolegomenon to Cur Deus Homo, rooting satisfaction in divine justice and mercy.
