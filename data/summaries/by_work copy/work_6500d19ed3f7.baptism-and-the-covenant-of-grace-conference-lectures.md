### TITLE
Baptism and the Covenant of Grace (conference lectures) - Gregg Strawbridge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed conference lectures aimed at pastors, elders, and seminarians; situated within late 20th/early 21st-century Reformed covenantal renewal movements that revisit classical paedobaptist convictions in pastoral and polemical contexts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Baptism belongs to the covenantal economy as the sign and seal of the Covenant of Grace; properly understood it marks covenant membership (including infants of believing parents), conveys covenant promises without functioning as automatic regeneration, and should be defended against credobaptist and overly sacramentalist distortions.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical groundwork: Old Testament circumcision as the antecedent sign of the covenant; New Testament alignment of baptism with that sign (esp. household baptisms, Pauline typology).
 - Theological scaffolding: Definition of sacrament as "sign and seal" within Reformed covenant theology; baptism and covenantal promise; role of federal headship and covenant succession.
 - Polemical engagement: Critique of credobaptist emphasis on personal profession as sole criterion for baptism; critique of baptismal regeneration in its overt forms.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: corporate identity of the church, catechesis of covenant children, discipline and nurture; guidance on mode and administration as secondary matters.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Genesis-Acts-Pauline corpus), classical Reformed sources (Westminster Confession, Heidelberg Catechism), Augustine and Calvin for sacramental doctrine; modern interlocutors include contemporary Baptist critics and recent Reformed sacramentalians; appeals to historical practice (household baptisms, infant baptism in patristic and medieval contexts).
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (Covenant of Grace), sacraments (sign and seal), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, membership), soteriology (regeneration, faith), typology (circumcision-baptism), pastoral theology (catechesis, nurture).
- **Closing line:** Baptism must be read covenantally: as the sign-seal of God's promises to his covenant people - including their children - that calls for covenantal nurture and disciplinary life, while stopping short of treating the sign as an automatic instrument of regeneration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reasserts **covenantal inclusion** as primary: baptism marks entry into the covenant community (paralleling circumcision) rather than merely expressing prior personal faith.
 - Strongly distinguishes **baptismal efficacy** (the sign conveys covenant promises and obligations) from **baptismal regeneration** (immediate impartation of new life), rejecting the latter while affirming covenantal blessing.
 - Emphasizes pastoral catechesis: baptism creates obligations for the believing household and church to raise children in covenant faith, not merely a formalism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects credobaptist reductive voluntarism by situating baptism within covenantal continuity and household Scripture examples.
 - Counters sacramental excess by denying that baptism automatically effects salvation; insists on union with Christ mediated through Spirit and faith.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear operational distinction between **covenant inclusion** (legal/relational status) and **covenant actualization** (regeneration and faith), useful for pastoral application and polemic alike.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed presbyterial circles for its pastoral clarity and confessional fidelity.
 - Used by pastors and catechists to justify infant baptism while avoiding the pitfalls of formalism or uncritical sacramentalism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a concise, pastorally oriented articulation of paedobaptist covenant theology; durable for classroom instruction, pulpit exposition, and intra-evangelical dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace:** The redemptive covenant administration in which God promises salvation in Christ to his people and their seed; baptism is its sign-seal.
- **Sign and Seal:** Reformed sacramental formula - a visible sign that also seals God's promise; baptism signifies cleansing and seals the promise of belonging to Christ.
- **Paedobaptism (infant baptism):** Practice of baptizing children of believing parents as members of the covenant community; justified by covenant continuity and household baptism examples.
 - Contrast: **Credobaptism** - baptizing only professing believers; Strawbridge critiques its voluntaristic presuppositions.
- **Baptismal efficacy:** The doctrine about what baptism accomplishes; here affirmed as *promissory and covenantal*, denied as automatic regeneration.
- **Baptismal regeneration:** The claim that baptism itself effects new birth - Strawbridge rejects unnuanced forms, while acknowledging a promised blessing for covenant children that requires faith for effectual realization.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology:** Covenant continuity thesis that circumcision in the OT is the precursor sign to baptism in the NT, supporting infant inclusion.
- **Household baptism:** New Testament instances where entire households were baptized; used as evidence for paedobaptism and covenantal household inclusion.
- **Visible vs Invisible Church:** Distinction reaffirmed; baptism marks **visible** membership and brings covenant obligations, while regeneration defines **invisible** membership.
- **Federal headship:** Adam/Christ paradigms used to explain covenant inclusion and imputed status; baptism marks corporate identity under Christ's headship.
- **Mode (immersion/sprinkling/pouring):** Treated as a secondary issue; theological focus is on sign/meaning, not uniform mode.
 - Strawbridge favors flexibility: historical and theological justification for pouring/sprinkling given typology and pastoral practice.
- **Catechesis / Covenant nurture:** Emphasized obligations of parents and church to instruct baptized children toward personal faith.
- **Discipline and promise:** Baptism creates both the church's promise-grounded hope for children and the church's disciplinary responsibility when profession is absent.
- **Faith and Regeneration:** Distinct but related: faith is the means by which covenant promises are actualized; regeneration is the Spirit's sovereign work, not mechanically tied to the sign.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for paedobaptist covenantal commitments in teaching and confessional contexts.
- As a **polemic** tool against credobaptist critiques, offering exegetical and theological rebuttals.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for integrating household baptism texts, typology, and congregational practice into pastoral catechesis and discipline.
