### TITLE
Contending for the Faith (2005) - Robert L. Reymond

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid renewals of confessional Reformed interest and frontal engagements with charismatic movements, liberalism, Roman Catholic apologetics, and popular evangelical revisionisms.
 - Reymond writes as a conservative, confessional Reformed theologian aiming to defend historic Protestant orthodoxy against modern deviations.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church must "contend for the faith" by recovering and defending classical Reformed doctrine and method against errors that compromise Scripture, confession, and catholic Protestant theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of contemporary theological challenges followed by doctrinal corrective rooted in Scripture and the Reformed confessions.
 - Major moves:
 - Explicate orthodox loci (Scripture, God, Christ, salvation, church, sacraments) with attention to polemical contexts.
 - Critique divergent positions (liberalism, Arminianism, semi-Pelagianism, certain charismatic and Pentecostal claims, Roman Catholic apologetics).
 - Reassert confessional categories and pastoral-ecclesial implications for fidelity and mission.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavily appeals to classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, the Westminster standards, Turretin) and engages modern interlocutors across the evangelical spectrum (Arminian writers, charismatic proponents, and liberal theologians).
 - Uses biblical exegesis as primary warrant while importing historical theology to adjudicate controversies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, sufficiency)
 - Anthropology (soul/spirit, image of God)
 - Providence and divine decrees (election and reprobation)
 - Soteriology (effectual calling, justification, sanctification)
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments
 - Apologetics and confessional method

- **Closing line**
 - A polemical, confessional call to recover rigorous Reformed theology as the faithful articulation of biblical Christianity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm insistence on the confessional method: doctrine read through Scripture and historic Reformed standards, not through therapeutic or experience-centered lenses.
 - Integrates rigorous systematic theology with practical ecclesial concerns-doctrine shapes worship, pulpit fidelity, and pastoral oversight.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects charismatic/trichotomist readings of Scripture that elevate pneumatic experience over doctrinal boundaries; contrasts with Arminian and liberal attempts to relativize divine sovereignty.
 - Pushes back against ecumenical irenicism that sacrifices doctrinal precision for institutional unity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not primarily innovative; rather, Reymond refines and restates confessional categories in contemporary polemical idiom, making classic formulations accessible to modern disputes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within conservative Reformed circles for its clarity and pastoral tone; used as a corrective text in seminary and elder training.
 - Less influential outside confessional Reformed networks due to its polemical posture and presuppositional commitments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, compact resource for teaching confessional Reformed doctrine and for training pastors and scholars to engage modern doctrinal challenges from a historically rooted position.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Confessional method**
 - Using creeds and confessions as theological-linguistic mediators that guard biblical exegesis from contemporary drift.

- **Dichotomy**
 - Reymond favors a **body-soul** (or body-soul unit) understanding over tripartite anthropology; he warns that trichotomy introduces Greek dualisms and threatens biblical simplicity.

- **Trichotomy**
 - Critiqued as unnecessary and exegetically weak; Reymond argues Spirit-language in Scripture does not entail a separate immaterial "spirit" part ontologically distinct from the soul.

- **Divine decrees**
 - Emphasizes **eternal, sovereign decrees** of God as the ordering principle of providence and salvation.

- **Election**
 - Presented as unconditional, particular, and grounded in God's sovereign will; exegetical defense tied to Pauline and Johannine texts.

- **Reprobation**
 - Treated as the negative counterpart in divine decretive counsel - taught as doctrinally coherent within classical Reformed formulations of double-predestination, affirmed as mysterious but biblically grounded.

- **Providence / compatibilism**
 - Affirms divine sovereignty and human responsibility without collapsing one into the other; rejects libertarian notions of freedom that make God contingent.

- **Confessional clarity**
 - Use of Westminster/Calvinian vocabulary to define terms and settle debates.

- **Polemic**
 - Frequent use of polemical engagement to expose non-confessional errors (Arminianism, Roman Catholic claims, aberrant charismatic practices).

- **Scriptural sufficiency**
 - Reiterates sola Scriptura as the criterion for adjudicating doctrinal disputes.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** and corrective resource in debates on anthropology (trichotomy vs dichotomy) and pneumatology.
 - As a **doctrinal definition source** and pedagogical guide for teaching classic Reformed positions on divine decrees, election, and reprobation.
