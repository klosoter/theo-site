### TITLE
The Inspiration of Scripture - Harold Lindsell (in The Foundations of Biblical Authority, ed. John H. Henry, 1978)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1970s evangelical milieu amid renewed controversy over biblical authority; contemporaneous with the drafting and circulation of the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978).
 - Reaction to mid-20th-century theological liberalism and to some evangelical conciliations toward critical methods and neo‑orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture is divinely inspired and **inerrant** (properly understood as true and without error in the autographs); the Bible is the final and authoritative norm for Christian faith and life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definitional clarification: distinguishes **inspiration** from lesser concepts (mere usefulness, partial divine activity) and aligns inspiration with verbal‑plenary authorship.
 - Historical testimony: appeals to patristic, medieval, and Reformation formulations to show continuity of high view of Scripture, while also critiquing modern deviations.
 - Biblical evidence: marshals self‑attestation texts (e.g., Scripture speaks as God) and the apostolic witness to ground divine origin and trustworthiness.
 - Polemic: critiques modernist and neo‑orthodox positions (e.g., Barthian ideas of the Bible as witness rather than propositional revelation); argues that conceding errors undermines doctrinal certainty and pastoral ministry.
 - Practical consequences: links doctrine to ecclesial stability, preaching, evangelism, and moral teaching; warns of theological drift if inerrancy is abandoned.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages conservative defenders (e.g., B. B. Warfield, J. Gresham Machen), contemporary evangelical scholars, as well as opponents in liberal theology and neo‑orthodoxy (e.g., Karl Barth indirectly).
 - Draws on patristic and Reformation authorities to buttress continuity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture (inspiration, authority, inerrancy/infallibility), ecclesial authority and pastoral theology; touches implications for hermeneutics and doctrine formation.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Scripture, as verbally and plenarily inspired and inerrant in the autographs, is the decisive, normative rule for doctrine and life; denial of this compromises the gospel and the church's teaching office.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Unyielding affirmation of **inerrancy in the original manuscripts** as the proper, orthodox locus of truth claims; insists this is not a pedantic nicety but theological necessity.
 - Strong pastoral framing: inerrancy is defended not merely for abstract orthodoxy but for the health of preaching, evangelism, and congregational confidence.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects neo‑orthodox tendencies that reduce Scripture to "a witness to the Word" by insisting Scripture itself reliably conveys propositional divine truth.
 - Pushes back against moderate evangelical compromises that allow historical or scientific errors without doctrinal collapse.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Reaffirms **verbal‑plenary inspiration** and clarifies **inerrancy** versus softer **infallibility** formulations; emphasizes the role of the autographs.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative and evangelical circles; contributed to consolidation of the inerrancy position in late 20th-century evangelical identity.
 - Criticized by mainline scholars and some evangelical critics for polemical tone and for perceived insufficiency in engaging higher criticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact defense of classic evangelical doctrine of Scripture; useful as a concise statement for pastors, students, and lay leaders in arguing for biblical authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration** - Divine agency in Scripture's composition; Lindsell insists upon a supernatural origin that warrants trust.
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture is without error in all that it affirms (properly applied to the original autographs).
 - Distinguished from **infallibility** (which some use more loosely to mean trustworthy in matters of faith and practice).
- **Verbal‑plenary inspiration** - Every word (verbal) and the whole corpus (plenary) are under divine guidance.
- **Autographs** - The original manuscripts; locus of inerrancy claims and theologically crucial for Lindsell.
- **Authority** - Scripture as the final normative rule for faith and life; not merely culturally authoritative but divinely authoritative.
- **Revelation** - God's self‑disclosure; Scripture records and mediates this revelation reliably.
- **Hermeneutic** - Implicitly conservative: high view of Scripture restricts interpretive latitude, guards doctrinal formulations.
- **Illumination** - The Spirit's application of Scripture to believers; distinguished from inspiration (origination).
- **Propositional truth** - Lindsell assumes Scripture communicates propositional content that can be true/false.
- **Neo‑orthodoxy** - Opposing position critiqued for making Scripture a witness rather than the propositional Word of God.
- **Historical testimony** - Use of church tradition and previous theologians to validate continuity of the high view.
- **Pastoral implications** - Practical consequences for preaching, catechesis, and ecclesial trustworthiness.

How this work is used across loci
- As a concise **definition source** for evangelical formulations of inerrancy and verbal‑plenary inspiration.
- As a **polemic** against neo‑orthodoxy and liberal revisionism in discussions of biblical authority.
- As a **practical resource** in ecclesial and pastoral contexts arguing for the necessity of a high view of Scripture.
