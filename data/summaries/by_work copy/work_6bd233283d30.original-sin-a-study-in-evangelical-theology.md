### TITLE
Original Sin: A Study in Evangelical Theology - Oliver D. Crisp

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary analytic-evangelical theology (21st century). Crisp writes from an evangelical and Reformed sympathetic vantage but with interdisciplinary engagement (biblical studies, historical theology, analytic philosophy of action and metaphysics). The book is situated within renewed evangelical interest in traditional doctrines under analytic scrutiny.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Original sin is a complex, multi‑membered doctrine that cannot be reduced to a single datum (e.g., mere propensity, mere mortality, or mere socialization). Crisp defends a nuanced evangelical account that preserves both **Adamic representation** (legal liability/imputation) and **real transmission** (a corrupted human nature transmitted through generation), while responding to modern objections from psychology, philosophy, and Eastern/modern anti‑Augustinian readings.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Preliminary conceptual clarifications: distinguishes types of claims often conflated under "original sin" (guilt vs. corruption vs. propensity vs. consequence).
 - Historical survey: traces Augustinian, Thomistic, Calvinist, Eastern Orthodox, Pelagian/Arminian approaches to identify strengths and weaknesses.
 - Philosophical analysis: examines metaphysical and moral questions about responsibility, identity, and causation relevant to transmission and imputation.
 - Positive proposal: formulates an account combining **federal headship** (Adam as representative) with a plausible doctrine of natural generation by which a sinful condition is passed on; calibrates imputation so it is neither arbitrary nor philosophically untenable.
 - Exegetical and doctrinal implications: explores Paul (esp. Romans 5), Christ as second Adam, soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Calvin, Aquinas, Pelagius, Arminius; modern analytic theologians and philosophers addressing moral responsibility and metaphysics; contemporary critics from Eastern Orthodoxy and secular psychology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Hamartiology (central), with sustained implications for soteriology (atonement, Christology as second Adam), anthropology (nature of human persons), covenant theology (federal headship), and some engagement with ecclesiology and sacramental theology as connected implications.
- **Closing line:** Crisp aims to rescue and refine the classical evangelical doctrine of original sin so it remains biblically rooted, intellectually defensible, and pastorally cognizant - holding together representative guilt and genuinely transmitted corruption without reduction or ad hoc metaphysics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Analytic clarity and multi‑level parsing:** Crisp consistently separates distinct claims commonly conflated (legal imputation vs. ontological corruption vs. noetic impairment), using precise philosophical tools to diagnose confusions.
- **Synthesis of federal and realist elements:** Rather than choosing pure "imputation only" or "structure/condition only" models, he endorses a hybrid that makes sense of biblical imagery (Romans 5) and natural generation.
- **Philosophical grounding for theological claims:** Uncommonly in evangelical treatments, he brings contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of action to bear on questions of identity and responsibility in descent from Adam.
- **Corrective to modern reductionisms:** Explicitly attacks sociological/psychological reductions of original sin and certain Eastern readings that deny inherited culpability.
- **Reception and influence:** Valued in analytic-evangelical circles for its rigor; used by Reformed theologians who want a philosophically respectable defence of classical teaching. It prompts renewed debate with Eastern Orthodox and liberal Protestant interpreters.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a compact, philosophically informed template for teaching original sin that honors historical theology while equipping students to engage contemporary objections.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin:** Multi‑dimensional doctrine encompassing transmitted corruption, universal propensity to sin, and representative liability.
- **Federal headship (representative imputation):** Adam as covenantal representative whose act grounds corporate liability for descendants.
- **Imputation:** Legal/forensic ascription of guilt or righteousness; in this context, the ascription of Adam's guilt to humanity.
- **Transmission (seminal/realist transmission):** The natural generative process by which a corrupted nature (not merely environment) is passed to offspring.
 - Contrast: Crisp rejects both pure "metaphorical" and pure "socialization" accounts.
- **Guilt vs. corruption:** Distinction between legal culpability (guilt) and ontological or dispositional corruption (propensity or depravity).
- **Total depravity (noetic and volitional effects):** The doctrine that sin affects all dimensions of human life; Crisp nuances how comprehensive this influence is without collapsing into determinism.
- **Second Adam motif:** Christ as representative reversal of Adam; key soteriological correlate of original sin.
- **Pelagianism / Semi‑Pelagianism:** Historical alternatives critiqued for denying real inherited corruption or liability.
- **Eastern Orthodox critique:** The tendency to treat original sin primarily as death/mortality and not inherited guilt; Crisp rehearses and replies to this line.
- **Moral responsibility and identity:** Philosophical issues bearing on whether descendants can properly be held liable for Adam's act; central to Crisp's defence.
- **Noetic effects (intellect/mind):** How sin impairs cognitive faculties; important for pastoral and apologetic usage.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Definition source: as a clear, philosophically informed statement of a classic evangelical formulation of original sin.
 - Polemic: as a resource against reductionist modern readings and Eastern denial of inherited guilt.
 - Exegetical model / conceptual pivot: used to read Romans 5 and soteriological doctrines in a way that keeps legal and ontological elements in tension without collapsing them.
