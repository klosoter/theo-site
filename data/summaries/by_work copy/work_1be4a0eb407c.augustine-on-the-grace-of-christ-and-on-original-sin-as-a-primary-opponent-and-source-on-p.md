### TITLE
Augustine, On the Grace of Christ and On Original Sin (as source/opponent on Pelagius's views) - notes on Pelagius in the anti-Pelagian corpus

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 5th century theological crisis (Pelagian controversy, c. 410s-420s). Augustine writing from Hippo against Pelagius and his Roman supporters; councils in Carthage (418) and imperial rescripts condemned Pelagian propositions.
 - Milieu: late antique moralism and ascetic culture, heightened attention to baptism, sin, and pastoral practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Whether human beings are born guilty and radically dependent on prevenient/regenerative grace (Augustine), or whether humans retain sufficient natural ability to choose good and merit salvation with only exhortatory or external grace (Pelagius).
- **Core argument or structure (Pelagius as represented by Augustine)**
 - Pelagius affirms human free will as intact and primary: will can choose righteousness without inner, irresistible aid.
 - He denies transmitted guilt from Adam: infants are born innocent; death and concupiscence are results of imitation and environment, not federal imputation.
 - He defines grace chiefly as the gift of creation, natural faculties, instruction, Scripture, and Christ's example - not an internal, sovereignly renewing favor that irresistibly heals will.
 - Moral life is achieved by human effort, aided by external grace; merit is possible and meaningful.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Pelagius (primary adversary), Celestius (associate), Augustine (respondent), Roman clergy and synods. Scriptural loci: Paul (Romans, 5), Psalms, Genesis. Patristic tradition (some Church Fathers ambiguous) is contested.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (nature and necessity), Original sin (nature, guilt, transmission), Imputation of Adam's sin, Free will (liberum arbitrium), Baptism (need and effect), human nature, merit and divine justice, pastoral implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine's sustained rebuttal frames Pelagius as asserting a morally autonomous human capable of salvation by nature-plus-exhortation; the controversy pivots on whether grace is primarily external aid or an interior, sovereignly efficacious gift that alone accounts for fallen human salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations (Pelagian position as depicted)**
 - Emphasis on human moral responsibility and the dignity of the will; Christ as exemplar and teacher rather than principal regenerating agent.
 - Sharp reserve about imputing Adam's guilt to descendants on grounds of divine justice.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Augustine's reading of Paul: Pelagius stresses pedagogical/imitative readings of Adam and lessens Pauline categories of federal guilt and total depravity.
 - Pushes back against fatalistic readings by some ascetics that would negate moral striving.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulation of "grace" toward communicable gifts (nature, reason, revelation) rather than non-communicable, sovereignly regenerative grace; refinement of how merit functions in soteriology.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Pelagian positions were formally condemned; nonetheless, Pelagian emphases resurfaced in later debates (Semi-Pelagianism, medieval optimisms, some modern moral theology, and certain strains of liberal Protestantism).
 - Augustine's contra-Pelagian corpus became a cornerstone for Reformed and Augustinian traditions, shaping doctrines of original sin, imputation, and prevenient vs effectual grace; Pelagius functions as the standard foil in these loci.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the stakes between moral-ability-centered and grace-centered soteriologies; sharpens pastoral, ethical, and theological reflection on human responsibility, baptismal practice, and the nature of divine help.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin**
 - Pelagian view (as reproved): no inherited guilt; sin arises from imitation and environment. Augustine contrasted: hereditary guilt and corruption.
- **Imputation**
 - Central dispute: whether Adam's sin is federally imputed to his descendants (Augustine) or not (Pelagius).
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)**
 - Pelagius: will remains fundamentally capable of choosing good unaided inwardly. Augustine: will wounded, requires grace to will rightly.
- **Grace (gratia)**
 - Pelagius' sense: external aids, gifts, revelation, example. Augustine's corrective: prevenient and justifying grace that internally renews.
- **Prevenient vs effectual grace**
 - Pelagian tendency denies necessity of prevenient restorative grace; later debates (Semi-Pelagianism) attempt compromise. Augustine insists on sovereign, efficacious grace.
- **Merit**
 - Pelagius assigns positive role to human merit post-conversion; Augustine emphasizes grace as ground of any true merit.
- **Concupiscence / The flesh**
 - Pelagius treats concupiscence as disordered habit, not guilt-bearing essence; Augustine treats it as consequence and sign of inherited corruption.
- **Baptism**
 - Polemical focus: Pelagius' practice less tied to original guilt; Augustine grounds infant baptism in need for cleansing from original sin.
- **Federal headship (Adam as representative)**
 - Denied or weakened in Pelagius' model; central for Augustine's doctrine of imputation.
- **Revelation and Scripture**
 - Pelagius appeals to Scripture morally and pedagogically; Augustine reads Paul's theology of sin and grace more existentially and forensic-ontologically.
- **Human nature / anthropology**
 - Pelagius affirms essentially intact nature with acquired disorder; Augustine emphasizes pervasive corruption.
- **Pastoral theology**
 - Pelagius stresses moral exhortation and example; Augustine argues for sacraments and preaching grounded in need for grace.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source and polemic**: Pelagius' statements as summarized and refuted by Augustine serve as the classic formulation of Pelagianism against which later councils and theologians define orthodoxy.
- As an **exegetical model and conceptual pivot**: Augustine's engagement with Pelagius shapes exegesis of Romans 5 and Genesis 3 and provides the paradigms (imputation, prevenient/effectual grace) used in later debates (e.g., Semi-Pelagianism vs Augustinianism).
