### TITLE
Embodied: Living as Whole People in a Fragmented World - Gregg R. Allison

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed milieu addressing late modern fragmentation: technological mediation, therapeutic individualism, and legacy dualisms (Platonic/Cartesian).
 - Pastoral-theological impulse: written for pastors, lay leaders, and seminarians seeking a theology that integrates doctrine and daily life.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity must recover an integrated **embodied anthropology**: human flourishing is not merely spiritual or cognitive but whole-person restoration (body, soul, sociality) through the incarnation, cross, and resurrection.
 - The book diagnoses cultural and ecclesial tendencies that fragment persons (spiritualization of faith, privatized religion, reductionist materialism) and proposes theological and practical redress.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: maps historical sources of fragmentation (biblical misreadings, Greek dualism, Cartesian legacy, modern therapeutic culture).
 - Biblical-theological reclamation: reads Scripture through an incarnational lens emphasizing body, creation, and eschatological renewal.
 - Constructive proposal: offers concrete loci for embodied discipleship - worship/sacrament, vocation, sexuality, suffering, community, death/resurrection - showing how doctrine animates practice.
 - Pastoral outworking: practical guidance for church life and formation that cultivates bodily practices (liturgical habits, care for the vulnerable, embodied witness).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: critiques of Platonic and medieval spiritualizing strains; engagement with Augustine and Reformation emphases on creation and providence.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: constructive conversation with modern theologians emphasizing incarnation and ethics (broadly evangelical and ecumenical conversation partners), and critique of therapeutic-cultural commentators.
 - Scriptural exegesis: sustained appeal to both Old and New Testament texts to ground embodied practices.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology**, **Christology** (incarnation as hermeneutical key), **soteriology** (whole-person redemption), **ecclesiology** (church as embodied community), **sacramentology**, **ethics** (sexuality, vocation, care), **eschatology** (resurrection and renewed creation).
- **Closing line**
 - Allison centers the Christian life as the restoration and formation of embodied persons: salvation and discipleship are practices that shape flesh-and-blood communities toward the bodily renewal promised in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that the incarnation is not merely doctrinal but normative for Christian formation: theology must issue in embodied practices.
 - Equally critical of secular materialism and pietistic spiritualization - seeks a middle, incarnational path.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic evangelical tendencies to privatize spirituality and treat the body as ancillary.
 - Contrasts with secular/therapeutic frames that reduce identity to psychological selfhood or consumer choice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Framing "embodied discipleship" as a theological category linking doctrine, liturgy, vocation, and ethics into one coherent praxis.
 - Integration of sacramentality and everyday vocation as parallel loci of bodily formation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in many Reformed and conservative-evangelical seminaries and churches as a pastoral corrective and curriculum resource.
 - Influential among pastors seeking resources to address sexuality, suffering, and technological fragmentation biblically.
 - Limited specialized academic critique but broad pastoral uptake for formation programs.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful synthesis of biblical theology, doctrinal clarity, and pastoral application.
 - Durable for teaching anthropology, pastoral theology, and Christian ethics with an incarnational center.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Embodiment**
 - Human existence as integrated bodily, social, and spiritual reality; central hermeneutical lens.
- **Incarnation**
 - Christology as the model and grounding for bodily restoration and sacramental life.
- **Holistic anthropology**
 - Rejection of soul/body dualism in favor of integrated personhood.
- **Dualism (Platonic/Cartesian)**
 - Diagnosed as a root cause of fragmentation in theology and practice.
- **Sacramentality**
 - The church's liturgy and sacraments as formative, embodied practices that mediate grace.
- **Sanctification**
 - Understood as bodily formation in habits, vocation, and community, not merely inner moral reorientation.
- **Vocation**
 - Everyday work and relationships treated as arenas of embodied discipleship and witness.
- **Sexuality**
 - Discerned theologically and ethically within embodied marriage, community, and redemption narratives.
- **Suffering and illness**

- **Death and resurrection**
 - Eschatological hope focused on bodily renewal and new creation, shaping present bodily practices.
- **Community / Church**
 - Congregation as embodied polity and formative context for whole-person discipleship.
- **Therapeutic individualism / consumerism**

- **Formation / practice**
 - Emphasis on liturgical and habitual practices that shape embodied persons.

- **Uses across loci**
