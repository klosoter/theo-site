### TITLE
Christ and Horrors: The Coherence of Christology (Marilyn McCord Adams, 2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century within analytic theology and philosophy of religion; follows Adams's influential work on theodicy ("Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God", 1999).
 - Responds to contemporary challenges about the problem of suffering by bringing analytic rigor to Christological doctrine and pastoral concerns about horrendous evil.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The central task: to show that a robust, orthodox Christology can coherently answer the moral and existential problem of "horrendous evils" - evils so devastating they can make life seem not worth living - by locating redemptive response in the person and work of Christ.
 - Christology must do more than explain why evil happens; it must show how God can genuinely defeat, redeem, and make sense of horrors so that lives can again be intelligibly good.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify what counts as a "horrendous evil" and why standard theodicies (e.g., free will defense, soul-making) fail to meet the existential-intelligibility challenge.
 - Show that Christ, as fully God and fully human, uniquely enters into and suffers horrendous evils without being their cause, thereby providing:
 - **solidarity** with sufferers (identification and empathy);
 - **definitive defeat** of evil (eschatological transformation, not mere compensation);
 - **reconstitution of persons** so that lives torn by horror can again be worth living.
 - argue that orthodox doctrines (incarnation, atonement, resurrection) can be articulated to meet the logical, moral, and pastoral demands posed by horrendous evils.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages analytic philosophers of religion (e.g., Alvin Plantinga indirectly via free-will theodicy), classical theologians (Augustine, Aquinas, Anselm), and contemporary theologians concerned with suffering (e.g., Moltmann, Hick).
 - Draws on philosophical work about value, personhood, and identity to analyze what it means to make life "worth living."
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (incarnation, two natures, theodramatic role of the person of Christ).
 - **Atonement** (function and scope vis-a-vis horrendous evils).
 - **Theodicy and divine justice** (the metaphysical and moral coherence of God acting against horror).
 - **Eschatology and soteriology** (defeat of evil and ultimate restoration of persons).
- **Closing line**
 - Adams locates the decisive theological answer to the lived problem of horrendous evil in a Christology that both identifies with suffering and secures its eschatological defeat, thereby restoring the intelligibility and attractiveness of life under God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Coined and rigorously developed the category **"horrendous evils"** as a distinctive challenge that standard theodicies do not adequately address.
 - Moves the debate from purely logical or evidential theodicy to an existential-pastoral demand: theology must show how damaged lives can be healed at the deepest level.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges **purely justificatory** approaches (e.g., appeal to greater goods, soul-making) as insufficient when the evil undermines the value-framework of the afflicted person.
 - Contrasts with liberal consolations that relativize horror; insists on a robust divine response that is neither sentimental nor nihilistic.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrates analytic philosophy concepts (value-theory, identity) into Christological and soteriological discussion.
 - Reframes atonement discussion in terms of **restoration of "life-worth"** rather than only penal substitution or moral exemplarism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in philosophy of religion and pastoral theology for reorienting theodicy around the suffering subject.
 - Influential among analytic theologians and used across denominational lines as a model for linking doctrine with pastoral exigency.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides an exemplar of how careful doctrinal work (Christology) can be marshaled to address pressing moral-pastoral questions; valuable for systematic, pastoral, and philosophical curricula.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Horrendous evils**
 - Evils so drastic they threaten the intelligibility or value of a person's life; central problem for theodicy.
- **Making life worth living**
 - The theological criterion for successful theodicy: God must be shown able to restore the fundamental intelligibility and value of a life marred by horror.
- **Solidarity**
 - Christ's identificatory suffering with victims; not mere sympathy but full participation.
- **Definitive defeat (of evil)**
 - Eschatological overcoming of horrendous evils, not merely temporal consolation or compensation.
- **Incarnation (two natures)**
 - The theological locus ensuring God can both fully know horror (humanity) and sovereignly redeem it (divinity).
- **Atonement rearticulated**
 - Focus on transformation and restoration of persons rather than only juridical transaction.
- **Critique of standard theodicies**
 - Free-will and soul-making defenses are necessary but insufficient to address existential collapse caused by horrors.
- **Personhood / identity**
 - Philosophical attention to how persons are constituted and how horrors can fragment identity - and how Christ heals that fragmentation.
- **Eschatological restoration**
 - The future-oriented completion through which horrors are overcome and persons reconstituted.
- **Pastoral-theological integration**
 - Use of doctrinal resources to meet pastoral needs of sufferers without reductionism.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for "horrendous evils" in theodicy curricula and research.
- **Polemic resource** against reductive theodicies that ignore existential damage caused by suffering.
- **Exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating Christology, atonement, and pastoral care in systematic theology courses.
