### TITLE
Dominion and Dynasty: A Theology of the Hebrew Bible (Stephen G. Dempster, 2003)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2003 amid renewed interest in canonical and biblical-theological readings of the Old Testament; conversation with Reformed covenant theology, canonical criticism, and royal/temple-focused OT scholarship.
 - Dempster writes from a broadly Reformed, evangelical vantage that prizes continuity between Israel's story and Christian fulfillment.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Hebrew Bible is structured by two interrelated divine purposes: **dominion** (God's intent for human rule over creation) and **dynasty** (the establishment of a royal house culminating in the Davidic line). The biblical narrative interprets Israel's history and institutions as shaped to accomplish these twin ends.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of Scripture as a unified story: creation → election → exodus → conquest → monarchy → temple → exile → restoration.
 - Major moves:
 - Identify a foundational creation covenant or commission that mandates dominion and provides the archetypal covenantal pattern.
 - Show how Israel's institutions (land, law, temple, kingship) serve the dominion-dynasty axis.
 - Read Mosaic covenant and other covenants typologically: they mediate and anticipate the fuller realization of dominion and dynasty.
 - Trace typological correspondences leading to fulfillment in the prophetic and messianic hope (and implicitly in the New Testament fulfillment).
 - Method: canonical, theological reading emphasizing motif recurrence and typological function.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts with covenant-theologians and OT scholars concerned with law, kingship, and temple; conversant with canonical critics and theologians who press continuity (explicit names are not exhaustive here).
 - Implicit engagement with traditions that treat the Mosaic law as autonomous versus those who see it as typological within a larger covenantal economy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (creation covenant, Mosaic covenant, Davidic covenant)
 - Christology and messianic expectation (typology and fulfillment)
 - Ecclesiology and kingship (royal theology)
 - Revelation (canonical shape), eschatology (restoration/fulfillment)

- **Closing line**
 - Dempster's theological center of gravity: the Hebrew Bible must be read as a covenantal, canonical drama whose institutions and laws are orientated toward God's twofold goal of renewed sovereign rule (dominion) exercised through an enduring royal line (dynasty).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The twin rubric **dominion + dynasty** provides a succinct organizing principle for the whole OT narrative, tying creation mandate to Davidic promise.
 - Strong canonical and theological integration: law, temple, land and kingship are not isolated genres but functional elements of one covenantal program.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters readings that over-privilege the Mosaic law as an end in itself or that fragment the Pentateuch from the monarchy/temple material.
 - Challenges any simplistic identification of the Mosaic covenant as a pure "covenant of works as to substance"; rather, Dempster treats Mosaic law as typologically ordered within the larger covenantal economy.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Elevates "dominion" (creation mandate) to primary theological status alongside the well-worn "covenant" vocabulary; frames Mosaic institutions as mediating types rather than autonomous covenants.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical OT theology as a synthetic, pedagogical framework; cited in courses and commentaries emphasizing canonical coherence and royal theology.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments of typology, kingdom theology, and covenantal continuity in OT studies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable pedagogically for teaching the OT as unified narrative; enduringly useful for framing typological connections to messianic fulfillment and for preserving a theologically unified view of covenant history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dominion**
 - God's creation mandate (rule over creation); central organizing motif for human vocation and Israel's mission.

- **Dynasty**
 - The divine aim to establish a lasting royal line (Davidic focus) as the historical locus of God's rule.

- **Creation Covenant**
 - Archetypal covenant/commission that sets the covenantal pattern; the basis for evaluating later covenants.

- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - Treated as a mediating covenant: an administration that instructs and typifies the kingdom life rather than functioning as a covenant of works in substance.
 - Relates to the site topic "Mosaic Covenant Covenant Of Works As To Substance": Dempster resists equating Mosaic form with a covenant-of-works model divorced from redemptive-historical context.

- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)**
 - Discussed critically: Dempster distinguishes the creation commission from later covenant administrations; he resists reading Mosaic legislation as a mere repetition of covenant of works substance.

- **Typology**
 - Central hermeneutical tool: institutions, persons, events are "types" foreshadowing fuller realities; used to knit OT institutions to messianic fulfillment.
 - Directly ties to the site topic "Typology And Fulfillment": Dempster develops typological chains (king, temple, land) culminating in prophetic and eschatological fulfillment.

- **Fulfillment**
 - The prophetic and messianic realization of dominion and dynasty; OT types point forward to consummation in king/servant.

- **Royal Grant / Davidic Covenant**
 - Legal and theological framework for dynasty; Dempster emphasizes grant-like features (promise, inheritance, perpetuity).

- **Temple & Land**
 - Functional loci of divine presence and dominion; typological markers of kingdom.

- **Canon / Canonical reading**
 - Methodological posture: read OT texts in their canonical relations to discern theological patterns.

- **Mediatorial Kingdom**
 - Concept tying priest-king motifs to God's delegated rule through covenant figures.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for integrating creation mandate with covenant theology (useful in lectures on covenant continuity).
- As a **polemic** against isolating the Mosaic law as an independent "covenant of works" in substance.
- As an **exegetical/typological model** for tracing institutional and messianic foreshadowing (e.g., kingship, temple).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in kingdom theology and in courses on OT theology and biblical theology.
