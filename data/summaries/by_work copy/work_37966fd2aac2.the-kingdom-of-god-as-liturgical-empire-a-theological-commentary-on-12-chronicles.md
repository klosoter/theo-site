### TITLE
The Kingdom of God as Liturgical Empire: A Theological Commentary on 1-2 Chronicles - Scott Hahn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Catholic theological and biblical scholarship bridging patristic, liturgical, and canonical-critical approaches; written within late-20th/early-21st century renewed interest in covenantal and sacramental readings of the Old Testament.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Chronicler presents Israel's history as the unfolding of a **liturgical empire** in which God's kingship is mediated and embodied through temple worship, Davidic covenantal order, and cultic institutions; understanding Chronicles theologically requires reading it as canonical theology oriented toward Christ and the Church.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Close, book-by-book commentary on 1-2 Chronicles highlighting recurring liturgical motifs.
 - Argues that the temple functions as God's throne and the liturgy as political-ecclesial ordering - worship is the means by which the kingdom is constituted and maintained.
 - Shows Chronicler's selective retelling of Samuel-Kings to emphasize covenant fidelity, priestly/Levitical roles, and cultic centralization.
 - Reads Davidic and Solomonic typology christologically: figures and institutions point forward to the consummation in Christ and the Church's worship life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - The Chronicler as primary theological agent; engagement with the Deuteronomistic accounts (Samuel-Kings), canonical critics, patristic interpreters, and modern liturgical and covenant theologians.
 - Dialogues implicitly with historical-critical skepticism that marginalizes the theological shape of the text.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant (Mosaic and Davidic), kingship, priesthood, temple theology, liturgy and sacramentality, ecclesiology, typological Christology, and eschatology.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Chronicles portrays God's reign not primarily as political dominion but as **a covenantal, liturgical empire** in which temple worship enacts and sustains the Davidic kingdom that finds its fulfillment in Christ and the Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Coins and centralizes the phrase **"liturgical empire"** to capture how cultic worship functions as imperial governance in the Chronicler's imagination.
 - Treats worship praxis (sacrifice, song, festival, priestly order) as theologically formative, not merely the epiphenomenon of religious sentiment.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against purely political or socio-historical reconstructions of Israel's monarchy by restoring the theological primacy of cult and covenant.
 - Counters readings that see Chronicles as mere nostalgic revisionism; Hahn emphasizes theological intentionality and christological horizon.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integrates covenantal theology with liturgical theory to propose a model where **liturgy functions as constitutional law** for the kingdom.
 - Highlights temple-as-throne language to reframe royal ideology in cultic rather than imperial-administrative terms.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well-received in Catholic and ecumenical circles for linking biblical exegesis to sacramental and liturgical theology; has been used in homiletic and catechetical contexts.
 - Met with caution by some historical-critical scholars who question typological leaps and teleological readings toward Christ.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable exegetical model for reading OT history theologically, especially where worship, covenant, and kingship intersect.
 - Valuable for pastors, liturgists, and teachers seeking an integrated approach to biblical theology that respects ancient cultic praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liturgical Empire:** Key coinage; the notion that liturgy constitutes the kingdom's order and authority.
- **Chronicler:** The theological narrator/editor whose selective retelling reshapes history around temple and cult.
- **Temple as Throne:** Theological axiom: God's kingship is localized in the temple cult rather than merely in dynastic politics.
- **Davidic Covenant:** Central covenantal frame that legitimates royal priestly order and anticipates messianic fulfillment.
- **Priesthood/Levites:** Institutional axis through which worship and royal legitimacy are maintained.
- **Cultic Centralization:** Chronicler's emphasis on worship at the centralized temple as constitutive of covenant fidelity.
- **Typology / Christology:** Reading David, Solomon, and cultic institutions as foreshadowings fulfilled in Christ and the Church's worship.
- **Canonical Reading:** Approach that reads Chronicles within the canonical economy, not as isolated historiography.
- **Liturgical Memory:** Concept that ritual recollection preserves and re-presents covenant identity across generations.
- **Sacramental Imagination:** Treats cultic rites as vehicles of divine action, prefiguring Christian sacramentality.
- **Eschatological Orientation:** Chronicles as forward-looking, anticipating consummation of the kingdom in Christ.
- **Intertextuality (Samuel-Kings):** Chronicler's theological rewriting of earlier historical books to emphasize worship and covenant.
- **Royal Theology:** Theological reflection on kingship structured by covenant and cult rather than imperial might.
- **Worship as Political Order:** The thesis that liturgy functions to order society and polity under God's reign.

How the work is used:
- As a **definition source** for integrating covenant, cult, and kingship in Old Testament theology.
- As a **polemic** against secularized, purely political readings of Israel's history.
- As an **exegetical model** for canonical and liturgical readings of historical books.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in homiletics and liturgical theology linking OT worship to New Testament sacrament and ecclesial practice.
