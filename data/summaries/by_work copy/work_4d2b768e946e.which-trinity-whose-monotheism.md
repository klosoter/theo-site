### TITLE
Which Trinity? Whose Monotheism? - Thomas H. McCall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century intervention in the resurgence of Trinitarian theology, responding to the so-called **New Trinitarian** or **social Trinitarian** movement that emphasizes relationality and the sociality of the divine life.
 - Situated within Reformed/confessional theology but engaging ecclesial and academic interlocutors across analytic theology, patristic studies, and contemporary systematic theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Many recent Trinitarian proposals that foreground personhood and relational ontology threaten classical **monotheism** and the traditional metaphysical resources (notably **divine simplicity**) needed to secure divine unity. McCall argues for a reassertion of a classical, confessional Trinitarianism that preserves genuine unity without collapsing persons or lapsing into tritheism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: maps the claims of New/Social Trinitarians (priority of relations/persons, critique of classical metaphysics).
 - Critical engagement: shows how certain formulations create conceptual tensions with biblical monotheism, patristic consensus, and key creedal claims.
 - Philosophical-theological defense: reconstructs and defends elements of **classical theism** (divine simplicity, aseity, unity) as necessary doctrinal commitments for coherent Trinitarian theology.
 - Constructive proposal: offers a confessional Trinitarian account that reads biblical data and doctrinal tradition together, avoiding both reductionistic modalism and social trinitarian tritheism.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Representative targets: proponents of social/relational Trinitarianism (e.g., strands associated with LaCugna-style relational theology, Eastern relational emphases, and contemporary social-Trinitarian advocates).
 - Resources appealed to: Scripture, Athanasius and Augustine, classical scholastic formulations, Reformed confessions and modern analytic philosophical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic/immanent distinction, persons and relations)
 - Monotheism and divine unity
 - Divine simplicity, aseity, immutability
 - Revelation and the priority of the economic Trinity for theology
 - Christology (as it bears on Trinitarian personhood and identity)
 - Worship and doxology (practical implications of Trinitarian/modeled monotheism)

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - McCall's theological center of gravity: **a confessional, classical Trinitarianism that defends divine unity (monotheism) by retaining classical metaphysical commitments while reading biblical Trinitarian revelation faithfully.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, methodical defense of **divine simplicity** as not merely philosophical ornament but essential to safeguarding biblical monotheism and avoiding tritheism.
 - Integration of historical theology (patristic and scholastic) with contemporary analytic resources to critique modern trends.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against social Trinitarian moves that prioritize relations such that the identity of the divine persons is determined relationally and risks plurality of centers of being.
 - Challenges relational theologians who dismiss classical metaphysics as foreign to Scripture, arguing instead that metaphysical commitments undergird coherent proclamation of one God.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much novel neologisms as a **reframing**: reclaims classical categories (simplicity, aseity) as doctrinally serviceable in contemporary debate rather than obsolete, and insists on clearer distinctions between economic versus immanent Trinity in constructive terms.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among Reformed and evangelical theologians seeking a rigorous defense of classical Trinitarian orthodoxy.
 - Criticized by social/relational Trinitarians and some contemporary theologians who view divine simplicity as metaphysically problematic or theologically reductionist.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, rigorous resource for teaching the theological necessity of unity in God and for training students to read Trinitarian debates with historical-theological and philosophical discernment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Trinitarianism / Social Trinitarianism**
 - Movement emphasizing persons, relations, and the social character of the divine life; primary interlocutor for McCall.
- **Classical theism**
 - The tradition holding God to be simple, immutable, impassible, and one substance; McCall's preferred framework.
- **Divine simplicity**
 - Thesis that God is not composite; attributes are identical with God's essence - defended as vital to monotheism.
- **Monotheism (Biblical & doctrinal)**
 - Commitment to one God; McCall argues it is threatened by certain relational renderings of the Trinity.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity**
 - Distinction between God's actions in history (economic) and God's inner life (immanent); used to argue that economic revelation anchors sound claims about immanent reality.
- **Persons (hypostases)**
 - Real subsistent centers of consciousness in God; McCall insists on guarding their unity without reducing persons to mere roles.
- **Relations of origin**
 - The origin relations (e.g., Father begetting Son) - analyzed to show how relations do not constitute independent centers of being.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling**
 - Affirms relational unity but within constraints of divine simplicity to avoid fragmentation.
- **Tritheism**
 - The error of positing three gods; treated as the chief risk of social-relational accounts that fail to secure unity.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence; used to argue for the ontological priority and unity of God.
- **Relational ontology**
 - Philosophical posture prioritizing relations over substances; critiqued where it undermines divine unity.
- **Revelation-anchored metaphysics**
 - McCall's method: metaphysical claims must cohere with biblical revelation, not replace it.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed/classical Trinitarian commitments and for teaching doctrine of God.
 - As a **polemic** against social Trinitarian proposals that downplay divine simplicity or threaten monotheism.
 - As an **exegetical-modeling** resource that insists economic revelation (Scripture) constrains metaphysical theorizing about the immanent Trinity.
