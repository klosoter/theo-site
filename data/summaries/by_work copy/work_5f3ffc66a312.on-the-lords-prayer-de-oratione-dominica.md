### TITLE
On the Lord's Prayer (De Oratione Dominica) - Cyprian of Carthage

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-3rd century North Africa (Carthage); Cyprian bishop (c. 248-258). Written in the context of episcopal leadership, pastoral care, and controversies over schism and discipline in the pre-Constantinian church.
 - Latin patristic milieu that balances biblical exegesis, moral exhortation, and ecclesial instruction.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Prayer is the paradigm of Christian prayer and the rule of life for the faithful; correct prayer presupposes and fosters ecclesial unity under episcopal authority. The right ordering of prayer is inseparable from church communion, repentance, and sacramental life.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition follows the petitions of Matthew 6 (with Luke parallels): Cyprian treats each petition as having moral, spiritual, and ecclesial consequences.
 - Opening address ("Our Father"): grounds prayer in common filial relationship and communal belonging.
 - "Hallowed be thy name" and "Thy kingdom come": call to holiness and longing for Christ's reign; ecclesial obedience and eschatological hope interrelate.
 - "Daily bread": dependence on God and the connection to sacramental provision (baptismal/new life and Eucharistic sustenance).
 - "Forgive us our debts": repentance, mutual forgiveness, and the church's role in reconciliation.
 - "Lead us not into temptation, deliver us from evil": moral vigilance, pastoral oversight, and petition for spiritual protection.
 - Emphasizes practice: prayer must be public, communal, and consistent with baptismal profession; private devotion is valid but cannot substitute ecclesial life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary text: the Lord's Prayer in Scripture (Matt 6; Luke 11).
 - Engages implicitly with contemporaneous pastoral concerns (schismatics, lax moral practice) and earlier Latin writers (shared vocabulary with Tertullian and other African writers), but argument is primarily expository and pastoral rather than polemical to a named opponent.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (unity, communion, episcopal governance)
 - Prayer and spirituality (model, formation, ethics)
 - Forgiveness and reconciliation (soteriology and moral life)
 - Sacramental hints (baptismal/Eucharistic connections)
 - Christology and divine fatherhood are presupposed in addressing God as Father.

- **Closing line**
 - Cyprian centers the Lord's Prayer as the concise rule of Christian life: true prayer both testifies to and sustains communion with God and with the One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong linking of correct prayer to ecclesial unity: prayer both presupposes communion and serves to maintain it.
 - Pastoral reading that turns each petition into communal/disciplinary norms, not merely private devotion.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond purely individualistic piety (common in some ascetic trends) by insisting on public, communal prayer as normative and authoritative under bishops.
 - Implicit corrective to schismatic tendencies: prayer discipline is one marker of authentic belonging.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrates liturgical, moral, and disciplinary language around the Lord's Prayer; treats petitions as loci for ecclesial praxis (e.g., forgiveness -> reconciliation by the community).
 - Articulates filial address ("Our Father") as ecclesial-covenantal identity rather than only personal consolation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Western patristic and medieval exegetical and pastoral tradition as a model of catechesis on prayer.
 - Reformation-era readers noted its moral and communal emphases; Protestant traditions appreciate its stress on repentance but often dispute Cyprian's ecclesial/episcopal emphases.
 - Modern liturgical and sacramental theologians draw on Cyprian for connections between prayer, sacrament, and church order.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model for pastoral exegesis: concise, practice-oriented, and ecclesially grounded.
 - Valuable for teaching about the interplay of prayer, forgiveness, and church unity.

### KEY TERMS & USES

- **"Daily bread"**
 - Dependence on God; read sacramentally as connected to sustenance of new life (baptism/Eucharist).

- **"Forgive us our debts/trespasses"**
 - Central ethical petition; mutual forgiveness as test and means of communion; grounds for ecclesial reconciliation.

- **"Lead us not into temptation"**

 - As a definitional source for ecclesiology and the relationship between prayer and church unity.
 - As a polemical or pastoral resource against schism and lax discipline.
 - As an exegetical model for homiletic/catechetical treatment of the Lord's Prayer and for integrating liturgy, ethics, and sacrament.
