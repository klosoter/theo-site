### TITLE
Ascension Theology - Douglas Farrow

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Anglican/Reformed theological recovery of classical Christology and sacramental ecclesiology. Farrow writes as a conservative-but-ecumenically minded theologian reacting to both liberal demythologizing and pietistic reductionisms.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The ascension and exaltation of Christ are doctrinally central: they articulate Christ's continuing humanity, mediatorial rule, sacramental presence, and the church's mission. Neglect of the ascension produces impoverished understandings of intercession, sacraments, and eschatology.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnosis: modern theology underplays ascension; focuses on incarnation/crucifixion/resurrection without sufficient attention to exaltation and session. 
 - Retrieval: patristic, medieval, and Reformation sources show ascension as constitutive of Christ's mediatorial office and the church's identity. 
 - Theological construction: the ascension secures Christ's continued human existence before the Father, grounds his intercession and heavenly priesthood, and institutes the sending of the Spirit and the church. 
 - Ecclesial and sacramental implications: sacraments are not merely memorials but signs/means tied to the ascended Christ's presence and rule; liturgy and polity flow from the ascension-shaped economy. 
 - Eschatological framing: ascension is the inauguration of the kingdom's realized-not-yet character; it is the hinge between redemption accomplished and redemption consummated.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic witnesses (e.g., Irenaeus, Athanasius) and medieval/Reformation authorities (Augustine, Calvin, Owen) for retrieval; engages moderns such as Barth and Moltmann as critical interlocutors; interacts with contemporary sacramental and ecclesiological scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Christology (continuing human nature, exaltation), soteriology (mediation, atonement in its relational consequences), pneumatology (sending and indwelling), ecclesiology (mission, office, sacraments), sacramentology (Eucharist, baptism), eschatology (already/not-yet), Trinity (economic relations).
- **Closing line:** 
 - Farrow centers Christian doctrine and practice on the ascended, reigning Christ: the ascension is the doctrinal pivot that secures Christ's mediatorial presence, sacramental efficacy, and the church's mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on the **continuing human nature** of the ascended Christ as metaphysical and soteriological necessity. 
 - Presentation of the ascension as the decisive act that institutes Christ's **mediatorial rule** (not merely a spatial relocation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects tendencies in modern theology that privatize or spiritualize Christ's presence (either by demythologizing ascension or by reducing it to symbol). 
 - Counters pietistic or purely ethical readings that separate personal piety from the ascension-grounded ecclesial life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Emphasizes the language of **session/exaltation** as doctrinally rich (rather than treating ascension as a mere movement). 
 - Reframes sacrament talk around the ascended Lord's **delegated presence** rather than mere memorial or purely spiritual presence.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Influential among conservative Reformed and Anglican scholars seeking to recover classical Christology and sacramental ecclesiology; cited in liturgical theology, sacramental studies, and ecclesial polity debates. 
 - Provoked debate with theologians who prioritize other moments of the economy (e.g., atonement-centered or Spirit-centered accounts).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a concise corrective to historically truncated Christologies; useful as a bridge between historical theology and constructive ecclesiology. Excellent for courses on Christology, sacrament, and the doctrine of the church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ascension:** the upward movement and enthronement of Christ; treated as inaugurating his mediatorial rule and continuing human existence before the Father. 
- **Exaltation/Session:** Christ's installation "at the right hand" - emphasized as ontologically significant, not merely honorific. 
- **Mediatorial Office:** the active, ongoing ministry of the ascended Christ (intercession, kingship, priesthood). 
- **Heavenly Priesthood:** the ascended Christ's continuing sacerdotal activity - basis for intercession and the application of redemption. 
- **Continuing Human Nature:** doctrine that the incarnate human nature of Christ persists in heaven; necessary for intercession and eschatological solidarity. 
- **Presence (delegated/sacramental):** how the ascended Christ is truly present to the church - via Spirit and sacraments, not by bodily proximity alone. 
- **Sending/Paraclete:** the ascension grounds the sending of the Spirit and thus the church's ongoing life and mission. 
- **Eschatological Already/Not-Yet:** ascension as the pivot that inaugurates the kingdom while promising future consummation. 
- **Covenant Fulfillment:** ascension as culmination of covenantal promises - the enthroned Lord embodies covenantal mediation. 
- **Sacramentology (Eucharist/Baptism):** sacraments as means tied to the ascended Lord's presence and authority; liturgy participates in heavenly reality. 
- **Intercession:** Christ's ongoing advocacy before the Father grounded in his exalted human life. 
- **Trinitarian Economy:** ascension's role for understanding roles within the Godhead - Son's glorification and Spirit's sending.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary doctrine of ascension/exaltation and session. 
 - As an **exegetical and ecclesiological model** tying Luke-Acts and Pauline accounts of ascension to sacramental practice and church order. 
 - As a **polemic** against both demythologizing liberal theology and privatizing pietism. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology (person and work) to sacrament, mission, and eschatology in teaching and preaching.
