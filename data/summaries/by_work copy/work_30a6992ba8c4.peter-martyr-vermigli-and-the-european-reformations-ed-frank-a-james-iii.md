### TITLE
Peter Martyr Vermigli and the European Reformations (ed. Frank A. James III) - research notes on the theological corpus and the volume's focal themes, with attention to: **Reformation Ecclesiology**; **Hypothetical Adam (What If Adam Had Not Sinned)**; **Baptism (mode, infant vs. believer, efficacy)**; **Lord's Supper (presence of Christ; fencing and admission)**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Italian Reformer operating in the broader European Reformations; academic and ecclesial posts in Strasbourg, Oxford, and Zurich.
 - Operates at the intersection of humanist patristic retrieval, late scholastic method, and Reformed pastoral/apologetic concerns.
 - The James volume collects studies that historicize and analyze Vermigli's responses to continental and English controversies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Vermigli aims to articulate a consistently **federal/forensic** Reformed theology that integrates sacramental realism, ecclesial discipline, and a rigorous Christocentric covenantal logic - answering both Catholic sacramentalism and radical reformers (e.g., Anabaptists).
 - He uses scholastic categories to defend a spiritual-real presence of Christ in the sacraments and to regulate church membership and communion.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological recovery: reconstruct Vermigli's positions across pastoral, liturgical, and scholastic registers.
 - Doctrinal synthesis:
 - Covenant theology and federal headship as central explanatory principle.
 - Sacraments as instrumental causes conveying grace (instrumental causality), not meritorious or magical signs.
 - Ecclesial order: discipline, office, and communion admission as necessary for visible holiness.
 - Method: careful exegesis of Scripture informed by Augustine and selective scholastic formalization.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine and patristic witnesses, Bucer, Calvin (consonant but distinctive in method), Melanchthon, Catholic polemicists (e.g., Pole), and Anabaptist critiques.
 - English Reformation contacts: Cranmer and Oxford debates that shaped Anglican reception.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (federal headship), justification (forensic), Christology (mediatorial presence), sacramentology (baptism and Eucharist), ecclesiology (visible church, discipline), providence and hypothetical theology.

- **Selected topical references in the volume**
 - **Reformation Ecclesiology** - Vermigli's defense of ordered worship, offices, and communion discipline (see essay on ecclesial order).
 - **What If Adam Had Not Sinned** - Vermigli's cautious use of hypothetical theology to clarify providence and the necessity of Christ's redeeming work (essay on hypothetical questions).
 - **Baptism: mode, infant vs. believer, efficacy** - polemic against Anabaptists; baptism as covenant sign/seal effective in union but not automatic regeneration.
 - **Lord's Supper: presence of Christ; fencing and admission** - formulation of spiritual-real presence and insistence on visible faith and church discipline for communion.

- **Closing line**
 - Vermigli's theological center of gravity is a **Augustinian, covenantal, scholastically articulated Reformed orthodoxy** that seeks to secure Christ's mediatorial efficacy in sacraments and the moral-ecclesial integrity of the visible church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong use of **instrumental causality**: sacraments as real instruments by which Christ conveys grace, distinct from physical presence or transubstantiation.
 - Robust **federal (covenantal) framing** of soteriology and ecclesiology: corporate headship explains election, sacramental inclusion, and discipline.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Clarifies and sometimes corrects Bucer and Melanchthon on sacramental language by insisting on both realism and rejection of corporal presence.
 - Opposes Catholic notion of sacramental merit while also resisting Anabaptist reduction of sacraments to mere signs.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Terminological move toward scholastic precision in Reformed settings: refined uses of "instrument," "causality," "federal headship," and "respectus" in hypothetical theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major influence on English Reformation theologians (especially Oxford debates) and later Reformed scholasticism; used as a bridge between humanist-patristic exegesis and systematic scholastic clarity.
 - Reclaimed by modern scholars as key early Reformed systematic voice beyond Calvin-centric narratives.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to integrate pastoral discipline, sacramental theology, and systematic precision; valuable for ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and studies in Reformed method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant / Federal Headship** - corporate representation; Adam and Christ as federal heads; explains inclusion (infant baptism) and imputation.
- **Instrumental Causality** - sacraments as instruments by which Christ effects grace (real but non-corporeal).
- **Spiritual Real Presence** - Christ truly present to believers in the Lord's Supper by the Holy Spirit; rejects corporeal ubiquity.
- **Fencing the Table** - practice of excluding scandalous or unrepentant persons from communion; admission conditioned on visible faith and discipline.
- **Admission / Visible Faith** - criterion for sacramental participation; distinguishes external sign from interior faith that receives benefit.
- **Infant Baptism (sign and seal)** - infants receive covenant sign and are members of visible church; efficacy depends on covenant promise and prevenient grace, not automatic regeneration.
 - Contrast: stands against Anabaptist believer-only model while rejecting baptismal regeneration in a Catholic sense.
- **Mode of Baptism** - mode (immersion/affusion) secondary; theological focus on sign-seal function and covenantal logic.
- **Hypothetical Theology (What If Adam Had Not Sinned)** - controlled scholastic exercise to display divine decree, contingency, and the necessity/coherence of Christ's mediatorial plan.
- **Forensic Justification** - legal imputation of Christ's righteousness central to salvation schema.
- **Church Order / Ecclesial Offices** - insistence on ordered ministry and public worship as means of sustaining covenantal life.
- **Patristic Retrieval** - heavy reliance on Augustine and selected Church Fathers to anchor Reformed claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental realism and covenantal ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Anabaptist and Roman positions on baptism and the Eucharist.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline covenant readings and sacramental interpretation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in studies of discipline, communal membership, and the ethics of admission to the Lord's Table.
