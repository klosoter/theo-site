### TITLE
**God of the Possible: A Biblical Introduction to the Open View of God** 
Gregory A. Boyd. Baker Books, 2000 (paperback 2004). Popular‑academic presentation advocating Open Theism with sustained biblical exegesis, philosophical defense, and pastoral application.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th century evangelical milieu: response to classical theism, Molinism, and deterministic Reformed models; part of broader "Open Theism" movement (Sanders, Pinnock, Laing).
 - Aimed at pastors, students, and engaged lay readers amid debates on providence, prayer, and the problem of evil.
- **Central thesis**
 - God is supremely powerful and omniscient with respect to what can be known, yet the future contains genuine possibilities because free agents make undetermined choices; God knows all possibilities and actualities but does not exhaustively know future free acts as settled facts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: readings of key biblical passages that depict God as responsive, changing, bargaining, or surprised (e.g., Genesis 6, Exodus 32, Jonah, Abraham, many prophetic conditionalities).
 - Philosophical and theological defense: argues classical assumptions about exhaustive foreknowledge rest on anachronistic metaphysics; defends coherence of divine omniscience without exhaustive future-settlement.
 - Pastoral implications: prayer as meaningful influence, genuine relationship, God's engagement with suffering, and theodicy reframed by a "risk‑taking" divine love.
 - Objections and replies: addresses charges of undermining divine sovereignty, reliability of prophecy, and biblical teaching about God's foreknowledge.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Allies: Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, other Open Theists. 
 - Primary interlocutors: classical theists (Augustine/Aquinas tradition), Molinists (Luis de Molina; contemporary defenders like William Lane Craig), conservative critics within evangelicalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine foreknowledge, omniscience, omnipotence, sovereignty, omnipresence, prayer, human freedom, the problem of evil, and aspects of biblical revelation and prophecy.
- **Closing line**
 - Boyd casts God as a **loving, responsive, risk‑taking sovereign**: omniscient over all that can be known, yet dynamically engaged with genuinely free creatures in a future that is partly open.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong biblical hermeneutic emphasizing narrative instances where God appears to change course, supporting a theology of relationality and responsiveness.
 - Portrays divine omnipotence in persuasive rather than coercive terms - God works providentially by influencing rather than determining free agents.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges classical theism's view of exhaustive divine foreknowledge and impassibility; rejects Molinist "middle knowledge" as philosophically and theologically unsatisfying for explaining genuine freedom and biblical relationality.
 - Contrasts with deterministic Calvinist accounts by affirming meaningful creaturely freedom that genuinely constrains future facts.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Popularizes the phrase **"God of the Possible"** to foreground a God who acts within an open future; reframes sovereignty as the ability to bring good from contingencies rather than micromanaging outcomes.
 - Emphasizes **divine risk** as a theological category-God chooses to grant creaturely freedom even at the cost of vulnerability to evil.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Substantially influential in late 20th-early 21st century evangelical debates; widely used in pastoral and seminary contexts to defend open theism.
 - Provoked strong criticisms from many conservative evangelical scholars who argue Boyd undermines biblical assurances and classical attributes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, accessible synthesis of biblical examples, pastoral applications, and philosophical claims-useful for teaching providence, prayer, and contemporary theodicy debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism** - The view that the future is partly open and not exhaustively settled; God knows all possibilities and actualities but not future free choices as settled facts.
- **Divine foreknowledge (limited/functional)** - God's knowledge includes all truths but future contingent free acts are not knowable as definite propositions until they occur.
- **Future openness** - The ontological claim that some future events are not fixed; consequential for prophecy, prayer, and providence.
- **Genuine free will** - Human (and creaturely) freedom is real and indeterministic; it constrains which future outcomes become actual.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism)** - The doctrine that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; Boyd critiques its coherence and biblical adequacy.
- **Risk‑taking God** - Terminology for divine self‑limitation in service of relational love; God accepts the possibility of being thwarted by free creatures.
- **Divine sovereignty reinterpreted** - Sovereignty understood as relational governance and persuasive power rather than exhaustive determinative control.
- **Prophecy and conditionality** - Prophetic announcements can be conditional forecasts; fulfilled prophecy consistent with open future when interpreted as contingent promises/warnings.
- **Prayer as influence** - Prayer is genuinely efficacious in changing outcomes because the future is responsive to creaturely acts.
- **Divine omniscience (reframed)** - Boyd affirms omniscience but distinguishes between knowledge of all that is knowable now and knowledge of settled future free actions.
- **Impassibility vs. impassioned God** - Rejects strict impassibility; God experiences relational give-and-take without compromising divine perfection.
- **Theodicy reorientation** - Suffering and evil partly explained by genuine creaturely freedom in an open future; God works to bring good from contingent evils.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for popular descriptions of Open Theism in classes and sermons.
 - As a **polemical resource** against classical foreknowledge and Molinist accounts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading responsive texts of Scripture (prayer, prophecy, divine "regret").
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology emphasizing prayerfulness, relationality, and a non‑coercive understanding of divine agency.
