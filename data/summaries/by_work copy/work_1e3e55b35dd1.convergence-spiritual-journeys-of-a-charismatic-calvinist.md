### TITLE
**Convergence: Spiritual Journeys of a Charismatic Calvinist** - Sam Storms 
A memoir-theology arguing for the integration of robust Reformed soteriology with practiced charismatic gifts.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelicalism amid the New Calvinism and Third Wave renewal currents.
 - Reformed resurgence (Piper, Edwards retrieval) intersects with Vineyard-influenced continuationism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can one hold classic Calvinist convictions and yet pursue and practice contemporary gifts of the Spirit without compromising Sola Scriptura, order, or holiness?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Narrative turn:** Storms recounts a shift from cautious or functional cessationism to convicted continuationism.
 - **Exegetical case:** Texts like 1 Cor 12-14; Eph 4; Rom 12; Acts; 1 Thess 5 ground ongoing gifts, with 1 Cor 13:8-12 read eschatologically, not as canonicity.
 - **Theological synthesis:** Edwardsian affectional Calvinism and already/not-yet eschatology frame gifts as means for Christ-centered joy and church edification.
 - **Pastoral practice:** Concrete guidelines for prophecy, healing prayer, and corporate order; emphasize testing, accountability, and humility.
 - **Sanctification link:** Gifts foster holiness by intensifying love, repentance, and service; power and fruit are inseparable.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Partners: Jonathan Edwards, John Piper, Wayne Grudem, D. A. Carson.
 - Dialogue and critique: B. B. Warfield, John MacArthur, traditional cessationist readings.
 - Renewal influence: John Wimber; practical wisdom from Third Wave praxis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture:** Sola Scriptura with non-canonical, fallible congregational prophecy.
 - **Pneumatology:** Distribution and purpose of charismata; do not quench the Spirit.
 - **Ecclesiology:** Edification, order, and discernment in gathered worship.
 - **Sanctification:** Spirit-empowered growth; affections, assurance, and holiness.
 - **Providence and sovereignty:** Calvinist compatibilism governing gift-seeking and suffering.
 - **Eschatology:** Already/not-yet as rationale for partial knowledge and ongoing gifts.
- **Closing line**
 - The triune God fuels a church that treasures Christ through the Word while earnestly desiring and wisely stewarding the Spirit's gifts for love-driven edification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Word-and-Spirit convergence:** High confessional Reformed theology with active charismatic practice.
 - **Affectional Calvinism:** Edwardsian joy and holy affections as telos of gifts.
 - **Pastoral safeguards:** Clear protocols for weighing prophecy, shared accountability, and ordered worship.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters cessationism by exegeting 1 Cor 13 as consummation, not canon; reads Heb 2 as descriptive, not limiting.
 - Rejects anti-intellectualism and perfectionism within charismatic circles; insists on theological depth and sanctification.
 - Resists equating prophecy with Scripture; distinguishes inspiration from illumination and impressions.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Convergence** as an ecclesial paradigm: neither experientialism without doctrine nor doctrine without power.
 - **Fallible congregational prophecy** under Sola Scriptura and community testing.
 - **Risk-taking prayer** married to rigorous discernment and pastoral order.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Gateway text for Reformed-charismatic pastors and students; often cited alongside Grudem and Carson as responsible continuationism.
 - Pushback from strict cessationists; appreciated in Acts 29 and broader evangelical contexts seeking ordered practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a biblically argued, pastorally realistic model for practicing gifts that advances sanctification.
 - Serves as a bridge resource in courses or churches debating continuationism vs cessationism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Convergence:** Integration of Reformed doctrine and charismatic practice in the local church.
- **Continuationism:** View that all New Testament gifts continue until Christ's return.
 - Contrast: **Cessationism** limits miraculous gifts to the apostolic era for canon authentication.
- **Word and Spirit:** Mutual primacy of Scripture and the Spirit's present operations; no competition, only ordered synergy.
- **Already/Not Yet:** Eschatological tension explaining partial, imperfect operations of gifts and need for discernment.
- **Congregational prophecy (fallible):** Spirit-prompted speech subject to testing; aims at edification, not revelation of doctrine.
- **Weighing/discernment:** Corporate testing of impressions per 1 Thess 5:19-21 and 1 Cor 14:29.
- **Earnestly desire the gifts:** Apostolic imperative (1 Cor 14:1) interpreted as normative for the church.
- **Sola Scriptura vs. extra-canonical speech:** Scripture as final norm; gifts function ministerially, not magisterially.
- **Sanctification through gifts:** Charismata as means to deepen love, repentance, and mission; fruit authenticates power.
- **Power and order:** Pursuit of healing, prophecy, and tongues within biblically governed liturgical structure.
- **Affectional Calvinism:** Edwardsian account of Spirit-wrought joy as the heart of holiness and gift-practice.
- **Pastoral safeguards:** Protocols for accountability, correction, and boundaries against abuse.
- **Quenching the Spirit:** Warning against principled refusal of gifts; balanced by testing to avoid credulity.
- **Edification:** Governing criterion for public exercise of gifts in ecclesial settings.

- **How this work is used**
 - As an exegetical and theological model in debates on continuationism vs cessationism.
 - As a pastoral manual for implementing spiritual gifts in ordered worship.
 - As a framework linking spiritual gifts and sanctification in discipleship curricula.
