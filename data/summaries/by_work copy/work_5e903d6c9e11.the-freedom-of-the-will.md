### TITLE
**The Freedom of the Will** (1754) - Jonathan Edwards

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-18th century New England, post-Great Awakening; pastoral and apologetic defense of Calvinist orthodoxy amid Arminian and Enlightenment critiques.
 - Interacts with Lockean psychology and Anglo-American debates on liberty, moral agency, and responsibility.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Compatibilism:** Human freedom is doing as one wills; the will is determined by the strongest motive as apprehended by the mind.
 - **Natural ability vs moral inability:** Sinners retain faculties but lack righteous disposition; thus they cannot will the good though they ought.
 - Asserts harmony between **divine decree/foreknowledge** and genuine human responsibility.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Defines **will, liberty, moral agency**, and the conditions of praise/blame.
 - Refutes **liberty of indifference** and the **self-determining power**; volitions are events that require causes; indeterminism yields regress and chance.
 - Clarifies **necessity, certainty, contingency**; establishes **moral necessity** of volitions from character and motives.
 - Distinguishes **natural ability** (powers) from **moral inability** (bias of heart); obligation tracks ability of faculties, not holiness of disposition.
 - Answers objections: divine **foreknowledge** entails certainty; certainty is compatible with responsibility; God is not the author of sin though he decrees all that comes to pass.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages **Daniel Whitby**, **Thomas Chubb**, broader Arminian and libertarian positions; uses **Locke** on ideas and power.
 - In Reformed lineage with **Augustine** and Protestant scholastics; heavy scriptural appeal.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Doctrine of sin:** total depravity, inability, nature of sin's dominion.
 - **Theology proper:** providence, decree, foreknowledge, problem of evil.
 - **Anthropology and soteriology:** will, affections, grace, merit, praise/blame.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center: **God's sovereign, wise determination of all things coexists with human accountability because responsibility rests in the moral quality of the will, not in indeterminate choice.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The crisp **natural ability / moral inability** distinction safeguarding both duty and dependence on grace.
 - **Strongest motive thesis**: the will follows the greatest apparent good.
 - Defines **moral necessity** as certainty arising from character without external compulsion.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contra **Arminian liberty of indifference** and **self-determining will**; rejects grounding responsibility in the sheer power to do otherwise.
 - Affirms that inability does not excuse, since it is moral and culpable, not natural and excusing.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of **necessity/certainty/contingency** distinctions.
 - Integrates a psychology of **affections/dispositions** with moral theory.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical for Reformed **compatibilism**; formative for New England theology and Old Princeton.
 - Critiqued by Methodist and analytic **libertarians**; still central in debates on foreknowledge, providence, and responsibility.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides durable definitions for teaching **sin and free will**, **total inability**, and **divine providence**.
 - Offers a conceptual framework that handles **problem of evil** without collapsing moral agency.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Will / Volition**: The mind's choosing; an event requiring a cause, not a first mover of itself.
- **Moral Agency**: Fitness for praise/blame grounded in rational faculties and moral quality of the will.
- **Liberty of Indifference**: The view that true freedom requires power to choose otherwise in the moment of choice; Edwards rejects.
- **Self-Determining Power**: A will causing its own acts without prior motive; criticized as incoherent and regressive.
- **Strongest Motive / Greatest Apparent Good**: The immediate cause of volition is the motive that appears best to the agent.
 - Not bare hedonism; tracks perceived total reasons.
- **Necessity vs Certainty vs Contingency**:
 - **Certainty**: Event will infallibly occur.
 - **Necessity**: Broadly, inability to be otherwise; morally, fixed by character and motives.
 - **Contingency**: Absence of constraint does not imply indeterminism.
- **Natural Ability vs Moral Inability**:
 - **Natural ability**: Possession of requisite faculties, opportunities, and powers.
 - **Moral inability**: Vicious disposition barring holy volitions; culpable.
- **Disposition / Habit of Heart**: Stable inclination shaping motives; seat of virtue/vice.
- **Moral Necessity**: The certainty of willing according to disposition; excludes compulsion.
- **Praise and Blame**: Track the will's moral quality, not indeterminate alternatives.
- **Divine Foreknowledge**: God's infallible knowledge renders events certain but not coerced.
- **Divine Decree and Providence**: God ordains all things, including free acts, without being the author of sin.
- **Author of Sin**: Denied; God orders evil permissively and for wise ends, while creatures are the proximate, blameworthy causes.
- **Original Righteousness and Fall**: Adam possessed natural ability and original rectitude; his fall shows will's dependence on motive; counterfactually, perseverance would have exhibited the same compatibilist liberty under holy disposition.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Definition source** for freedom, will, ability, and responsibility in anthropology and hamartiology.
 - **Polemic resource** against Arminian/libertarian accounts in doctrines of sin, grace, and election.
 - **Conceptual pivot** for providence, decree, and foreknowledge in theology proper and theodicy.
 - **Pedagogical framework** for preaching total depravity/total inability alongside full moral accountability.
