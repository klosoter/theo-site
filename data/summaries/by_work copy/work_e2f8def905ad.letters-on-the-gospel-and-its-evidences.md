### TITLE
**Letters on the Gospel and Its Evidences - Andrew Fuller**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 18th-early 19th century Particular Baptist / evangelical revival milieu in England. Fuller writes amid disputes over evangelistic duty, assurance, and the relationship of faith and works; the letters address both internal Baptist controversies (antinomian and hyper‑Calvinist tendencies) and broader objections to Christian truth.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Gospel is self-attesting by its effects in the believer; **good works are necessary evidences of union with Christ and sanctification, but they do not constitute merit before God or ground justification**. Fuller seeks to vindicate the compatibility of free justification by grace with the moral requirement of holiness in the covenant of grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of the Gospel's nature and how it bears witness to itself (scriptural, experiential, and moral dimensions).
 - Analysis of the role of repentance, faith, and obedience as simultaneous elements of the Christian life-obedience as fruit and evidence, not as a meritorious cause of acceptance.
 - Pastoral application: how believers may obtain assurance by attending to the Gospel's inward and outward evidences (affection, conformity to Christ, persevering obedience).
 - Apologetic moves against both antinomian laxity (which denies the necessity of works) and legalistic merit claims (which would make works the ground of justification).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis is primary; Fuller converses with contemporary Baptist colleagues and opponents (notably hyper‑Calvinist and antinomian voices), and addresses Enlightenment sceptical objections by appealing to evidential and experiential grounds for faith.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant of grace, justification by faith, sanctification, assurance, good works, merit (denied), imputation (positional righteousness), evidences of conversion.
- **Closing line:** Fuller locates theological equilibrium in the covenant of grace: **justification is by free grace through faith alone, while holy obedience is the necessary and divinely appointed evidence of that faith, never its meritorious ground.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insistence on **good works as evidences** rather than as contributors to merit-Fuller sharpens the pastoral, evidentiary function of sanctification.
 - Pastoral evidentialism: cultivates assurance through observed moral fruit combined with trust in the promises, not introspective perfectionism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against antinomian readings that separate salvation from moral transformation.
 - Opposes a distorted "works‑merit" theology that would make obedience a ground of acceptance; reasserts forensic justification alongside moral obligation.
 - Counters hyper‑Calvinist passivity by affirming duty to evangelize and to expect conversion signs.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinguishes carefully between **"evidence"** (what demonstrates a real change) and **"merit"** (what earns acceptance), using covenant language to keep these concepts distinct.
 - Uses covenantal categories to integrate justification and sanctification without conflating causal relations.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among Particular Baptists and the early modern missionary movement (Fuller as a key figure in promoting evangelical missions).
 - Adopted by later evangelical and Baptist pastoral traditions as a model for handling assurance and the faith‑works relation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Provides a compact, pastorally sensitive, and theologically coherent treatment balancing justification and sanctification; valuable for pastoral theology, covenant instruction, and polemics against both antinomianism and legalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace:** The framework Fuller uses to show that covenantal promises secure justification by faith while obliging believers to holy living as covenant fruit.
- **Good Works:** Defined chiefly as the **necessary evidence** of union with Christ and sanctification; morally required but not meritorious for justification.
 - Evidence vs. meritorious cause: evidence points to a past gracious act of God, not as payment or earning.
- **Merit:** Rejected as a ground of acceptance in salvation; Fuller warns against any doctrine that attributes saving merit to human obedience.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration by grace through faith alone; distinguished from sanctification and not altered by subsequent moral performance.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive renewal and the realm of moral evidence; the sphere in which good works rightly function.
- **Assurance:** Attained by attending to the Gospel's promises and to accompanying evidences (affection, repentance, obedience), without transforming assurance into perfectionism.
- **Evidences of Conversion:** The suite of inward (faith, repentance, love) and outward (fruit, perseverance) signs that the Gospel furnishes to the believer and community.
- **Faith:** Instrumental and trusting reception of Christ; always accompanied by repentance and fruit in Fuller's schema.
- **Duty and Evangelism:** Practical outworking of covenant obligation; Fuller uses evangelistic duty against hyper‑Calvinist inhibition.
- **Forensic/Experimental Distinction:** Fuller preserves both the forensic (justification) and experimental (assurance, sanctification) aspects without collapsing them.
- **Means of Grace:** Means by which sanctification and evidences are wrought (preaching, sacraments, prayer) - reinforced as duties, not merit‑builders.
- **Moral Government of God:** Underpins Fuller's pastoral appeals-God requires holiness and expects fruits without deriving justification from them.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical/Baptist articulation that separates merit from evidential works within covenant theology.
- As a **polemic text** against antinomianism and hyper‑Calvinism, and as an **exegetical‑pastoral model** for grounding assurance in Scripture and observable fruit.
