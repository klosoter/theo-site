### TITLE
Works of James Arminius, trans. Peter Y. DeJong, James Nichols, and William R. Bagnall (3 vols.) - Jacobus Arminius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 16th-early 17th century Dutch Reformed milieu (Leiden). Arminius (1560-1609) wrote amid rising scholastic Calvinism and the emerging Remonstrant controversy (formalized 1610).
 - Engages post-Reformation scholastic categories while reading Scripture with analytic precision; many writings are disputations, sermons, and treatises later collected and translated.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How are Adam's sin and its consequences related to the sin and condemnation of his descendants? Specifically: what is the nature of original sin and in what sense (if any) is Adam's guilt imputed to his posterity?
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirmation of original sin as universal inherited corruption and mortality: human nature is depraved after Adam and lacks original righteousness.
 - Careful distinction between kinds of "imputation":
 - Denies that Adam's personal guilt is directly and immediately imputed to each descendant as a juridical act independent of any real connection.
 - Affirms a form of derived or consequential guilt because descendants participate in Adam's corrupt nature (propagation/seminal transmission) and thus are sinners and liable to death/condemnation.
 - Exegetical hinge on Romans 5 and 1 Cor 15: interprets "in Adam all die" as death and sin transmitted by natural propagation, with representative dimensions in Adam's headship.
 - Uses a blend of biblical exegesis, logical distinctions (nature vs. guilt; original vs. actual sin), and pastoral concerns to correct what he sees as theological and pastoral excesses.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal interlocutors: contemporary Reformed scholastics (notably Franciscus Gomarus and the strict federalist school) and classical sources (Augustine, scholastic manuals). Also engages Scripture centrally and the theological vocabulary of concupiscence, privation, and federal headship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin (nature, transmission, effects)
 - Imputation (forensic, representative, derived)
 - Human inability and depravity (distinctions between natural and supernatural inability)
 - Soteriological implications (need for Christ, atonement, justification) as corollaries
- **Closing line**
 - Arminius seeks a mediating position: robustly affirming inherited corruption and the need for redemption while rejecting an immediate forensic imputation of Adam's personal guilt to each individual, thereby reframing imputation in relational/ontological and representative terms rather than purely juridical fiat.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precision in conceptual distinctions: original sin as a real, transmitted corruption (ontological) versus the juridical imputation of guilt; stresses participation and propagation over abstract forensic accounting.
 - Pastoral sensitivity: wants doctrines stated so as not to make God the author of sin or to cast infants as punished for a purely extrinsic legal act.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges strict federalism that reads Romans 5 as requiring direct, immediate forensic imputation of Adam's guilt; opposes any account that detaches the reality of inherited corruption from the moral culpability of descendants.
 - Pushes back on Pelagian/Semipelagian minimizations of original corruption while also resisting an overly deterministic guilt-imputationism within some Calvinist presentations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinguishes multiple "senses" of imputation (representative/federal, natural/propagative, forensic/consequential) and insists the term be used with care.
 - Uses a more psychological/ontological idiom for transmitted corruption (propagation, seminal headship) alongside legal language.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Core intellectual source for Remonstrant formulations (Remonstrance, 1610) and for later Arminian theologies (notably Wesleyanism).
 - Rejected or contested by Reformed orthodox critics (Gomarus and the Contra-Remonstrants); nevertheless remains a primary text for moderating Reformed claims about imputation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful exegetical-theological nuance on contested biblical texts (Romans 5); valuable for teaching distinctions between nature, guilt, and representation in historical and systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin** - inherited corruption and loss of original righteousness transmitted from Adam.
- **Imputation** - polyvalent term; Arminius distinguishes:
 - **Forensic imputation**: direct juridical accounting of guilt (which he denies as immediate from Adam to all).
 - **Representative/federal imputation**: Adam as head whose act has representative consequences.
 - **Natural/propagative imputation**: transmission of corruption by generation (seminal headship).
- **Seminal transmission** - the biological/ontological mode by which corruption and mortality pass from Adam to descendants.
- **Federal headship** - Adam as covenantal representative whose act has representative consequences (Arminius accepts representative dimensions but limits immediate forensic transfer).
- **Guilt vs. corruption** - guilt (culpa) as juridical blame; corruption (malitia/peccatum originale) as privation and bent to sin.
- **Actual sin** - personal, voluntary sins distinct from original sin; moral responsibility flows from actual sins grounded in corrupt nature.
- **Natural inability** - inability to do good due to corruption; distinct from supernatural inability (e.g., inability without prevenient grace).
- **Privation of original righteousness** - loss of the prelapsarian right standing and powers given to Adam.
- **Romans 5 exegesis** - key proof-text; Arminius reads "in Adam all die" as indicative of real propagation and representation, not merely abstract juridical transfer.
- **Representative (analogical) language** - Arminius prefers language that preserves both ontological connection and legal consequence without endorsing immediate forensic imputation.
- **Participation/solidarity** - humans are in Adam's loins; solidarity explains why the consequences of Adam's fall come to humanity.
- **Consequential imputation** - guilt that follows from being a sinner by nature, rather than an arbitrary forensic decree.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for nuanced distinctions within doctrines of original sin and imputation.
 - As a **polemic resource** against absolutist federal-imputation readings in Reformed orthodoxy.
 - As an **exegetical model** for treating Romans 5 and Pauline anthropology by coordinating representation and propagation.
