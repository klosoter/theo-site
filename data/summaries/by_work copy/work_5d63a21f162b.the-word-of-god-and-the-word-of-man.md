### TITLE
**Karl Barth, The Word of God and the Word of Man** (essays and lectures, chiefly 1916-1925; Eng. trans. 1928). Early dialectical theology after the first edition of Romans, articulating the primacy of Gods self-speaking over religion, culture, and church.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-WWI crisis theology; Barth breaks with liberal Protestantism in German-speaking Europe. Engages the university, pastors, and laity via lectures on Scripture, preaching, and theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can fallible human words mediate the infallible Word of God? Barth answers: Gods Word is a free, sovereign **event** in which Scripture and proclamation become the Word of God by the Holy Spirit.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - The Bible confronts us as a **strange new world**, not a storehouse of religious experience. Revelation is Gods address, not human ascent.
 - **Threefold form** of the Word: revelation in Jesus Christ; the prophetic-apostolic Scriptures as normative witness; church proclamation that serves this witness.
 - **Authority and self-attestation:** Scripture attests Christ and, in the Spirits power, authenticates itself as Gods Word in the act of God speaking.
 - **Preaching and theology:** Preaching stands under promise and judgment; theology serves proclamation through prayerful exegesis and critical listening.
 - **Church and kingdom:** The church is a hearing and witnessing community, never identical with the kingdom. Visibility is ambiguous; the church remains under Gods hidden rule.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Against Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Troeltsch, historicism, and cultural Protestantism; receptive to Luther and Calvin on Word and preaching; influenced by Kierkegaard on the infinite qualitative distinction; engages modern exegesis while subordinating it to the text.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; inspiration and inerrancy (recast as event and service); Holy Spirit and illumination; Christology of the Word; nature and task of theology; church, proclamation, and the kingdom; canon and tradition.
- **Closing line:** Gods Word is Jesus Christ speaking by the Spirit through prophetic-apostolic witness and empowered proclamation; the church lives by hearing, not by possessing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Word-of-God-as-event and the **becoming** of Scripture and preaching as Gods Word.
 - **Threefold form** tightly ordered to Christ as the center of revelation.
 - Scripture as **witness** with real authority without ascribing a property of inerrancy to the paper-ink object.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against liberalism: revelation is not religious consciousness but Gods free act.
 - Against fundamentalism: authority does not rest in a theory of textual inerrancy but in the Spirits self-attestation of Christ through Scripture.
 - Against ecclesial positivism: church and kingdom are not identical; the church stands under judgment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Strange new world of the Bible; Word-event; freedom of God; witness; the church as hearing community; theology as prayerful science; threefold Word.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Reoriented Reformed and wider Protestant bibliology toward a christological-pneumatological center.
 - Shaped homiletics emphasizing proclamation as an event of divine address.
 - Sparked debates on canon, inspiration, and the visible-invisible church distinction.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A seminal primer for reading Barth on Scripture before Church Dogmatics I-1.
 - Pedagogically powerful for courses on revelation, preaching, and ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God vs. Word of Man:** Divine speech addresses through human witness; the two are not identical yet can coincide in Gods act.
- **Event (Ereignis):** Revelation is an occurrence, not a possession; authority is enacted as God speaks.
- **Threefold form of the Word:** Revelation in Christ; Scripture as prophetic-apostolic witness; proclamation that serves the witness.
- **Witness:** The Bibles mode of authority; its human words point to and are taken up by God to speak Christ.
- **Self-attestation:** God authenticates his Word by his Spirit; certainty is given, not constructed.
- **Inspiration and inerrancy:** Inspiration is the Spirits freedom to use fallible texts infallibly for Gods purpose; inerrancy as a property of the text is displaced by christological truthfulness.
- **Canon and tradition:** Canon as normative witness recognized, not constituted, by the church; tradition serves, it does not rule.
- **Holy Spirit and illumination:** The Spirit effects both revelation and hearing, making Scripture and preaching Gods Word here and now.
- **Proclamation (kerygma):** Preaching is promised to become Gods Word yet remains under judgment of the Scriptural witness.
- **Nature and task of theology:** Theology listens, tests, and repeats; a churchly science performed in repentance and prayer.
- **Church visible and invisible:** The church appears in history yet its truth is hidden with Christ; marks found where Word is rightly preached.
- **Church and kingdom:** The kingdom is Gods rule in Christ; the church is a sign and servant, not the kingdom itself.
- **Christ as center:** Jesus Christ is both content and form of revelation; Scripture is true as it attests him.
- **Messianic kingdom:** Christs identity and mission determine the churchs proclamation and hope.

- **How the work is used across loci:**
 - Bibliology: source text for self-attestation, witness, and threefold Word.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: frames church as hearing-witnessing community under the kingdom.
 - Christology: anchors revelation in the person and work of Christ.
 - Prolegomena: models theology as service to the Word in prayerful exegesis and proclamation.
