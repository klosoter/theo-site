### TITLE
The Apostolic Preaching and Its Developments (1936) - C. H. Dodd

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1936 in interwar Britain amid vigorous historical-critical New Testament scholarship. Engages contemporary form- and tradition-criticism and the emerging "realized eschatology" debate; shaped by Dodd's Cambridge context and response to continental scholars (e.g., Bultmannian concerns about kerygma and myth).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The earliest Christian message (the *kerygma*) is a distinct, historically rooted proclamation centered on the death, resurrection, and messianic significance of Jesus; this primitive proclamation is then the formative matrix from which successive doctrinal developments arise, including responses to the Delay of the Parousia.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Identifies a succinct primitive kerygma consisting of annunciation, ministry, passion, resurrection, exaltation, and eschatological significance.
 - Argues that later theological language (Pauline theology, Gospel narratives, ecclesiastical formulations) are developments, re-articulations or expansions of that nucleus in response to pastoral, apologetic and apologetical needs.
 - Treats the *Delay of the Parousia* as a key pressure causing theological development: early eschatological imminence had to be reinterpreted when the expected parousia did not occur.
 - Distinguishes between proclamation (*kerygma*) and instruction (*didache*), showing how proclamation shapes and precedes doctrinal systematization.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive use of Pauline epistles, Synoptic traditions, early creedal material; engages methods and positions of German scholars (e.g., Bultmann), earlier British critics, and patristic echoes in reception history.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (Christ-event, exaltation), soteriology (resurrection as salvific center), eschatology (kingdom, parousia, realized vs. future), ecclesiology (proclamation shaping community), hermeneutics (tradition development).
- **Closing line:** Dodd locates the theological center of gravity in a historically anchored apostolic proclamation - the resurrection-event interpreted as present, transformative reality - whose subsequent doctrinal formations are intelligible responses to pastoral needs, notably the problem of the delayed Parousia.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Elevates the short, formulaic *kerygma* as the primary historical object for NT theology.
 - Emphasizes the *Christ-event* (death + resurrection + exaltation) as the decisive interpretive key - not abstract doctrinal systems.
 - Strong stress on the *eschatological present* or "realized eschatology": the kingdom is already operative in the risen Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Moves beyond purely doctrinal or dogmatic reconstructions; opposes teleological readings that retrofit later dogma into primitive proclamation.
 - In contrast to futurist eschatologies, Dodd interprets many early texts as addressing an already inaugurated kingdom rather than solely a remote future.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Systematizes the kerygma/didache distinction for historical-theological analysis.
 - Popularizes language of "development" (not degeneration) from proclamation to doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in mid-20th-century NT studies; a cornerstone for studies of the early Christian message and for the "realized eschatology" approach.
 - Provoked pushback from conservative exegetes (who argued Dodd minimizes futurity and historic continuity) and from some form-critical scholars (who challenged neat reconstructability of a unitary kerygma).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a durable heuristic for separating proclamation from later theological elaboration.
 - Remains a primary reference for studies on early proclamation and for discussions about how communities adapt doctrine to disappointed expectations (e.g., Delay of the Parousia).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma:** The apostolic proclamation nucleus (death, resurrection, exaltation; messianic significance).
- **Didache:** Teaching/instruction that follows and systematizes the kerygma into ethics, order, theology.
- **Christ-event:** The combined facts of Jesus' passion, resurrection, and exaltation as a single salvific occurrence.
- **Realized eschatology / eschatological present:** The claim that the kingdom of God is already present in the risen Christ, not only a future hope.
- **Parousia (Delay of the Parousia):** The anticipated return of Christ; Dodd analyzes how its delay necessitated reinterpretation and pastoral adaptation.
 - Sub-use: explains emergence of ethical exhortations, sacramental practices, and ecclesiastical order as responses to delay.
- **Development (of doctrine):** Non-linear, pastoral-historical unfolding from kerygma to doctrinal formulations.
- **Fulfillment language:** How early preaching reads Jesus' life and death as fulfilling Israel's scriptures - interpretive move central to the kerygma.
- **Primitive tradition / creedal formulas:** Short liturgical/creedal expressions seen as windows into earliest proclamation.
- **Exaltation:** Post-resurrection vindication and enthronement as theological pivot explaining continued presence.
- **Apologetic/pastoral reprise:** The way apostolic preaching reworks proclamation to meet new congregational needs.
- **Historicizing the proclamation:** Methodological stance treating kerygma as historically anchored, not purely mythic.
- **Immanence / imminence tension:** Dodd's account of how early expectations of imminent parousia are rebalanced by ethical and institutional stabilization.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "kerygma" and for distinguishing proclamation vs. doctrine.
- As an **exegetical model** to read NT texts as responses to pastoral pressures (notably the Delay of the Parousia).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates between realized and future eschatologies and in histories of early Christian doctrinal development.
