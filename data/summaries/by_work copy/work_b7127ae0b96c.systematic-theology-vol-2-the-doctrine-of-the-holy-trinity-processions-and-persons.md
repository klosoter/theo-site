### TITLE
Systematic Theology Vol. 2: The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: Processions and Persons - Katherine Sonderegger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Contemporary Anglican/academic theology (21st century). Part of an ongoing multi-volume constructive-retrieval project in systematic theology aiming to restore classical Trinitarian doctrine for church and academy.
 - Milieu: reaction to late‑20th/21st-century "social" and functional readings of the Trinity; engagement with patristic sources and medieval scholastic categories under renewed philosophical clarity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The orthodox doctrine of the Trinity requires a careful account of **eternal processions** (generation, spiration) as the ground of real personal distinctions without violating divine unity or simplicity; persons are grounded in relations of origin (not merely roles or modes).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical-historical retrieval: reads Cappadocians, Augustine, Aquinas to recover how processions and persons were conceived as metaphysically coherent.
 - Conceptual clarification: defines key terms (ousia, hypostasis, prosopon, relation) and their systematic roles; distinguishes immanent (intra-Trinitarian) from economic (salvific/historical) actions.
 - Theological construction: argues persons = subsistent relations; processions are eternal act-events within divine life (not temporal causes); maintains monarchy of the Father and perichoretic unity.
 - Practical-theological consequences: implications for Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology and prayer; resists reductions that turn persons into isolated centers of consciousness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa), Augustine, Pseudo‑Dionysius, Aquinas.
 - Modern interlocutors: Barth, Rahner, Jenson, contemporary "social" Trinitarian proponents (e.g., Moltmann, Zizioulas), analytic theology of God.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (processions, persons), divine simplicity, aseity, impassibility, perichoresis, economy/immanent Trinity distinction, properties/propria, relation and personhood.
- **Closing line**
 - Sonderegger locates the doctrine's center of gravity in a robustly classical, metaphysically disciplined account: persons are real, eternal subsistences rooted in processions that secure both personal distinction and ontological unity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm recovery of the **monarchy of the Father** alongside perichoretic mutuality - unity first, persons second as relations of origin.
 - Precise retrieval of patristic usage of hypostasis/prosopon without capitulating to modern sociological analogies.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back against "social" or pluralistic Trinitarian models that make persons independent centers or undermine simplicity.
 - Critiques some modern readings that temporalize processions or conflate economic acts with immanent processions.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Careful modern articulation of **persons as subsistent relations** that avoids both nominalism and excessive metaphysical composition.
 - Nuanced account of processions as eternal, non-temporal acts intrinsic to divine being.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Anglican and Reformed academic circles seeking classical clarity; praised for scholarship and pastoral seriousness.
 - Criticized by advocates of social Trinitarianism for perceived conservatism and for privileging metaphysical unity over relational plurality.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a rigorous bridge between patristic doctrine and contemporary systematic theology; valuable for courses on Trinity, for polemical engagement, and for grounding doctrine in both history and metaphysics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Procession** - the eternal originating acts within the Godhead (generation, spiration) by which persons come to be; distinct from temporal missions.
- **Generation** - eternal begetting of the Son by the Father; a non-temporal, intrinsic procession.
- **Spiration** - the eternal procession of the Spirit (single or double depending on theological account); treated carefully in relation to filioque debates.
- **Person / Hypostasis** - a concrete subsistence in God; Sonderegger emphasizes persons as **subsistent relations** (real, not accidental).
- **Ousia (essence/substance)** - God's one divine being; persons share a single ousia without division.
- **Prosopon** - the "face" or manifest personhood in scripture and liturgy; used to connect immanent and economic realities.
- **Relation (relatio)** - ontologically constitutive for personhood when specified as relation of origin vs. accidental relation.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling that preserves unity and distinction; relational reciprocity without loss of monarchy.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - theological principle that the Father is the single principle/origin within the Trinity, preserved by Sonderegger as central.
- **Divine simplicity** - affirmation that God is not composition; Sonderegger argues processions and persons must be intelligible within simplicity.
- **Immanent vs. Economic Trinity** - rigorous distinction maintained to prevent conflation of intra‑divine life with historical revelation.
- **Propria / properties** - attributes personal to each person (e.g., begetting, being begotten, proceeding).
- **Social trinitarianism (contrast term)** - modern model treating persons as quasi‑autonomous centers; Sonderegger uses it as foil.
- **Aseity / impassibility** - God's self‑existence and freedom from change maintained in the account of eternal processions.

How the work is used:
- As a **definition source** for technical Trinitarian vocabulary in courses and essays.
- As a **polemic** against social/personalist reconfigurations of the Trinity.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Cappadocians and Augustine in systematic construction.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating divine simplicity, perichoresis, and ecclesial practice in systematic theology.
