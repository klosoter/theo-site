### TITLE
God of Grace and God of Glory: An Account of the Theology of Jonathan Edwards - Stephen R. Holmes

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical scholarship on early American Puritanism; Holmes writes as a systematic theologian tracing Edwards as a constructive theologian within the Reformed tradition and the Enlightenment milieu.
 - Engages Edwards' sermons, treatises, notebooks and the revival contexts (Great Awakening), situating him between Puritan orthodoxy and modern philosophical pressures.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Holmes argues Edwards is a coherent, distinctive systematic theologian whose priorities are **God's sovereignty, holiness, and saving grace**, integrated by a Trinitarian framework and a moral-psychological account of religious experience.
 - Problem addressed: how Edwards preserves classical Reformed commitments under pressures of revivalism, sentimental religion, and Enlightenment thought about causation and mind.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Descriptive reconstruction of Edwards' theology across loci: God, Trinity, creation, providence, human nature, sin and salvation, Christ and atonement, sanctification, and religious experience.
 - Major moves:
 - Show Edwards' **Trinitarian center** governs his account of divine action and human restoration.
 - Reconstruct Edwards' metaphysics (divine simplicity, causation, freedom as compatibilism) and show how it undergirds his doctrine of conversion and revival.
 - Read Edwards' pastoral theology (religious affections) as theology in practice - doctrine shaping spiritual sensibility.
 - Concludes that Edwards is both a rigorous metaphysician and acute pastoral theologian.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary: Jonathan Edwards (sermons, Freedom of the Will, Religious Affections, Charity and other treatises, miscellaneous writings).
 - Background interlocutors: Augustine, Calvin, English Puritans, contemporaneous Enlightenment thinkers; Holmes also dialogues with 20th-century interpreters and critics (including reference to critiques such as Van Til's on "one-person" language).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, divine simplicity, sovereignty and providence, creation, human will (compatibilism), original sin, covenant of grace, Christology and atonement, sanctification and revival, religious affections as theological anthropology + pastoral theology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Edwards is presented as a theologian whose **Trinitarian and sovereign God shapes a fully integrated system** where metaphysics and pastoral concern cohere in a theology of grace that aims both to explain and to produce genuine religious life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of the **affective/moral life**: doctrine is evaluated by its capacity to produce holy affections and genuine benevolence.
 - Strong synthesis of **metaphysical rigour and pastoral application** - metaphysics is not abstract but serves conversion and sanctification.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Holmes corrects caricatures of Edwards as cold intellectualist or merely revivalist enthusiast; emphasizes his logical subtlety and pastoral integrity.
 - Contrasts Edwards with some later Reformed emphases that separate doctrine from affective formation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Reclaims Edwards as a systematic theologian rather than merely a sermonizer: highlights his internal coherence across loci.
 - Re-frames Edwards' compatibilist account of freedom as a theological answer to Enlightenment voluntarism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Contributed to renewed interest in Edwards within Reformed systematic theology and pastoral studies; used by scholars to show continuity between Puritanism and modern Reformed thought.
 - Part of larger 20th-century reassessment that reclaimed Edwards for constructive theology rather than merely historical study.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for integrating doctrine and discipleship; encourages contemporary theologians to connect metaphysics, ethics, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian center** - Edwards' doctrines organized by the interrelation of Father, Son, and Spirit; theological moves always read with Trinitarian relations in view.
- **Divine simplicity** - God conceived as metaphysically simple; Holmes shows Edwards uses simplicity to secure divine immutability and unity.
- **Sovereignty / Providence** - God's active governance; Edwards ties providence to conversion and historical revivals.
- **Compatibilist freedom** - Human liberty defined compatibly with divine causation; crucial for Edwards' moral responsibility.
- **Religious affections** - Affections as criterion of true religion; theological anthropology linking feeling, judgement, and will.
- **True virtue** - Benevolence oriented toward God and neighbor; central ethical standard for judging piety.
- **Covenant of grace** - Framework for redemption history and ecclesial life; Edwards treats covenant as relational and soteriological.
- **Atonement / Christology** - Penal/representative themes integrated with divine love and moral influence; Incarnation treated in relation to divine persons.
- **Original sin / human depravity** - Radical corruption of will and affection necessitating sovereign grace.
- **Revival theology** - Providentially mediated awakenings; analyzed as combined doctrinal, spiritual, and communal phenomena.
- **Moral government** - Edwards' account of divine law and moral order underpinning ethical exhortation.
- **Sensible religion** - Distinction between mere sensory or excited religion and authentic, spiritually informed affections.
- **Van Til's "one-person" critique** - Holmes notes later critics (e.g., Van Til) who worry about singular-language tendencies; Holmes defends Edwards as maintaining personal distinctions within a strong unity of God.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Edwards' integrated Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates on freedom, revival, and experiential criteria for true religion.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for combining doctrinal precision with pastoral formation.
