### TITLE
Scripture and Tradition in the Letters to Timothy and Titus (2012) - David W. Pao

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Monograph situated in contemporary Pauline studies and canonical/authority studies (post-1990s interest in Scripture, tradition, and church order).
 - Engages debates about the Pastoral Epistles' authorship and their role in shaping early Christian norms for doctrine and practice.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Pastorals (1-2 Timothy, Titus) presuppose and deploy both **Scripture (graphe)** and **tradition (paradosis)** as complementary, normative resources for teaching, discipline, and ecclesial formation; typological readings of the OT function to legitimate and shape pastoral instruction.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close readings of key Pauline Pastorals passages that treat scripture and tradition (notably 1 Tim 1:18; 1 Tim 5:18; 2 Tim 2:2; 2 Tim 3:14-17; Titus 3:8).
 - Distinguishes different senses of paradosis (apostolic sayings, transmitted practices, institutional rules) and maps their relation to written Scripture in pastoral contexts.
 - Argues that the Pastorals use **typology and fulfillment**-OT persons/events and instructions are read and applied typologically to guide ecclesial life and disciplinary measures.
 - Shows how tradition functions as an authoritative carrier of apostolic teaching when Scripture alone is not immediately determinative for local situations.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts broadly with Pauline scholarship (authorship debates), tradition-criticism, canonical theory, and studies of early Christian liturgical/disciplinary practices.
 - Dialogues implicitly with scholars who privilege Scripture alone as normative and with those who emphasize extra-scriptural apostolic tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and normative authority (Scripture vs. tradition)
 - Apostolicity and transmission of teaching
 - Ecclesiology (office, order, disciplining)
 - Hermeneutics (typology, fulfillment, interpretive method)
 - Indirectly touches Christology insofar as fulfillment readings of the OT shape Christ-centered exegesis.

- **Closing line**
 - Pao locates the theological gravity of the Pastorals in their dual claim: the church must be governed by the shaping force of both Scripture and apostolic tradition, mediated through typological reading that binds past revelation to present ecclesial order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats paradosis not as a secondary, residual datum but as an active, normative medium alongside Scripture in pastoral instruction.
 - Clarifies functional distinctions among kinds of tradition (e.g., institutional rules vs. transmitted sayings) and how each interacts with graphe.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters readings that reduce the Pastorals to legalistic impositions by showing how tradition and Scripture jointly undergird pastoral flexibility and continuity.
 - Challenges extreme sola scriptura reconstructions that ignore the Pastorals' evident reliance on transmitted apostolic practice.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced taxonomy of paradosis uses (formulas, creedal-sayings, disciplinary praxis) and mapping of their normative force relative to Scripture.
 - Emphasizes a typological hermeneutic as a bridging device between OT Scripture and contemporary ecclesial praxis in the Pastorals.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable for scholars and pastors wrestling with authority, apostolicity, and church order; cited in studies of canonical formation and pastoral-theological method.
 - Provokes reexamination among Protestant theologians of how tradition functions without supplanting Scripture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a careful exegetical model for integrating textual evidence with historical-theological reflection.
 - Useful corrective in teaching on ecclesial authority, demonstrating how New Testament texts negotiate written and oral norms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Paradosis (tradition)** - transmitted teaching/practice; Pao distinguishes types (saying-formulas, institutional rules, disciplinary practices).
- **Graphe (Scripture)** - Old Testament text used as authoritative warrant in pastoral instruction.
- **Normativity** - the relative binding force of Scripture and tradition in ecclesial contexts.
- **Apostolicity** - the claim that certain traditions derive their authority from apostolic origin or sanction.
- **Typology and Fulfillment** - OT persons/events read as types whose fulfillment in Christ and church supplies theological rationale for pastoral directives.
 - Shows how typological reading legitimates current ecclesial practices by pointing to providential continuity.
- **Transmission** - mechanisms (oral/written) by which apostolic teaching is preserved and applied.
- **Hermeneutical rule** - interpretive moves that connect OT Scripture, received tradition, and present pastoral judgment.
- **Ecclesial order** - structures (offices, qualifications, discipline) upheld through combined appeal to Scripture and tradition.
- **Formulary/Creedal sayings** - short transmitted units used as teaching anchors in the Pastorals.
- **Canonical implications** - how Pastorals inform understandings of Scripture's place amid living tradition.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As **exegetical model** for reading Pastorals that balances textual detail with theological import.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on authority (useful in discussions that nuance sola scriptura without endorsing traditionalism).
 - As a **source for typology and fulfillment** studies, illustrating practical hermeneutics that move from OT type to NT pastoral application.
