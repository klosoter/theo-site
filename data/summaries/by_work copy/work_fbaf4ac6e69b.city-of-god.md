### TITLE
**City of God (De Civitate Dei)** - Augustine of Hippo, c. 413-426, in response to the sack of Rome (410) and critiques of Christianity in late antique Roman culture.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late Roman Empire; pagan elites blamed Christians for Rome's decline.
 - Intellectual milieu: Latin Christian Platonism; engagement with Roman historiography and civic religion.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - History is a contest of two cities formed by two loves: **amor Dei** vs **amor sui**.
 - True justice and peace come only from the worship of the true God through Christ; the earthly city cannot achieve man's final end.
- **Core argument / structure (22 books)**
 - Books 1-10: **Negative/apologetic.**
 - Refutes charge that Christianity ruined Rome; exposes moral bankruptcy of the gods; kingdoms without justice are robber bands.
 - Critiques **civil** and **natural theology** (after Varro); shows demons masquerade as gods.
 - Commends Platonists as closest to truth yet insufficient without the **Mediator**.
 - Books 11-22: **Positive/constructive.**
 - Creation ex nihilo; angelic fall; origin of two cities.
 - Biblical history from Cain/Abel through Israel to Christ and the Church as the pilgrim **people** of God.
 - Nature of earthly goods and **peace**; right order of loves.
 - Eschatology: resurrection, judgment, eternal destinies; amillennial reading of Rev 20.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture (LXX/Vulgate); Varro, Cicero, Sallust, Virgil; Platonists (esp. Porphyry); Apuleius; Roman historians; earlier Christian apologists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology:** authority of Scripture over pagan philosophy; literal/figurative reading under rule of faith.
 - **God/Creation/Providence:** one God, Creator; governance of history.
 - **Angelology/Demonology:** fall of angels; demon mediation rejected.
 - **Christology:** Christ the true Mediator and Head of the City of God.
 - **Anthropology/Soteriology:** original sin, grace, love rightly ordered.
 - **Ecclesiology/Sacraments:** mixed body in the saeculum; signs and reality; pilgrim church uses earthly peace.
 - **Eschatology:** two cities intermixed until judgment; resurrection; millennium spiritual.
 - **Public theology/ethics:** justice, commonwealth, peace, just war, use of temporal goods.
- **Center of gravity**
 - God orders all history toward the eternal **peace of the heavenly city**, where creatures rightly enjoy God; the church lives now as a pilgrim people with reordered loves.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Two cities defined by loves, not territory or institutions.
 - **Ordo amoris** and **tranquillitas ordinis** as normative moral-political vision.
 - Redefinition of **people/commonwealth**: a people is a multitude united by common objects of love.
 - Earthly peace as genuine but penultimate good to be used for heavenly ends.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against pagan civil religion: gods are immoral/demonic; cult cannot secure virtue or peace.
 - Against philosophical elitism: Platonists need the incarnate **Mediator**; no ascent to God without grace.
 - Against cyclical history and imperial destiny: linear providential history climaxing in Christ.
 - Against triumphalism/sectarianism: church is mixed until judgment; cautions both empire-baptizing and rigorist separatism.
 - Against chiliasm: millennium interpreted spiritually; first resurrection as regeneration.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Libido dominandi** as diagnosis of political order.
 - Justice as God-directed order; without justice, empires are magnified robberies.
 - Social ontology by love; political goods evaluated by their end.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Medieval political theology (commonwealth, two powers); just war reflection.
 - Reformation and Reformed thought: amillennialism; two-kingdoms/pilgrim ecclesiology; Calvin, Bucer, later Kuyperian and neo-Augustinian streams.
 - Modern Augustinian political theology (Niebuhr, O'Donovan); critique of ideologies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Template for Christian public witness in pluralist societies.
 - Integrates apologetics, exegesis, and eschatology into a theology of history.
 - Offers criteria to evaluate culture by loves and ends, not success.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **City of God / Earthly City**: two societies formed by loves; destined for eternal enjoyment of God vs self-exaltation and domination.
- **Amor Dei / amor sui**: love of God to contempt of self vs love of self to contempt of God; generative principles of the cities.
- **Ordo amoris**: right ordering of loves under God, the measure of virtue and social justice.
- **Tranquillitas ordinis**: peace as the calm of rightly ordered relationships; ground of just-war reasoning.
- **Libido dominandi**: lust for domination, the pathology of fallen politics and empire.
- **Peregrinatio**: pilgrim condition of the church within the saeculum; seeks heavenly homeland while using temporal goods.
- **Saeculum**: the interim age where the cities are intermixed until judgment.
- **Pax**: earthly peace (penultimate, instrumental) vs heavenly peace (ultimate, consummate).
- **Res publica / populus**: a people defined by common objects of love, not merely by legal order.
- **Providentia**: divine governance of history toward judgment and beatitude.
- **Mediator (Christ)**: sole way to God; fulfills what philosophers sought but could not attain.
- **Sacramentum / res**: sign and reality; supports mixed-church ecclesiology and pilgrim use of means.
- **Millennium / first resurrection**: allegorical present reign; first resurrection = regeneration; shapes amillennial eschatology.
- **Totus Christus**: Christ and his body united; frames ecclesial participation in the City of God.
