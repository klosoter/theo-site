### TITLE
**Living with Other Creatures: Green Exegesis and Theology** (Richard Bauckham, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid a growing Christian engagement with climate change and ecological ethics in the early 21st century.
 - Part of a larger movement to reexamine biblical theology for environmental concern; dialogical with both academic eco-theology and popular Christian environmentalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible, correctly read, supports a vision of human life lived "with" other creatures rather than dominion as domination; eschatology affirms nonhuman continuity in the New Heavens and New Earth.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Method: "green exegesis" - read canonical texts with sustained attention to their treatment of nonhuman creatures.
 - Biblical-historical moves:
 - Genesis: reframe "dominion" as responsible stewardship and relational authority, not exploitative control.
 - Wisdom, Psalms, Prophets: show creation as praising God and ethically significant in covenantal relations.
 - Christ and Redemption: Jesus sovereignly includes creation within his lordship; redemption has cosmic scope.
 - Revelation and New Creation: interpret New Heavens and New Earth as continuity in which creatures participate in eschatological flourishing.
 - Theological implications: critiques anthropocentrism and instrumentalization of animals; proposes ethical consequences for human practice and policy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary environmental critique and eco-theologians; implicitly counters claims that Christianity necessarily causes ecological harm (Lynn White thesis and its heirs).
 - Uses canonical biblical texts as primary interlocutors; engages theological traditions about creation, covenant, and eschatology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, imago Dei, covenant, sin (ecological consequences), Christology (cosmic scope of Christ), eschatology (New Heavens and New Earth), and ethics (stewardship).
- **Closing line**
 - Bauckham centers a covenantal, incarnational, and eschatological theology that insists humans live as responsible companions among creatures, expecting a renewed creation that includes nonhuman flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The phrase and method of **"green exegesis"** as a disciplined hermeneutic priority.
 - Emphasis on **living with** rather than ruling over other creatures; relational language foregrounds companionship and moral considerability.
 - Eschatological claim that the **New Heavens and New Earth** will involve continuity of nonhuman life, not merely human salvation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects strong anthropocentric readings that use "image of God" to justify unfettered exploitation.
 - Rejects pantheistic or mystical solutions that collapse creature-God distinction; upholds creaturely otherness while affirming inclusion in redemption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of "green exegesis" as both descriptive and prescriptive for biblical scholarship.
 - Recasts dominion language as stewardship relationality rooted in covenantal accountability.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative and mainline Christian environmental discussions as a biblically-grounded corrective to both exploitative and pantheistic tendencies.
 - Influential for evangelical and Reformed conversations seeking robust biblical warrant for animal and creation care; some critics argue it is not radical enough for deep ecology proponents.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a careful, textually grounded bridge between biblical theology and environmental ethics; valuable pedagogically as a model for integrating exegesis with ecological concern.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Green exegesis**
 - Reading strategy that centers nonhuman creatures in biblical interpretation and seeks theological implications for ecology.
- **Living with other creatures**
 - Practical-theological ideal: relational cohabitation rather than domination.
- **Dominion**
 - Reinterpreted as responsible stewardship and accountable authority, not exploitative mastery.
- **Stewardship**
 - Ethical outworking of dominion in covenantal responsibility toward creation.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Maintained as grounding human moral status, but reframed to restrain domination and promote relational care.
- **Creation praise**
 - Biblical motif showing creatures as participants in worship, implying moral and theological value.
- **New Heavens and New Earth**
 - Eschatological horizon asserting continuity and renewal of creation, inclusive of nonhuman life.
- **Eschatological continuity**
 - Concept that final redemption remodels rather than annihilates creation; important for ethical hope and conservation.
- **Instrumentalization**
 - Critique term for reducing creatures to resources; Bauckham argues Scripture resists such reduction.
- **Covenantal inclusion of creation**
 - Theological claim that creation bears covenantal significance and is not peripheral to God's saving purposes.
- **Cosmic lordship of Christ**
 - Christological assertion that Jesus' reign pertains to the whole creation, supporting a cosmic scope of redemption.
- **Moral considerability**
 - Implicit ethical principle granting creatures some degree of moral standing derived from Scripture.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "green exegesis" and biblically grounded environmental theology.
- As a **polemic** against simplistic anthropocentrism and the claim that Christianity inherently promotes ecological destruction.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis, Psalms, Prophets, and Revelation with environmental concern.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenantal theology, Christology, and eschatology to practical ecological ethics.
