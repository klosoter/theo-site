### TITLE
Revival - Martyn Lloyd-Jones

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century evangelical London (Westminster Chapel). Lloyd-Jones writes from the context of postwar Britain, declining church influence, and renewed interest in spiritual renewal. He stands in the Reformed/Calvinistic evangelical tradition but draws on revival history (Welsh revivals, Edwards, Puritans).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** True revival is a sovereign, supernatural visitation of the Holy Spirit that renews individuals and churches by producing conviction of sin, radical repentance, holiness, and power for witness; it requires faithful proclamation, persistent prayer, and openness to the Spirit but cannot be manufactured by techniques or emotional manipulation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - The need: churches are spiritually weak because of prayerlessness, superficial preaching, and compromise.
 - The ground: revival is rooted in divine sovereignty-God alone awakens and converts-but it normally comes in connection with biblical means (preaching, prayer, faithfulness).
 - The method: faithful expository preaching, intense corporate and private prayer, and insistence on holiness prepare a people for the Spirit.
 - The fruit: regeneration, holiness, increased evangelistic power, lasting church renewal.
 - Practical warnings: avoid emotionalism, false expectations, and reduction of revival to techniques or to one experiential sign.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Historical revival models: Puritans, Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, Welsh revivalists.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: mid-century evangelical leaders, pentecostal/charismatic movements (critique and interaction).
 - Scriptural warrants: Acts (especially Acts 2 and 1:8), Pauline pneumatology, Gospels on promise of the Spirit.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (central), conversion/regeneration, sanctification, proclamation (homiletics), ecclesiology (renewal of the gathered church), soteriology (distinguishing justification and subsequent Spirit-empowerment), occasionally sacramental practice insofar as it relates to pastoral renewal.
- **Closing line:** Lloyd-Jones situates revival theologically as a sovereign work of the Holy Spirit conditioned by biblical means-especially preaching and prayer-and aimed at deep, moral, and missional reform of individuals and churches.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Revival as both sovereign act and responsive process: God acts, but his action normally comes through ordinary means (Word + prayer).
 - Strong insistence on the primacy of faithful, expositional preaching as the normal channel of revival.
 - A rigorous call to holiness: revival results in moral and doctrinal seriousness, not merely emotion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against mechanical or technique-driven revivalism (revivalism as method); against sentimental or entertainment-driven religion.
 - Against Pentecostal/charismatic identification of "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" exclusively with tongues or with being the normative, sole evidence of Spirit baptism.
 - Aligns more with Edwardsian and Puritan emphases on introspection, conviction of sin, and doctrinal clarity than with some modern revival entrepreneurs.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinguishes carefully between initial Spirit-reception at conversion (regeneration) and subsequent Spirit-baptisms or fillings for power and holiness without granting a single outward evidential sign as normative.
 - Emphasizes "agony of prayer" as a technical pastoral phrase for the intensity required to seek revival.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in Reformed evangelicalism and among pastors valuing expositional preaching and spiritual seriousness.
 - Provoked critique from Pentecostal/charismatic circles for perceived minimalization of charismatic gifts; also praised by those wary of emotional excess.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A model integration of pastoral theology, homiletics, and pneumatology on revival.
 - Useful corrective to both dry institutionalism and method-driven revivalism; supplies disciplined pastoral practices for renewal.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revival:** A sovereign outpouring of the Spirit producing widespread conviction, repentance, holiness, and missionary zeal.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit:** Treated as a distinct experience of Spirit-empowerment for witness and holiness that may follow conversion; not reducible to tongues and not identical with regeneration.
 - Contrast: regeneration (new birth) vs. Spirit-baptism/filling (empowerment).
- **Filling of the Spirit:** Recurrent need; ethical and missional enabling rather than a one-off trophy.
- **Regeneration:** Instantaneous, sovereign work of the Spirit that makes a person spiritually alive.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive fruit of revival; moral transformation and growth in holiness.
- **Preaching (expositional):** The primary ordinary means God uses to bring revival; emphasis on biblical fidelity and seriousness.
- **Prayer (agonizing prayer):** Persistent, humble, corporate and individual intercession seen as a necessary condition for revival.
- **Conviction of sin:** The Spirit's work to expose sin, precursor to repentance and conversion in revival.
- **Holiness:** Both an evidential fruit of revival and a necessary aim; Lloyd-Jones ties revival closely to moral reformation.
- **Sovereignty of God:** The theological framework-revival is initiated by God, not manufactured by human technique.
- **Witness/missionary power:** A chief end of revival is energizing evangelism and church growth.
- **Emotionalism vs. true affections:** Distinction Lloyd-Jones draws-feelings may accompany revival but are not its proof.
- **Evidence (fruit, not signs):** Revival's legitimacy is judged by sustained fruit (repentance, changed lives), not by spectacular signs.
- **Means and conditions:** Word, prayer, holiness, pastoral faithfulness; these are means God often uses.
- **Agonistic intercession:** Practical demand for pastoral and congregational intensity in prayer.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a theologically disciplined, Reformed account of revival and the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.
- As a **polemic** against technique-driven revivalism and against charismatic excesses (esp. identification of tongues as normative evidence).
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for integrating expository preaching, prayer ministry, and pneumatology in pursuit of church renewal.
