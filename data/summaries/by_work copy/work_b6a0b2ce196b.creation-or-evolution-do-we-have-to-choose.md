### TITLE
**Creation or Evolution: Do We Have to Choose? - Denis Alexander**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published in the early 21st century amid intensified public debate over evolution, intelligent design (ID), and young-earth creationism. Positioned within the wider movement of scientifically informed Christian apologetics and theists engaging contemporary biology (post-Genomics era).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Christian faith and Darwinian evolution are not inherently incompatible. The crucial task is to distinguish legitimate scientific conclusions from philosophical naturalism and to develop theological categories that preserve Christian orthodoxy (creation, providence, sin, Christ) in light of common ancestry and natural processes.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Survey of modern evolutionary biology and clarifying what science does and does not claim (limits of methodological naturalism). 
 - Critique of reductionist and atheistic readings of evolution; critique of ID and young-earth positions for conflating scientific method with metaphysical claims. 
 - Proposal of **"evolutionary creation"** as a theological framework: God as creator who uses evolutionary processes as the means of bringing about biodiversity and human beings. 
 - Theological repair work: reconstructions of imago Dei, the status of Adam and the Fall, and divine action (providence, guidance, and miracle) that can coherently sit with evolutionary history. 
 - Pastoral and hermeneutical recommendations for reading Genesis in its literary and theological context rather than as science.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Engages scientific authorities in molecular biology and evolutionary theory; dialog with public intellectuals (e.g., Richard Dawkins), mainstream Christian scientists (e.g., Francis Collins, John Polkinghorne), and critics in the creationist and ID movements. Historical theologians (notably Augustine-style non-literal readings of Genesis) are invoked to defend non-literalist options.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Creation (ex nihilo, divine agency), providence and divine action, imago Dei, anthropology, original sin and the Fall, revelation and biblical interpretation, plus implications for Christology and soteriology (maintaining Christ's uniqueness and atonement within an evolutionary framework).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 Faithful Christian doctrine can be retained while accepting evolution as God's chosen means for creating life; the real challenge is theological nuance, not scientific capitulation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Advocates the explicit label **"evolutionary creation"** to signal theological priority (God as Creator) while embracing evolutionary science. 
 - Stresses the difference between *methodological naturalism* (a scientific constraint) and *metaphysical naturalism* (a philosophical worldview), arguing that accepting the former does not force the latter.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects young-earth literalism by arguing Genesis is not a scientific account and that insisting on such reading produces unnecessary conflict with science. 
 - Critiques Intelligent Design for often importing theological (or philosophical) commitments into what should be empirical science and for failing as a robust scientific program.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Operationalizes "evolutionary creation" as a working theological category distinct from both naive theistic evolution and adversarial secular Darwinism. 
 - Uses recent biological concepts (emergence, complexity) to argue for non-reductive accounts of human uniqueness.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used among theistic scientists, clergy, and lay Christians seeking integration; well-received in circles promoting science-theology dialogue. 
 - Criticized by ID proponents and young-earth creationists; less persuasive to those insisting on a strict historical Adam or a radically interventionist model of divine action.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Model for integrating current biology with systematic theology and biblical interpretation. 
 - Useful classroom resource for pastoral formation, apologetics, and courses on science and religion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evolutionary creation:** The preferred term for a theological stance affirming God as Creator who accomplishes creation through evolutionary processes. 
- **Methodological naturalism:** Scientific method's appeal to natural causes; Alexander stresses it is not equivalent to metaphysical naturalism. 
- **Metaphysical naturalism:** Philosophical claim that only natural entities exist; identified as a distinct and avoidable extrapolation from science. 
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** Reinterpreted in non-genetic, functional and relational terms to allow human uniqueness within evolutionary ancestry. 
- **Original sin / Fall:** Reassessed theologically to account for a pre-historical evolutionary process; explores models (symbolic, representative, federal) rather than insisting on one simple genetic origin story. 
- **Divine action / Providence:** Proposes models of non-interventionist but purposive divine governance compatible with natural law and chance in evolution. 
- **Reductionism:** Targeted as a faulty move when biological descriptions are taken to undercut theological claims about persons and purpose. 
- **Emergence:** Used to explain higher-level properties (mind, moral agency) arising in evolutionary systems without reductive elimination. 
- **Scripture genre / hermeneutics:** Argues for attention to Genesis genre and ancient Near Eastern context; promotes theological rather than scientific reading of early chapters. 
- **Intelligent Design (ID):** Critiqued as epistemologically weak and for conflating design inference with supernatural proof. 
- **Common ancestry:** Affirmed as best scientific explanation for biodiversity; theological implications explored rather than dismissed. 
- **Theistic evolution:** Related term; Alexander distinguishes evolutionary creation as emphasizing divine causality more explicitly. 
- **Teleology:** Reclaimed in a theological sense (purpose in creation) without requiring teleological science.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definitional source** for "evolutionary creation" in theology-of-science curricula. 
 - As **polemic** against young-earth creationism and Intelligent Design in church and seminary debates. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for reconceiving imago Dei, providence, and original sin in light of evolutionary biology.
