### TITLE
The Continuing Conundrum: Calvin and the Conditionality of the Covenant - Peter A. Lillback (Calvin Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship re-engaging primary Calvinian sources amid renewed debates over covenant theology. Published in Calvin Theological Journal; addresses historical-theological disputes within the Reformed tradition (see: Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition; Covenant Of Grace).
 - Moves against both hyper-systematic readings of Calvin and reductive portrayals that cast Calvin as either strictly unilateral or strictly bilateral.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin presents a **tension**: the covenant is framed with both God's sovereign promise and human obligations; the question is whether Calvin makes the covenant **conditional** (dependent on human obedience/faith) or **unconditional** (grounded solely in divine election and promise).
 - Lillback contends that Calvin maintains a **functional conditionality** - covenantal blessings are promised by God but require the believer's faith/obedience as the appointed human condition, without undermining divine sovereignty.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Calvin's primary corpus (Institutes, commentaries, sermons) to trace language of promise and obligation.
 - Distinguishes between **ontological basis** (unilateral divine initiative) and **ethical/functional terms** (bilateral obligations and conditional blessings).
 - Argues Calvin's pastoral and forensic concerns produce deliberate dialectic: assurance rooted in promise; sanctification expressed in obedience as evidence and means.
 - Reconciles Calvin's talk of covenantal "stipulations" with his doctrines of justification and election: stipulations regulate life within the covenant community but do not become a ground of acceptance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes; commentaries; sermons).
 - Secondary/reception: later Reformed theologians and systematicians whose covenant formulations sometimes diverge from Calvin.
 - The paper engages contemporary interpreters who polarize Calvin's view (e.g., alleged hyper-Calvinists vs. conditionalists).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant** (central), with integration of **justification**, **election**, **sanctification**, **law and gospel**, **sacramental signs** (as covenant signs), and pastoral assurance.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Calvin holds a **promise-rooted covenant that nevertheless operates with moral/faithful conditions in practice** - a theological tension that preserves divine initiative while requiring human responsivity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes a clear **functional-bilateral framework** in Calvin: unilateral divine establishment + bilateral moral demands, held in productive tension.
 - Clarifies Calvin's consistent use of covenantal language to ground pastoral assurance without dissolving ethical responsibility.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that make Calvin either a proto-hyper-Calvinist (denying conditional obligation) or a simple works-based conditionalist.
 - Contrasts with later systematicizations that flatten Calvin's dialectic into a single model (purely unilateral or purely bilateral).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the phrase **"functional conditionality"** (analytic, not necessarily Calvin's own words) to capture how conditions operate within promise structures.
 - Highlights a methodological move: reading Calvin simultaneously as theologian and pastor to avoid doctrinal over-simplification.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful to historians of doctrine for rehabilitating Calvin's nuanced covenantal language.
 - Influential in teaching and pastoral theology for balancing assurance and obedience in Reformed practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a measured corrective to polarized readings; valuable for courses on covenant theology, Calvin studies, and pastoral doctrine where the covenant of grace is central.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - central relational framework; Calvin affirms God's initiating promise and human response.
- **Conditionality** - the debated status of obligations/requirements within the covenant; Lillback emphasizes operational (not soteriological-foundational) conditionality.
- **Unilateral / Bilateral** - analytical categories: God's unilateral initiation vs. bilateral moral duties; Calvin holds both.
- **Functional conditionality** - Lillback's key analytic phrase for how conditions function within promise (promises are free but tied to appointed human duties).
- **Covenant of grace** - Calvin's primary covenant concept: salvation by promise in Christ, mediated by faith and signs.
- **Promise vs. Stipulation** - promise = divine gratuitous gift; stipulation = human duty/condition within covenant life.
- **Justification** - forensic status by grace through faith; not earned by covenant stipulations but evidenced by them.
- **Election** - sovereign choosing; maintained as theological foundation that does not cancel ethical demands.
- **Sanctification / Obedience** - covenantal fruit and means; obedience serves as evidence of covenant incorporation and is required by stipulations.
- **Sacraments / Signs** - covenant signs that confirm promises and require believer response.
- **Pastoral assurance** - Calvin's concern; Lillback shows the covenantal language serves assurance without annihilating responsibility.
- **Law and Gospel** - interplay in covenant discourse: law as covenant stipulation; gospel as promise-centered assurance.
- **Typology / Christology** - Christ as mediator of covenantal promises; types prefigure covenant continuity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **historical-definition source** clarifying Calvin's covenantal vocabulary for courses on Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition.
 - As a **polemic/resource** in debates over the Covenant Of Grace to defend a balanced reading that honors both divine promise and human response.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading primary Calvin texts with attention to pastoral-theological nuance.
