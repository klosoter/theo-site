### TITLE
**Jonathan Edwards: A Mini-Theology - John Gerstner**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th century reappraisal by a conservative Reformed scholar; part of renewed evangelical interest in Puritan theology and Jonathan Edwards (18th-century New England revival leader and theologian). Gerstner writes as a compact, synthetic introduction aimed at seminarians and pastors.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Edwards is a coherent, systematic theologian whose integration of metaphysics, affections, and soteriology makes him indispensable for understanding classical Reformed claims about human depravity and the necessity of sovereign grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Presents Edwards as a unified intellectual system rather than a series of disparate sermons.
 - Traces how Edwards grounds doctrines (God, sin, redemption) in an ontology of desire and moral beauty.
 - Demonstrates that Edwards' account of human nature leads inevitably to **total depravity** and **total inability**, necessitating effectual, sovereign regeneration.
 - Shows continuity with Reformed orthodoxy while highlighting Edwards' distinctive stress on affections and aesthetic divine attraction.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary: Jonathan Edwards (texts from sermons, Treatise on Grace and Original Sin, The Religious Affections, Freedom of the Will).
 - Secondary/contrasts: classical Calvin and Puritan predecessors, Arminian opponents, Enlightenment critics, and contemporary 20th-century theologians re-evaluating Edwards.
- **Doctrines treated:** original sin, imputation, total depravity, total inability, regeneration, conversion/affections, divine sovereignty, providence, liberty of the will (compatibilist account), atonement, sanctification, Scripture and practical divinity; orthodox Trinitarian and Christological commitments affirmed.
- **Closing line:** Gerstner presents Edwards as a God-centered theologian whose metaphysic of affections forces a logically tight Reformed conclusion: human beings are radically unable to seek God apart from sovereign, sanctifying grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats Edwards as an "affectional metaphysician": doctrine and experience are integrated via a theory of desire and moral perception (beauty of God).
 - Stresses Edwards' rigorous, systematic logic from ontology to soteriology rather than treating him as a revivalist only.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against portrayals of Edwards as merely an emotional evangelist or as inconsistent with Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Clarifies distinctions between Edwards' compatibilist freedom and both libertarian free will and hard determinism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Highlights Edwards' language of "disinterested love" and aesthetic attraction as theological categories that operationalize total depravity and regeneration.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Gerstner's mini-theology helped cement Edwards' place in late 20th-century Reformed curricula; used widely in conservative seminaries and by pastors to defend classical doctrines.
 - Influential in conversations about revival theology, experiential piety, and evangelical apologetics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Compact, readable map of Edwards' theological system; particularly valuable for teaching how doctrines of sin and grace cohere with pastoral practice and spiritual experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total depravity:** Edwards' view that sin pervades all aspects of human nature; Gerstner insists Edwards means inability at the heart (affections) not mere lack of some good.
- **Total inability:** Humans cannot effectually seek God or turn to saving faith without sovereign regeneration; Gerstner treats this as central to Edwards' soteriology.
- **Original sin:** Innate corruption derived from Adam; both guilt (imputation) and innate depravity are affirmed in Edwards and emphasized by Gerstner.
- **Imputation:** Forensic reckoning of Adam's sin/righteousness; Gerstner shows Edwards accepts classical imputation alongside psychological depravity.
- **Regeneration (new birth):** Sovereign, immediate work of the Spirit creating saving affections; the necessary antecedent to true conversion in Edwards' schema.
- **Religious affections:** Edwards' hallmark category-affections are the locus of genuine conversion; Gerstner stresses their doctrinal and pastoral centrality.
- **Liberty of the will / compatibilism:** Edwards' account that the will acts according to strongest inclination; freedom compatible with divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
- **Disinterested benevolence:** Edwards' ideal of love for God and others free from self-seeking; used to distinguish genuine virtue from self-interested piety.
- **Beauty of God / aesthetic attraction:** Theological aesthetics as motive for love and worship; Edwards argues the soul is drawn by perceived divine beauty.
- **Providence & sovereignty:** God's meticulous governance undergirds Edwards' explanation of grace, revival, and the ordering of salvation.
- **Conversion & revival:** Empirical phenomena (revivals) interpreted theologically as results of sovereign grace producing true religious affections.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive fruit of implanted new affections; moral renewal follows regeneration.
- **Practical divinity:** Edwards' pastoral application of systematic theology; Gerstner highlights its usefulness for preaching and pastoral care.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Edwards' articulation of total depravity/total inability and the centrality of affections.
 - As a **polemic** against Arminian and reductionist views of human ability and conversion.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for integrating doctrine with experiential theology (conversion, revival, sanctification).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Puritan practical piety to systematic Reformed theology.
