### TITLE
The End of Protestantism: Pursuing Unity in a Fragmented Church - Peter J. Leithart (Canon Press, 2019)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the late 2010s amid renewed ecclesiological debate in Reformed and wider Protestant circles: growing confessionalism, critiques of denominal fragmentation, and renewed interest in catholicity, liturgy, and sacramental theology.
 - Leithart writes from a conservative Reformed / confessional vantage point with strong patristic and sacramental sympathies; engages both evangelical and mainline Protestant audiences.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Protestantism as a distinctive social-theological movement has become an obstacle to Christian unity; the remedy is not denominational patchwork but a recovery of the church's catholic, visible, and sacramental structure rooted in apostolic faith.
 - The problem identified: privatized, individualistic, and anti-ecclesial tendencies in Protestantism produce fragmentation that undermines the church's witness and the kingdom of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: traces how Reformation principles (private judgment, sola scriptura as individual interpretive right, sola fide misapplied) devolved into sectarianism and denominational multiplication.
 - Recovery: argues for retrieval of catholicity - a visible, structured church with authoritative ministry, robust sacraments (esp. Eucharist and baptism), and corporate worship shaped by tradition.
 - Integration: proposes ecclesial unity grounded in shared confession, sacramental life, and recognition of orders of ministry rather than mere doctrinal minimalism or institutional merger.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformers (Luther, Calvin) - critiqued and partially reclaimed.
 - Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology - used as corrective models for catholicity and sacramental realism.
 - Contemporary Protestant leaders and movements (evangelicals, new Calvinists, liberal Protestantism) - critiqued for contributing to fragmentation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (visible vs. invisible church, ministry, catholicity)
 - Sacramental theology (Eucharist, baptism)
 - Authority and confessionalism (role of creeds, councils, and ecclesial office)
 - Covenant and kingdom (relation of church life to the kingdom of God)
 - Subsidiary attention to revelation and Scripture as formative for corporate life

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Leithart locates the church's future in a reclaimed catholicity: a visible, sacramental, and confessional communion that ends sectarian Protestantism by embodying the unity of the kingdom of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves beyond simple ecumenical concord to argue that Protestant identity itself should end when it fosters disunion; unity requires substantive ecclesial reform, not mere tolerance.
 - Strong stress on sacramental and visible markers of the church as normative for unity (real Eucharistic practice, baptismal polity).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects liberal ecumenical naivete (which minimized doctrine and sacrament) and conservative evangelicalism (which emphasized voluntarism and private faith) by insisting on public, corporate, and ritual structures.
 - Differs from some Roman Catholic claims by seeking a Reformed retrieval of catholicity - not full Roman assimilation but a recovered catholic ecclesiality.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "Protestantism" as a historical phase and social pathology rather than merely a set of doctrinal affirmations.
 - Emphasizes "ending" Protestantism as an ecclesial transition into renewed confessional catholicity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provocative and widely discussed in Reformed, Anglican, and confessional circles; praised by those seeking unity and liturgical renewal.
 - Criticized by evangelicals who view the proposal as minimizing Reformation distinctives or as sympathetic to hierarchical ecclesiology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Stimulates renewed attention to ecclesiology in Reformed theology, sacramental practice, and the relationship between church identity and kingdom witness.
 - Useful as a corrective to sectarian drift and as a programmatic work prompting institutional and pastoral reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible Church**
 - The concrete, institutional, sacramental community that worships, ministers, and administers the sacraments - central to Leithart's recovery of catholicity.
 - (See interaction with Invisible Church below.)

- **Invisible Church**
 - The church known fully to God (the elect); Leithart critiques overreliance on this category when it is used to demote corporate life and sacraments.

- **Visible / Invisible Church Distinction**
 - Leithart presses for a rebalancing: do not spiritualize ecclesial reality into invisibility; the visible church expresses the kingdom and mediates grace.

- **Sacramental Realism**
 - Eucharist and baptism as real means of grace and markers of corporate identity; Eucharistic communion as a principal locus of unity.

- **Authority / Ministry**
 - Confessional and ordered ministry (recognition of offices and apostolic continuity) as necessary structures for unity and orthodoxy.

- **Confessionalism**
 - Shared creeds and confessions as the glue for unity; not mere doctrinal minimalism but robust corporate assent.

- **Sola Scriptura (reframed)**
 - Leithart defends scriptural primacy but resists an individualistic reading; Scripture interprets the church as much as the church interprets Scripture.

- **Catholicity**
 - The church's universality expressed in common faith, worship, and sacraments across time and space.

- **Denominationalism**
 - Diagnosed as the symptom of Protestant decline; Leithart urges transcending denominations toward confessional communion.

- **Church and Kingdom**
 - Leithart links the church's visible life with the coming kingdom: the church embodies and proclaims the king (Christ) and his reign, so ecclesial unity is integral to kingdom witness.

- **End of Protestantism (as term)**
 - The project of terminating sectarian Protestant identity by restoring a catholic, confessional, sacramental church.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **polemic** against privatized, fragmented Protestantism and denominationalism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology courses or seminars to reframe discussions about visible/invisible church and the relation of church to kingdom.
 - As a **resource for confessional revival**, employed by pastors and theologians advocating sacramental and liturgical renewal.
