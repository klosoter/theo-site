### TITLE
**Faithful Presence: The Promise and the Peril of Religion in the Public Square** - James Davison Hunter (essay)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century North American public-theological debate following Culture Wars; responds to both secular pluralism and revived forms of political Christianity (e.g., theocratic/dominionist strains) and to church strategies that retreat into privatization.
 - Situated alongside Hunter's broader corpus (Culture Wars; To Change the World) and contemporary public theology conversations about religion in plural democracies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theologically and strategically, Christian witness in a plural public should be characterized by *faithful presence*: an incarnational, vocationally-grounded engagement that seeks cultural formation through sustained institution-building and witness rather than domination or withdrawal.
 - The problem addressed: how Christians should act in the public square without collapsing into triumphalism (seeking political power to coerce) or privatization (retreating from public responsibility).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses the two dominant, faulty responses:
 - **Triumphalist/dominionist** impulse: religion aims to seize political power and impose religious norms.
 - **Privatist/accommodationist** impulse: religion retreats to the private sphere, leaving culture to secular institutions.
 - Proposes **faithful presence** as a third way:
 - Grounded in **vocation** and the **cultural/creation mandate**-Christians participate in social life through institutions (family, school, neighborhood, civic associations).
 - Emphasizes **long-term, local, incarnational** strategies that cultivate virtues, practices, and goods rather than short-term policy victories.
 - Attends to the **peril**: co-optation, loss of prophetic integrity, and complicity when religion seeks immediate political dominance.
 - Articulates practical implications: pastoral formation, institutional engagement, patient cultural work, coalition-building in plural democracies.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages critically with American Christian activists, political theologians advocating a dominionist posture, and liberal secular theorists who privatize religion.
 - Implicit interlocutors include proponents of Reconstructionism/theonomy and cultural accommodationists; building on social-scientific observations from his earlier work.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Vocation / Calling**, **Creation cultural mandate**, ecclesiology (the church as a formative presence), and ethics (social practices, virtues).
 - Less direct treatment of Christology/Trinity, but implicitly shaped by incarnational theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Faithful presence reframes public theology as patient, incarnational vocation: cultural formation through practices and institutions rather than the seizure of political power or the withdrawal into privatized faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes *presence* and *practice* over policy and power: the moral and cultural goods produced by sustained institutional engagement matter more than episodic political conquest.
 - Roots public engagement in **vocation** and the **creation mandate** rather than purely in rights-talk or party politics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both **dominionist** projects (which conflate Christianity with political control) and **privatist** projects (which cede the common good to secular actors).
 - Moves beyond the binary of culture-war confrontation by proposing a patient, institution-centered strategy.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The phrase **"faithful presence"** as a programmatic public theology-operationalizes incarnational witness into social strategy.
 - Recasts cultural change as *institutional cultivation* rather than legislative victory.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by a range of mainline and evangelical public theologians as a constructive alternative to politicized Christianity.
 - Influences congregational strategy, Christian higher-education policy, and civil-society engagement frameworks.
 - Critiques remain from those who argue it underestimates urgency of policy or overestimates capacity of institutions to resist secularization.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a clear, teachable framework for vocational engagement.
 - Useful corrective to triumphal and privatist impulses; practical orientation for formation-focused ministry and Christian social ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faithful presence** - The core concept: sustained, incarnational Christian witness in social institutions that forms character and cultivates goods.
- **Vocation** - The theological basis for engagement: citizens, professions, and institutions as callings where faith is lived out.
- **Cultural/Creation mandate** - The theological warrant for cultural work: stewardship and cultivation of creation through institutions.
- **Dominionism (theonomy/triumphalism)** - A target of critique: efforts to capture state power to impose religious norms.
- **Privatization / accommodation** - The opposite error: withdrawing religion from public life or merely privatizing faith.
- **Institutions / relational networks** - Primary loci of change (family, schools, businesses, NGOs, neighborhoods).
- **Long-term formation vs. short-term politics** - Distinction between patient cultural cultivation and episodic political victories.
- **Prophetic witness** - The church's vocation to critique as well as to cultivate; warns against co-optation by power.
- **Co-optation / capture** - The peril: when religious presence is subsumed by political or cultural power and loses integrity.
- **Embodiment / incarnational praxis** - Emphasis on lived practices and virtues rather than rhetoric or policy alone.
- **Public square** - The contested space of plural democratic life where faithful presence is exercised.
- **Thick social goods** - Qualities cultivated by institutions (trust, fidelity, character) that sustain civil life.
- **Pluralism / civic pluralism** - The situational reality that shapes how faithful presence must operate.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source**: canonical articulation of "faithful presence" in public theology curricula.
- As a **polemic**: critique of dominionist and privatist strategies in evangelical and public-theological debates.
- As a **practical / pastoral model**: guiding congregational planning, formation programs, and long-range civic engagement.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: reframes church-state discourse toward vocation, institution-building, and cultural formation.
