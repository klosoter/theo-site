### TITLE
Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation (2009) - James K. A. Smith

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2009 amid renewed interest in cultural theology, liturgical theology, and theological anthropology in Reformed and evangelical circles.
 - Intersects debates about secularization (Charles Taylor), virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre), and liturgical renewal in postmodern/post-liberal theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Christian beliefs are secondary to appetites: *worship (liturgies) trains desires*, and cultural formation proceeds through embodied practices rather than primarily through propositional instruction.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of the dominant model that understands worldview as a set of propositions to be assented to intellectually.
 - Positive anthropology: humans are *liturgical animals*-we are shaped by rituals, practices, and embodied habits that orient our loves.
 - Diagnosis: modern secular institutions offer powerful "secular liturgies" that cultivate rival loves and visions of the good life.
 - Prescription: Christian practices (worship, sacraments, Christian practices in church and home) are apprenticeships to Christ that re-orient desires toward the kingdom; formation is pedagogical and programmatic.
 - Practical implications for worship design, Christian education, and cultural engagement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine (affective anthropology), Alasdair MacIntyre (habitus/virtue formation), Charles Taylor (secular age and background conditions), and contemporary liturgical theologians.
 - Engages the legacy of Christ-and-culture debates, especially themes in "Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective" to argue for an *inaugurated-eschatology* posture toward culture: Christians live as citizens of the kingdom now, formed by liturgies that anticipate consummation.
 - Treats themes from "The Fall And Its Consequences": sin is a disordering of desire, so cultural formation must address loves, not only beliefs.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropological: nature of desire and habit; sin as disordered love.
 - Ecclesiology & sacramentology: church practices as formative.
 - Eschatology: inaugurated/teleological view shapes cultural engagement (already/not-yet).
 - Implicit Christology: apprenticeship to Christ as formative telos.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Christian life is primarily an apprenticeship of love: worship-shaped practices reorder our affections toward the eschatological kingdom and thereby reshape culture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes *affective formation* (desire) over propositional cognition in debates about worldview and cultural engagement.
 - Brings *liturgical theology* into conversation with cultural theory: everyday routines are religious rites that form identity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges the modern Protestant reliance on apologetics and argument as the chief method of cultural transformation.
 - Reframes Kuyperian cultural engagement: less about intellectual dominion or sphere-sovereignty as ideas and more about embodied practices that cultivate loves.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Liturgies of the ordinary" / "secular liturgies" - the term highlights how non-church institutions function as formative rituals.
 - Treats "worldview" as a *practical grammar of loves* rather than a propositional architecture.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries for courses on worship, formation, and cultural theology.
 - Influenced pastors and liturgists seeking to redesign worship and Christian education around formative practices.
 - Cited in broader theological discussions on formation, even among ecumenical liturgical scholars.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable corrective to exclusively cognitive accounts of theology and a practical framework for pastoral formation and cultural engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Desire** - central anthropological category; desires drive practices, not merely beliefs.
- **Liturgies** - embodied, repeatable practices that train loves; not limited to Sunday worship.
- **Secular liturgies** - institutions (markets, schools, media) with ritualizing power that inculcate rival visions of the good.
- **Worldview** - redefined as a formative set of practices and loves rather than a set of propositions.
- **Apprenticeship to Christ** - formation conceived as vocational training in Christlike loves through practices.
- **Habituation / habitus** - borrowing from MacIntyre: virtues and dispositions formed by repeated practices.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - living between now and the consummation; liturgies orient toward telos.
 - Linked to "Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective": Smith reads cultural engagement through eschatological anticipation rather than triumphalism or withdrawal.
- **The Fall / disordered love** - sin as a corruption of desire that explains the power of secular liturgies (see "The Fall And Its Consequences").
- **Sacramental imagination** - sees material practices and signs as formative, not merely symbolic.
- **Embodiment** - theological anthropology emphasizing body, rituals, and space for formation.
- **Teleology / final cause** - human flourishing oriented toward the kingdom; practices point to an end.
- **Cultural formation** - the process by which societies inculcate loves and visions; primary battleground for theology.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for liturgy-as-formation and for reinterpreting "worldview" in pastoral theology.
 - As a **polemic** against purely propositional apologetics and against naively optimistic cultural-engagement models.
 - As a **practical model** for liturgical redesign, Christian education, and spiritual formation curricula that emphasize embodied habits.
