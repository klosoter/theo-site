### TITLE
**The Unaccommodated Calvin: Studies in the Foundation of a Theological Tradition** 
Richard A. Muller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2000 amid late 20th century reassessment of Reformation and orthodox Reformed theology.
 - Pushes back against the Calvin vs the Calvinists narrative shaped by Barthian and neo-Protestant historiography.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin should be read unaccommodated by modern agendas and also not collapsed into later dogmatics. Properly located, he stands in substantive continuity with the catholic tradition and provides foundations for Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Method and principia**: Reconstructs Reformed claims that theology is a scientia ordered by principium essendi, God, and principia cognoscendi, Scripture externally and Spirit internally.
 - **Accommodation and knowledge of God**: Clarifies Calvin's doctrine of divine condescension in revelation, distinguishing anthropomorphic idiom from divine ontology.
 - **Classical attributes**: Shows Calvin's adherence to simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility and the scholastic grammar of absolute and relative attributes.
 - **Trinitarian clarification**: Interprets Calvin's autotheos for the Son as fully compatible with eternal generation and the Spirit's spiration; corrects misreadings that pit autotheos against Nicene taxis.
 - **Continuity and development**: Maps lines from Calvin to Beza, Junius, Polanus, and Turretin, arguing organic development rather than declension.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic and medieval: Augustine, Athanasius, the Lombard, Aquinas.
 - Reformed: Calvin, Beza, Vermigli, Junius, Polanus, Turretin.
 - Interlocutors: R. T. Kendall, Brian Armstrong, T. F. Torrance, Wilhelm Niesel, Barthians; historiographical debts to Heiko Oberman.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology**: Scripture as principium cognoscendi; Word and Spirit; accommodation.
 - **Theology proper**: Simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility; absolute vs relative attributes; analogical predication.
 - **Trinity**: Eternal generation and spiration; autotheos; inseparable operations.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on method: situating Calvin within a catholic, scholasticized Reformed habitus so that doctrine proceeds from principia to coherent loci without surrendering biblical primacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Reads Calvin with his own tools: accommodation, analogical knowledge, and exegetical reserve framed by a scholastic habit of ordered discourse.
 - Strong articulation of theology as science under principia, resisting reduction to either biblicism or speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Refutes a single central dogma engine for Calvinism; shows multiple principia shaping diverse loci.
 - Rehabilitates classical theism in Calvin against relationalist projections and open theist appropriations of accommodation.
 - Nuances autotheos to secure Nicene consubstantiality and personal procession without subordinationism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight deployment of archetypal and ectypal theology to explain Creator creature distinction and the limits of theological discourse.
 - Clarifies absolute vs relative attributes and their use in exegesis and dogmatic synthesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a touchstone for post-Reformation Reformed studies and for dismantling the Calvin vs the Calvinists thesis.
 - Frequently cited in contemporary debates on divine simplicity, impassibility, and trinitarian processions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a methodological anchor for reading Calvin and Reformed orthodoxy with historical precision and dogmatic sobriety.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Unaccommodated Calvin**: Reading Calvin in his historical theological grammar rather than through modern polemical lenses.
- **Accommodation**: Divine condescension in revelation and language; regulates anthropomorphism without revising divine ontology.
 - Guards against open theist appeals to biblical narrative as literal of divine passibility or ignorance.
- **Principium essendi**: God as the ontic ground of theology.
- **Principium cognoscendi externum**: Scripture as the external cognitive principle of theology.
- **Principium cognoscendi internum**: Holy Spirit as internal principle enabling true knowledge.
- **Theology as scientia**: Ordered, principled discipline using scholastic tools in service of Scripture.
- **Archetypal and ectypal theology**: God's self-knowledge vs creaturely participation; grounds analogical predication and epistemic humility.
- **Absolute and relative attributes**: Distinction between perfections considered in se and in relation to creatures; stabilizes exegesis and metaphysics.
- **Simplicity**: God is without parts; underwrites unity of attributes and inseparable operations.
- **Aseity**: God's self-existence; includes Calvin's careful treatment of the Son's autotheos within Nicene taxis.
- **Immutability and impassibility**: No change and no passions in God; harmonized with biblical language via accommodation.
- **Eternal generation and spiration**: Personal origins of Son and Spirit; maintained alongside autotheos and simplicity.
- **Autotheos**: The Son truly God of himself as to essence, not as to hypostatic origin; avoids ontological subordination.
- **Central dogma fallacy**: Rejects attempts to derive a tradition from a single doctrinal core.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a methodological template for principia and theology as science in prolegomena and bibliology.
 - As a source for precise accounts of classical attributes and their exegetical regulation.
 - As a corrective in trinitarian studies on autotheos, eternal generation, and inseparable operations.
 - As a polemical resource against open theism and reductive Calvin vs the Calvinists narratives.
