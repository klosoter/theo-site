### TITLE
The Cappadocian Fathers (primary focus: Basil of Caesarea; secondary: Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen) - core texts: Basil, On the Holy Spirit; Gregory of Nyssa, On Not Three Gods; Gregory Nazianzen, selected Orations on the Trinity.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 4th century (c. 350-400s). Eastern Roman Empire, Cappadocia (modern central Turkey).
 - Reaction to Arianism and to terminological vagueness left after the Council of Nicaea (325). Working within Nicene commitments to Christ's deity while sharpening language for the Trinity.
 - Ecclesial and monastic backgrounds; engagement with Greek philosophical categories (ousia, hypostasis) reframed for theological ends.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to confess one God (unity of ousia) without collapsing the distinct persons (threeness of hypostases), and how to articulate the Son's eternal generation and the Spirit's eternal spiration while safeguarding the Spirit's full deity and personhood.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm one divine essence (ousia) and three real persons (hypostases): Father, Son, Spirit.
 - Distinguish relational properties:
 - Son: **eternal generation** (begetting) - the Son is begotten of the Father, not made.
 - Spirit: **eternal procession/spiration** (Greek: ekporeusis) - the Spirit proceeds from the Father.
 - Defend the Spirit's personhood and deity through:
 - Biblical attributions of personal agency, will, and knowledge.
 - Demonstrations of divine works (creation, sanctification) as actions indistinguishable from divine activity.
 - Use of analogical and philosophical categories to prevent Sabellian modalism and ontological tritheism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Main authors: Basil of Caesarea (On the Holy Spirit), Gregory of Nyssa (On Not Three Gods; On the Trinity), Gregory Nazianzen (Orations).
 - Opponents: Arian and semi-Arian theologians, modalists; later polemical interlocution with Latin Fathers over Filioque.
 - Philosophical vocabulary: Platonizing and Stoic terms reappropriated for Christian doctrine (ousia, hypostasis, procession).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), Christology (as background), revelation and divine names, personhood and deity of the Spirit, eternal generation and spiration, operations/energies of God.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Cappadocians secure the unity of God and the real personal distinctions of Father, Son, and Spirit by positing one divine ousia subsisting in three hypostases and by specifying the Son's eternal begetting and the Spirit's eternal procession as relational properties that preserve both unity and personal distinction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic use of **"one ousia, three hypostases"** as normative formula.
 - Robust assertion of the Spirit as **personal and divine**, not a force or mere attribute.
 - Emphasis on relational origins (generation, procession) as constitutive of personal identity rather than accidental.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects Sabellian modalism by insisting on real, eternal personal relations.
 - Opposes Arian denial of the Son's and Spirit's deity; counters views that subordinate Spirit to creaturely status.
 - Contrasts with later Latin developments: Cappadocians stress **ekporeusis** (procession from the Father alone) and resist the Latin Filioque (Spirit proceeding also from the Son).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operational distinction between **ousia** (essence) and **hypostasis** (person), stabilizing Trinitarian language.
 - Formalization of **ekporeusis** as the technical term for Spirit's relation to the Father.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Eastern Orthodox theology: foundational authorities; Cappadocians are considered decisive in Nicene Trinitarianism.
 - Western/Reformed theology: respected for clarifying Trinity and personhood; used variably-some Reformed theologians draw on their categories while rejecting Eastern exclusive stress on ekporeusis or reinterpreting procession.
 - Central to later medieval, patristic, and ecumenical debates (e.g., Filioque controversies).

- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies the classical categories for discussing immanent Trinity, personal relations, and the full deity of the Spirit; indispensable for Trinitarian theology, liturgical theology, and pastoral doctrine of the Spirit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ousia (essence)** - the one divine substance shared by Father, Son, Spirit.
- **Hypostasis (person/individual reality)** - the three real subsistences in the one ousia.
- **Homoousios** - "of one essence"; used to ground the Son's and Spirit's consubstantiality with the Father.
- **Eternal Generation** - the Son's relationship to the Father: begotten, not made; an eternal relational origin.
- **Ekporeusis (Eternal Spiration / Procession)** - the Spirit's origin: proceeds from the Father; technical Eastern term stressing Father as source.
 - Contrast: Latin "processio" and the later Filioque dispute (proceeding from Father and Son) - Cappadocians typically limit ekporeusis to the Father.
- **Personhood of the Spirit** - attributed through agency, will, intellect, and personal relations; defended against impersonal readings.
- **Deity (divinity) of the Spirit** - proven by participation in divine works and by scriptural ascriptions of divine titles and honors.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - the Father as principle (arche) in Trinity relations; used to order relations without implying subordination of Son or Spirit.
- **Perichoresis / Mutual Indwelling** - mutual interpenetration of persons used to explain unity in distinctness.
- **Economic vs Immanent Trinity** - Cappadocians bridge economy (God's actions in history) and immanent relations (eternal relations within God).
- **Energeiai (divine operations)** - discussions of actions of God while preserving single divine agency expressed in three persons.
- **Analogy / Psychological models** - cautious use of human analogies (mind, will, reason) to illustrate unity and distinction without collapsing persons.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Trinitarian theology: provides the standard patristic categories (ousia/hypostasis) used in systematic formulations.
 - As a **polemic resource** against modalism, Arianism, and later Filioque claims: invoked to defend both Spirit's deity and the Father's monarchy.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for discussing the personhood and operations of the Holy Spirit in pneumatology and ecclesiology.
