### TITLE
Moral Choices: An Introduction to Ethics (sections on human nature) - Scott B. Rae

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical Christian ethics text (first published 1996; revised editions later). Positioned in late 20th-early 21st century Protestant moral theology, intended for undergraduate seminary and church contexts. Writes at the intersection of biblical theology and analytic moral philosophy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Human moral agency must be understood as rooted in the biblical doctrine of the imago Dei, qualified by the fall, and restored in Christ; any adequate moral theory must account for both the ontological dignity and the corrupted will of human beings.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Sketches a biblical-theological anthropology: creation, imago Dei, vocation, fall, and redemption.
 - Diagnoses modern alternatives (naturalism, emotivism, relativism, secular humanism) and their implications for moral knowledge and responsibility.
 - Defends a model of moral agency that integrates **personhood, freedom, moral responsibility, conscience, and social embeddedness**.
 - Applies this anthropological account to normative ethics and applied moral questions (e.g., bioethics, sexual ethics, social justice) by connecting doctrine to decision procedures.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture as primary source; classical theologians (Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin), modern ethicists and philosophers (Kant, Mill, various utilitarians and emotivists), and contemporary evangelical voices. Engages secular psychological and social-scientific claims as challenges.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christian anthropology (imago Dei), original sin and its effects, moral responsibility and freedom (compatibilist tendencies), conscience, natural law and common grace, sanctification and virtue formation, and implications for soteriology and ecclesial ethics.
- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** Human moral choice is intelligible only when rooted in the Creator-creature relation: humans bear God's image, are morally impaired by sin, yet remain morally accountable and capable of restoration through Christ - this synthesis grounds Rae's normative ethic.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Persistent stress on the **simultaneous dignity and depravity** of human beings: the image of God is retained even amid moral corruption.
 - Practical integration of **biblical categories with philosophical moral theory** rather than mere biblical exposition or pure analytic ethics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects moral anti-realism and emotivism by appealing to objective moral orders grounded in the Creator; opposes secular naturalism that reduces personhood to biological processes.
 - Distinguishes itself from pietistic voluntarism by affirming structural features of human nature (reason, will, conscience) that condition moral deliberation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes a pragmatic decision-model for ethics that moves from **anthropological diagnosis** to **normative prescription** and **pastoral application**.
 - Uses a balanced compatibilist language to preserve moral responsibility within theological commitments to divine sovereignty.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical ethics courses as a clear, accessible introduction that bridges doctrine and applied ethics.
 - Praised for pedagogical clarity and biblical fidelity; critiqued by some analytic philosophers for limited technical engagement and by some progressive theologians for conservative presuppositions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a reliable entry-point to Christian moral anthropology and applied ethics; useful for pastors, students, and lay leaders seeking an ethic shaped by Scripture and aware of philosophical challenges.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei:** The foundational category; explains human dignity, moral capacity, and vocation. Rae stresses both ontological and functional dimensions.
- **Original sin:** Describes pervasive moral impairment; accounts for systematic bias and moral weakness without annihilating moral agency.
- **Moral agency:** Human capacity to deliberate, intend, and act; central to responsibility and ethical evaluation.
- **Conscience:** Faculty for moral awareness; fallible and shaped by culture, but accountable before God; needs formation by Scripture and community.
- **Natural law / common grace:** Grounds some moral knowledge accessible to all; serves as a bridge between revelation and general moral insight.
- **Freedom & determinism (compatibilism):** Rae leans toward compatibilist formulations to uphold responsibility under divine sovereignty.
- **Autonomy vs. divine lordship:** Critique of moral autonomy as idolatrous; ethical life is framed under God's authority.
- **Virtue & sanctification:** Moral formation is both habitual (virtue) and theological (sanctification) - ethics is formation, not only rule-following.
- **Moral epistemology:** Defends objective moral knowledge anchored in God and partially accessible via conscience and reason.
- **Moral responsibility:** Individuals remain culpable despite cultural or psychological influences; sociological factors mitigate but do not remove responsibility.
- **Personhood:** Embodied, relational, rational beings created for communion with God and others.
- **Decision-model:** Practical method moving from data (facts and doctrine) to principles to action, aimed at pastoral applicability.
- **Pastoral application:** Ethical theory framed for moral counseling, church practice, and public witness.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical Christian anthropology and moral agency.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrinal anthropology (imago Dei, sin) to applied ethical decision-making in bioethics, sexuality, and social ethics.
