### TITLE
**Karl Barth, Christ and Adam (in Church Dogmatics, esp. IV/1): Man and Humanity in Romans 5**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1950s in CD IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation); often excerpted as the short work Christ and Adam.
 - Mature phase of dialectical theology turned christocentric dogmatics; post-war anthropology re-grounded in revelation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - We know Adam only in the light of Christ: **Christ, the second Adam, is the original in God s will; Adam is the provisional type whose truth and untruth are disclosed by Christ**.
 - Re-reads original sin, imputation, and corporate solidarity through the one-for-the-many event of Jesus Christ (Rom 5; 1 Cor 15).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture-first dogmatics: close exegesis of Rom 5:12-21 (with 1 Cor 15) to establish asymmetrical typology.
 - **Asymmetry**: Christ determines Adam, not vice versa; the Yes of God in Christ includes and overcomes the No borne by Adamic humanity.
 - **Representation and substitution**: the one for the many; the Judge judged in our place; justification grounded in union with Christ, not a bare legal transfer.
 - **Objective then subjective order**: reconciliation accomplished in Christ for all; faith, baptism, and churchly existence are awakened participation in what is already true in him.
 - **Covenant and creation**: The covenantal purpose of God grounds humanity; creation is the external basis of the covenant, fulfilled in the new humanity of Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Paul (Rom 5; 1 Cor 15) read with Irenaean recapitulation themes; Calvin affirmed yet corrected.
 - In contrast with Augustine s inherited guilt schemes, Reformed federal headship and covenant of works, liberal anthropologies (Schleiermacher), existential demythologizing (Bultmann).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology**: Scripture as normative witness; dogmatics as exegesis.
 - **Trinity/Christology**: the electing God and elected man; anhypostasis/enhypostasis in the one person.
 - **Soteriology**: substitution and representation; justification/rectification; objective reconciliation and its subjective reception.
 - **Sin/Anthropology**: old man/new man; corporate personality; the negated possibility (das Nichtige) in Adam.
 - **Covenant/Election**: all election decided in Christ, the true human.
 - **Eschatology/Ecclesiology**: new creation in the risen Christ; church as witness-participant; baptism as sign of incorporation.
- **Closing line**
 - **The theological center of gravity**: God s Yes to humanity in Jesus Christ decisively defines what humanity is; Adam is intelligible only as the negated and overcome form of that humanity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Christological determination of anthropology: Christ precedes Adam in divine counsel.
 - Asymmetrical typology: not two parallel heads but one definitive human and his shadow.
 - One-for-all representation integrating forensic and participatory accounts.
 - Objective reconciliation prior to human response, safeguarding grace and universality of scope.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **federalism** and a covenant of works that centers Adam as primal norm.
 - Against **Augustinian transmissionism** of guilt as quasi-biological; sin is real solidarity yet judged and displaced in Christ.
 - Against **Pelagian/modern anthropologies** that start from autonomous man rather than revelation.
 - Against purely **forensic imputation** detached from union with Christ; legal standing is grounded in participation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - One for the many; old man/new man; Yes and No of God; the Judge judged in our place; history/time of Jesus Christ; objective-subjective order; humanity of God.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped Reformed and ecumenical treatments of Rom 5 and the New Adam (T. F. Torrance; Berkouwer in dialogue; Balthasar and Moltmann resonances).
 - Provoked debates on universalism, election in Christ, and the nature of imputation and union.
- **Enduring value**
 - A robust christological anthropology; a canonical, doctrinally responsible model of exegesis; a powerful resource for preaching, catechesis, and sacramental instruction on union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Second Adam**
 - Christ as definitive human; Adam derivative and disclosed by Christ.
- **Asymmetrical typology**
 - Type fulfilled from the antitype downward; Christ determines Adam.
- **One for the many**
 - Representation and substitution as the form of reconciliation (Rom 5:18-19).
- **Old man / New man**
 - Adamic existence judged and set aside; new humanity constituted in Christ.
- **Objective reconciliation / Subjective participation**
 - Salvation accomplished in Christ, then participated in by the Spirit through faith and baptism.
- **Imputation in union**
 - Righteousness reckoned on the ground of being-in-Christ, not an external legal fiction.
- **Election in Christ**
 - Christ as electing God and elected man; humanity chosen in him.
- **Covenant and creation**
 - Creation serves covenantal fellowship realized in the new Adam.
- **Humanity of God**
 - God s gracious condescension in Christ reveals true humanity.
- **Anhypostasis / Enhypostasis**
 - Christ s human nature has no independent personhood; truly personal in the Logos for us.
- **The Judge judged**
 - Divine judgment borne by Christ to justify the ungodly.
- **Corporate personality / Solidarity**
 - Humanity viewed in collective headship, redefined by Christ.
- **Yes and No of God**
 - God s No to sin is enclosed within the greater Yes to humanity in Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Christology and Anthropology: definitional source for humanity-in-Christ and vicarious humanity.
 - Soteriology and Covenant: conceptual pivot against federalism, for union-grounded imputation and election.
 - Bibliology and Exegesis: model of doctrinally governed reading of Rom 5 and 1 Cor 15.
 - Ecclesiology/Sacraments: framework for baptismal incorporation and church as witness to an accomplished reconciliation.
