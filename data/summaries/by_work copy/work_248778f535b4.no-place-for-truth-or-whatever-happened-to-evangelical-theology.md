### TITLE
No Place for Truth, or Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology? - David F. Wells

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1993 during cultural shifts in late-20th-century evangelicalism: rise of megachurch pragmatism, therapeutic religion, market-driven ministry, and waning confessional theology.
 - Responds from a conservative Reformed perspective to trends in North American evangelical institutions and seminaries.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelicalism has largely abandoned *truth* - doctrinal, propositional knowledge about God - in favor of pragmatism, experience, and relevance; as a result theology is diminished, church practice is shallow, and the means of grace are misunderstood or neglected.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: historical and cultural analysis of shifts from doctrinal seriousness to pragmatic "success" metrics in church and academy.
 - Genealogy: traces influences (liberalism, pietism, existential theology, consumer culture) that hollowed out doctrinal formation.
 - Institutional critique: seminaries, parachurch organizations, and churches adopt managerial and therapeutic priorities over theological formation.
 - Recuperation: defense of theology as disciplined, propositional inquiry; insistence on robust preaching, sacraments, and prayer as formative means of grace.
 - Practical implications: calls for recovery of confessional theological formation, curricular renewal, and renewed emphasis on preaching and liturgy.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with modern and modernizing theology: Schleiermacher (subjective turn), liberal theology, elements of neo-orthodoxy, and contemporary evangelical leaders/practices.
 - Interacts implicitly with Reformed confessional tradition and critiques of pietism and pragmatism more than sustained technical engagement with a single systematician.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture: critique of reduced notions of propositional revelation and authority.
 - Theology (nature and task): insists theology is cognitive, propositional, and public.
 - Ecclesiology and means of grace: central attention to preaching, sacraments, and prayer as formative.
 - Indirectly: doctrine of God and Christology as content endangered by theological neglect.

- **Closing line**
 - A polemical call to return evangelicalism to theology as rigorous, truth-focused intellectual discipline, recovering preaching and the means of grace as central to Christian formation (see esp. sections on Theological Method; Nature and Task of Theology; Means of Grace: Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp coupling of *truth* (propositional knowledge) with the health of church life; theology is not optional or merely pastoral but foundational.
 - Unapologetic reclamation of theology as an intellectual discipline distinct from spirituality, counseling, or managerial church practice.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic and experiential emphases that privatize religion; contrasts with approaches that prioritize relevance or technique over doctrine.
 - Pushes back on "market" ecclesiology that measures success by growth metrics rather than formation in truth.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames contemporary evangelical decline as a loss of "place for truth"-a useful shorthand for the conflation of truth with utility/experience.
 - Advocates a conception of theology-as-disciplined inquiry (theology-as-science in the classical sense of disciplined, verifiable knowledge) rather than ecclesial entertainment or therapeutic practice.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among conservative and Reformed evangelical educators and pastors; used as a rallying critique in seminary reform and confessional renewal.
 - Provoked debate: praised for diagnosis and urgency; criticized by others for perceived nostalgia or insufficient engagement with legitimate critiques of doctrinalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise cultural-theological diagnosis and a resource for re-centering theological education, homiletics, and sacramental practice in evangelical contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Truth** - Propositional, objective content about God that forms Christians; the book's central value.
- **Theology as discipline** - Theology conceived as rigorous, public, cognitive inquiry (analogous to "theology as science" in methodical seriousness).
- **Propositional revelation** - Critique of reducing revelation to experience; insistence on verbal, doctrinal content.
- **Confessionalism** - Recovery of creeds and confessions as vehicles for doctrinal formation.
- **Pragmatism (church)** - The managerial, success-oriented ethos critiqued for displacing truth.
- **Pietism / subjectivism** - Historical culprits for privatizing faith and sidelining doctrine.
- **Means of grace** - Preaching, sacraments, and prayer as the forms through which doctrine forms life; Wells insists these be doctrinally saturated.
 - Preaching - Central, doctrinal, formative act; opposed to therapeutic or purely motivational speaking.
 - Sacraments - Undervalued where theology is weak; need reintegration into confessionally-formed practice.
 - Prayer - Not merely experiential but shaped by truth and doctrine.
- **Seminary formation** - Critique of vocational and managerial training that neglects theological depth.
- **Authority (Scripture)** - Defense of Scripture's doctrinal authority against reductionist readings.
- **Cultural diagnosis** - The book's method: sociological-historical analysis linked to theological consequences.
- **Theological illiteracy** - Term-like descriptor for evangelical laity and clergy lacking doctrinal knowledge.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what constitutes theology as disciplined propositional inquiry.
 - As a **polemic** against pragmatic, managerial, or therapeutic models of church and ministry.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula and preaching seminars aiming to re-center doctrine and the means of grace.
