### TITLE
Preaching Christ from the Old Testament (1999) - Sidney Greidanus

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed-evangelical homiletical revival. Responds to historical-critical estrangement of the OT from Christian proclamation and to homiletical trends that either moralize or allegorize OT texts.
 - Addresses pastors, homileticians, and seminarians seeking a theologically faithful method to connect Old and New Testaments in proclamation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament must be preached as Christian Scripture: sermons on OT texts must show how they point to and find their historical and consummate fulfillment in Christ, without abandoning sound exegesis of the original context.
 - Problem being corrected: both the neglect of Christological reading and abuses of allegory/proof-texting that either detach meaning from context or reduce OT to mere proof snippets.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: many preachers either (a) ignore the Christological center of OT, (b) allegorize and spiritualize, or (c) use NT proof-texts without adequate exegesis.
 - Proposal: a hermeneutic and homiletical method that is both redemptive-historical and historically-grammatical.
 - Homiletical move recommended (recurring formula):
 - Exposition of the OT text in its original historical and canonical context (what the text meant).
 - Demonstration of the text's place in salvation history - how it is a promise, type, prophecy, or foreshadowing.
 - Connection to its fulfillment in Christ as attested in the New Testament.
 - Contemporary application for Christian faith and life.
 - Practical help: classification of Christological material in the OT (types, prophecies, promises), steps for exegesis, and sermon outlines modeled on the promise-fulfillment approach.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages tradition broadly: appeals to Reformed and patristic typological readings (e.g., Calvinian and earlier typological practice) while dialoguing with modern critical scholarship that cautions against naive typologizing.
 - Interlocutors include homileticians and biblical scholars who separate Testaments or de-emphasize canonical unity; also counters allegorizing tendencies from both historical and modern sources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (unity of OT and NT)
 - Covenant and redemptive history
 - Christology (Christ as fulfillment and telos)
 - Typology and prophecy (hermeneutics of fulfillment)
 - Preaching theory and application (homiletics)

- **Closing line**
 - Greidanus centers the book on the claim that faithful Old Testament preaching must be both exegetically responsible and decisively Christ-centered: the OT's promise-structures and types find their meaning and goal in Jesus Christ, and preaching must mediate that promise-fulfillment to the congregation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sets a clear, repeatable "promise-fulfillment" homiletical formula that requires due attention to original context before moving to Christ and application.
 - Stresses canonical and redemptive-historical reading without abandoning historical-grammatical exegesis.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic moralizing that treats OT narratives as isolated ethical exemplars.
 - Counters both raw proof-texting (NT verses pasted onto OT texts) and unfettered allegory by insisting on a teological-historical bridge: typology grounded in redemptive history and NT witness.
 - Offers a middle path between liberal form-critical separation and naive typological reading.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic articulation of homiletical categories for Christ in the OT (prophetic, typical, anagogical as clarified) and operational rules for moving from type to antitype.
 - Emphasis on sermon structure as theological bridge (promise -> fulfillment -> application), rather than mere rhetorical device.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries and churches as a primary textbook on OT preaching.
 - Influential in the revival of redemptive-historical preaching; also sparked debates about the limits of typological reading and concerns about over-Christologizing.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical model for pastors learning to preach the OT Christologically while maintaining exegetical integrity.
 - Continues to serve as the standard reference for homiletical integration of OT material into New Testament-centered proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Promise-fulfillment (homiletical formula)**: Exposition of OT promise → historical fulfillment in Christ (NT witness) → contemporary application.
- **Redemptive-historical reading**: Interpreting OT texts as stages within the covenantal unfolding that culminates in Christ.
- **Typology / type and antitype**: Persons/events/institutions in the OT that prefigure (type) their realization in Christ (antitype); must be historically grounded and canonical.
- **Prophetic fulfillment**: Direct predictive promises or foreshadowings that the NT interprets as realized in Jesus.
- **Christotelic**: The view that Scripture's ultimate aim (telos) is Christ - Greidanus insists sermons manifest this telos.
- **Historical-grammatical exegesis**: Careful attention to original meaning and context; the constraint against arbitrary allegory.
- **Proof-texting (critique of)**: The tendency to superimpose NT texts on OT passages without adequate exegesis; Greidanus warns against this abuse.
- **Canonical reading**: Interpreting a text within the larger unity of Scripture and the story of salvation history.
- **Application (homiletical aim)**: The pastoral step that draws contemporary implications from the text-as-fulfilled-in-Christ.
- **Foreshadowing / typological motif**: Recurring patterns in salvation history that indicate Christological fulfillment.
- **Antitype caution**: Greidanus warns that not every OT element is a christological antitype; criteria must be met.
- **Christ in OT and NT**: The focal topic - how texts speak of Christ both implicitly (OT) and explicitly (NT).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary **exegetical-homiletical model** for preaching Old Testament texts in seminary courses and pastor training.
- As a **definition source** for redemptive-historical and typological preaching methodology.
- As a **polemic resource** against allegorical preaching and careless proof-texting, and as a conceptual pivot toward canonical unity in biblical theology.
