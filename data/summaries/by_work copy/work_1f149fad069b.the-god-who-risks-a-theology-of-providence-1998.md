### TITLE
The God Who Risks: A Theology of Providence (John Sanders, 1998)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1990s evangelical theological scene; height of renewed debate over providence, foreknowledge, and divine sovereignty.
 - Part of the resurgence of **open theism** following earlier work by Clark Pinnock; addresses both academic and pastoral concerns within conservative Protestantism.
 - Method: biblical-theological exegesis combined with analytic philosophy of religion and pastoral sensitivity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God willingly accepts genuine risk in creating free creatures; providence is essentially relational and persuasive rather than determinative.
 - The key doctrinal problem: how to reconcile divine sovereignty, omniscience, and providence with human freedom and the reality of divine change in Scripture.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - God's knowledge: affirms omniscience broadly but denies that God necessarily possesses exhaustive definite foreknowledge (EDK) of future free acts that are not yet settled.
 - God's action: providence operates primarily by **constraining possibilities**, persuasive presence, and covenantal promises rather than exhaustive micromanagement.
 - God's temporality: God is temporally engaged; God experiences succession and is responsive to creaturely actions (prophetic negotiation, intercession).
 - Pastoral and exegetical emphasis: reads biblical texts (e.g., Genesis 6 flood narrative, Jonah, Moses intercession, prophetic repentance passages) as depicting genuine divine change and relational risk.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Allies: contemporary open theists (e.g., Clark Pinnock, William Hasker).
 - Primary critics engaged implicitly or explicitly: defenders of classical theism and Molinism (e.g., Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig tradition), conservative Reformed exponents of EDK (e.g., John Feinberg).
 - Uses biblical texts, historical theology selectively, and contemporary analytic arguments about knowledge and modality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence (central), divine foreknowledge, omniscience, freedom and human agency, covenantal relation, prayer and intercession, divine immutability/impassibility (reinterpreted), divine condescension/self-limitation.

- **Closing line**
 - Sanders' theological center of gravity: **a God whose love entails risk - a providence that preserves genuine creaturely freedom by adopting a self-limiting, relational mode of government.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Bold re-description of providence as **risk-taking and responsive** rather than micromanaging.
 - Insistence that divine condescension includes a voluntary **epistemic and causal self-limitation** so that humans can act freely and relationally.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with classical Reformed accounts that prioritize exhaustive divine control and timeless knowledge of all future events.
 - Diverges from Molinism by rejecting middle knowledge as the best explanation for divine foreknowledge and providential ordering.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts **"omnipotence" and "omniscience"** within a relational framework (God can do all that is logically possible and knows all that can be known about future free acts).
 - Emphasizes **divine risk** as a theological category connected to love and relational commitment.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked vigorous debate in evangelical circles; contributed to a set of interchanges (articles, books, symposia) on foreknowledge and providence.
 - Widely cited by pastors and theologians sympathetic to relational accounts of God; criticized by analytic philosophers and classical theists for alleged incoherence or theological costs.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for exegetical attention to biblical texts depicting divine change; pastoral framing of prayer and suffering; clarifies stakes of modeling divine-human relation.
 - Useful corrective where doctrines of providence become mechanistic or depersonalized.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism**
 - The theological stance that the future is partly open and not exhaustively settled; God knows possibilities and probabilities, not necessarily definite future free acts.

- **Divine Risk**
 - The claim that God voluntarily incurs real possibilities of creaturely divergence from divine desires as a cost of genuine relationship.

- **Providence (persuasive model)**
 - Divine governance that primarily works by persuasion, covenantal promise, and influence rather than exhaustive deterministic control.

- **Exhaustive Definite Foreknowledge (EDK)**
 - The classical claim that God infallibly knows every future free act; Sanders rejects EDK for unsettled future choices.

- **Omniscience (reconfigured)**
 - God knows all that is knowable; future free actions are not knowable as settled facts prior to being actualized.

- **Divine Condescension**
 - God's loving self-limitation in relation to creatures; in Sanders' use, includes epistemic and causal condescension that permits creaturely freedom.

- **Temporal Engagement**
 - The view that God is genuinely in temporal sequence and responds contingently to creaturely acts (prophetic change, intercession).

- **Libertarian Freedom**
 - Human freedom understood as undetermined by prior causes; central for Sanders' account of why future acts are open.

- **Molinism / Middle Knowledge**
 - The rival attempt to reconcile divine foreknowledge and free will via God's knowledge of counterfactuals; Sanders rejects it as unnecessary or incoherent.

- **Immutability / Impassibility (reinterpreted)**
 - Sanders reframes these classical attributes to allow for relational change without implying moral or metaphysical deficiency in God.

- **Biblical Exemplars (Moses, Jonah, prophets)**
 - Used to argue that Scripture depicts genuine divine change and repentance in response to prayer and human action.

- **Covenantal Promise and Risk**
 - God's commitments in covenantal contexts create known patterns and promises but do not eliminate free divergence.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for open theist positions on foreknowledge and providence.
 - As a **polemic** against classical EDK-based accounts of divine sovereignty.
 - As an **exegetical model** for readings that emphasize anthropomorphic and responsive depictions of God in Scripture.
 - As a **pastoral resource** for approaches to prayer, suffering, and divine presence that stress relational contingency.
