### TITLE
The Calvin Handbook - Section on **Common Grace** (Herman Selderhuis)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Modern edited handbook (Selderhuis, 21st century) synthesizing Calvin scholarship for historical-theological readers.
 - Engages 16th-century Reformation milieu (Calvin in Geneva) and subsequent Reformed developments (post-Calvinian orthodoxy, Kuyperian common-grace debates).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin articulates what can be called a doctrine of **common grace**-God's benevolent preserving and sustaining action toward all humans and creation-but he does so without the later technical language and while safeguarding the necessity and exclusivity of saving (special) grace.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base: Institutes, Sermons, Commentaries, letters - traces passages where Calvin affirms gifts, preservation, and civic virtues among the non-elect.
 - Distinguishes types of divine activity:
 - Providence and conservation of creation (material and social order).
 - Restraint of sin and maintenance of civil righteousness (public good).
 - Distribution of natural gifts and cultural capacities to all people.
 - Polemical moves: rejects any notion that these ordinary benefits confer salvation; stresses human corruption and need for Christ.
 - Historical-theological move: situates Calvin between patristic/medieval antecedents and later systematicizations (Kuyper, 19th-20th c.).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Calvin (primary), with frequent contrasts to Augustine and medieval scholasticism; later interlocutors include Beza, Dutch neo-Calvinists (Kuyper), and post-Reformation orthodoxies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, preservation, sin and corruption, election, revelation (natural and general), law, vocation/callings, magistracy and civil order.
- **Closing line**
 - Selderhuis shows that **Calvin affirms a robust, providentially ordered common benevolence from God that preserves society and enables culture, yet he keeps it strictly subordinate to and distinct from the saving work of Christ and special grace**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reads Calvin's common-grace material primarily through his doctrine of providence and the practical theology of the magistrate and church order.
 - Emphasizes Calvin's pastoral caution: common blessings cannot be spiritualized into salvation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects anachronistic readings that project Kuyperian categories onto Calvin; Selderhuis insists Calvin did not systematize "common grace" as a technical category but practiced its theology.
 - Contrasts Calvin's restrained use with later Dutch Reformed amplification that treats common grace as a principle for cultural optimism and Christian-non-Christian cooperation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Highlights Calvin's lexical choices (gifts, benevolence, conservation) rather than later jargon; thus reframes "common grace" as an explanatory label rather than Calvin's own distinct term.
- **Reception and influence**
 - The chapter functions as a corrective resource in current Reformed debates: used by those who want a historically faithful Calvinist account that resists over- or under-emphasizing common grace.
 - Influential for scholars and pastors seeking balance between cultural engagement and doctrinal particularity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, source-grounded model for teaching Calvin on how God's general goodness relates to election and redemption; useful for seminars on providence, law, and public theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace**
 - God's non-saving benevolence toward all people: preservation, gifts, restraining sin, enabling social order.
- **Special (saving) grace**
 - Grace operative in regeneration and redemption exclusively for the elect via Christ.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance that conserves the world and administers both common and special providences.
- **Conservation / preservation**
 - Divine sustaining action that keeps creation and civil life functioning.
- **Restraint of sin**
 - God's ordinary governance that limits the full eruption of human depravity for societal good.
- **Natural gifts / cultural capacitites**
 - Talents and intelligences given to the non-elect that permit artistry, science, and civic order.
- **Natural (general) revelation**
 - Knowledge of God and moral order accessible to all; insufficient for salvation but part of common grace.
- **Law (civil and moral)**
 - Public norms and magistral institutions upheld by God's providence as part of maintaining order.
- **Magistracy / vocation**
 - Offices and callings ordained by God; Calvin connects civil duty with the outworking of common grace.
- **Election / reprobation**
 - Doctrinal poles that Calvin keeps central; common grace never undermines particular redemption.
- **Gifts to the reprobate**
 - Phenomenon Calvin notes: virtuous acts and blessings among non-elect that demonstrate God's benevolence without effecting salvation.
- **Benevolence (Calvin's language)**
 - Frequent term pointing to God's outward kindness and provision.
- **Conflation warning**
 - Selderhuis highlights the danger of conflating common and special grace in practical theology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **historical-definition source**: clarifies what Calvin meant and did not mean by notions later labeled "common grace."
- As a **polemic resource**: used to critique both Kuyperian overreach and antinomian denial of public good.
- As an **exegetical-model**: demonstrates method of reading Institutes, sermons, and commentaries together to reconstruct pastoral theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching providence, church-state relations, and Christian cultural engagement.
