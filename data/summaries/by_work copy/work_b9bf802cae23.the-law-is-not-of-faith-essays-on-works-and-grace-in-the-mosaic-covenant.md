### TITLE
The Law Is Not of Faith: Essays on Works and Grace in the Mosaic Covenant - Lee J. Irons

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-covenantal debate (early 21st century). Responds to intra-Reformed disputes over the theological status of the Mosaic covenant and to exegetical readings of Paul (Romans/Galatians) influenced by both confessional Reformed and New Perspective scholarship.
 - A scholarly collection aimed at pastors, seminarians, and academic readers interested in covenant theology and Pauline exegesis.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Mosaic covenant should not be construed as a covenant of works in the sense that it offers justification or covenantal standing on the basis of human works; rather, its law and stipulations must be understood in continuity with God's covenantal dealings-distinguished carefully between covenantal obligation and the grounds of acceptance before God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchor: close readings of Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) and OT covenant texts to determine Paul's use of "law" and "works."
 - Conceptual move: clarifies and limits the technical category "covenant of works" so it is not conflated with every covenantal arrangement that includes obligations.
 - Historical-theological move: surveys Reformed and patristic treatments to show orthodox continuity that resists reducing Mosaic law to a works-based ground of justification.
 - Systematic synthesis: proposes a framework where Mosaic obligations function as covenantal stipulations within a broader economy of God's grace rather than as meritorious means to divine acceptance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary textual interlocutors: Pauline corpus (Romans, Galatians), Deuteronomy and Sinai covenant texts.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: proponents and critics within Reformed covenant theology (those who press a strict "covenant of works" label on Sinai) and voices from the New Perspective who read Paul's "works of the law" in ethnic/marker terms.
 - Historical sources: Reformers and Reformed confessions/orthodoxy used as context and corrective.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Mosaic covenant, covenant of works vs. covenant of grace)
 - Soteriology (justification, imputation, faith, works)
 - Biblical theology (law, Torah, Pauline hermeneutics)
 - Ecclesiology/ethics (role of obedience/covenant stipulations for covenant life)

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Irons aims to preserve a disciplined distinction: the Mosaic law issues covenantal obligations but does not function as the ground of acceptance before God-God's gracious covenantal structure, not human merit, remains primary.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous boundary-drawing around the technical category "covenant of works," preventing its overextension to any covenant that contains commands and sanctions.
 - Methodological insistence that Pauline arguments about "law" and "works" must be read in their covenantal and juridical contexts, not as blanket condemnations of Mosaic covenantal life.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that equate Mosaic covenant with a works-based soteriology, whether from some revivalist "works-covenant" readings within Reformed circles or from opponents who portray Paul as anti-Torah wholesale.
 - Acts as corrective to simplistic uses of "works of the law" in New Perspective debates by reasserting normative covenantal categories from a confessional vantage.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies a threefold distinction often implied but not stated: (1) covenantal obligation, (2) covenantal sanction/penalty, (3) covenantal ground of acceptance - and insists on analytic separation for theological precision.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary Reformed discussions on the Mosaic covenant; used as a standard corrective against both legalistic and anti-nomian misreadings.
 - Serves as a go-to resource in seminary courses on covenant theology and Pauline ethics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a model of careful exegesis married to confessional categories; valuable for teaching how to navigate complex covenantal vocabulary without collapsing theological distinctions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic covenant**
 - The covenant given through Moses (Sinai/Deuteronomy) with stipulations, sanctions, and cultic provisions-treated as covenantal but not meritorious ground of justification.

- **Covenant of works**
 - Technical category: originally applied to pre-Fall covenant with Adam; Irons defends a narrow sense to avoid mislabeling Mosaic arrangements.

- **Covenant of grace**
 - The overarching covenantal framework in which divine promises and redemptive continuity are located; Mosaic law is interpreted within this economy.

- **Works / works of the law**
 - Differentiates moral/obediential works as covenant duties from Pauline polemical use (which may target attempts to claim status by law-keeping).

- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration of righteousness; Irons emphasizes that Mosaic law does not supply its ground.

- **Faith**
 - The means of receiving covenant promises; contrasted with attempts to ground acceptance in human works.

- **Law (Torah)**
 - Multifaceted: instruction, covenant stipulation, cultic code; not reducible to a juridical "grounds of acceptance."

- **Imputation**
 - Doctrinal category concerning crediting righteousness; kept distinct from covenantal obedience required by the law.

- **Conditional covenant**
 - Used to show that conditional obligations and sanctions do not necessarily imply a works-based soteriology.

- **Covenantal administration**
 - The idea that God administers one saving covenant through different economies (patriarchal, Mosaic, Christ) - Irons stresses continuity with qualifications.

- **Typology / promise-fulfillment**
 - Mosaic institutions interpreted as typological, pointing forward to Christ rather than functioning as permanent meritorious systems.

- **Sanction / curse**
 - Distinguishes punitive consequences of covenant breach from salvific grounds.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: clarifies and defends technical uses of "covenant of works" vs "covenant of grace."
 - Polemic: employed to counter readings that treat Sinai as a soteriological works-system or to rebut reductionist New Perspective claims.
 - Exegetical model: exemplar of close Pauline and Deuteronomic exegesis tied to systematic categories.
 - Conceptual pivot: used to recalibrate discussions of law, faith, and covenant continuity in Reformed theology.
