### TITLE
**Jesus and the Kingdom of God** - Craig A. Evans (Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Short, authoritative encyclopedia article located in a late 20th-century/early 21st-century reference volume aimed at students and scholars of the New Testament. Reflects mainstream historical-critical and evangelical-engaged scholarship attentive to Second Temple Jewish background.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Jesus' proclamation of the Kingdom of God is best understood as rooted in Jewish apocalyptic expectation, combining both inaugurated (present) and eschatological (future consummation) dimensions; Jesus manifests and announces God's reign in word, deed, and self-understanding (including a messianic consciousness), without reducing the kingdom to either only ethical reform or only future political deliverance.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Establish historical background: Jewish hopes for God's reign, covenant restoration, and messianic expectations.
 - Analyze Synoptic portrayal of kingdom language (parables, sayings, pronouncements).
 - Emphasize the twofold temporal profile: "already" (miracles, forgiving sins, authoritative teaching) and "not yet" (parousia, final judgment, consummation).
 - Link Jesus' ministry and signs to inauguration: deeds as kingdom-attesting miracles; parables as interpretive keys to kingdom character.
 - Conclude with the relationship of Jesus' messianic self-awareness to his kingdom preaching-he both announces and embodies the rule of God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages the scholarly conversation with proponents of realized eschatology (e.g., C. H. Dodd), Schweitzeran/apocalyptic readings, and more recent apocalyptic-revivalists; interacts with Synoptic and Johannine texts, early Christian proclamation, and Second Temple Jewish literature as background.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Eschatology**, **Christology** (messianic consciousness), **covenant/kingdom theology**, **revelation** (God's rule disclosed), with incidental impact on **soteriology** (kingdom as the soteriological horizon).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Jesus announces and inaugurates God's eschatological rule: a kingdom both present in his words and deeds and awaiting future consummation, grounded in his identity as the eschatological agent within Israel's covenantal horizon.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on a balanced "inaugurated eschatology"-neither wholly future nor wholly realized; kingdom as God's active reign rather than merely a location or ethical program.
 - Treats Jesus' miracles explicitly as **kingdom signs** that validate his proclamation and messianic agency.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against over-realized readings (which collapse the kingdom into present ethical presence) and against views that wholly privatize Jesus' message from Jewish apocalyptic expectation.
 - Counters reductionist social-gospel readings by reasserting eschatological and covenantal contours.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Subtle reframing of "kingdom" vocabulary to prioritize **kingship/ rule** over spatial metaphors; emphasizes the interplay of parable-interpretation and action as hermeneutical keys.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used as a concise, scholarly summary in New Testament courses and reference works; influential among scholars who seek to preserve both Jewish apocalyptic context and the theological significance of Jesus' messianic self-understanding.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Reliable survey that models how to integrate literary-critical exegesis, historical context, and theological implications; particularly useful as a compact entry point into debates over realized vs. inaugurated eschatology and Jesus' messianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven** - primary motif indicating God's sovereign rule; Evans stresses functional rule over spatial metaphor.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - kingdom is already present in Jesus' ministry but awaits consummation.
- **Realized eschatology (critique)** - overemphasized by some predecessors; Evans critiques its collapse of future hope.
- **Apocalyptic expectation** - Second Temple Jewish horizon shaping Jesus' message and messianic hopes.
- **Messianic consciousness** - Jesus' self-understanding as eschatological agent; not merely nationalist king but covenant-restoring figure.
- **Parables** - interpretive medium revealing kingdom character and boundaries; both revelation and concealment.
- **Signs and wonders / miracles** - concrete kingdom-attesting acts that validate Jesus' proclamation.
- **Son of Man** - eschatological title linked to judgment and vindication; used to connect Jesus' identity with kingdom consummation.
- **Covenant restoration** - kingdom as fulfillment of Israel's covenantal hopes.
- **Rule/royal imagery** - emphasis on God's sovereign reign rather than a territorial realm.
- **Present/future tension** - recurring synthetic motif: already inaugurated, not yet consummated.
- **Ethical demand of the kingdom** - kingdom proclamation entails moral transformation but is not limited to it.
- **Parousia** - future coming that will consummate the kingdom.
- **Soteriological horizon** - kingdom-centered framework for salvation in word and deed.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - Definition source: concise, balanced working definition of "kingdom" for lecture and syllabi.
 - Exegetical model: template for integrating parable-study, miracle-material, and Jewish background in interpreting kingdom sayings.
 - Polemic/resource: deployed against both hyper-realized and purely ethical/social readings of Jesus' message; used to defend a historically rooted inaugurated-eschatological approach.
