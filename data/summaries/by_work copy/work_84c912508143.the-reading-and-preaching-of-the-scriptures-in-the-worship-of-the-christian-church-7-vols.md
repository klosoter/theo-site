### TITLE
The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church (7 vols.) - Hughes Oliphant Old

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Multi-volume, late 20th / early 21st-century scholarly project by a Reformed homiletician and liturgical historian (Eerdmans). Designed as a comprehensive historical-theological survey of how Scripture has been read and preached in corporate worship from the early church to modernity.
 - Situated at the intersection of historical theology, liturgical studies, and homiletics; written from a broadly confessional, ecumenical perspective with special attention to Reformed and Anglican traditions while treating Eastern and Roman practices.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The public reading and preaching of Scripture are constitutive acts of Christian worship and primary *means of grace*; they cannot be understood apart from the liturgical framework, sacramental life, and ecclesial formation of the assembly.
 - Raises persistent doctrinal problems: How does the Word function as a means of grace alongside the sacraments? How have differing answers informed Eucharistic theology (presence of Christ) and pastoral practices (fencing and admission)?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Each volume treats a major historical period, combining:
 - historical description of liturgical forms and rubrics;
 - close readings of sermons, lectionaries, and liturgical texts;
 - theological synthesis showing the evolving understanding of Word, sacrament, and assembly.
 - Major movements traced:
 - Early church lectio, catechetical reading, patristic homiletics.
 - Medieval proclamation and scholastic sacramental theology.
 - Reformation recoveries: divergent Lutheran, Reformed, and Zwinglian emphases.
 - Post-Reformation confessional, Puritan, Anglican, Pietist, and modern developments leading into 20th-century liturgical renewal.
 - Persistent claim: preaching functions as a formative, corporate act (not merely private exegesis) and often functions as a means of grace analogous to sacraments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic: Chrysostom, Augustine, Ambrose; Medieval: Bernard, Aquinas; Reformers: Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Zwingli; Puritans and Reformed orthodox writers; Anglican divines (Cranmer, Hooker); modern figures (Dix, Bonhoeffer, Barth among interlocutors).
 - Utilizes sermon corpora, lectionaries, pastoral manuals, liturgical rubrics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; Word as event; sacramentology; covenantal hearing; Christology as related to Eucharistic presence; ecclesiology (assembly, office of preacher); pastoral theology of admission and fencing of the table.

- **Closing line**
 - At theological center: the proclaimed Word in the gathered assembly, shaped and received within sacramental and liturgical structures, is the decisive means by which the church is formed and sustained.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats *reading* (lectio) and *preaching* together as liturgical actions; stresses continuity between reading, proclamation, and sacrament.
 - Argues for the formative power of corporate hearing - preaching as a communal, disciplining means of grace rather than primarily an intellectual exercise.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against treatments that isolate homiletics from liturgy or reduce preaching to information delivery.
 - Nuances polarized Reformation-era narratives: demonstrates a range of Eucharistic theology (real presence, spiritual presence, memorialist positions) and their practical ramifications (table fencing, admission criteria).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames preaching as a kind of sacramental act within the economy of means of grace (not replacing baptism/Eucharist but functioning in sacramental ecology).
 - Rehabilitates the language of "assembly" and "hearing" as theological categories for homiletics.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in seminary homiletics and church-history courses; influential for liturgical renewal and for pastors seeking historically grounded pastoral practice.
 - Respected across Reformed and ecumenical circles; some critique for limited non-Western scope and for privileging ecclesial continuity over disruptive reform movements.

- **Enduring value**
 - Comprehensive, usable synthesis linking historical detail to pastoral theology; a go-to resource for exegetical-homiletic formation and for debates on Word-sacrament relations (including Eucharistic presence and table discipline).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Means of grace**
 - The Word (reading and preaching) is treated alongside baptism and Eucharist as primary instruments through which God forms the church.

- **Preaching as liturgical act**
 - Public proclamation within worship, not merely a didactic sermon; formative for corporate identity.

- **Reading / Lectio**
 - The liturgical practice of Scriptural reading (lectionary, lectio continua) as a shape-giver for theology and piety.

- **Assembly (ekklesia)**
 - The gathered congregation as the primary locus of Scripture's hearing and sacramental mediation.

- **Sacraments**
 - Treated relationally with the Word; sacraments and preaching form a sacramental ecology.

- **Lord's Supper: Presence of Christ**
 - Surveys competing doctrines (real bodily presence, spiritual/real presence, memorialist) and traces how each shaped worship and pastoral practice.

- **Fencing and admission**
 - Historical practices of table discipline: theological rationale, pastoral implementation, and changing criteria across periods.

- **Lectionary**
 - Role in shaping homiletic content and theological imagination; mediates canonical reading.

- **Covenantal hearing**
 - Hearing as participation in covenant life; the Word effects covenantal response.

- **Homiletical genres**
 - Exposition, catechetical sermon, polemical sermon - all situated within liturgical forms.

- **Pastoral manuals / rubrics**
 - Historical guides for admission to sacraments and for the conduct of preaching and liturgy.

- **Presence vs. Memorialist vocabulary**
 - Helpful contrasts for Eucharistic theology and pastoral discipline debates.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the liturgical-theological meaning of "preaching" and "reading" as means of grace.
 - As a **polemic and historical resource** in debates over Eucharistic presence and the pastoral practice of fencing/admission.
 - As an **exegetical-homiletic model** for shaping lectionary-based exposition within corporate worship.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses that integrate homiletics, sacramentology, and liturgical theology.
