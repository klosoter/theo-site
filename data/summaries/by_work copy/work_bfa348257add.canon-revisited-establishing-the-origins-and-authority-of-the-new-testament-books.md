### TITLE
Canon Revisited: Establishing the Origins and Authority of the New Testament Books - Michael J. Kruger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary evangelical scholarship (2012). Written in an environment of renewed popular and academic interest in canon formation, responding to skeptical claims about late, contested or socially-constructed NT canons. Kruger writes from an evangelical/Reformed background and teaches in a U.S. seminary context.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The 27-book New Testament canon is historically legitimate and the authority of its books derives from their apostolic origin and the church's recognition, not from later ecclesiastical invention. The book challenges narratives that treat the canon as late, accidental, or purely sociological.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - The problem: popular and some scholarly claims that the canon was forged, late, or unstable. 
 - Historical case: evidence from apostolic-era writings, early patristic citations, lectionary use, and church orders shows early recognition of many NT books. 
 - Theological claim: canonical authority rests on apostolicity and the church's recognition (a "recognition" model), under divine providence. 
 - Criteria clarified: apostolic connection, orthodoxy (conformity to the apostolic rule of faith), catholicity (wide and sustained use), and reception in worship and teaching. 
 - Refutation of rivals: critiques of the "canon as consensus"/late invention models and responses to skeptical popularizers (e.g., arguments that Marcion or late councils invented the canon).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Engages primary patristic witnesses (Irenaeus, Clement, Justin, Origen, Tertullian), as well as modern scholars who argue for fluidity or late closure (implicitly and explicitly engaging popular skeptics). Dialogue with textual-criticism and historical-critical methodologies is present but often polemical.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Revelation, inspiration, authority of Scripture, apostolicity, ecclesiology (role of church in recognition), providence, and hermeneutics (canonical normativity).

- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** 
 The New Testament canon is the product of apostolic authority and early ecclesial recognition under providence; therefore the 27 books possess enduring, normative authority for the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong defense of the *recognition* model: the church recognized apostolic texts rather than inventing them. 
 - Heavy use of reception-history (use in worship, citation patterns) as evidence of canonicity.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against views that locate canonical authority primarily in ecclesiastical councils or late consensus. 
 - Challenges popular skeptical narratives that emphasize fragmentation, lost books, or social construction without theological constraints.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clear operationalization of canonical criteria in historically testable terms (apostolic connection + orthodoxy + catholicity + liturgical use). 
 - Emphasis on providential safeguarding of the apostolic corpus as a theological frame for historical data.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely received in evangelical and Reformed circles as a concise, accessible defense of the NT canon. 
 - Adopted in seminary curricula and used as a corrective to popular skeptical literature. 
 - Some academic critics note polemical tone and argue Kruger underplays sociological dimensions and the complexity of textual formation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a readable synthesis of primary evidence and a usable conceptual framework for teaching canonical origins. 
 - Provokes constructive engagement between historians, theologians, and pastors on the authority and formation of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon:** The recognized corpus of authoritative Christian Scripture; Kruger defends the 27-book NT as historically and theologically warranted. 
- **Recognition model:** The view that the church acknowledged the authority of apostolic writings rather than inventing them. 
- **Apostolicity:** Connection to the apostles (authorship, endorsement, or content consonant with apostolic teaching); central criterion for canonicity. 
- **Orthodoxy (rule of faith):** Conformity to the apostolic tradition/trustworthy gospel content; used as a filter for authenticity. 
- **Catholicity (wider usage):** Broad and sustained use across geographically diverse churches; indicates recognition. 
- **Reception-history:** The pattern of citation, liturgical use, and theological appropriation in the early church as evidence for canonical status. 
- **Providence:** The theological conviction that God guided the preservation and recognition of the apostolic corpus. 
- **Self-authentication (canonical force):** Implicit claim that apostolic texts carry intrinsic authority that the church recognises; Kruger stresses internal and external signs of this authority. 
- **Marcion & heresiology:** Historical polemic figures used to show early debates and how canonicity helped define orthodoxy. 
- **Patristic citation evidence:** Use of early church fathers' writings to trace recognition patterns and textual prevalence. 
- **Closed canon / finality:** Defense of a bounded NT corpus against claims of ongoing expansion or fluidity. 
- **Textual-criticism:** Distinct from canon work but used to buttress historical claims about text circulation and stability. 
- **Lectionary / liturgical use:** Practical proof-points for which books functioned as normative Scripture.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a definitional source in systematic theology for the doctrine of Scripture and the nature of canonical authority. 
 - As polemic against skeptical/popular claims about "lost" or late-invented NT books; used in apologetics and church teaching. 
 - As an exegetical and historical model in biblical studies courses to ground the authority of NT books in apostolic origin and reception history.
