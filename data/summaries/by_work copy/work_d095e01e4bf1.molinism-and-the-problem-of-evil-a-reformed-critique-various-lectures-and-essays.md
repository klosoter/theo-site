### TITLE
Molinism and the Problem of Evil: A Reformed Critique (Bruce A. Ware - lectures & essays)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed engagement with contemporary analytic apologetics and philosophy of religion.
 - Responds to the renewed popularity of Molinism (scientia media) advanced by William Lane Craig and others within evangelical circles as a solution to theodicy and divine foreknowledge problems.
 - Situated within broader Reformed commitments to divine sovereignty, classical theism, and compatibilist notions of human freedom.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Molinism, by positing divine knowledge of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom prior to the decree, undermines biblical/Reformed doctrines of God's sovereignty and providential origination and fails to solve the problem of evil without making God morally responsible for evil.
 - A Reformed compatibilist account of providence and decree better preserves divine sovereignty and explains moral responsibility and the presence of evil.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Molinism: the doctrine of scientia media (middle knowledge) - God knows what free creatures would do in any circumstance, enabling God to select a feasible world that secures his ends.
 - Philosophical-theological objections:
 - **Grounding and metaphysics of counterfactuals**: Are counterfactuals true prior to God's decree, and if so, on what ground? Molinism makes such truths logically antecedent to God's creative choice, thus giving creatures a kind of proto-ontological priority.
 - **Sovereignty and origination**: Molinism replaces divine ordination of all contingent facts with divine selection among pre-given creaturely possibilities; this compromises God's role as first cause.
 - **Moral responsibility and theodicy**: If God actualizes a world knowing a better feasible world exists, God appears culpable for permitting evil; Molinism does not evade the charge that God intentionally chose a world with moral evil.
 - Positive Reformed alternative:
 - Defend compatibilist freedom: human actions are genuinely free and morally responsible but metaphysically compatible with divine decree and concursus.
 - Affirm classical theistic doctrines: divine aseity, immutability, complete origination of contingent reality by the decree.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Luis de Molina historically and modern proponents such as William Lane Craig.
 - Dialogues implicitly with Alvin Plantinga (free-will defense, transworld depravity) and with broader Reformed tradition (Calvin, Edwards) on providence and decree.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine sovereignty, decree, foreknowledge, freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist), divine simplicity/aseity, concursus, problem of evil/theodicy, moral responsibility.

- **Closing line**
 - Ware's critique centers theological gravity on the claim that true theism requires God to be the ultimate ordainer and originator of contingent reality; Molinism, by relativizing divine decree to creaturely counterfactuals, fails that requirement and so is an inadequate theodicy from a Reformed perspective.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, systematic insistence that theological method must subjugate philosophical accommodations to core biblical doctrines of sovereignty and origination.
 - Stresses pastoral and moral implications: theology that implicitly makes God the chooser of evil-worlds undermines trust in divine goodness.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts Molinist voluntarism about knowledge-of-creaturely-choices with Reformed claim that God's decree is logically prior and formative of contingent realities.
 - Corrects what Ware views as Molinism's confused ontology: counterfactual truths cannot be true in a robust way prior to God without compromising his aseity.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts standard theistic concerns about middle knowledge in terms of **origination** and **moral culpability** rather than only epistemic coherence.
 - Frames the Molinist move as a *selection theory* of providence (selection among feasible worlds) vs. a *decretive origination* model.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical critiques of Molinism; used in classroom debates on providence and theodicy.
 - Molinists reply by defending metaphysical accounts of counterfactuals and insisting selection does not diminish divine sovereignty; debates remain active.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a clear, theologically rooted statement of how classical theism/Calvinism relates to modern Molinist proposals.
 - Valuable for training students to assess theological proposals on both philosophical coherence and fidelity to confessional commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle Knowledge (scientia media)** - God's knowledge of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom prior to the creative decree.
- **Counterfactuals of Freedom** - Propositions of the form "If person S were placed in circumstance C, S would freely do action A."
- **Feasible Worlds** - Worlds compatible with libertarian freedom as revealed by middle knowledge; God chooses among these when creating.
- **Decretive Will / Divine Decree** - God's efficacious, origination-causing will to bring contingent reality into being (emphasized by Reformed critique).
- **Divine Sovereignty** - Biblical-Reformed claim that God is ultimate ordainer and first cause of all contingent facts.
- **Compatibilist Freedom** - The Reformed account: genuine moral responsibility compatible with divine determinative decree.
- **Libertarian Freedom** - The freedom presupposed by Molinism: indeterministic, agent-caused possibilities.
- **Origination** - The metaphysical priority of the divine decree in bringing contingent truths into being (central contrast with Molinist selection).
- **Moral Culpability of God** - The charge that choosing a world with gratuitous evil makes God morally responsible (Ware contends Molinism faces this problem).
- **Concursus** - Doctrine that God cooperates with creaturely causation preserving divine governance (affirmed under compatibilism).
- **Transworld Depravity (TWD)** - Plantinga's thesis that no feasible world exists where all free creatures always choose rightly; interacts with Molinist claims.
- **Divine Aseity / Immutability** - Attributes jeopardized, Ware argues, if truths about creaturely actions ground divine choice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against Molinist theodicies in courses on the problem of evil and apologetics.
- As a **definition and defense** of Reformed/compatibilist accounts of providence and decree.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about the metaphysics of counterfactuals and the theological import of foreknowledge.
