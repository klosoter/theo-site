### TITLE
William Whitaker - Disputations on the Authority of Holy Scripture (traces cited by Richard A. Muller on Self-Attestation and Authority of Scripture)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century English Reformed scholasticism (Cambridge); Whitaker (1548-1595) was a leading Protestant controversialist and regius professor.
 - Polemical milieu: defense of sola scriptura against Roman Catholic claims of ecclesial magisterium and scholastic Catholic apologists (e.g., Bellarmine‑type argumentation).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the ultimate, *self‑attesting* norm of divine revelation: it possesses intrinsic authority that grounds Christian belief and practice; the Church cannot supplant Scripture as first rule.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes modes of authority and certainty:
 - *Formal authority* of Scripture derives from its divine authorship; Scripture is authoritative in itself.
 - Human assent to that authority is aided but not constituted by the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit.
 - Two complementary lines of proof for Scripture's authority:
 - **Internal testimony**: the Spirit bears witness to the conscience of believers to confirm Scripture's divine origin and truth (assurance for the faithful).
 - **External signs and arguments**: miracles, fulfilled prophecy, coherence and unity of the Scriptures, and historical testimony serve as external confirmation especially for the unconverted or disputing parties.
 - Epistemological move: Whitaker integrates scholastic logical categories to show how objective authority (auctoritas) and subjective certitude (certitudo) relate without making faith merely a private feeling.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opposes Roman Catholic appeals to Church infallibility (Magisterium, tradition). Engages patristic witnesses, Scripture itself, and scholastic logical forms; reads and adapts Reformation sources (Calvinic convictions) within a scholastic method.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture (canon, sufficiency, perspicuity), ecclesial authority, Spirit's testimony, apologetics (miracles and prophecy), epistemology of faith.
- **Closing line**
 - Whitaker's theological center of gravity: Scripture is objectively authoritative by divine origin and self‑witness; the Holy Spirit's inward testimony secures believerly assent while external proofs rebut opponents - together upholding sola scriptura against ecclesiastical claims.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful scholastic articulation of how *objective* divine authority and *subjective* assurance coexist: Scripture is not merely credible because believers feel it is, nor is faith groundless if unbelievers lack the Spirit's witness.
 - Balanced two‑pronged apologetic: privileges internal testimony for the regenerate but does not dismiss external arguments for public disputation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - More methodical and philosophically precise than earlier Reformation polemicists; moves beyond rhetorical assertions of sola scriptura to provide a proto‑epistemology of revelation.
 - Contrasts with Roman Catholic reliance on ecclesial authority by denying that ecclesial testimony can supplant Scripture's primacy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of scholastic categories (authority vs. certainty, formal vs. material grounds) applied to Reformation convictions about Scripture.
 - Clarifies the term "self‑attestation" by distinguishing internal witness (Spirit) from external attestations (signa).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in English Reformed circles and in later Reformed orthodoxy for systematizing defenses of scriptural authority.
 - Cited by subsequent theologians and by modern historians (e.g., Muller) as a key example of Reformed scholastic treatment of Scripture's authority.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful pedagogically for teaching the epistemology of revelation; fruitful for polemical contexts where the interplay of Spirit testimony and historical proof must be defended.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self‑attestation** - Scripture's claim to be divine is, in a sense, internally authoritative; it presents itself as God's word and requires recognition.
- **Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** - the Spirit's inward witness that confirms Scripture's divine origin and grants assurance to the believer.
- **External signs (signa)** - miracles, prophecies, the Church's historical testimony, and Scriptural coherence used as public proof of Scripture's divine source.
- **Auctoritas (authority)** - objective rightness and rule‑giving status of Scripture grounded in divine authorship.
- **Certitudo (certainty)** - subjective assurance enjoyed by believers, related to but distinct from objective authority.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - Scripture contains all necessary truth for salvation and doctrine; Whitaker defends both material and formal sufficiency against appeal to extra‑scriptural infallibility.
- **Perspicuity** - Scripture's clarity for essentials; Whitaker accepts a qualified perspicuity, mediated by the Spirit and interpretive labor.
- **Magisterium / ecclesial infallibility** - the Roman Catholic claim that the Church provides final interpretive authority; Whitaker rejects this as a usurpation of Scripture's primacy.
- **Objective vs. subjective warrant** - Whitaker's distinction between Scripture's objective warrant (divine authorship) and subjective appropriation (Spirit's testimony).
- **Apologetic methods** - systematic reliance on both internal witness and external proofs for different audiences.
- **Canon and canonicity** - criteria and historical demonstration for why the received books are authoritative.
- **Reformed scholastic method** - use of disputational form, syllogistic argument, and technical categories to defend Reformation doctrine.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: clear, scholastically framed definitions of authority, certitude, and self‑attestation for doctrinal loci on revelation.
 - Polemic: model for arguing against ecclesial infallibility and in defense of sola scriptura in disputations and confessional controversies.
 - Exegetical model / conceptual pivot: supplies an epistemological framework linking Spirit testimony and external corroboration that is invoked in loci on revelation, Scripture, and apologetics.
