### TITLE
Christian Theology - Millard J. Erickson (focus: Anthropology chapters; with treatments of Inspiration and Inerrancy; Trichotomy vs Dichotomy)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical systematic theology; first ed. 1983, revised editions 1998 and 2013. Positioned within conservative-evangelical, broadly Reformed-influenced academic milieu responding to liberal theology, historical-critical pressures, and intra-evangelical debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To present a comprehensive, biblically grounded systematic theology accessible to seminarians; in anthropology the central questions are: What is human nature (composition, origin, destiny)? What is the Image of God (Imago Dei)? How does sin affect human nature? How should Scripture guide our answers?
- **Core argument / structure (anthropology chapters and related loci)**
 - Survey biblical data on human constitution (Hebrew/Greek terms), historical interpretations, and philosophical influences.
 - Analyze theories of human composition: dichotomy (body/soul) versus trichotomy (body/soul/spirit), assessing exegetical and philosophical merits.
 - Evaluate the Imago Dei (substantive, relational, functional models), arguing for a blended, biblically responsible account emphasizing rationality, relationality, and vocational function.
 - Treat origin of the soul (creationism vs traducianism), nature and universality of original sin, and soteriological consequences (regeneration, sanctification, final destiny).
 - Integrate doctrines of Scripture (inspiration and inerrancy) to ground theological claims exegetically and epistemically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: Origen, Augustine, Aquinas, Reformation teachers (Calvin), classical Protestant defenders (Warfield).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: evangelical scholars arguing for/against inerrancy and for trichotomy; historical-critical scholarship as foil for the doctrine of Scripture.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation / Inspiration / Inerrancy (grounds for theological method)
 - Anthropology (composition, Imago Dei, origin of the soul)
 - Hamartiology (original sin, corruption of the image)
 - Soteriology & Pneumatology (regeneration, indwelling Spirit)
 - Christology and eschatology insofar as they bear on human destiny and restoration.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Erickson's anthropology centers on a careful, Scripture-first evangelical orthodoxy: humans are created in God's image, corrupted by sin, restored in Christ - with doctrinal claims defended by disciplined exegesis and moderate philosophical awareness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Pedagogical clarity: systematically weighs biblical, historical, and philosophical evidence before reaching a balanced evangelical conclusion.
 - Integrative account of Imago Dei that resists reduction to solely substantive, relational, or functional models - argues for a composite picture.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects extreme Platonic/dualistic readings (overstated separation of soul and body) while also criticizing reductionist materialism.
 - Pushes back on both liberal skepticism about Scripture and absolutist forms of inerrancy that ignore hermeneutical nuance.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Careful operational distinctions: inspiration vs inerrancy vs infallibility; dichotomy vs trichotomy assessed as distinct exegetical paradigms rather than mere labels.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted as a standard evangelical textbook; respected for fair engagement of opposing views and usefulness in seminary classrooms across conservative Protestant institutions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a reliable, balanced introducion to anthropology for students and pastors; models how to connect biblical exegesis with systematic formulations while maintaining evangelical commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration** - Erickson defends divine authorship of Scripture, endorsing supernatural guidance of human authors without collapsing human agency.
- **Inerrancy** - Affirmed for the autographs; he distinguishes scope (original manuscripts) and nuance (genre and intent matter).
- **Verbal-plenary** - Aspects of Scripture are verbally inspired and plenarily authoritative; Erickson prefers careful qualification rather than sloganistic appeals.
- **Dichotomy** - Erickson favors the two-part view (body + immaterial life principle), arguing biblical data and theological economy support it.
- **Trichotomy** - Treated sympathetically as historically significant; Erickson critiques it on exegetical grounds and on the absence of decisive biblical partitioning of soul vs spirit.
- **Imago Dei (substantive / relational / functional)** - Erickson synthesizes elements: human rationality and moral capacity (substantive), relationality to God and others, and vocational/representative function before God.
- **Creationism (soul origin)** - The soul as directly created by God at birth; Erickson weighs evidence against traducianism but discusses both.
- **Traducianism** - Soul derived via procreation; engaged as a historically prominent alternative with theological consequences for original sin.
- **Original sin / corruption of the image** - Image of God is marred not destroyed; anthropology is tightly linked to hamartiology.
- **Body-soul-spirit vocabulary (Hebrew/Greek terms)** - Erickson emphasizes careful lexical and contextual study rather than imposing philosophical categories.
- **Regeneration / indwelling Spirit** - Links anthropology to soteriology: human nature is renewed, not annihilated, in salvation.
- **Hermeneutical priority of Scripture** - Undergirds his methodological approach to both inspiration/inerrancy and anthropological questions.
- **Historical theology** - Uses patristic, medieval, and Reformation precedent to test contemporary claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a standard definition source and pedagogical overview for doctrines of Scripture (inspiration/inerrancy) and anthropology (dichotomy argument).
 - As a polemical but balanced resource in debates over trichotomy vs dichotomy and over the scope/meaning of inerrancy; frequently cited in classrooms and introductory bibliographies.
