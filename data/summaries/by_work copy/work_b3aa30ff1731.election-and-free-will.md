### TITLE
Election and Free Will - Robert A. Peterson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical conversation (late 20th/early 21st century). Written within a milieu reacting to renewed interest in Molinism, libertarian Arminianism, and revival of classical Augustinian-Calvinist treatments of sovereignty and human agency.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend a classical Reformed/compatibilist account in which **God's unconditional election and absolute sovereignty are compatible with real human freedom and moral responsibility**, rejecting libertarian free will and the theological adequacy of middle-knowledge (Molinist) accounts.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Clarifies different senses of "free will" and argues for a robust compatibilist definition: freedom as voluntary, non-coerced choice determined by one's character and desires, not contra-causal indeterminism.
 - Exegetical engagement with key Pauline and Johannine texts (e.g., Romans, Ephesians, John) to show biblical precedence for predestination and divine initiative in salvation.
 - Philosophical critique of libertarian freedom: shows that contra-causal freedom is either incoherent or incompatible with biblical anthropology (total depravity) and divine foreknowledge.
 - Critique of Molinism: argues that middle knowledge undermines divine sovereignty, logically privileges creaturely counterfactuals over divine decree, and fails to solve the problem of evil or divine providence without cost.
 - Pastoral and doctrinal ramifications: discusses assurance, prayer, evangelism, and theodicy under a compatibilist-Reformed framework.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, Westminster standards; contemporary interlocutors include Molinists (Molina, Plantinga, Craig), Arminians, and popular libertarian advocates. Uses Scripture as primary theological locus with philosophical theology supplements.
- **Doctrines treated:** Election, predestination, providence, human will and moral responsibility, sin (depravity), grace (prevenient/irresistible), reprobation, soteriology, and aspects of theodicy.
- **Closing line:** The work centers on the conviction that **God is utterly free and sovereign in election while human choices remain genuinely responsible**, and that biblical fidelity and theological coherence point decisively to a compatibilist, Reformed resolution of the election/free-will tension.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm articulation of a *biblically-rooted compatibilism* that prioritizes theological concerns (sovereignty, grace) over philosophical intuitions about libertarian freedom.
 - Stresses pastoral consequences of election (assurance, prayer, mission) rather than leaving the topic at abstract metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects libertarian Arminian appeals to moral fairness by emphasizing depravity and the necessity of sovereign grace for any saving response.
 - Challenges Molinist reliance on counterfactuals of creaturely freedom as epistemically and theologically prior to divine decree.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies distinctions among kinds of freedom (e.g., freedom as non-coercion vs. libertarian contra-causality) and insists on terminological rigor to prevent equivocation in debates.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, accessible defense of compatibilism; used by pastors and seminary instructors to teach election and human agency.
 - Functions as a go-to corrective in dialogs with Molinists and Arminians; less influential among proponents of libertarian freedom or those convinced by Molinist philosophical literature.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models careful interplay of exegetical work and analytic philosophy while keeping pastoral concerns in view.
 - Serves as a concise, teachable statement of classical Reformed convictions on a contested contemporary topic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Election:** God's sovereign, gracious choice to save some; unconditional in motive and effect.
- **Free will (compatibilist):** Human freedom conceived as voluntary, non-coerced action that nevertheless is determined by desires/character.
- **Libertarian free will:** Contra-causal freedom that Peterson rejects as philosophically problematic and theologically unnecessary.
- **Molinism / middle knowledge:** The view that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom prior to decree; critiqued as theologically and logically deficient.
- **Foreknowledge:** Understood as God's comprehensive knowledge that is ordered to and expressive of his sovereign will, not merely foresight of free choices.
- **Predestination / reprobation:** Doctrines affirmed and distinguished; reprobation treated as the counterpart to election in biblical data and sober theological reflection.
- **Prevenient vs. irresistible grace:** Contrasts discussed-prevenient grace emphasized by Arminians; Peterson upholds sovereign (effectual/irresistible) grace consistent with Reformed soteriology.
- **Compatibilism:** Key philosophical-theological stance defended; central pivot for reconciling divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
- **Total depravity / human inability:** Anthropological claim used to ground the necessity of sovereign election and grace.
- **Theodicy and providence:** Treats problem of evil in light of divine decree and human responsibility.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom:** Technical Molinist term that Peterson evaluates and disputes.
- **Assurance and pastoral implications:** Emphasizes that election fosters assurance and motivates evangelistic zeal, not passivity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed compatibilist usages of "free will" and "election."
 - As a **polemic** against Molinism and libertarian Arminianism in academic and pastoral settings.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans, Ephesians, and John on sovereignty/responsibility.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on soteriology, providence, and philosophical theology.
