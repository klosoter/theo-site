### TITLE
**Hearer of the Word** (Karl Rahner) - Prolegomenon to revelation, grace, and the human as the site of God's address

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Lectures (Innsbruck, late 1930s) published as Horer des Wortes (1941); English translation later.
 - Pre-Vatican II Catholic milieu; programmatic for transcendental Thomism and later Catholic fundamental theology.
 - Responds to Neo-scholastic extrinsicism, engages modern philosophy (Kant, Heidegger), and converses with dialectical theology (Barth).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How can finite human beings be capable of receiving God's self-revelation? Rahner argues that the human subject is transcendently open to the **Absolute Mystery** and thus constituted as a **hearer of the Word**; revelation is possible and fitting, though always free and historical.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Phenomenology of finite spirit**: Human knowing and freedom transcend categorial objects toward an unthematizable horizon.
 - **Vorgriff (preapprehension)**: A built-in dynamism toward unlimited intelligibility and goodness implies orientation to the Absolute.
 - **Absolute Mystery**: God encountered as the silent horizon of all knowing and willing; never a grasped object.
 - **Possibility of revelation**: If God freely self-communicates, the human is already structured to receive a historical **word-event**.
 - **Grace and history**: Grace is not an external add-on but an existential orientation (supernatural existential) fulfilled in concrete history.
 - **Christic and ecclesial focus**: The definitive Word occurs in Jesus Christ and is normatively mediated by Scripture and Church proclamation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **Aquinas** (analogy, desire for God), **Maréchal** (transcendental Thomism), **Kant** (limits and conditions of knowledge), **Heidegger** (finitude, historicity), dialogue with **Barth** (revelation and the Word).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (Bibliology), **Theology Proper** (God as Mystery; analogical knowledge), **Anthropology/Creation** (spirit-in-the-world, freedom), **Grace/Soteriology** (supernatural existential), **Christology** (definitive Word), **Ecclesiology** (mediation).
- **Closing line**
 - Theology begins in God's free self-communication to a creature already graced to listen: the human is the being who can and must hear God's Word in history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The human as **hearer** rather than seer: revelation as **address** that summons response.
 - **Absolute Mystery** as horizon; knowledge of God is real yet non-objectifying.
 - **Supernatural existential**: grace as constitutive orientation, not episodic addition.
 - **Word-event**: revelation is personal, performative, and historical, not mere propositions.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Neo-scholastic **extrinsicism** (nature and grace as separable layers).
 - Nuanced alternative to **Barth**: affirms philosophical prolegomena to the possibility/fittingness of revelation without collapsing into natural theology.
 - Moves beyond **Kantian** strictures by showing transcendental openness without denying finitude.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Vorgriff**, **Absolute Mystery**, **supernatural existential**, **categorical vs transcendental** revelation, **word-event**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Catholic **fundamental theology**; informs Vatican II's atmosphere (esp. Dei Verbum on revelation as self-communication).
 - Engaged and critiqued by Barthians and analytic theologians; appropriated ecumenically for accounts of revelation-as-address.
 - In Reformed discussions, mined for anthropology of receptivity and for a non-reductive account of the Word as covenantal address (with cautions re natural theology and grace-nature schema).
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined bridge from philosophy to theology; a grammar for hearing Scripture as divine address; a robust account of human openness, freedom, and historicity under grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hearer of the Word**: The human as constituted to receive God's self-communication in history.
- **Transcendental Thomism**: Thomistic metaphysics read through transcendental method (conditions of possibility of knowing/willing).
- **Vorgriff (preapprehension)**: The intellect's unrestricted dynamism toward being/truth/goodness; anticipatory openness to God.
- **Absolute Mystery**: God as non-objectifiable horizon of finite knowing and loving; real yet never contained.
- **Self-communication of God**: Revelation/grace as God giving Godself, not merely information or effects.
- **Supernatural existential**: A grace-given, always-already orientation of the person to God; contrasts with mere obediential potency.
 - Distinguish: obediential potency (capacity-in-principle) vs existential (actual orientation).
- **Word-event (Wortgeschehen)**: Revelation as performative act in history that elicits faith and obedience.
- **Categorical vs transcendental revelation**:
 - **Transcendental**: God as horizon encountered in all knowing/willing.
 - **Categorical**: Concrete historical words/events (Scripture, Christ, Church).
- **Freedom and history**: Personal response occurs in time; revelation respects and perfects creaturely freedom.
- **Analogy of being**: Real yet asymmetrical likeness between God and creatures; guards against univocity/equivocity.
- **Fundamental option**: The person's basic disposition toward or away from God, enacted in concrete choices.
- **Anonymous Christianity** (later Rahnerian theme): Salvation orientedness beyond explicit confession; not central here, but related to the supernatural existential.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Bibliology**: Conceptual basis for Scripture as divine address and for revelation as word-event.
 - **Theology Proper**: Non-objectifying talk of God as Absolute Mystery; analogical predication.
 - **Anthropology/Creation and Soteriology**: Human openness and freedom under grace; supernatural existential as orientation to salvation.
 - **Christology and Covenant Theology**: Frames Christ as the definitive Word who fulfills creaturely openness; supports covenantal hearing-as-response without collapsing into mere rationalism.
