### TITLE
God With Us: Divine Condescension and the Attributes of God - K. Scott Oliphint

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed, analytic and confessional milieu (late 20th-21st c. Reformed scholastic revival). Written for pastors, seminarians, and systematic theologians seeking to integrate classic doctrine of God with a hermeneutic of divine condescension.
- **Central thesis**
 - Divine **condescension** (God's voluntary self-limitation and accommodation in relation to creatures) is the hermeneutical key for interpreting and cohering the divine attributes without sacrificing classical incommunicables (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Sets out the problem: many contemporary accounts treat divine transcendence and immanence as oppositional, producing either depersonalized transcendence or an impoverished immanence.
 - Articulates a Reformed framework that reads attributes through **condescension**:
 - explication of incommunicable attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) and their theological function;
 - showing how these attributes ground, rather than preclude, the possibility of genuine divine relation and accommodation;
 - application to revelation and the incarnation as paradigmatic acts of condescension.
 - Concludes with constructive proposals for theological method: analogical knowledge of God anchored in revelation (see discussion of **Analogia Entis vs Analogia Fidei**).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts with classical authorities (Augustine, Aquinas), Reformation sources (Calvin), 20th-century traditions (Barth), and contemporary analytic/Reformed theologians.
 - Dialogues with Van Tilian and other presuppositional emphases on divine sovereignty and epistemology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (accommodation), attributes of God (communicable/incommunicable), Trinity, Christology (incarnation as supreme condescension), creation and the creature/Creator distinction.
 - Specific attention to coherence between God's absolute being and God's relational action in history.
- **Closing line**
 - The book argues that to know God truly is to hold together his absolute otherness and his voluntary, revelatory nearness: divine condescension secures both transcendence and saving communion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places **condescension** at the center of attribute-theology rather than treating it as merely one attribute among others.
 - Moves beyond a defensive reconciliation to positive doctrine: condescension is constitutive of how God communicates and saves.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Critiques tendencies that blur Creator/creature distinction under the guise of relational theology.
 - Opposes accounts that derive knowledge of God from metaphysical analogy apart from revelation (critical of the unguarded use of **analogia entis**; favors **analogia fidei** grounded in divine self-disclosure).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Uses condescension as a methodological lens for ordering attributes: not merely descriptive of specific acts but hermeneutical for systematic theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Reformed academic and pastoral circles for providing a robust corrective to both liberal immanence and sterile apophaticism.
 - Cited in recent work on divine simplicity and Trinitarian relationality; utilized increasingly in seminary curricula on doctrine of God.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a teachable synthesis that preserves classic incommunicable attributes while supplying a biblically grounded account of God's personal involvement with creation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine condescension**
 - Voluntary self-limitation and accommodation by which God communicates with finite creatures; methodological principle for reading attributes.
- **Analogia fidei**
 - Knowledge of God shaped and disciplined by redemptive revelation; Oliphint favors this over speculative ontological analogy.
- **Analogia entis**
 - The metaphysical analogy of being; critiqued where it functions apart from revelation and threatens to naturalize God.
 - See the book's sustained contrast: Analogia Entis vs Analogia Fidei (treatment of how we know God).
- **Simplicity**
 - God is metaphysically uncompounded; attribute talk is truly about one divine essence. Oliphint insists simplicity does not preclude relational acts.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; grounds divine sovereignty and the possibility of gracious condescension.
- **Immutability**
 - God's unchangeableness in being and purpose; read relationally so that immutability secures faithfulness rather than barring personal response.
- **Impassibility**
 - God does not suffer as creatures do; Oliphint defends impassibility while allowing for genuine relational engagement (incarnation as real divine condescension without ontological suffering of God's essence).
- **Communicable vs incommunicable attributes**
 - Clarifies their interrelation in the economy of condescension: communicable attributes reflect God's condescension in creaturely ways, without compromising incommunicables.
- **Accommodation**
 - God's adapting of revelation to creaturely capacity; pivotal for scriptural epistemology and Christology.
- **Incarnation**
 - Prime example of divine condescension: the Word's taking of human nature is the decisive paradigm for understanding other divine self-limiting acts.
- **Creator/creature distinction**
 - Preserved insistently as normative boundary for theological reasoning.
- **Analogy and revelation**
 - Oliphint frames analogical predication as legitimately possible but always under the governance of revealed truth.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source and pedagogical synthesis for the doctrine of God, especially when teaching simplicity and relationality together.
 - As a polemic resource against analogia entis-informed natural theology and against theological accounts that collapse divine immutability/impassibility into passibility.
 - As an exegetical-modeling aid for Christology and revelation: demonstrates how the incarnation functions as the paradigmatic case of divine condescension.
