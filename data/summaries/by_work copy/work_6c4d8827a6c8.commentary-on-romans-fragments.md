### TITLE
Commentary on Romans (fragments) - Pelagius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 5th century (c. 400-420). Pelagius, a British ascetic and teacher active in Rome and later in Palestine, wrote exegetical and moral commentaries amid controversies over sin and grace. Only fragments of his Romans commentary survive directly or via anti-Pelagian refutation (notably Augustine and later councils). The piece functions within the broader Pelagian controversy that culminated in condemnations by African synods and imperial councils (418-431).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's teaching in Romans - especially Romans 5 and the doctrine of Adam - must not be read as teaching inherited guilt or depravity. Adam provides a bad example and the occasion of death, not a juridical transfer of guilt. Human beings are born morally neutral and possess real capacity to obey God; sin is the result of individual choice, not transmitted guilt.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Close, literal exegesis of Pauline texts (Romans 1-5 passages received particular emphasis).
 - Distinguishes between bodily consequences (death) and moral culpability: physical mortality can be a consequence without moral imputation.
 - Argues that Pauline language about Adam as "type" (Rom. 5) indicates pattern and representation in action, not forensic imputation of Adam's guilt to descendants.
 - Reframes "original sin" as propensity or inclination (concupiscence as inclination) rather than inherited guilt; grace assists the will rather than overriding or imposing it.
 - Maintains human responsibility and the possibility of living sinless lives by grace-assisted upright will.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary), other scriptural witnesses; major interlocutors include Augustine (principal antagonist), Jerome and Latin African bishops (as critics), and the broader Roman and British ascetic milieu. Pelagius appeals to moral examples (scriptural saints) and to natural reason.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sin, imputation, grace (nature and role), free will, death and mortality, justification and righteousness, infant status, Christian ethics and moral responsibility.
- **Closing line:** The fragments press a Pauline reading that defends human moral agency and rejects a forensic transfer of Adamic guilt - sin rooted in individual willing, grace as enabling obedience, not juridical absolution of inherited guilt.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the goodness of created human nature; sin as voluntary departure rather than ontological corruption.
 - Emphasis on moral pedagogy: Scripture instructs conscience and will, not primarily teaching metaphysical heredity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit correction of Augustinian formulations: rejects imputation of Adam's guilt and the notion of total depravity or inherited culpability.
 - Challenges readings that make infant baptism a remedy for juridical guilt; baptizing infants is pastoral but not because they bear Adam's guilt.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reorients "original sin" language toward "original condition" and inclination rather than forensic transmission.
 - Develops a sharper distinction between physical consequences (death) and moral responsibility (guilt) in Pauline interpretation.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Largely rejected and condemned by orthodox councils and by Augustine; labeled "Pelagian" and used as the classic foil to Augustinian and later Reformed doctrines of total depravity and imputed guilt.
 - Despite condemnation, Pelagius' emphases on moral responsibility and the role of human will influenced later debates on free will, semi-Pelagianism, and pastoral discussions of culpability.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear, historically important alternative reading of Romans that sharpens questions about hermeneutics, anthropology, and the relation of grace to human agency.
 - Serves as a diagnostic foil: testing exegetical claims about imputation and the locus of sin; useful for tracing doctrinal development and pastoral implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original Sin:** For Pelagius, primarily an inherited condition of mortality and inclination, not inherited guilt before God.
- **Imputation:** Denied in the forensic sense; Adam's sin is not counted as the moral guilt of descendants.
 - Contrast: Augustine reads imputation as forensic and ontological; Pelagius reads Adam as exemplar/occasion.
- **Adam as "Type" (figura):** Interpreted as representative in action (pattern) rather than bearer of transferable guilt.
- **Concupiscence (concupiscentia):** Seen as a disordering inclination or tendency, not guilt in itself; morally significant only when willed.
- **Free Will (liberum arbitrium):** Central and real; human will can cooperate with grace and is capable of obedience.
- **Grace (gratia, auxilium):** Helpful, enabling, instructional - assists the will, restrains and enlightens, but does not irresistibly effect conversion.
- **Death (mors):** Physical mortality as consequence of Adam's sin, separable from moral imputation.
- **Justification:** Concerned with moral standing through right conduct assisted by grace rather than forensic absolution of inherited guilt.
- **Infant status / baptism:** Infants require Christian care and baptismal incorporation, but are not guilty by Adam's sin; baptism mediates grace, not remission of imputed guilt.
- **Merit / Desert:** Human acts can bear moral value; grace elevates and assists meritorious striving rather than nullifying human responsibility.
- **Nature (natura):** Fundamentally good and capable of uprightness despite inclination; not radically corrupted.
- **Pelagianism (label):** The later technical label for Pelagius' position; used polemically by opponents.
- **Moral exemplarism:** Scriptural examples as formative models rather than demonstrations of inherited depravity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic**: primary source for reconstructing Pelagian arguments against imputation in patristic controversies.
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar of literal/socio-moral reading of Romans emphasizing human agency.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: reference point in debates on original sin, prevenient versus assisting grace, and the balance of divine aid and human responsibility.
