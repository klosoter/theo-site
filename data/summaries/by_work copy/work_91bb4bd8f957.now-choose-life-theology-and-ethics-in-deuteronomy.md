### TITLE
Now Choose Life: Theology and Ethics in Deuteronomy - J. Gary Millar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Situated in contemporary evangelical/Reformed Old Testament scholarship that seeks to bridge careful exegesis and constructive theology.
 - Engages canonical readings of Deuteronomy against the background of Deuteronomistic history, modern critical scholarship, and pastoral concerns about law and ethics.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Deuteronomy portrays law as the covenantal grammar that enables Israel to "choose life"** - a theologically saturated ethic grounded in Yahweh's revelation, gracious election, and covenant faithfulness rather than autonomous moralism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduction: Genre, structure, and theological aims of Deuteronomy; methodological commitment to theological exegesis.
 - Covenant framework: Deuteronomy frames ethical demands within covenant stipulations, narrative memory, and communal identity formation.
 - Law as formative instruction: Toratic material functions to shape communal practices, dispositions, and institutions (worship, kingship, justice).
 - Social and ritual ethics: Detailed treatment of obligations to the vulnerable, economic laws, ritual centralization, and holiness as public vocation.
 - Judgment and hope: Blessings/curses and the prophetic call to covenant renewal; ethical exhortation emerges from divine promises and warnings.
 - Theological application: Implications for contemporary Christian ethics - vocation of obedience, social justice, ecclesial formation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with canonical and critical commentators on Deuteronomy and Deuteronomistic history.
 - Interacts with broader theological interpreters (those emphasizing covenant theology, prophetic critique, and biblical moral theory).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (role of law), covenant (structure and stipulations), divine election and grace, holiness and sanctification, communal righteousness (justice), kingship and prophetic authority, land theology, worship.

- **Closing line**
 - Deuteronomy calls Israel - and by extension the people of God - to **choose life**: a covenantally rooted, theologically informed way of living that makes obedience the medium of flourishing under Yahweh's gracious lordship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Deuteronomy not as mere legal code but as **theological pedagogy**: law forms identity and habitus for sustained covenantal life.
 - Stresses the primacy of **covenantal choice** - moral agency embedded in historical memory and divine promise rather than abstract duty.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters readings that bifurcate law and gospel by showing law's role within covenantal grace.
 - Challenges purely sociological or Hellenistic moral reconstructions by insisting on theological categories (blessing/curse, election).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts common categories (e.g., "holiness," "justice," "worship") as **relational and formative practices** within covenant life rather than isolated moral virtues.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a model for integrating exegesis with ethical theology.
 - Influential for pastors and ethicists wanting a biblically rooted, covenant-shaped ethic that avoids both antinomianism and legalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for reading legal material theologically; valuable for homiletics, pastoral ethics, and curriculum on biblical social ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant**
 - The organizing frame: law as stipulation within a relational vow that defines identity and obligations.

- **Choose life**
 - Central exhortation: moral decision grounded in remembering God's acts and promise.

- **Torah (law)**
 - Formative instruction and covenantal praxis, not merely penal code.

- **Blessing and curse**
 - Eschatological categories that motivate obedience and communal fidelity.

- **Holiness**
 - Corporate vocation shaping worship, social relations, and separation from idolatry.

- **Justice (sedeq, mishpat)**
 - Social ordering for the vulnerable; legal provisions aimed at communal righteousness.

- **Land**
 - Theological locus of promise and responsibility; ethical obligations are land-oriented (sabbatical, inheritance, ecology).

- **Kingship / leadership**
 - Constrained and critiqued by Deuteronomy's laws; leadership accountable to covenant law.

- **Worship / centralization**
 - Liturgical fidelity as formative for ethics; central sanctuary as nexus of identity and obedience.

- **Prophecy / covenant renewal**
 - Mechanism for reorienting communal life when covenant faithlessness threatens exile.

- **Hospitality / protection of the vulnerable**
 - Recurrent ethic: foreigners, widows, orphans, and aliens as indices of covenant faithfulness.

- **Blessing as grace**
 - Emphasizes divine initiative; obedience as response, not means to earn election.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for covenantal ethics - clarifies what it means to read law theologically.
- As an **exegetical model** for treating legal material as narrative-theological pedagogy.
- As a **pastoral/homiletic resource** - grounds sermons and teaching on social justice and discipleship in Deuteronomic theology.
- As a **polemic** against both antinomian readings and mechanical legalism, serving as a conceptual pivot in contemporary Reformed ethics.
