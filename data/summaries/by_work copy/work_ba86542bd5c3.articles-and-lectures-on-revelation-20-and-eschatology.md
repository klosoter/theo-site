### TITLE
Articles and lectures on Revelation 20 and eschatology - Kim Riddlebarger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical context (late 20th-early 21st century); material often distilled from conferences, seminary lectures, and popular-level articles leading toward his book A Case for Amillennialism. Written against the backdrop of resurging dispensational premillennialism in North American evangelicalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Revelation 20 should be read amillennially: the "thousand years" is symbolic; Satan's binding was effected by Christ's victory; the "first resurrection" and the reign with Christ are not a future earthly golden age but realities tied to Christ's present exaltation and the church's present/heavenly reign.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Genre and hermeneutics: start from Revelation as apocalyptic, highly symbolic literature; caution against overly literalist readings that ignore Old Testament typology and numbers as symbolic.
 - Interpret the "binding of Satan" (20:1-3) as a present, partial restraint beginning with Christ's victory (cross and resurrection/ascension) that permits the spread of the gospel.
 - Read the "thousand years" as symbolic of a complete, limited period (not a precise chronology) coinciding with the church age.
 - Understand the "first resurrection" as the spiritual rising of believers (and/or the martyrs' vindication) and the reigning as a present, heavenly reality, with the final bodily resurrection and final judgment occurring at Christ's single, climactic return.
 - Argue against a two-stage return (staged parousia) and against a future earthly millennium; critique dispensational literalism for dividing the people and promises of God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to Augustine and classical amillennial tradition, the Reformers and Reformed commentators, and engages modern dispensationalists (Scofield/Walvoord line) and historic premillennialists. Uses Old Testament intertextual readings (Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel) and compares patristic and medieval readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennium, resurrection, second coming, final judgment)
 - Christology (victory, exaltation, present reign)
 - Satanology (binding, deception)
 - Ecclesiology (reign with Christ, nature of the church age)
 - Biblical hermeneutics (genre-sensitive interpretation)
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: Revelation 20 portrays Christ's decisive victory inaugurated in the present age-vindicating a symbolic millennium and a single, climactic parousia rather than a future earthly thousand-year reign.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of canonical and historical-theological argument: the amillennial reading is defended both exegetically (genre, intertextuality) and historically (patristic and Reformation witnesses).
 - Pastoral-scholarly tone that aims to correct popular sensational eschatologies while maintaining hopefulness about the church's present participation in Christ's reign.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit critique of dispensational literalism: rejects sharp Israel/Church divides and postponed fulfillment schemes that require a two-step parousia.
 - Challenges literal chronological sequencing in Revelation, arguing that Revelation 20 functions thematically and theologically rather than as strict sequential history.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Habitual use of "binding" as a restrictive not annihilating act; frames the "first resurrection" in broader spiritual/resurrectional senses rather than only as future bodily event.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, popular defense of amillennialism; influential among pastors and students seeking an accessible counter to dispensationalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching: combines readable exposition, solid hermeneutical principles, and engagement with historical theology; useful as both introduction and compact polemic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Millennium (the thousand years)** - Read as symbolic of a complete era (the church age) rather than a literal future 1,000-year earthly reign.
- **Amillennialism** - The thesis adopted: no future earthly millennium; Christ reigns now; final resurrection at one future return.
- **Premillennialism (dispensational vs historic)** - Contrasted positions; Riddlebarger primarily argues against dispensational literalism and staged parousia.
- **Binding of Satan** - Interpreted as inaugurated at Christ's victory (cross/ascension), a restraint permitting gospel advance.
- **First resurrection** - Understood pastorally/spiritually (believers' participation in Christ's victory; martyrs' vindication) rather than strictly a delayed physical resurrection.
- **Parousia / Second Coming** - Single, climactic return that coincides with final bodily resurrection and judgment.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / already-not-yet** - Central hermeneutical lens: some kingdom realities are present now, consummation awaits Christ's return.
- **Apocalyptic genre / symbolism** - Emphasizes non-literal, typological reading of numbers and images; intertextual with Daniel and Ezekiel.
- **Resurrection(s) and judgment** - Distinguishes present spiritual realities from future bodily consummation; rejects cleaving of multiple comings for different peoples.
- **Reign with Christ** - Regarded as a present, primarily heavenly participation for saints (not an earthly political dominion).
- **Satanology / deception** - The "binding" mitigates Satanic deception but does not end all evil; explains gospel spread amid opposition.
- **Hermeneutics: literal vs. figurative** - Advocates genre-sensitive literalism (plain sense within apocalyptic symbolism).
- **Chronology / telescoping** - Reads Revelation's sequences as theological telescoping rather than strict chronology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary amillennial exegesis of Revelation 20.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational premillennialism and staged-parousia schemes.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating genre-aware reading of apocalyptic literature and canonical intertextuality.
