### TITLE
Jews and Christians - Parting Ways in the First Two Centuries CE? (eds. Jens Schröter, Benjamin A. Edsall)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Interdisciplinary volume addressing the historiography of early Judaism and Christianity; focuses on first two centuries CE and asks whether, when, and how Jewish and Christian identities separated.
 - Responds to longstanding debates sparked by social-scientific and literary studies (e.g., "parting of the ways", sectarian models, Pauline Judaism debates).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The book reframes the question from a single decisive rupture to a plural, regionally variegated, and gradual set of processes that produced distinctive Jewish and Christian identities; it problematizes teleological narratives that locate a clean split in a single event or decade.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Multi-author contributions marshal literary, epigraphic, legal, and archaeological evidence to map possible trajectories toward separation.
 - Case studies examine particular locales (e.g., Palestine, Asia Minor, the Diaspora) and genres (Pauline letters, Gospels, Apologists, rabbinic miscellanea).
 - Analytical moves emphasize boundary-making practices: ritual, law, narrative, liturgy, and polemics.
 - The volume contrasts competing models: early, sharp separation vs. late, gradual divergence vs. mosaic, multi-path separation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Paul, Gospel traditions, Acts, Didache, Apostolic Fathers, Justin Martyr; Josephus; early rabbinic materials; inscriptions and ossuaries.
 - Secondary interlocutors: E.P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, Daniel Boyarin, Paula Fredriksen, other scholars in the "parting of the ways" debate.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant** and covenantal continuity/discontinuity (how Christology reframes or reinterprets Jewish covenantal claims).
 - **Christology** (high/low, communal christological identity as boundary marker).
 - **Law / Torah observance** (ritual practice as social boundary).
 - **Revelation and authority** (scripture, oral tradition, apostolic and rabbinic authority).
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center: identity formation between Jews and Christians was contested, multi-causal, and mediated by doctrinal claims (Christology, covenant) together with social practices (ritual, law, liturgy); there is no single point of severance but a constellation of boundary-making moves.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological pluralism: combines textual exegesis with social-scientific models and material culture to avoid mono-causal explanations.
 - Focus on boundary practices (ritual, narrative, legal exegesis) rather than merely institutional or chronological markers.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges simplistic "70 CE rupture" or single-event separation narratives.
 - Moderates the polemic of scholars who either posit total continuity (minimal difference models) or abrupt severance (maximal separation models).
 - Troubles readings that treat Paul as uniformly anti-Jewish by foregrounding internal Jewish diversity and intra-Jewish contestation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of "multi-path" or "constellation" metaphors for separation processes.
 - Adoption of sociological boundary theory to theological identity questions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in academic debates as a corrective to teleological histories; used in graduate seminars on origins of Christianity and rabbinic Judaism.
 - Influential for scholars seeking an integrative approach that respects both textual nuance and social context.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced, historiographically aware model for teaching the origins question; durable resource for pastors and theologians wrestling with continuity/discontinuity in covenantal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parting of the ways** - shorthand for scholarly debate over when/if Judaism and Christianity became distinct religions; here treated as a complex, non-uniform process.
- **Boundary markers** - practices/claims (ritual, law, language, memory) that function to include or exclude groups.
- **Multi-path separation** - model proposing several, overlapping routes to distinct identities rather than a single rupture.
- **Covenant continuity/discontinuity** - debate whether the Christian reinterpretation of covenant preserved, superseded, or transformed Jewish covenantal claims.
- **Christology as boundary** - degrees and public expression of belief in Jesus as messiah/Divine are treated as identity-shaping.
- **Torah observance / halakhic practice** - ritual and legal behavior as primary sites where social boundaries were negotiated.
- **Intra-Jewish sectarianism** - early diversity within Judaism (Pharisees, Sadducees, followers of Jesus) complicates neat Jewish/Christian binaries.
- **Diaspora dynamics** - migration, synagogal life, and inscriptions show varied local interfaces between Jews and emerging Christian groups.
- **Polemics and apologetics** - literary strategies (e.g., Justin) that articulate separateness; studied as both theological and social moves.
- **Material culture** - archaeological and epigraphic evidence used to test and refine literary claims.
- **Social-scientific boundary theory** - applied analytical tool to explain how identities form via inclusion/exclusion.
- **Canonical formation** - how selective scriptural canons contributed to group self-definition.
- **Martyrdom and memory** - how stories of suffering shaped communal identity and boundary rhetoric.
- **Legal exegesis (pesher, midrashic hermeneutics)** - interpretive methods that functioned to claim authority and distinguish communities.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional resource** for graduate courses on Jewish-Christian relations and the origins debate.
 - As a **polemic tool** in theological discussions over continuity/discontinuity (e.g., covenant theology), offering a cautious middle path.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating integrated use of texts and material culture to study identity formation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for moving conversations from chronology to mechanisms of boundary-making.
