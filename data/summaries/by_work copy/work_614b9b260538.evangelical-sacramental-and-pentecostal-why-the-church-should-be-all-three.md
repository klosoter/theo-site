### TITLE
Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal: Why the Church Should Be All Three - Gordon T. Smith (IVP Academic, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the early 21st century amid renewed ecumenical interest and growing cross-pollination between evangelical, liturgical/sacramental, and charismatic/Pentecostal streams.
 - Author Gordon T. Smith: evangelical pastor-theologian and spiritual formation scholar, addressing pastors, seminarians, and thoughtful laity seeking integrative ecclesiology.
- **Central thesis**
 - The healthy church must embrace a threefold identity - **evangelical** (proclamation and conversion), **sacramental** (incarnational means of grace), and **Pentecostal** (Spirit-empowered life and gifts). These are mutually corrective and organically related, not competing options.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary Christianity suffers from reductionisms - some communities emphasize only proclamation, others only sacrament, others only Spirit-experience - producing ecclesial imbalance.
 - Theological grounding: roots the threefold claim in the **Trinity** and the economy of redemption - Word, Sacrament, and Spirit are distinct yet unified acts of God.
 - Historical/theological resources: draws selectively from patristic, medieval, Reformation, and Pentecostal witnesses to show precedents for integration.
 - Practical outworking: argues for renewed worship, disciplined spiritual formation, sacramental practice (baptism, Lord's Supper), and openness to charismatic gifts in accountable forms.
 - Pastoral emphasis: integration serves mission and discipleship - formation of mature Christians who are converted, formed by grace, and empowered for ministry.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broad traditions rather than a single opponent: evangelicalism (conversion theology), liturgical/sacramental tradition (ancients, Reformers), and Pentecostal-charismatic movement.
 - Appeals to Scripture, classic theology (e.g., incarnational motifs), contemporary pneumatology, and spiritual-formation literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology**, **pneumatology**, **sacramentology**, **soteriology**, **worship theory**, and **spiritual formation**; also implications for mission and pastoral practice.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The church incarnates the triune God through proclamation, sacrament, and Spirit; refusing any of the three impoverishes Christian life and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presents a clear, pastoral framework for **simultaneously** holding evangelical, sacramental, and Pentecostal convictions - not a syncretistic bricolage but a cohesive ecclesial identity.
 - Strongly formation-oriented: sacraments and Spirit are framed as formative means of grace that shape discipleship, not merely theological categories.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both Protestant minimalists who reduce Christianity to conversion and proclamation, and sacramental maximalists who underplay Spirit-led renewal.
 - Counters some Pentecostal tendencies toward anti-liturgical or anti-sacramental stances by affirming historic forms and disciplines.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Articulates a concise **triadic model** (Evangelical-Sacramental-Pentecostal) as a usable hermeneutic for evaluating churches and practices.
 - Reframes sacraments as dynamic, Spirit-enabled means of grace that work together with proclamation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Has found traction among pastors and seminaries seeking an integrated ecclesiology and practical liturgical renewal within evangelicalism.
 - Provoked critique from strict cessationists and high-church sacramentalists who see trade-offs in emphasis; generally well-received in ecumenical and charismatic-evangelical circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, pastorally oriented corrective to tribal ecclesial identities; valuable as a bridge text for formation courses, worship planning, and ecumenical conversation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evangelical**
 - Emphasis on gospel proclamation, conversion, biblical authority, and personal faith. In Smith: indispensable but incomplete alone.
- **Sacramental**
 - Focus on baptism and Lord's Supper as incarnational means of grace that form believers.
- **Pentecostal**
 - Emphasis on the Holy Spirit, gifts, renewal, and experiential empowerment for mission.
- **Triadic model**
 - Smith's shorthand for integrating the three identities into one coherent ecclesiology.
- **Means of grace**
 - Sacraments and spiritual disciplines seen as channels through which God forms believers.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Doctrine of the Spirit as the animating, empowering presence that unites Word and Sacrament.
- **Incarnation**
 - The motif grounding sacramental theology: God's Word becoming flesh as paradigm for embodied worship and means.
- **Formation / Spiritual formation**
 - Ongoing discipleship practices oriented by Word, Sacrament, and Spirit.
- **Worship (Word-Sacrament-Spirit)**
 - Liturgical praxis that integrates preaching, sacramental action, and openness to the Spirit.
- **Ecumenical integration**
 - The methodological posture of drawing resources across traditions for a healthier church life.
- **Accountability**
 - Practical principle for charismatic practice; gifts must be exercised within ordered, communal structures.
- **Conversion**
 - Evangelical starting point; personal turning as necessary but to be followed by formation and empowerment.
- **Mission**
 - Outcome of integrated identity - proclamation shaped by sacrament and empowered by Spirit for witness.
- **Grace**
 - Central theological category linking sacraments, the Spirit's activity, and evangelistic proclamation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for courses and church leaders articulating integrated ecclesial identity.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist or tribal ecclesiologies and as a practical **exegetical-model** for liturgy, formation, and pneumatological practice.
