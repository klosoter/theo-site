### TITLE
**The Idea of Systematic Theology** - B.B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th c., Old Princeton Theology; confessional Reformed orthodoxy engaging post-Kantian, liberal Protestant proposals (Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Harnack).
 - Part of Princeton prolegomena tradition (with C. Hodge, A.A. Hodge): theology as a scientific enterprise grounded in divine revelation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Systematic theology is the scientific construction of the knowledge of God and his relations to the world from the facts of divine revelation, principally Scripture. It is distinct from, yet coordinated with, the other theological disciplines.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines theology's object: **God** (principium essendi) and his works; its material: **revealed facts**; its norm: **Holy Scripture** (principium cognoscendi).
 - Distinguishes the theological encyclopedia:
 - **Exegetical/Biblical Theology**: ascertains the facts of revelation in their native form.
 - **Historical Theology**: traces the church's understanding and confessional development.
 - **Systematic/Dogmatics**: organizes revealed truth into a coherent whole.
 - **Practical Theology**: applies truth in ministry and piety.
 - Method: primarily **inductive** from Scripture's data to doctrines; secondarily **deductive** for coherence and entailments; reason is ministerial, not magisterial.
 - Guardrails: rejects subjectivist foundations (religious feeling, value-judgments) and speculative metaphysics as sources; philosophy serves as handmaid.
 - Scope and center: the whole counsel of God, theocentrically ordered, with Christ's mediatorial work as the organic heart of the system.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Calvin, Reformed scholastics (e.g., Turretin), Old Princeton (C. Hodge).
 - Critically: Schleiermacher (feeling), Ritschl (value-judgments), Harnack (essence-of-Christianity), Roman Catholic scholasticism where it subordinates Scripture to ecclesial authority.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, inerrancy as methodological presupposition).
 - Theology Proper (God's knowability, attributes, decree) as the organizing locus.
 - Trinity, Christology, covenantal structure, church and sacraments, and eschatology as coordinated loci within the system's unity.
- **Closing line**
 - The systematizing of revealed truth is a reverent act of obedience to God's self-disclosure, yielding a coherent, church-serving body of doctrine centered on the triune God and his redeeming purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as a true **science** with a definite object and method; Scripture as principium; reason as servant.
 - **Organic unity** of Scripture warrants doctrinal synthesis across canon and history.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Opposes **experience-centered** or **value-judgment** dogmatics (Schleiermacher/Ritschl); resists speculative metaphysics or ecclesial magisterium as norming sources.
 - Clarifies the division of labor: exegesis supplies data; dogmatics draws conclusions; church history records reception; practice applies.
- **Conceptual innovations / clarifications**
 - Crisp articulation of principia (essendi/cognoscendi) for dogmatics.
 - Methodological pairing of **induction** (from biblical facts) with **systemic coherence** (logical relations, loci).
 - Theocentric ordering that keeps Christology central without collapsing the system into a single motif.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical in Reformed seminaries for prolegomena; frames curricula and research method.
 - Widely engaged (and critiqued) by neo-orthodox and biblical-theology movements; foundational in evangelical defenses of inerrancy and theological method.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides stable vocabulary and architecture for cross-loci work (Trinity, covenant, church, sacraments, eschatology).
 - Equips pastors and scholars to integrate exegesis, confession, and coherent doctrinal formulation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Systematic Theology (Dogmatics)**: Ordered presentation of revealed truth concerning God and all things in relation to him.
- **Principium essendi**: God as the ontological ground and object of theology.
- **Principium cognoscendi (externum)**: Scripture as the normative source and rule of faith.
- **Revelation**: Divine self-disclosure; provides theology's facts; includes general and special, with Scripture supreme.
- **Inspiration / Inerrancy**: Grounds Scripture's authority and fitness as theological norm.
- **Inductive method**: Gathering biblical data before constructing doctrines; resists a priori speculation.
- **Loci communes**: Thematic groupings (Trinity, Christology, Ecclesiology, Eschatology, etc.) within the system.
- **Theological Encyclopedia**: Ordered relation of disciplines (exegetical, historical, systematic, practical).
- **Apologetics**: Handmaid that defends principia; distinguished from, yet supportive of, dogmatics.
- **Organizing principle (theocentrism)**: God's glory and redemptive purpose unify doctrine; Christ mediates this center.
- **Rule of faith**: Scriptural summary confessed by the church; ministerial norm under Scripture.
- **Organic unity of Scripture**: Canon coheres as one revelation; warrants cross-text synthesis.
- **Prolegomena**: Foundational questions of sources, method, and scope.
- **Ministerial reason**: Reason serves Scripture, seeking coherence without norming it.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition source for what counts as doctrine in Trinity, covenant, church, sacraments, and last things.
 - As methodological guardrails for constructing eschatology teleologically and ecclesiology sacramentally from Scripture.
 - As a polemical frame against experience-based or historicist reductions of doctrine.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking exegesis to coherent dogmatic formulation in teaching and preaching.
