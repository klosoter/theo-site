### TITLE
Politics after Christendom: Political Theology in a Fractured World - David VanDrunen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the post-2008 political and cultural moment marked by declining Western Christendom, rising pluralism, and renewed debates in Reformed circles over political engagement (published mid-2010s). Situated within contemporary Reformed/confessional theology and natural law conversation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians must develop a robust political theology appropriate to a non-Christendom context: one that resists both nostalgia for Christendom and utopian theocratic projects while still grounding legitimate political engagement in biblical doctrine (not secular voluntarism).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Christendom is gone; the public moral consensus that once sustained Christian law and culture no longer holds.
 - Theological resources: Scripture, confessional Reformed theology, doctrines of covenant, common grace, and natural law provide the basis for political claims.
 - Norms for politics: Distinguish the magistrate's legitimate civil role (maintain order, punish evil, promote justice) from the church's redemptive, ecclesial functions.
 - Practice: Offer prudential guidance for Christian political action in pluralist democracies that respects freedom and limits of civil authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and Calvin (classical magisterial tradition), Reformed confessions and scholastics, Kuyper (sphere sovereignty) as interlocutor, critics including theonomy/theonomic Reconstructionists (e.g., Rushdoony/North) and radical post-Christendom critics (Hauerwasian pacifism, some liberationist critiques). Also engages natural law tradition and modern political theory.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology, divine sovereignty, law (moral/ceremonial/civil distinctions), common grace, natural law, Christology (kingly office), eschatology (inaugurated yet not consummated), the doctrine of the magistrate and church.
- **Closing line:** A confessional Reformed political theology that insists on Christian public responsibility without Christendom's power-grounding limited magistral authority in covenantal law, common grace, and eschatological realism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reclaims a sober, confessional account of the magistrate that avoids both theonomic imposition and political quietism.
 - Frames the problem as a structural "fracture" produced by the end of Christendom and inaugurated eschatology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against theonomy: rejects the idea that modern civil law should be a direct application of Old Testament civil codes or that magistracy should enforce church discipline.
 - Against Christian withdrawal/sectarianism (e.g., certain Hauerwas readings): rejects abdication of political responsibility and offers prudential engagement instead of pure separation.
 - Nuances Kuyper: affirms sphere distinctions but presses stronger limits on political ambitions of Christian institutions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Politics after Christendom" as a constructive category emphasizing post-settlement prudence and realism.
 - Re-articulation of classical two-kingdom motifs with covenantal and natural-law anchoring rather than mere institutional dualism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in conservative and confessional Reformed seminaries and churches as a balanced corrective to extremes.
 - Praised for clarity and practicality; critiqued by some on the left for insufficient engagement with social justice frameworks and by some theonomists for being too restrictive.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models disciplined use of historical theology to address contemporary politics.
 - Serves as a clear syllabus for church-state teaching grounded in Reformed confessions and usable in pastoral ethics classes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christendom:** The historical sociopolitical order where Christianity shaped public law and culture; VanDrunen diagnoses its end and the consequences for political theology.
- **Magistrate:** Civil authority ordained by God to restrain evil, administer justice, and preserve order; legitimate but limited in redemptive scope.
- **Two Kingdoms (covenantal nuance):** Distinction between God's rule in the church and civitas, reworked with covenantal and natural-law foundations rather than strict separatism.
- **Common Grace:** God's restraining and providential care that allows non-Christians to participate in civil goods and moral order; grounds shared public norms.
- **Natural Law:** Moral ordering accessible to reason and Scripture; used to justify civil legislation in a pluralist setting without confessional coercion.
- **Eschatological realism:** Recognition that Christ's kingdom is inaugurated but not consummated; shapes political hope and limits utopianism.
- **Sphere sovereignty (qualified):** Acknowledged as a useful corrective to statism, but constrained so ecclesial aims do not co-opt civil magistracy.
- **Redemptive vs. Civil Justice:** Clarifies duties of church (redemptive, covenantal restoration) and state (public order, punishment, protection).
- **Political theology:** Theological reflection that grounds claims about public order, law, and governance in Scripture and doctrine.
- **Prudential engagement:** The Christian posture toward politics after Christendom-responsible, principled, and realistic rather than maximalist.
- **Fractured world:** The sociopolitical reality of pluralism and contestation post-Christendom; shapes method and aims.
- **Confessional grounding:** Uses Reformed confessions as normative guides for political theology.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Church And State Relations: Used as a primary definition source and teaching text for a confessional Reformed account of magistral limits, magistrate duties, and prudential church engagement in pluralist polities.
 - Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective: Serves as a conceptual pivot illustrating how inaugurated eschatology and common grace produce a sober, non-utopian framework for Christian cultural and political engagement.
