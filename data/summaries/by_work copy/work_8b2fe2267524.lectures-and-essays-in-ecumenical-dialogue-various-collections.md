### TITLE
Lectures and Essays in Ecumenical Dialogue (various collections) - John D. Zizioulas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th - early 21st century ecumenical milieu: post-Vatican II conversations, Anglican-Orthodox-Catholic trilateral contacts, and international commissions addressing the **Filioque** and creedal formulations.
 - Zizioulas writes as a contemporary Orthodox theologian rooted in patristic retrieval (especially Cappadocians) and responding to modern Western theological categories.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The primary ecumenical problem treated is the theological and ecclesiological significance of the **Filioque** controversy within broader discussion about the creeds: how differing accounts of divine procession reflect and shape divergent ontologies of personhood and communion.
 - Thesis: Trinitarian doctrine must be read through a **relational/hypostatic ontology**; correct resolution of Filioque and creedal disputes requires restoring the monarchy of the Father and seeing persons as relational centers (hypostases) rather than individual substances defined by abstract causality.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of patristic witnesses (Cappadocians, Maximus) on procession, monarchy of the Father, and perichoresis.
 - Critical contrast with Latin theological categories: causal language, substantialism, and metaphysical notions of process that led to Filioque insertion.
 - Proposal of an interpretive hermeneutic: creeds as ecclesial-symbolic acts (symbola) whose statements are to be read in the context of Trinitarian communion and ecclesial life (Eucharist as hermeneutical key).
 - Practical ecumenical moves: recommend terminological clarifications, mutual recognition of theological concerns, and ecclesiological steps (synodality, primacy) enabling agreement without forced doctrinal capitulation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Maximus the Confessor.
 - Modern interlocutors: Roman Catholic theologians involved in JDDJ-style dialogues, Anglican ecumenists, contemporary Orthodox peers.
 - Philosophical background: critique of Latin Aristotelian categories; engagement with 20th-century existential and personalist currents where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (procession, monarchy of the Father, perichoresis)
 - Ecclesiology (church as communion, eucharistic ontology)
 - Christology (as related to Trinitarian confession)
 - Soteriology and anthropology insofar as they flow from Trinitarian communion
 - Creeds and liturgical theology (status and interpretation of symbola)
- **Closing line**
 - Zizioulas centers ecumenical resolution on recovering a **Trinitarian ontology of personhood and ecclesial communion**: creeds are living acts of communion, and the Filioque dispute can only be rightly judged within that relational, ecclesial horizon.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Primacy of **relational/hypostatic ontology** over abstract substance metaphysics in Trinitarian theology.
 - Eucharistic/ecclesial reading of creeds: confessional formulas function within the church's life, not only as metaphysical propositions.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques Latin causal-language about the Spirit as masking an individualist ontology; counters modern Western reductions that treat persons as isolated substances.
 - Challenges purely juridical or procedural ecumenical fixes that ignore underlying ontological-linguistic differences.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Consistent deployment of **"ontology of communion"** as both theological method and ecclesiological program.
 - Reframing "procession" and "monarchy" in inter-personal, not hierarchical, terms to facilitate ecumenical understanding.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in contemporary Orthodox theology and ecumenical commissions; his categories frequently shape Orthodox interlocution with Catholics and Anglicans.
 - Adopted selectively in Western theology: appreciated by theologians seeking a more relational trinitarianism; critiqued by others for downplaying historical-linguistic specifics of Latin theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable framework for reading creeds as ecclesial acts and for reframing Filioque debates away from sterile terminology disputes toward shared ecclesial life.
 - Valuable pedagogically for linking trinitarian doctrine, ecclesiology, and ecumenical method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostasis (person)** - concrete center of relational existence; primary unit in Trinitarian and ecclesial ontology.
- **Ousia vs. Hypostasis** - distinction restored to avoid conflation of communal personhood with abstract substance.
- **Procession (ekporeusis / procession)** - the manner of the Spirit's origin; Zizioulas insists on patristic nuance distinguishing Father-to-Son and Father-to-Spirit relations.
 - Contrast: ekporeusis (Eastern technical term) vs. Latin double procession formula (Filioque).
- **Monarchy of the Father** - Father as source (principium) within Trinitarian relations; emphasized to preserve personal distinctions without implying subordination.
- **Perichoresis (circumincession)** - mutual indwelling expressing interpersonal unity without identity of hypostases.
- **Ontology of communion** - key methodological concept: being is primarily relational and ecclesial, not isolated substance.
- **Creeds as symbola** - creeds conceived as liturgical-ecclesial confessions; their meaning anchored in worship and communion.
- **Eucharistic ecclesiology** - the Eucharist as the hermeneutical center for reading and resolving doctrinal formulations.
- **Patristic retrieval** - methodological insistence on Cappadocian and Maximos as primary interpreters for Trinitarian issues.
- **Relational anthropology** - human personhood derived from Trinitarian relationality.
- **Dialogical/ecumenical method** - theological exchange that prioritizes mutual recognition and reformulation rather than unilateral correction.
- **Primacy and synodality** - ecclesiological concepts treated as practical outworkings of communion needed for ecumenical agreements.
- **Filioque (term & controversy)** - focal case-study for broader differences in theological method and ontology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for relational/hypostatic readings of Trinity and personhood.
- As a **polemic and corrective** to Western causalist readings of procession, deployed in ecumenical briefs.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting creeds liturgically (creeds as ecclesial acts).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses or dialogues linking trinitarian theology, ecclesiology, and ecumenical method.
