### TITLE
Contra Collatorem (Against the Conference) - Prosper of Aquitaine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-5th century Gaul (Prosper active c. 432-455). Work composed in the aftermath of Augustine's debates with Pelagius and his followers; theological milieu dominated by disputes over grace, free will, and the legacy of Augustine in Gallic churches.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A sustained defense of Augustinian teaching that divine grace is necessary even for the first move of conversion; direct refutation of Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian claims that human free will can initiate salvation without antecedent divine aid.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Statement of opponent's claim: freedom of the will suffices for initial faith and conversion (Pelagian or semi‑Pelagian posture).
 - Scriptural and Augustinian proof that human nature is wounded by original sin and cannot effect true conversion unaided.
 - Positive account: grace is both **necessary** and **efficacious** - God initiates and completes the work; human will cooperates but never precedes grace.
 - Practical consequences: implications for election, merit, and perseverance; warning against giving human effort causal priority in salvation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine (primary authority), implicit/explicit opponents drawing on Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum traditions and later semi‑Pelagian spokesmen; heavy reliance on Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians) and Augustinian corpus.
- **Doctrines treated:** Original sin, prevenient/effective grace, free will (liberum arbitrium), predestination/election, justification and merit, perseverance/conversion.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Christianity's salvation is fundamentally God's work: grace precedes, empowers, and secures conversion; any theology that places the first causal move in fallen human will undermines sin, Scripture, and Augustine's pastoral convictions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm insistence on the **priority of grace** for the initial act of faith (not merely for growth after faith).
 - Tight coupling of Pauline exegesis with pastoral concerns about repentance and ecclesial purity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Polemically opposes Pelagian optimism about human nature and the semi‑Pelagian attempt to protect human freedom by assigning it an initiating role.
 - Defends Augustine against charges of denying human responsibility while avoiding deterministic caricatures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Helps popularize distinctions later central to medieval and Reformed formulations (e.g., **sufficient** vs **efficacious** grace, and the priority of prevenient divine motion) even if not systematized in modern technical terms.
 - Clarifies Augustine's language for use in Gallic controversy, making Augustinian positions more accessible and portable.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Important in shaping the Gallic reception of Augustine and in the broader campaign that culminated in the Council of Orange (529), which rejected semi‑Pelagianism while carefully phrasing the role of will.
 - Influential for medieval Augustinian continuations and later Reformed appropriations of Augustine's views on grace and predestination.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models concise pastoral polemic grounded in exegesis and patristic authority.
 - Useful for tracing the genealogy of debates over prevenient/effective grace and for understanding how Augustinianism was transmitted and adapted in the West.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prevenient grace:** The divine aid that comes before any human turning; for Prosper, this is necessary for even the first act of faith.
- **Efficacious grace:** Grace that actually effects its intention (conversion); contrasted with mere offer or sufficiency.
- **Sufficient grace:** (Implicit contrast) Grace offered universally but not always efficacious unless applied; Prosper leans toward stressing efficacy for the elect.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium):** Preserved as genuine but morally incapacitated by original sin; will acts only after being moved by grace.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale):** The fallen condition that incapacitates unassisted human effort to attain right relationship with God.
- **Predestination/election:** Divine choosing tied to grace's initiative; Prosper links election to the reality of efficacious grace without denying human responsibility.
- **Merit and reward:** Human acts do not cause grace; merit is a response enabled by grace, not the ground of divine favor.
- **Concupiscence:** The disordered inclination post‑Fall that demonstrates the will's need for restorative grace.
- **Perseverance:** A continuation of the theme that perseverance in faith is sustained by God's ongoing grace.
- **Pauline exegesis:** Use of Romans and Galatians to demonstrate impossibility of unaided conversion and to underline the doctrine of grace.
- **Augustinian authority:** Reliance on Augustine as theological anchor and interpretive guide.
- **Pelagianism:** Denied need for prevenient grace; Prosper combats its optimistic anthropology.
- **Semi‑Pelagianism:** Attempted compromise attributing initial movement to will; main target of Prosper's corrective.
- **Operatio divina (divine operation):** The concept that God's action is primary in salvific transformation (implicit operative category throughout).
- **Voluntas (will) vs. gratia (grace):** Recurrent tension resolved by affirming grace's primacy without annihilating willing.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **polemic** source against Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian positions in historical theology.
 - As an **Augustinian exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts on sin and grace; used in loci on soteriology and divine initiative.
