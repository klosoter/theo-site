### TITLE
Baptism: Three Views - David F. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Situated in late 20th-century Reformed scholarship and evangelical ecumenical debate over sacraments. Wright writes as a historically informed Presbyterian/Reformed theologian engaging contemporary Baptist critiques and renewed interest in covenant theology and sacramental theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend **paedobaptism** (infant baptism) within a covenantal-sacramental framework against credobaptist readings that restrict baptism to professing believers; clarify the relation of baptism to circumcision, covenant membership, regeneration, and church identity.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical-theological survey establishing consistent practice and theology of infant baptism in the early church and Reformers.
 - Exegetical defense of household baptisms and passages commonly appealed to by Baptists (e.g., Acts, Pauline household lists, Luke).
 - Theological articulation of baptism as the **sign and seal** of the covenant, continuous with Old Testament circumcision, instituting covenant inclusion for children of believing parents.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiological implications: baptism establishes visible covenant membership and responsibility for covenant nurture; it is not a magical guarantee of regeneration but a pledge of God's promise requiring covenantal upbringing and faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Reformed and patristic authorities (e.g., Calvin, Augustine, patristic practice).
 - Contemporary Baptist critics and scholars of the believer's baptism tradition.
 - Biblical witnesses (Pauline corpus, Acts, Gospels) read through covenantal categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology, sacramentology (sign and seal), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, membership), soteriology (regeneration, faith), biblical exegesis of household baptism texts, typology (circumcision -> baptism).
- **Closing line capturing theological center:** Wright grounds infant baptism as covenantal incorporation-baptism functions as the visible sign and seal of God's covenantal promise to the children of believers, continuous with circumcision, and essential for maintaining the covenant community while distinguishing sign from automatic conferment of saving grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Careful integration of patristic, Reformation, and contemporary sources to show historical continuity of paedobaptism.
 - Balanced sacramental language: robust sign-seal emphasis without collapsing baptism into mechanical regeneration.
 - Strong stress on covenantal responsibility: baptism presupposes and obligates covenant nurture and catechesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Challenges credobaptist appeals to household baptism as necessarily implying believer-only baptism; argues household contexts better fit covenantal inclusion.
 - Corrects crude sacramentalism by clarifying that baptism seals a promise, not automatically effects conversion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precise delineation of **covenant-inclusion** language (incorporation into visible covenant community) that avoids both nominalism and sacramental determinism.
 - Nuanced use of typology linking circumcision-baptism as continuity markers rather than simple analogues.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and Presbyterian teaching as a clear, scholarly defense of paedobaptism.
 - Employed in pastoral formation and ecumenical dialogues as a temperate but firm statement of covenantal baptismal theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of combining historical theology, exegesis, and pastoral concern.
 - Useful classroom text for advanced seminars on sacraments, covenant theology, and baptismal controversies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Paedobaptism:** Infant baptism; defended as covenantal inclusion and sign/seal of promise to believing households.
- **Credobaptism:** Believer's baptism; presented as primary interlocutor and contrasted with covenantal logic.
- **Covenant theology:** Framework situating baptism as continuation of Old Testament covenant signs (esp. circumcision).
- **Sign and seal:** Sacramental category Wright emphasizes-baptism signifies and authenticates God's promise without automatically imparting saving grace.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology:** Continuity thesis holding baptism functions analogously to circumcision as covenant sign.
- **Household baptism:** Key exegetical phrase; Wright reads household baptisms as evidence for including children in covenant membership.
- **Visible vs. invisible church:** Distinction used to justify infant baptism as membership marker of visible covenant community while leaving salvation to heart-level faith.
- **Baptismal regeneration (rejected as mechanical):** Wright rejects that baptism inevitably effects regeneration but allows covenantal promise and calling to grace.
- **Covenant nurture / catechesis:** Pastoral obligation entailed by baptizing infants-parents and church must foster faith development.
- **Efficacy (conditional vs. declarative):** Baptism is efficacious as a sign-seal promise that awaits faith, not an unconditional conferment of salvation.
- **Household faith presupposition:** The notion that a believing head's faith bears implications for the household's covenant status.
- **Ecclesial membership:** Baptism's primary social/communal function-entry rite into the visible church community.
- **Typological hermeneutic:** Method connecting OT practice to NT sacramental theology.
- **Infant faith (debated):** Wright treats infant faith as non-identical with adult profession but as belonging to covenant context warranting baptism.

- **Usages across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed paedobaptist positions in theology syllabi.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates with credobaptist/Baptist arguments over household baptisms and covenant logic.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading household texts and circumcision-baptism typology within covenant theology.
