### TITLE
**"The Westminster Confession on the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace" - T. David Gordon (WTJ article)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th/early-21st century scholarship situated in confessional Reformed studies and historical theology; engages the 17th-century Westminster Assembly and the textual theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF).
 - Interaction with both classical Puritan/federal theologians and modern interpreters who revise or question traditional covenant schemata.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gordon argues that the WCF articulates a coherent two-fold covenantal framework - a Covenant of Works with Adam and a Covenant of Grace after the Fall - and that careful attention to the Confession's language resolves many contemporary disputes about continuity, conditions, and legal/gracious relations between the covenants.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical reading of relevant WCF chapters (esp. on God, original sin, Christ the Mediator, and salvation) to show how covenant language functions.
 - Distinguishes the Covenant of Works as an original, conditional arrangement with Adam as federal head; Covenant of Grace as the post-Fall divine disposition toward sinners mediated in Christ.
 - Examines the doctrines of imputation, federal headship, active and passive obedience, and sacramental signs as interlocking supports for the Confession's covenantal scheme.
 - Argues for a calibrated continuity: moral demands persist, but the covenantal relation shifts from probation under Adam to promise and fulfillment in Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit conversation with Westminster divines (Rutherford, Ames, Owen) and later Reformed scholars.
 - Engages modern critics who either minimize the Covenant of Works or collapse distinctions between the covenants (revisionists and some NPP/"Federal Vision" debates).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works and grace), original sin, federal headship, Christology (mediatorship; active/passive obedience), justification (imputation), sacraments as signs and seals, law/gospel relation.

- **Closing line**
 - The WCF, Gordon contends, preserves a balanced, juridical-and-relational covenantal theology: the Covenant of Works explains Adamic accountability while the Covenant of Grace displays God's redemptive fidelity fulfilled in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful textual sensitivity to the Confession's phrasing; Gordon stresses terminological precision (e.g., "covenant of works" as a specific juridical construct rather than a loose moral description).
 - Emphasizes the grammatical and theological links between federal headship, imputation, and Christ's mediatorial role.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that either deny a distinct Covenant of Works or that make the Covenant of Grace merely a continuation without real typological/forensic transition.
 - Corrects views that read the WCF as primarily moralistic or purely forensic by underscoring its covenantal-relational texture.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions such as "condition" (covenantal obligation) versus "promise" (covenantal gift) in WCF usage.
 - Refines the manner of speaking about continuity: not identity of covenantal terms but continuity of God's moral law as normative across covenants.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful to confessional and conservative Reformed audiences as a short corrective to revisionist covenant theologies.
 - Cited in debates over federal theology, Adamic headship, and sacramental-pedagogical continuity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a tight, confessionalist exegetical model that aids teaching on the WCF and on how classical Reformed theology links law, gospel, and covenantal structure.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-Fall arrangement with Adam requiring perfect obedience on pain of death; juridical and conditional; Adam as federal head.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The covenantal economy post-Fall in which God promises redemption through a Mediator (Christ); covenantal promise, fulfilled objectively in Christ and applied by the Spirit.

- **Federal Headship (Federalism)**
 - The representation principle: Adam's act counts for his posterity; Christ functions as the second/true federal head for the elect.

- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer: Adam's sin imputed to his descendants; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers - key to the WCF's soteriology.

- **Active and Passive Obedience**
 - Christ's fulfilling the law (active) and suffering penalty (passive) as necessary for fulfilling the Covenant of Works and accomplishing the Covenant of Grace.

- **Condition vs. Promise**
 - A working distinction in the WCF: Covenant of Works marked by conditional tenure; Covenant of Grace by promissory divine engagement.

- **Law/Gospel Relation**
 - The Confession preserves the law's normative role while locating its fulfillment and penal removal in Christ's mediatorial work.

- **Sacraments as Signs and Seals**
 - Baptism and the Lord's Supper as covenantal marks linking promise to believer; continuity of covenantal signs affirmed.

- **Original Sin / Total Depravity**
 - The theological groundwork that necessitates the transition from probation (Works) to promise (Grace).

- **Covenant of Redemption (implied)**
 - Pre-temporal pact within Trinitarian will to secure the Covenant of Grace through the Mediator (used to explain intra-Trinitarian planning).

- **Typology and Christological Fulfillment**
 - Adam typology vs Christ typology: Adam as type whose failure is reversed in Christ.

- **Works Principle**
 - The idea that merit is based on covenantal obedience - affirmed for Adam, repudiated for sinners saved by grace through faith.

- **Justification by Faith**
 - Central locus showing how Covenant of Grace operates forensic-ly via imputation.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional source** for confessional readings of the WCF on covenant structure.
- As a **polemic** against revisionist or reductive accounts that deny a distinct Covenant of Works.
- As an **exegetical model** for teaching the interrelation of law, covenant, and Christology in Reformed systematic theology.
