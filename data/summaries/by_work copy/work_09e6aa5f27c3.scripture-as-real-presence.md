### TITLE
Scripture as Real Presence - Hans Boersma

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed/Anglo-Catholic retrieval movement (early 21st century). Part of a wider "reformational retrieval" reclaiming patristic, medieval, and sacramental resources against modern Protestant minimalism and secular historicism.
 - Located in debates over the nature of the Word (proposition/event/speech-act) and the relation between Scripture, sacrament, and liturgy.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Scripture functions as a real, mediating presence of Christ** rather than merely a propositional repository of true statements about God. Boersma argues against representationalist and purely informational models of Scripture and for a sacramental, incarnational account of biblical language and reading.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: modern/post-Reformation tendencies reduce the Word to propositions or referential signs, severing language from sacramental efficacy.
 - Retrieval: recover patristic and medieval vistas where language, liturgy, typology and sacraments participate in God's presence.
 - Analogical move: analogy with Eucharistic **real presence** - Scripture is a different mode by which Christ is really present to his people.
 - Hermeneutical implications: canonical, christocentric, liturgical and typological reading practices recover Scripture's enacted mediation; reading is a sacramental act facilitated by the Spirit and the church.
 - Pastoral/ecclesial move: preaching, reading, and liturgy are the loci where Scripture's presence is actualized - not private informational consumption alone.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Aquinas; strong engagement with Calvin (appropriating incarnational emphases) and with modern theologians (Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, speech-act theorists).
 - Polemical targets include modernist demythologizers, representationalist epistemologies, and some strains of evangelical propositionalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, Christology (mediatory presence), sacramentology, ecclesiology, hermeneutics, Word-Spirit relation, typology, and elements of Trinitarian appropriation by way of mediation.

- **Closing line**
 - Boersma's center of gravity: **Scripture must be read and taught as an incarnational, sacramental medium through which the risen Christ is really present and effective for the church.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Recasts the Bible as a **sacramental instrument** - not sacrament in the same mode as Eucharist but homologous: real, efficacious presence mediated through signs and enacted within ecclesial worship.
 - Stresses ritual/performative aspects of reading: proclamation and hearing are sacramental acts energized by the Spirit.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Protestant tendencies that reduce Scripture to abstract propositions or private proof-texting; challenges modern hermeneutics that depersonalize divine speech.
 - Contrasts with Barth's emphasis on spoken Word-event by insisting that texts and liturgical forms also embody and mediate the living Word.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Terminological shift: moves the language of **"real presence"** from Eucharistic exclusivity to a broader sacramental theory of Scripture.
 - Advances a sacramental ontology of language: words as sacramental means, capable of conveying presence, not merely truth-bearers.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed retrieval and Anglo-Catholic circles; influential for liturgical theology, sacramental homiletics, and catholic-reformed dialogues.
 - Criticized by some evangelicals for blurring Word/sacrament distinctions and by analytic theologians for ambiguity about ontological claims.

- **Enduring value**
 - Prompts renewed attention to worship, preaching, and reading practices; rehabilitates typology and patristic grammar for contemporary hermeneutics.
 - Serves as a corrective to secularized and privatized Bible engagement, recovering communal and sacramental dimensions of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture as Real Presence** - The central claim: Scripture mediates Christ's presence in a real, efficacious manner analogous to sacraments.
- **Sacramental ontology of language** - Language can be an ontologically effective medium, not merely representational.
- **Incarnational analogy** - The Word's mode of mediation is patterned on the Incarnation: God with us via material means (words, rites).
- **Typology** - Typological reading is restored as a normative, salvific-historical way Scripture points to Christ.
- **Canonical reading** - Emphasis on Scripture as a unified, ecclesial canon whose reading enacts presence.
- **Performative proclamation** - Preaching and public reading are sacramental acts that effect reception of the Word.
- **Word and Spirit relation** - The Spirit actualizes the presence mediated by Scripture; text alone apart from Spirit and church is inert.
- **Ecclesial mediation** - The church, liturgy, and sacraments are necessary contexts for Scripture's presence.
- **Anti-propositionalism** - Critique of models that reduce Scripture to propositional truth only.
- **Realist hermeneutic** - Opposite of radical subjectivism or mere historical-critical skepticism; affirms objective efficacy of the Word as mediated.
- **Liturgical focus** - Reading of Scripture is integral to worship where presence is enacted.
- **Typological/sacramental reading** - Combines figural exegesis with sacramental theology to locate Christ in the text.
- **Presence vs. representation** - Key contrast: mediating presence (efficacy) vs. representing facts (information).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a sacramental account of revelation and the Word.
- As a **polemic** against propositionalist, privatized, or demythologizing readings of Scripture.
- As an **exegetical model** encouraging typological, canonical, and liturgical approaches in biblical theology and homiletics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for connecting sacramentology, preaching, and ecclesial formation in Reformed and catholic-minded theological work.
