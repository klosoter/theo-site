### TITLE
**The Work of Christ Applied** (chapter in Theonomy and Eschatology) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed debates over law, kingdom, and eschatology; Westminster Seminary milieu shaped by Vos and Murray. Engages theonomy discussions and broader questions of inaugurated eschatology and Christian ethics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The application of Christ's once-for-all work is the eschatological work of the Spirit uniting believers to the resurrected and exalted Christ. Soteriology, ethics, and any account of law must be ordered by this union-with-Christ in the already-not-yet.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - From historia salutis to ordo salutis: Christ's resurrection-exaltation and Pentecost are the turning point of redemptive history; the Spirit applies what Christ accomplished.
 - Union with Christ: All benefits are facets of one Spirit-wrought union in his death and resurrection; ordo salutis is a differentiated description of that union rather than a temporal ladder.
 - Justification and sanctification: Distinct yet inseparable in union; both are eschatological in structure. Sanctification includes a definitive breach with sin rooted in Christ's death-resurrection.
 - Law and new covenant: Christ is the telos of the law; the Spirit internalizes the law in the church as new-creational reality. Christian obedience is of the Spirit, not a mere republication of Mosaic civil-juridical structures.
 - Kingdom and ethics: The church lives in the overlap of the ages; ethics are cruciform and pneumatic, oriented to the age to come, not an immanent social blueprint.
 - Theonomy assessed: Claims of direct, abiding civil continuity with Mosaic judicial law fail to reckon with redemptive-historical fulfillment and the eschatological nature of the Spirit's application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture, especially Paul (Rom 4-8; 1 Cor 15; Gal 2-5; Eph 1-2) and Hebrews; Vos and Ridderbos on inaugurated eschatology; Murray on redemption accomplished and applied; Bavinck and Calvin on union and law; contemporary theonomic arguments in view.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (resurrection, exaltation), Pneumatology (eschatological gift), Soteriology (union, justification, sanctification, adoption), Eschatology (two-age schema), Covenant Theology (Mosaic-new covenant relations), Law and Gospel, Ecclesiology (church as firstfruits), Theology Proper (Trinitarian economy).
- **Closing line:** The Spirit's eschatological union with the risen Christ is the axis of applied redemption, by which the church participates now in the age to come and learns to obey as new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong centering of all soteriological benefits in Spirit-wrought union with the resurrected and exalted Christ.
 - Ordo salutis reframed as facets of union, not a sequence detachable from historia salutis.
 - Emphasis on definitive sanctification as an accomplished redemptive-historical transfer of realm and lordship.
 - Justification as an already eschatological verdict anticipating the last day.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects theonomic continuity claims by highlighting covenant-historical fulfillment and the internalization of the law by the Spirit.
 - Pushes back against ordo-salutis atomism that separates benefits from the person and history of Christ.
 - Guards against over-realized eschatology by maintaining the not yet of struggle, suffering, and bodily hope; against under-realized eschatology by insisting on real new-creational transformation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Coordinating historia salutis and ordo salutis via union with Christ.
 - Definitive sanctification language grounded in Rom 6 and the believer's death-resurrection solidarity with Christ.
 - Christ as telos of the law refracted through Spirit-empowered obedience as the law of Christ.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed discussions to counter both antinomianism and theonomy, reinforcing inaugurated eschatology in ethics.
 - Helped consolidate a union-with-Christ paradigm across soteriology and ecclesial practice.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides an integrated, Trinitarian, eschatological map for preaching, catechesis, and public theology.
 - Clarifies how law, gospel, and Spirit relate in the new covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Spirit-wrought solidarity with the crucified and risen Christ; the matrix of all benefits.
- **Historia salutis / Ordo salutis:** Accomplishment in Christ's history versus application to believers; coordinated, not separated.
- **Resurrection-exaltation:** The pivotal transition in Christ's work that grounds the church's new life.
- **Pentecost:** The eschatological gift of the Spirit who applies Christ and constitutes the church.
- **Eschatological Spirit:** The down payment of the age to come who internalizes the law and empowers obedience.
- **Two-age schema:** This age versus the age to come; believers live in the overlap.
- **Already and not yet:** Present participation in future realities with continuing pilgrimage and hope.
- **Definitive sanctification:** Once-for-all transfer from sin's dominion to Christ's, issuing in progressive renewal.
- **Justification:** Present verdict of righteousness in Christ anticipating final judgment; distinct from but inseparable from sanctification.
 - Works are evidential, not meritorious; the verdict is Christ's.
- **Adoption:** Sonship participation in the risen Son, entailing inheritance and Spirit of sonship.
- **Firstfruits / Arrabon:** The Spirit as pledge; resurrection life tasted now.
- **Law fulfilled in Christ:** Christ as telos; law written on hearts; the law of Christ governs new-creational obedience.
- **Kingdom of God:** Eschatological reign present in the church by the Spirit, awaiting consummation.
- **Theonomy:** View of abiding civil-juridical Mosaic norms; here critiqued via redemptive-historical fulfillment and pneumatic ethics.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definition source for union with Christ and for coordinating ordo and historia.
 - As a polemical and constructive resource in law-ethics debates, especially against simplistic theonomic continuity.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Paul and Hebrews through an inaugurated-eschatology lens.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking eschatology to sanctification, ecclesiology, and public theology.
