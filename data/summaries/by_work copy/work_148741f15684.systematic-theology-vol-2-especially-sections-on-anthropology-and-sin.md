### TITLE
**Wolfhart Pannenberg, Systematic Theology, Vol. 2** 
Focus: **Anthropology and Sin** within an eschatological ontology of history (German 1991; Eng. trans. 1994)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century German Protestant theology, after Barth and Bultmann, in dialogue with philosophy of history, the human sciences, and natural science.
 - Pannenberg advances a public, rationally testable theology in a postmetaphysical milieu, aiming at universality.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - What is the human being before God, and how does sin arise and spread, when truth is disclosed in the **history** whose meaning is settled **only from the eschatological future**?
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Anthropology**
 - Human beings are **openness to the world** (Weltoffenheit): self-transcending, linguistic, historical agents whose identity is deferred toward the future.
 - **Personhood** is constituted relationally by anticipation of God's future; the **imago Dei** is forensic-teleological, not a static substance.
 - **Body-soul-spirit** unity: rejects substance dualism; speaks of psychosomatic unity with Spirit-language drawn from biblical usage and field-theory analogies.
 - **Freedom and law**: human freedom is creaturely, correlated to God's lordship; autonomy apart from God becomes destructive heteronomy to powers.
 - **Sin**
 - Rooted in **anxiety about finitude and death**; becomes **self-assertion** (Selbstbehauptung) that curves the self inward and against God and neighbor.
 - **Original sin**: universal historicity of sin's spread, not hereditary substance; Adam functions as representative primordium of human history.
 - Sin is personal and social; structures of domination and ideology stabilize self-assertion.
 - **Christological orientation**
 - The resurrection of Jesus is the **proleptic** disclosure of the eschatological future that grounds a truthful anthropology and the overcoming of sin.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture read within the history of Israel and Jesus; patristic and Reformation voices (Augustine, Aquinas, Luther).
 - Moderns: Kant, Hegel, Schleiermacher, Heidegger, Dilthey; dialogue with Freud, Marx, sociobiology, and evolutionary biology.
 - Systematic interlocutors: Barth (revelation), Bultmann (existential interpretation), Rahner and Moltmann (Christology and eschatology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence; image of God; freedom; sin and original sin; death; Christology via resurrection; Spirit and human person; beginnings of soteriology; method and revelation-in-history carry over from Vol. 1.
- **Closing line**
 - The **future of God** is the decisive horizon of human identity; sin is the refusal of that future through self-assertion, and its truth and defeat are disclosed **proleptically** in Jesus' resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Eschatological ontology**: being is determined from its consummation; truth is historical and public.
 - **Openness to the world** and future-oriented personhood as the key to the imago Dei.
 - **Sin as anxiety-driven self-assertion** under the power of death; integration of biblical, philosophical, and psycho-social analyses.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **Barth's** revelational a priori: insists on theology's public rationality within universal history.
 - Beyond **Bultmann's** existentialism: grounds existential analysis in real history and eschatological fulfillment.
 - Revises Augustinian **original sin**: from quasi-biological inheritance to universal historicity and social embeddedness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Prolepsis** of the future in the resurrection as criterion of truth.
 - **Selbstbehauptung** as analytic of sin; **Weltoffenheit** as analytic of human nature.
 - **Field** analogy for Spirit to express non-competitive divine-human relation and psychosomatic unity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely engaged across traditions; appreciated for integrating science, philosophy, and dogmatics; critiqued for speculative scope and for grounding deity and truth in history's future disclosure.
 - Reformed readers draw on his history-of-revelation and eschatological emphases, while querying Scripture's normativity and original sin's reformulation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides categories to teach anthropology and hamartiology that converse with modernity while remaining biblically textured.
 - Offers a robust bridge between Christology, eschatology, and human sciences for interdisciplinary theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological ontology**: Being and truth determined from the end; the future gives identity to the present.
- **Prolepsis**: Anticipatory realization; Jesus' resurrection as foretaste and criterion of the final truth of reality.
- **Revelation-in-history**: God's self-disclosure occurs within and is testable by universal history, centered in Israel and Jesus.
- **Weltoffenheit (openness to the world)**: Human transcendence beyond immediate environment; basis for culture, language, and theology.
- **Imago Dei as destiny**: Image framed teleologically and relationally; fulfilled in communion with God rather than located in a static faculty.
- **Psychosomatic unity**: No soul-body dualism; personhood is holistic, with Spirit-language marking relation to God and life's dynamic.
- **Field metaphor for Spirit**: Nonlocal, life-giving presence patterned analogically on field theory; resists substance metaphysics.
- **Anxiety and death**: Finitude and fear of nonbeing generate sin's dynamics; cf. Heb 2:15.
- **Selbstbehauptung (self-assertion)**: Sin's core act of securing the self against God and others; relates to incurvatus in se.
- **Original sin as historicity**: Universality explained by the structure and history of human existence, not by biological transmission.
- **Social sin and structures**: Sin institutionalized in systems and ideologies; requires eschatological critique.
- **Public truth**: Theology argued in the forum of rational inquiry, not private decision alone.
- **Resurrection criterion**: The resurrection vindicates Jesus and norms theological claims about God, humanity, and salvation.
- **Freedom under lordship**: Creaturely freedom realized in relation to God's rule; autonomy apart from God becomes bondage.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional source for anthropology and sin across loci, integrating Christology and eschatology.
 - As a conceptual pivot for Bibliology and revelation-in-history, including canon as witness within public truth-claims.
 - As a polemical and synthetic resource contrasting existentialist or purely substance-based accounts of personhood and sin.
 - As an interdisciplinary model engaging philosophy and sciences in theological construction.
