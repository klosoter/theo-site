### TITLE
God Is the Head of Christ: Does 1 Corinthians 11:3 Ground Gender Complementarity in the Immanent Trinity? (JETS 56.4, 2013) - Kyle Claunch

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society (2013) amid intensified evangelical debate over gender roles and trinitarian language.
 - Converses with contemporary complementarian claims that appeal to Trinitarian order (notably proponents of ESS-eternal/substantial subordination of the Son).
 - Targets an audience of evangelical biblical theologians and pastors seeking exegetical clarity for pastoral practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Claunch contends that 1 Corinthians 11:3 should not be read as grounding gender complementarity in the **immanent Trinity** (i.e., as evidence of eternal ontological subordination of the Son to the Father).
 - The verse functions within Paul's **economic** and social logic, not as a metaphysical exposition of intra-Trinitarian being.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical focus on the immediate context of 1 Cor 11 (head coverings, worship order) and Pauline household code idiom.
 - Linguistic and semantic analysis of kephale ("head") and related terms in Pauline and Hellenistic usage:
 - Argues against simple equation of kephale = authority/ontological source without contextual qualification.
 - Distinction between economic and immanent Trinity:
 - Paul's language is interpreted as referring to role/function within redemptive order (economic), not eternal ontological relations (immanent).
 - Critique of using 11:3 as a prooftext for ESS:
 - Demonstrates that the chain "man-woman-God" as Paul uses it pertains to social order and symbolic headship in worship, not to eternal subordination.
 - Appeals to broader Pauline theology (Christ's resurrection, Lordship, Spirit) to show consistency with orthodox trinitarianism that resists ontological subordination.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary complementarian theologians advocating ESS (implicit/explicit critics include Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware; responds to trends in egalitarian scholarship).
 - Employs patristic and reformational trinitarian commitments implicitly to safeguard against heterodox ontological readings.
 - Uses lexical, syntactical, and intertextual Pauline scholarship (Pauline context and Greco-Roman household parallels).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic vs immanent distinctions), Christology (sonship, lordship), biblical hermeneutics (prooftexting), ecclesiology (worship order), anthropology/gender (complementarianism vs egalitarianism).

- **Closing line**
 - Paul's appeal to "the head of Christ is God" in 1 Cor 11:3 functions within an economic, liturgical-social frame and therefore cannot be pressed as proof that gender complementarity is grounded in an ontological ordering of the immanent Trinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the hermeneutical boundary between economic descriptions and immanent-Trinitarian ontology.
 - Prioritizes contextualized, socioreligious reading over isolated systematic appropriation.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects complementarian moves that treat 1 Cor 11:3 as metaphysical justification for eternal Son-subordination.
 - Contrasts with readings that universalize worship-order language into perennial ontological categories.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the functional range of kephale in Pauline corpora and resists monolithic semantic readings.
 - Reinforces disciplined deployment of "headship" language by differentiating symbolic/functional headship from ontological subordination.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in evangelical circles skeptical of ESS and in egalitarian scholarship defending traditional Trinitarian orthodoxy.
 - Cited modestly as an exegetical corrective in debates about Scripture's bearing on gender roles and Trinitarian doctrine.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a clear methodological exemplar: avoid extrapolating doctrinal systems from single verses; maintain economy/immanence distinction.
 - Valuable for pastors and theologians needing a concise, scholarly rebuttal to ESS-based complementarian arguments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kephale ("head")** - lexical-semantic treatment; argued to have functional/symbolic range in Paul, not automatically ontological.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's roles/actions in redemption; the domain Claunch assigns Paul's 11:3 language to.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's eternal inner life; Claunch resists reading 11:3 as testimony about this domain.
- **Eternal/Substantial Subordination (ESS)** - the view Claunch critiques as illegitimately grounded in 1 Cor 11:3.
- **Functional subordination** - temporary/role-based submission in economy of salvation; allowed distinction from ontological subordination.
- **Ontological subordination** - denied as a legitimate inference from 11:3 by Claunch.
- **Pauline household codes** - socio-rhetorical context used to interpret headship language; informs the economic reading.
- **Worship order / head coverings** - immediate context of 1 Cor 11; primary interpretive horizon in Claunch's reading.
- **Prooftexting** - methodological problem identified; warns against using isolated verses to establish systematic trinitarian claims.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling** - background Trinitarian concepts implicitly appealed to in defending orthodox equality of persons.
- **Lordship of Christ** - Christ's authority in redemption affirmed but not equated with ontological inferiority.
- **Contextualized exegesis** - Claunch's methodological priority: social and liturgical context governs meaning.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Cor 11 within its economic and liturgical frame rather than as metaphysical prooftext.
- As a **polemic** against ESS-based complementarian appeals to immanent Trinity.
- As a concise **definition source** for distinguishing economic vs immanent uses of Trinitarian language in pastoral debate.
