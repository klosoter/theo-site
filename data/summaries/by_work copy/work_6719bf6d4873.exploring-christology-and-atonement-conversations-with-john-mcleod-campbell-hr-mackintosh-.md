### TITLE
Exploring Christology and Atonement: Conversations with John McLeod Campbell, H.R. Mackintosh and T.F. Torrance - Andrew Purves

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed/Scottish theological revival; Purves writes as a pastoral theologian engaging the Scottish tradition (Campbell, Mackintosh, Torrance) to reframe contemporary Christology and atonement debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Purves contends that orthodox atonement must be recovered within a Trinitarian, incarnational Christology that emphasizes divine initiative, relational reconciliation, and participation in the person of Christ - correcting both sentimental moral-influence readings and overly abstract penal models.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Read Campbell, Mackintosh, Torrance as complementary interlocutors rather than opponents.
 - Show how Campbell recovers the suffering, reconciling love of God; Mackintosh mediates doctrine and pastoral theology; Torrance supplies ontological and Trinitarian rigor.
 - Synthesize these strands into an account of atonement that is simultaneously **vicarious**, **objective**, and **participatory** - i.e., God acts in Christ to accomplish reconciliation, which believers receive by incorporation into Christ.
 - Apply the synthesis to pastoral practice: preaching, confession, assurance, and pastoral care must presuppose this Trinitarian, incarnational atonement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** John McLeod Campbell (19th c. Scottish minister), H.R. Mackintosh (early 20th c.), T.F. Torrance (mid-20th c. theologian); Scripture; selected patristic and Reformed resources as background.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person of Christ, incarnation), Trinity (ground of atonement), atonement theories (vicarious suffering, substitution, recapitulation, participation), reconciliation, union with Christ, soteriology, pastoral theology/assurance.
- **Closing line:** Purves offers a Trinitarian, incarnational atonement that preserves Christ's objective work and the believer's participatory union with him, reorienting doctrine toward pastoral proclamation and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that atonement language be rooted in the Trinitarian person and action of God - not merely a transaction or juridical fiction.
 - Emphasis on **participatory substitution**: Christ's vicarious work is objectively efficacious and must be entered into by faith through union with Christ.
 - Pastoral primacy: doctrinal articulation serves ecclesial proclamation, pastoral care, and transformation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Campbellian caricatures by retaining objective efficacy while adopting Campbell's stress on divine suffering and reconciling love.
 - Challenges narrow, individualized penal-substitutional readings that make God's wrath the primary focus detached from Trinitarian love and renewal.
 - Aligns with Torrance against purely exemplarist or moral-influence models, but criticizes any technical scholasticism that loses pastoral and relational contours.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses phrases like **relational reconciliation** and **participatory atonement** to bridge forensic and ontological emphases.
 - Reframes "substitution" so it is neither purely penal-imputed nor merely illustrative, but an incarnational, covenantal exchange.
- **Reception and influence:** Valued in Reformed pastoral theology circles and seminary contexts for integrating doctrinal depth with ministry practice; used as a corrective in contemporary debates over penal substitution and pastoral assurance.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Models how to read historical theologians dialogically; provides a usable synthesis for preaching, pastoral formation, and ecumenical discussions of atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement:** The work of Christ reconciling humanity to God - here developed as both **objective** (what God accomplishes) and **participatory** (what believers receive).
- **Vicarious atonement / substitution:** Christ stands in for sinners; Purves insists this is real and ontological, not merely forensic.
 - Contrast: neither reducible to penal-imputation alone nor to mere moral example.
- **Penal substitution:** Engaged critically - acknowledged in aspects but reinterpreted within Trinitarian, incarnational categories.
- **Participation / union with Christ:** Central soteriological category; the means by which believers share in Christ's reconciling work.
- **Reconciliation:** The restoration of right relationship rooted in divine initiative and demonstrated in Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
- **Divine suffering / God's reconciling love:** Emphasizes God's self-giving in Christ; draws on Campbell to portray God as both just and reconciling.
- **Trinitarian grounding:** The Father's reconciling action through the Son in the Spirit frames all atonement talk.
- **Incarnation / Christology:** The ontological basis for atonement - Christ as true God and true man enabling vicarious, efficacious reconciliation.
- **Objective reconciliation:** The accomplished reality of salvation in Christ, independent of human response but intended to be appropriated in union by faith.
- **Pastoral Christology:** Doctrine framed for proclamation, assurance, and pastoral care - not merely academic taxonomy.
- **Recapitulation:** The notion of Christ summing up human life in himself; used to supplement substitutionary language.
- **Soteriology:** Focus on transformation, assurance, and ecclesial formation as outcomes of atonement.
- **Expiation vs. satisfaction:** Distinction preserved - Purves holds to real expiation within a satisfied relational order.
- **Ecclesial usage:** The book insists doctrinal language be used in worship, preaching, and pastoral rites.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Trinitarian-incarnational account of atonement that integrates objective and participatory emphases.
- As a **polemic** against both narrow penal-only models and sentimental moral-influence accounts.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching Pauline and Johannine texts on union with Christ and reconciliation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking historical theology (Scottish tradition) with contemporary pastoral theology.
