### TITLE
**Holiness** (John Webster, 2003), a dogmatic treatise arguing that holiness is first a perfection of the triune God and, only derivatively, the sanctity of creatures by grace.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context:** Early 2000s retrieval of classical dogmatics within post-Barthian Anglican/Reformed circles; in conversation with ecclesial ethics and virtue traditions; part of a renewed case for theology as a science grounded in divine self-communication.
- **Central thesis:** **God's holiness** is an **absolute, simple, and triune perfection** that grounds and governs all God's works. **Creaturely holiness** is the sanctifying effect of God's Word and Spirit, given as a gospel gift and then commanded as creaturely enactment ordered toward eschatological fellowship with God.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Holiness is first an **attribute of God**: not bare separation nor mere moral purity, but the majestic goodness of God's life ad intra and ad extra.
 - By reason of **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility**, holiness is identical with God's being and perfections; its relative aspect appears in God's consecrating acts.
 - **Theological method:** theology is a science with **principia** in God and God's self-giving; Scripture's sanctity mirrors and serves God's sanctifying address.
 - **Sanctification:** evangelical order of **gift before task**; the church shares in Christ's holiness through the Spirit, then enacts obedience.
 - **Eschatological anthropology:** the end of human life is holy fellowship with God; present sanctification is proleptic participation in that end.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture (Leviticus; Isaiah 6; 1 Pet 1:16; 1 Thess 4); Augustine; Aquinas; Calvin; Luther; Barth; engagements with modern moralism and ecclesial-practice ethics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (absolute/relative; simplicity/aseity/immutability/impassibility), Trinity; creation and providence; sin; Christology (holiness of Jesus); pneumatology; Scripture and church; sanctification; eschatology.
- **Closing line:** The holy God makes holy a people by Word and Spirit, that they may share already-and-not-yet in the beatific fellowship for which they were created.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Priority of **divine holiness** over anthropological or ethical accounts; holiness is theological before it is moral.
 - **Evangelical ordering:** holiness as gift that generates command; sanctification as participation, not self-construction.
 - Integration of **attributes, method, and ethics** within a single dogmatic account.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against **moralism** and perfectionist voluntarism that detach ethics from God's prior act.
 - Against reducing holiness to **cultic separation** or to **immanent communal practices**; insists on God's free consecrating address.
 - Rehabilitates **immutability/impassibility** against caricatures, linking them to the reliability of sanctifying grace.
- **Conceptual innovations / formulations:**
 - Language of **consecrating address** (Word/Spirit) and **creaturely enactment** of sanctity.
 - Framing holiness as both **absolute attribute** and **relative operation** without dividing the simple God.
 - **Principia theologiae** applied to sanctification: method is itself sanctified under God's self-gift.
- **Reception / influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and Anglican dogmatics to recenter **sanctification** theologically.
 - A touchstone in debates on **classical theism** and doctrinal retrieval post-Barth.
 - Cited in ethics to ground virtue and practices in **gospel ontology**.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies holiness across loci (attributes, Scripture, church, ethics, eschatology).
 - Models a **scientia Dei** method binding doctrinal content and spiritual formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holiness (of God):** God's simple triune perfection; majestic moral beauty; not separable from love and goodness.
- **Absolute vs. relative attributes:** Holiness is **absolute** in God's being; **relative** in God's works ad extra (consecration, judgment, renewal).
 - Guards against reifying a split between who God is and what God does.
- **Simplicity:** God is not composed; holiness is identical with God's life and with other perfections.
- **Aseity:** God's holy life is from himself; sanctification is sheer gift, not elicited by creatures.
- **Immutability / impassibility:** God's holiness is steadfast and uncoerced; ensures the reliability of promise and the freedom of grace.
- **Principia theologiae:** God and God's self-communication in Word/Spirit as the first principles that make theology a genuine science.
- **Sanctification:** Gift-and-task; participation in Christ by the Spirit issuing in holy obedience.
- **Consecrating address:** God's sanctifying act through Scripture and proclamation that creates holy hearing and action.
- **Evangelical ethics:** Moral life generated by the gospel indicative; command flows from promise.
- **Church's holiness:** Given in election and union with Christ; enacted in worship, discipline, and missional witness.
- **Analogy/participation:** Creaturely holiness analogically reflects and participates in the divine perfection without collapse.
- **Eschatological anthropology:** Human telos is holy communion with God; present sanctification is proleptic of beatitude.
- **Word and Spirit:** Principal means by which God communicates and effects holiness in the church.
- **Purity and love:** Holiness integrates separation from sin with generous self-giving; judgment and mercy meet.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source on **absolute/relative attributes** and their coordination.
 - To ground **theological method** (principia; theology as sanctified science).
 - To articulate **classical perfections** (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) in service of soteriology.
 - To frame **sanctification and eschatological anthropology** within the nature and task of theology and ecclesial practice.
