### TITLE
Why People Matter: A Christian Engagement with Rival Views of Human Significance (2017), John F. Kilner (co-authored)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2017 amid intensified interdisciplinary debates in bioethics, human-rights discourse, and technology (AI, neuroscience, reproductive technologies).
 - Situated in contemporary Christian theological anthropology and public ethics, addressing secular naturalism, liberal individualism, and various philosophical accounts of personhood.

- **Central thesis**
 - A robust **Christian account of human significance**, rooted in the **imago Dei**, better secures intrinsic human dignity, moral status, and ethical obligations than rival secular or reductionist views.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Map competing conceptions of human significance (instrumentalism, utilitarian cost-benefit, reductive naturalism, radical autonomy, communitarian alternatives).
 - Exegetical and theological reconstruction of **imago Dei** as the decisive biblical resource for human worth.
 - Systematic articulation: ontology (what humans are), moral status (why they matter), and telos (what humans are for).
 - Application to ethical and policy questions to show practical superiority of the Christian account for protecting vulnerable lives.
 - Concluding defense that Christian anthropology grounds universal obligations without collapsing into either fideism or secular moral relativism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Biblical texts and classical theological sources (broad patristic / medieval / Reformation resources).
 - Contemporary philosophical and ethical positions (secular naturalism, utilitarian and consequentialist thought, liberal individualism, communitarian critiques).
 - Empirical disciplines referenced for interdisciplinary dialogue (bioethics, neuroscience, social science).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Imago Dei** (central), creation and creaturehood, human personhood, embodiment, fall and sin, redemption and vocation, moral responsibility, and eschatological telos as ethical horizon.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **human dignity is grounded in creaturely relation to the triune God (imago Dei), which makes persons intrinsically valuable, relationally constituted, morally accountable, and teleologically oriented toward flourishing in God.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reads imago Dei less as a single metaphysical predicate and more as a **relational, vocational, and moral status**-linking ontology and ethics.
 - Stresses vulnerability and dependency as constitutive of human significance, not marks of lesser value.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects secular reductionism that defines personhood by cognitive thresholds, functionality, or instrumental value.
 - Challenges both absolutizing sanctity-of-life rhetoric (which can be juridical and non-relational) and purely autonomy-driven approaches that disconnect dignity from divine calling.
 - Avoids crude dualisms (soul/body) by integrating embodiment into Imago Dei account.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Articulates a **spectrum model of moral status** grounded in common imago (equal intrinsic worth) but sensitive to differences in capacities, relations, and dependency.
 - Reframes dignity as **relational standing** rather than merely metaphysical possession or social honorific.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a useful bridge between systematic theology and applied bioethics; cited by theologians and ethicists engaging human dignity, disability ethics, and life‑issues.
 - Particularly welcomed among theologians who want a biblically grounded, theologically rich alternative to secular human-rights paradigms.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical resource for courses in theological anthropology and bioethics.
 - Practical framework for policy debates where intrinsic worth must be defended against economic or utilitarian reduction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - central explanatory principle: human beings reflect God in relational, moral, and vocational ways; the foundation of intrinsic dignity.
- **Human dignity** - redefined as grounded in divine relation and vocation; intrinsic and inviolable, not merely functional or honorific.
- **Personhood** - theological-personal notion (relational and embodied), contrasted with philosophically narrow cognitive definitions.
- **Intrinsic vs. instrumental value** - insists on intrinsic human worth that resists reduction to utility or social function.
- **Relationality** - emphasis on persons as essentially related (to God and others); moral status arises in interpersonal and covenantal contexts.
- **Embodiment** - corporeality is integral to the imago; counters disembodied conceptions of soul-based worth.
- **Vulnerability & dependency** - viewed as normative features that call forth moral responsibility, not signs of lesser status.
- **Moral status / spectrum model** - equal basic worth coexisting with differences in capacities and contexts that shape ethical duties.
- **Telos / vocation** - human flourishing oriented toward participation in God's purposes; an eschatological dimension for ethics.
- **Creation-Fall-Redemption frame** - anthropology and ethics read through redemptive history, informing present duties and hopes.
- **Applied bioethical focus** - connects theological anthropology to concrete issues (end-of-life, disability, reproductive ethics, emerging tech).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary theological accounts of imago Dei and intrinsic dignity.
- As a **polemic** against reductive secular accounts of personhood in bioethical and policy debates.
- As an **exegetical-model** linking biblical exegesis of Genesis and Pauline anthropology to ethical prescriptions.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: to show how doctrine (imago Dei) translates into obligations toward vulnerable persons.
