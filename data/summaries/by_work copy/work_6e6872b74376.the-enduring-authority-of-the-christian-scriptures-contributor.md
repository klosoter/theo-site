### TITLE
The Enduring Authority of the Christian Scriptures - contribution by D. A. Carson (essay in collection). 
Site usage: 1 reference; topical focus: **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical-Reformed milieu: response to confessional concerns about Scripture (authority, inerrancy, sufficiency) amid rising canonical, redemptive-historical, and postliberal conversations.
 - Engages both continental and anglophone interlocutors: canonical critics (e.g., Brevard Childs), biblical-theologians (Vos, von Rad), and systematicians (classical Reformed and modern constructive theologians).
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture retains an enduring, normative authority for Christian doctrine and life; proper appreciation of that authority requires integrating robust biblical-theological sensitivity (history and canon) with disciplined systematic theological synthesis.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary debates split between (a) over-systematizing theology that abstracts texts from their narrative-historical contexts, and (b) purely descriptive biblical theology that resists doctrinal synthesis.
 - Exegesis-first claim: Authoritative doctrine must grow out of careful historical-grammatical and canonical exegesis; biblical theology supplies the contours and trajectory of revelation.
 - Systematic necessity: Systematic theology is a necessary second step to articulate unity, implications, and contemporary application-without imposing foreign frameworks onto the text.
 - Harmony model: Argues for a dialectic - let biblical-theological trajectory constrain systematic categories; let systematic clarity guard against fragmented or merely anecdotal readings.
 - Practical corollary: Pastoral application and confessional formulation must be both textually rooted and doctrinally coherent.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Cites and contrasts: Geerhardus Vos (biblical theology as redemptive history), Brevard Childs (canonical approach), Karl Barth (Scripture as witness to revelation), and modern evangelical defenders of inerrancy (B. B. Warfield legacy).
 - Interacts with exegetical, historical, and canonical scholarship rather than speculative systematicism alone.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy, perspicuity, canon, covenant and redemptive-history, Christology (as center of canonical unity), and the task of theological method.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **Scripture's enduring authority is preserved when close exegesis of its redemptive-historical witness governs systematic formulation, producing doctrines that are both faithful to the text and pastorally applicable.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that biblical theology (trajectory, canon, redemptive history) must shape systematic theology rather than be subordinate to preformed doctrinal schemas.
 - Emphasis on the continuity and fulfillment pattern of revelation: later revelation clarifies and fulfills earlier promises without arbitrary revision.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects extremes on both sides:
 - Against reductionist systematicians who abstract doctrines from narrative context.
 - Against anti-systematic biblical theologians who refuse doctrinal synthesis and thereby risk practical incoherence.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Advocates a disciplined "exegetical constraint" on systematic categories - a methodological phrase that signals constraint without elimination.
 - Reframes canonical reading as a mediating practice between historical-critical description and dogmatic formulation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in conservative evangelical and Reformed circles as a measured corrective: affirmed by those wanting doctrinal orthodoxy rooted in exegesis.
 - Influential in shaping curricula that pair biblical-theological courses with systematic theology in seminaries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological posture for handling disputed doctrines: balances fidelity to text with necessity of theological articulation; valuable for pastors, seminarians, and scholars seeking an integrated hermeneutic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Enduring authority** - Scripture's ongoing normative status for belief and practice; not contingent on cultural reception.
- **Biblical theology** - Attention to the progressive, narrative, canonical development of revelation (trajectory and redemptive history).
 - Emphasizes diachronic movement (promise -> fulfilment).
- **Systematic theology** - Synchronous articulation and logical ordering of doctrines for teaching and application.
 - Emphasizes coherence, implication, and application across loci.
- **Exegetical constraint** - The methodological rule that systematic categories must be tested against careful exegesis.
- **Canonical approach** - Reading the Bible as a unified canon where later texts interpret earlier ones within God's redemptive plan.
- **Historical-grammatical method** - Basic hermeneutical stance advocated for authorial intent and textual meaning.
- **Inerrancy / inspiration** - Affirmed as ground for authoritative use; Carson situates these within canonical and redemptive frameworks to avoid naïve proof-texting.
- **Development of doctrine** - Distinguishes legitimate development (unfolding revelation) from corrupting change (contradiction of prior revelation).
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - Interpreting text with attention to Christ as center and telos of Scripture.
- **Perspicuity & sufficiency** - Scripture is accessible and adequate for doctrine and life when faithfully read and doctrinally formulated.
- **Trajectory hermeneutics** - Reading the movement of Scripture's moral and covenantal trajectory while guarding against treating trajectory as an autonomous ethical source.
- **Authorial intent / final author (God)** - Textual meaning grounded in human authors but ultimately unified under divine intentionality.
- **Pastoral application** - The culminating task: exegesis -> biblical theology -> systematic form -> contextual application.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a balanced methodological stance between biblical and systematic theology.
- As a **polemic** against both doctrinal abstraction and anti-systematic descriptivism.
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating redemptive-historical insights into confessional teaching and sermon formation.
