### TITLE
Infant Baptism: How My Mind Has Changed - Gregg Strawbridge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Recent reflective essay within the Reformed evangelical milieu addressing intra-Protestant baptismal controversy. Written as a personal-theological testimony responding to decades of debate between paedobaptist (Reformed/Covenantal) and credobaptist (Baptist/Anabaptist) positions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Strawbridge narrates and defends a shift toward a qualified **paedobaptist** position: infant baptism is the biblical and ecclesial practice as a covenantal sign and seal, though its efficacy must be rightly understood - not as automatic regeneration but as inclusion with pastoral and covenantal responsibilities.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Narrative opening: personal intellectual and pastoral journey, initial doubts, key challenges from credobaptist critiques.
 - Exegetical re-engagement: re-reading texts often appealed to by credobaptists (Mark 16; Acts household baptisms; Luke 18:15-17) and paedobaptist proofs (Genesis 17; Colossians 2).
 - Covenant theology as hermeneutic: argues for continuity between circumcision and baptism as sign/seal of the covenant across economies.
 - Historical-theological survey: early church practice and patristic witness favoring infant baptism; Reformation and post-Reformation articulations (Calvin, Westminster, Bavinck) refined rather than invented the tradition.
 - Pastoral clarification: insists on catechesis, covenantal nurture, and insistence that baptism does not guarantee salvific efficacy apart from faith and the Spirit.
 - Engagement with objections: addresses concerns about profession of faith, baptismal regeneration accusations, and ecclesial boundaries.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin, Westminster Standards, Bavinck, classic patristic writers; contemporary Baptist/credobaptist interlocutors and apologists. Biblical text exegesis is prioritized over purely historical or sociological arguments.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (primary), sacraments (baptism as sign & seal), ecclesiology (church membership, baptismal households), soteriology (faith, regeneration, assurance), typology (circumcision-baptism).
- **Closing line capturing theological gravity:** Infant baptism, rightly framed as the covenantal sign and seal, preserves ecclesial continuity and pastoral responsibility while insisting that baptism's promise is realized only through faith and the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong emphasis on a middle path: robust covenantal objectivity (church includes covenant children) paired with pastoral insistence that baptism does not replace conversion or personal faith.
 - Clear distinction between **inclusion** (legal/positional) and **efficacy** (saving reality), preventing confusion between sign and sacramental regeneration.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects caricatures of paedobaptism that claim baptism automatically effects regeneration.
 - Challenges credobaptist readings that isolate baptismal practice from covenantal and typological continuity with Israel.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses phrases such as **"covenantal inclusion without automatic regeneration"** and **"catechetical baptismal economy"** to capture pastoral framework.
 - Proposes treating household baptisms as evidence of covenant corporate practice rather than proof texts for universal credobaptism.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Received positively among Reformed pastors and teachers seeking pastoral clarity; used as a model of charitable polemics coupled with careful exegesis.
 - Criticized by hardline credobaptists as insufficiently attentive to conversion-required models; welcomed by covenant theologians as clarifying common misreadings.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable as a case study of theological change - integrates exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral theology.
 - Useful in seminary courses on sacraments, ecclesiology, and pastoral care for articulating a nuanced paedobaptist stance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Infant baptism (paedobaptism):** Baptism administered to covenant children as a sign/seal of the covenant; marks inclusion in the covenant community.
- **Believer's baptism (credobaptism):** Baptism administered upon an individual profession of faith; emphasized by Strawbridge as an important corrective but insufficient as sole normative practice.
- **Sign and seal:** Traditional formula: baptism signifies the promise of the covenant and seals the believer (or covenant child) in that promise.
- **Covenantal inclusion:** Legal/positional belonging to the covenant community applied to children of believers.
- **Efficacy (sacramental efficacy):** Distinguishes between the objective covenantal promise and the subjective reception of grace (faith/Spirit); baptism does not automatically effect regeneration.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology:** Argument that baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign in the new economy; used as a central exegetical hinge.
- **Household baptisms:** Acts narratives (households baptized) read as indicative of covenantal corporate practice rather than proof of universal credobaptism.
- **Baptismal regeneration (rejected form):** The view that baptism itself effects regeneration; Strawbridge rejects any simple identification of baptism with regeneration.
- **Catechetical baptismal economy:** Pastoral program linked to infant baptism: nurture, instruction, covenant accountability.
- **Ecclesial boundaries:** How baptism shapes membership, discipline, and pastoral care within the church.
- **Assurance and faith:** Emphasizes that baptism can be a means of assurance when coupled with faith and perseverance.
- **Typology and continuity:** Methodological commitment to continuity between Israel and church when interpreting baptismal practice.
- **Pastoral tone:** The essay models humility and prioritizes pastoral implications over polemical triumphalism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a measured, covenantal paedobaptist position that denies baptismal automatism.
- As a **polemic** against simplistic credobaptist proofs (household texts, exclusive profession criterion).
- As an **exegetical-pedagogical model** for teaching baptismal practice in seminaries and elder training, combining biblical, historical, and pastoral strands.
