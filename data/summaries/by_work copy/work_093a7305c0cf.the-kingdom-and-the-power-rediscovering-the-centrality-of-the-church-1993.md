### TITLE
The Kingdom and the Power: Rediscovering the Centrality of the Church - Peter J. Leithart (1993)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical-Reformed milieu; reaction to privatized pietism, revivalist ecclesiology, and a growing interest in liturgical and sacramental renewal.
 - Part of a broader recovery of classical Reformed catholicity and social-ecclesial theology among younger Reformed writers.

- **Central thesis**
 - The church is not an accessory to Christian life but the concrete locus of God's kingdom and redemptive power; ecclesiology must be primary, not peripheral.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern Protestantism has diminished the church by prioritizing individual conversion and private religion.
 - Reclamation: Scripture portrays the church as the visible, covenantal instrument of Christ's kingship - a public, corporate bearer of divine power.
 - Practical consequences: worship, sacraments, preaching, and prayer function as the means by which the kingdom is present and operative.
 - Ecclesial polity and liturgy are central to Christian identity and mission; the church embodies social and political aspects of Christ's rule.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed confessional tradition (Calvin, Westminster), patristic and medieval sacramental theology, and modern critics of ecclesial minimalism.
 - Implicitly dialogues with pietistic/evangelical emphases on the "invisible church" and with secular privatizing tendencies in modernity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (primary focus), covenant theology, sacraments (baptism, Eucharist), means of grace (preaching, prayer), Christology (kingship), and the relation of church and kingdom.
 - Secondary implications for polity, public theology, and soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - Leithart insists: the church is the tangible administration of Christ's kingdom - visible, sacramental, and constitutive of Christian life and social order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates the **visible church** and its institutions as the primary arena of God's saving activity rather than a mere sign of inward faith.
 - Recovers **means of grace** (preaching, sacraments, corporate prayer) as instruments of kingdom power, not mere symbols for private devotion.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against the **visible/invisible church** bifurcation common in Protestantism; insists on the normative reality of the visible, covenantal congregation.
 - Challenges individualistic soteriology and privatized spirituality typical of modern evangelicalism.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Treats **church = kingdom** more robustly: the church is not only a witness to the kingdom but its present manifestation and executor of divine authority.
 - Foreshadows elements later discussed in debates over **Federal Vision / monocovenantalism** by stressing corporate covenant identity and sacramental incorporation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among those seeking a high ecclesiology in Reformed circles; read sympathetically by advocates of liturgical renewal and sacramental recovery.
 - Contested by critics wary of conflating church and kingdom or of tendencies toward sacramentalism; later debates on Federal Vision sometimes cite Leithart's positions as precursory.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to reductionist ecclesiologies; enduring resource for teaching ecclesial centrality, sacramental theology, and public implications of Christ's kingship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom and Power**
 - Central motif: the church as the locus where Christ's kingly power is exercised in history.

- **Visible Church**
 - Emphasized as normative, corporate, and public; the institution through which covenant life is mediated.

- **Invisible Church**
 - Critiqued as an abstract corrective when used to privatize or demote visible ecclesial structures.

- **Means of Grace**
 - Preaching, sacraments, and prayer understood as effective instruments of God's kingdom presence.

 - Preaching: not only proclamation but performative, forming covenantal identity.
 - Prayer: corporate prayer as an exercise of ecclesial power and petition in the public assembly.

- **Sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist)**
 - High view of sacramental efficacy; sacraments incorporate believers into the covenant and the kingdom.

- **Covenant / Monocovenantalism**
 - Strong covenantal continuity; stresses corporate covenant identity that anticipates later debates labeled as monocovenantal tendencies.

- **Federal Vision**
 - Work is frequently cited as a theological antecedent to themes in the Federal Vision controversy (corporate election, sacramental efficacy), though not identical to that movement.

- **Church and Kingdom**
 - Terminological pivot: treating ecclesiology as the precise embodiment of the kingdom's presence and authority.

- **Liturgy and Office**
 - Liturgical practice and ordained ministry are central for mediating kingdom power and maintaining corporate identity.

- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: authoritative sketch for a high, public ecclesiology useful in systematic treatments.
 - Polemic: deployed against evangelical privatism and reductionist views of sacraments and ministry.
 - Exegetical model: used as a template for reading New Testament ecclesiology as corporate and kingdom-centered.
 - Conceptual pivot: serves as a bridge from Reformed confessionalism toward liturgical and sacramental renewal conversations.
