### TITLE
**The Holiness of God (1985) - R. C. Sproul**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1985 amid a late-20th-century evangelical resurgence in doctrinal recovery; emerges from Reformed apologetic milieu associated with Ligonier Ministries. Responds to sentimental and experiential trends that downplay divine transcendence and moral gravity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The defining attribute of God is holiness - His absolute moral otherness and separateness - and a right apprehension of that holiness exposes human depravity and drives sinners to Christ for substitutionary atonement and sanctifying grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of holiness as an attribute: ontological otherness, moral perfection, and consuming purity.
 - Biblical theophanies and liturgical responses (e.g., Isaiah 6, Revelation) illustrate human bewilderment and fear before divine holiness.
 - Consequence for humanity: holiness reveals sin, provokes divine wrath, and demonstrates total depravity and total inability to reconcile oneself to God.
 - Christ as the only answer: substitutionary atonement reconciles the holy God and sinful humanity; sanctification follows by grace.
 - Pastoral implications: worship must be reverent and doctrinally informed; contemporary Christianity needs recovery of fear and awe.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy reliance on Scripture (Old and New Testament theophanies); frequent appeal to classical Reformed voices (Calvinian emphases on divine majesty and sin); polemical contrast with liberal theology, moralistic therapeutic deism, and reductionist pietism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (holiness, wrath, glory, transcendence), revelation, imago Dei, sin (including **Total Depravity** and **Total Inability**), atonement (substitution), justification, sanctification, worship and fear of the Lord, providence and sovereignty.
- **Closing line:** Sproul roots the Christian life in an encounter with the overwhelming holiness of God, which simultaneously condemns human pride, exposes total inability, and compels trust in Christ's substitutionary work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Holiness as the organizing attribute: every other divine attribute is interpreted through God's holiness.
 - Strong pastoral insistence that proper doctrine must produce reverent fear - not mere cognitive assent or sentimental devotion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects pietistic and liberal tendencies that domesticate God into a benevolent friend; challenges evangelical cheap-grace narratives that minimize divine justice and wrath.
 - Reasserts a Calvinian balance: sovereign holiness does not negate Christ's compassion but grounds the necessity of substitutionary atonement.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not an innovation in doctrine so much as an accessible re-centering of holiness language for modern evangelical audiences; popularizes "fear of God" as a positive, formative spiritual posture.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in late-20th and early-21st-century Reformed and evangelical circles; used as a standard popular theological resource, frequently cited in preaching and adult education.
 - Prompted renewed interest in liturgical reverence and classical doctrinal catechesis among evangelicals.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, memorable synthesis linking doctrine and devotion; useful in seminarians' formation and in pastoral contexts to recover doctrine-driven worship and a sober anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holiness:** Central divine attribute; moral purity, otherness, and separateness from creation; the lens for reading all other attributes.
- **Transcendence:** God's "otherness" and distance; grounds human creatureliness and the need for revelation.
- **Immanence:** God's nearness exercised through mercy, covenant, and the incarnation - held in tension with transcendence.
- **Wrath of God:** A necessary aspect of holiness against sin; not arbitrary anger but just response to moral violation.
- **Grace:** Unmerited favor that reconciles sinners to a holy God; the only remedy for total inability.
- **Substitutionary Atonement:** Christ bears the penalty demanded by holiness; Sproul uses this as the theological pivot between divine justice and mercy.
- **Imago Dei:** Human dignity derived from being made in God's image, corrupted by sin yet the locus for redemption.
- **Total Depravity:** Human condition of pervasive sinfulness; holiness exposes the depth of corruption in mind, will, and affections.
 - Relation: Serves to demonstrate why human beings cannot approach God on their own and require divine initiative.
- **Total Inability:** The practical outcome of depravity - humans cannot effect their own salvation or true repentance apart from divine effectual grace.
- **Reverence / Fear of the Lord:** Moral and religious posture required by God's holiness; corrective to flippant or therapeutic religiosity.
- **Justification:** Declared righteous status by faith; made intelligible only in light of holiness and substitution.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive response to holiness by the Spirit; the lived out consequence of justification.
- **Theophany / Vision of God:** Scriptural episodes (Isaiah, Moses, John) that exemplify human reaction to holiness and function as exegetical models in the book.
- **Glory:** God's manifest presence; holiness is integral to the experience of divine glory.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for preaching and catechesis on "holiness" and related attributes.
 - As a **polemic** against sentimental or therapeutic forms of Christianity that minimize sin and divine justice.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting biblical theophanies and liturgical responses (e.g., Isaiah 6, Revelation).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrines of sin (Total Depravity/Total Inability) to atonement and the necessity of sovereign grace.
