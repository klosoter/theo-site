### TITLE
Israel and the Law in Romans 5-11: Interaction with the New Perspective (essay in Justification and Variegated Nomism, 2004) - Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early 21st-century debate between the traditional Protestant (Reformation) reading of Paul and the New Perspective on Paul (NPP). Published in a Festschrift/collected volume responding to E. P. Sanders and developments by James D. G. Dunn and N. T. Wright. Moo writes from a conservative Reformed-exegetical standpoint within academic Pauline studies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Moo examines how Romans 5-11 treats Israel and the Torah in light of NPP claims. He argues that while NPP rightly corrects some anachronistic readings, it underestimates Paul's continuity with earlier Jewish theology on law and covenant and misconstrues key Pauline categories (e.g., "works of the law," justification).
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Diagnostic: sets out NPP claims (covenantal nomism, works of the law as boundary markers, corporate/readjustment emphases). 
 - Exegesis: close reading of Romans 5-11 to show Paul's use of "law," "works," and OT quotations; attention to rhetorical flow from sin and death to justification and Israel's future. 
 - Critique: shows limits of NPP readings when applied to Romans 5-11 - especially on the nature of "works of law," the role of the law in revealing sin, and the forensic dimension of justification. 
 - Constructive: affirms some NPP insights (e.g., sociological contexts) but defends a Reformation-consistent soteriology that preserves imputed/forensic justification and divine faithfulness to Israel's covenant promises.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** 
 - Engages E. P. Sanders (covenantal nomism), James D. G. Dunn (variegated nomism; "works of law"), N. T. Wright (new perspective and covenant theology), and historical Protestant interpreters; draws on Paul's letters and extensive OT citation in Romans.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Covenant (national/corporate election), Law (Torah: function and limits), Justification (forensic vs. covenantal readings), Election and remnant theology, Eschatology (restoration of Israel), Christology insofar as justification and atonement ground Paul's claims.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Moo contends that Paul affirms God's faithfulness to Israel and the continuing theological significance of the law, while unequivocally maintaining that righteousness and covenant inclusion are by faith in Christ rather than by law-works - a balance that the NPP underestimates or misplaces in Romans 5-11.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Careful balance: gives NPP credit for sociological/covenantal corrections but insists on preserving forensic and individual aspects of Pauline justification evident in Romans 5-11. 
 - Emphasizes the law's revelatory/condemning function in Paul's argument (not reducible to boundary-marker function).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Challenges a strong NPP claim that "works of the law" primarily denote ethnic boundary markers; insists the phrase carries a broader ethical/merit dimension in Romans. 
 - Argues that NPP readings sometimes downplay Paul's use of the OT and his continuity with prior Jewish theological concerns about sin, covenant, and elect remnant.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - No radical new terms; rather, methodological insistence on the coexistence of **corporate/covenantal categories** with **forensic language** in Paul.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited by conservative and Reformed scholars as a careful exegetical rebuttal to stronger versions of the NPP. Used in subsequent debates to demonstrate limits of purely sociological readings of Paul.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Models disciplined engagement with NPP: combines detailed exegesis, engagement with primary NPP claims, and constructive theological synthesis-valuable for teachers addressing Romans, justification, and Israel's place in Paul.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenantal nomism:** Sanders' phrase describing first-century Judaism; Moo accepts corrective value but resists its monopolization of Paul's categories.
- **Works of the law (ergon nomou):** Central contested phrase; Moo argues it cannot be reduced to ethnic boundary markers alone and retains a merit/works dimension in Romans.
- **Law (Torah):** Treated as both covenantal marker and moral/revealing instrument whose function Paul critiques in light of Christ.
- **Justification:** Forensic/imputational element affirmed; not merely covenant-status reassignment but a declaration grounded in Christ's atoning work and received by faith.
- **Election / Remnant:** Paul's corporate election language and the concept of a faithful remnant are upheld; Israel's future restoration remains a corporate, divine act.
- **Boundary markers:** NPP term for circumcision, food laws, Sabbath - Moo allows significance but argues Paul treats more than mere boundary markers.
- **Variegated nomism:** Dunn's modification recognizing diversity in Judaism; Moo incorporates nuance but disputes downstream implications for Paul.
- **Forensic language:** Legal/declarative vocabulary in Paul that supports traditional soteriological readings.
- **Eschatological salvation of Israel:** The future, corporate restoration of Israel remains central in Romans 11; Moo underscores divine faithfulness.
- **OT proof-texting:** Moo defends Paul's use of the OT as theological argument, not mere rhetorical appropriation.
- **Sociological context:** Acknowledged as helpful background but insufficient to displace theological exegesis.
- **Faith (pistis):** Central means of receiving righteousness; maintains objective content (Christ's work) as well as relational trust.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5-11 that resists reductive sociological interpretations. 
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with NPP proponents, defending continuity with Reformation doctrines (esp. justification). 
- As a **definition source** clarifying contested terms (e.g., "works of the law") for classroom and research applications.
