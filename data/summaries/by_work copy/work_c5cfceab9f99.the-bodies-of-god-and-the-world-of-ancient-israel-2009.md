### TITLE
The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel (Benjamin D. Sommer, 2009)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2009 amid a resurgence of interest in the ancient Near Eastern background of Israelite religion and the "divine council" literature.
 - Interdisciplinary move: integrates philology, comparative religion (Ugaritic, Mesopotamian, Egyptian), and material/iconographic evidence against anachronistic readings influenced by later philosophical monotheism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Ancient Israelite religion, as reflected in the Hebrew Bible, contains evidence of *plural and embodied* divine figures (a plurality of divine beings and bodily manifestations of YHWH), and this plurality is intrinsic to Israel's early understanding of God rather than a later corruption.
 - This historical plurality complicates modern theological readings that smoothe Hebrew Bible data into later abstract, metaphysical monotheism (and has implications for discussions about OT bases for NT trinitarian language).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Reassess core lexical items and syntactic constructions (e.g., elohim, bene elohim, plural verbs/adjectives) without presupposing later theological categories.
 - Bring external Near Eastern texts and iconographic data to bear on how deities were pictured and conceptualized (statues, anthropomorphic depictions, divine councils).
 - Propose that Israelite religion allowed for a *plurality within the divine sphere* (multiple divine figures, divine intermediaries, and bodily theophanies) while maintaining a distinctive claim to YHWH's supremacy.
 - Explore hermeneutical implications for how later Jewish and Christian interpreters read these texts into monotheistic doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary sources: Hebrew Bible, Ugaritic corpora, Mesopotamian and Egyptian texts and images.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: mark S. Smith, Frank M. Cross, G. von Rad heirs, and contemporary proponents/critics of "divine council" models (e.g., Michael Heiser, Karel van der Toorn).
 - Engages both biblical philologists and historians of religion.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and theophany, angelology, divine plurality and unity, implications for the Trinity (indirectly), Christological and Trinitarian readings of OT theophanies, monotheism vs monolatry.

- **Closing line**
 - Sommer reframes Israelite monotheism as theologically and historically complex: the Hebrew Bible presents embodied and plural divine realities that require reinterpretation of how OT revelation can be read as antecedent material for later theological claims (including Trinitarian doctrine), without collapsing ancient plurality into either simple polytheism or later abstract monotheism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong and sustained focus on *corporeality* of deity in Israelite religion - not merely anthropomorphic language but theologies of embodied divine presence (statues, theophanic agents).
 - Treats *elohim* plurals and divine multiplicity as historically real phenomena within Israelite religion instead of later editorial residue or mere honorifics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that retroject Hellenistic philosophical monotheism or later rabbinic abstractions back into the Hebrew Bible.
 - Challenges minimalist readings that reduce "sons of God"/divine council imagery to purely metaphorical or rhetorical devices.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a working category of "plurality-within-the-divine" (multiple divine figures linked to one supreme YHWH).
 - Reorients the debate from abstract ontological monotheism to historical-theological practice: how ancient communities experienced and represented divine presence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in biblical studies on divine council and theophany; used by some as an OT warrant for theological discussions of plurality in God.
 - Provoked debate among theologians and historians: appreciated for evidential breadth, criticized by defenders of classical monotheism for potential theological overreach.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of interdisciplinary method (philology + iconography).
 - Provokes sustained, careful rethinking of how OT texts bear on later doctrinal formulations (Trinity, Christology, angelology).
 - Useful corrective against anachronistic readings in systematic theology and biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elohim**
 - Treated as historically plural in many contexts; Sommer argues for readings that allow concrete plurality rather than universally treating it as majestic singular.
- **El / Elah**
 - Comparative use with Ugaritic El to show shared semantic fields and possible conceptual inheritance.
- **Divine council**
 - Institutional plurality: YHWH presides over a council of divine beings (bene elohim); not identical to classical polytheism.
- **Bene elohim (sons of God)**
 - Interpreted as members of the divine sphere, not merely human courts or poetic figures.
- **Angel of YHWH (malakh YHWH)**
 - Read as an embodied theophanic agent, sometimes indistinguishable from YHWH in action/speech.
- **Theophany / embodiment**
 - Emphasis that divine self-revelation often occurs in bodily, visible form - statues, standing images, or embodied agents.
- **Anthropomorphism vs. corporeality**
 - Moves beyond metaphorical anthropomorphism to argue for corporeal conceptions of deity in practice and images.
- **Plurality-within-unity**
 - Conceptual phrase for Israel's combination of a supreme deity and attendant divine plurality.
- **Iconography / material evidence**
 - Uses images and cult objects as primary data for theological claims about embodied divine presence.
- **Monotheism / monolatry**
 - Reframes these categories historically: Israel's religion may be best described as monolatrous with internal plurality rather than philosophically monotheistic.
- **Implications for Trinity**
 - Sommer's work is used as an OT-historical resource in debates about whether the Hebrew Bible contains motifs that could be read as antecedent to later Trinitarian language - supportive for some, cautionary for others.
- **Hypostasis / personhood**
 - Not equated directly with later Trinitarian persons; instead offers a precedent for distinct divine manifestations/personae.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "divine plurality" and embodied theophanies in OT studies.
- As an **exegetical model** integrating philology with iconography for reading Hebrew Bible passages relevant to divine plurality.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological debates: supports arguments that the OT permits a plurality of divine manifestations, while being contested as a direct proof-text for classical Trinitarian doctrine.
