### TITLE
The Open Secret: A New Vision for Natural Theology - Alister E. McGrath

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the mid-1980s by Alister McGrath (an evangelical Anglican/Reformed-trained theologian) amid renewed interest in apologetics, theology-science dialogue, and reassessments of classical natural theology after Kant, Darwin, and Hume.
 - Part of a broader late-20th-century project to recover a modest, doctrinally-informed natural theology suitable for contemporary philosophy and science.

- **Central thesis**
 - Natural theology is possible but must be reframed: God is an "open secret" in creation-both hidden and manifest. Natural signs point to God only when read within the interpretive framework of Christian doctrine and historical revelation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical critique of classical natural theology and of radical critiques (Humean/skeptical and Kantian limits).
 - Positive proposal: a **theologically informed** natural theology that:
 - treats creation as revelatory but not self-sufficient;
 - places special revelation (Christ and Scripture) as decisive for interpreting natural signs;
 - embraces methodological humility and dialog with science and philosophy.
 - Practical apologetic implications: modest claims, invitational argumentation, and sensitivity to contemporary intellectual contexts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Aquinas and natural-law/natural-theology traditions; popular exemplars like Paley.
 - Critical moderns: Hume, Kant, Darwin and the general Enlightenment critique of metaphysical proofs.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: late-20th-century analytic and evangelical apologists and philosophers (engagement with epistemology and philosophy of science themes).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general vs special), creation as revelatory, providence, basic epistemology of theology.
 - Indirectly touches Christology and Trinity insofar as revelation culminates in Christ and shaped theological reading of nature.

- **Closing line**
 - Natural theology survives not as autonomous proof but as a humble, doctrine-shaped practice: nature can witness to God only when interpreted through the lens of the gospel - the "open secret" of divine self-disclosure.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Natural theology is not neutral: it is **theology-shaped**, not purely philosophical. The believer's doctrinal commitments enable the recognition of divine signs in nature.
 - Emphasizes **epistemic modesty**-natural theology yields pointers and plausibilities rather than airtight proofs.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters classical confidence in purely demonstrative proofs (Aquinas/Paley style) as overreaching.
 - Opposes strict fideism that denies any epistemic value to creation's testimony; offers a mediating position.
 - Rejects natural theology as merely apologetic rhetoric; insists on doctrinal integrity and theological humility.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"open secret"** functions as a compact theological concept: hiddenness and revelation cohere in creation.
 - Recasts natural theology as a **hermeneutical enterprise** (reading nature) rather than a branch of pure natural philosophy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in evangelical and Anglican circles for rehabilitating natural theology without capitulating to naïve evidentialism.
 - Cited across theology, apologetics, and theology-science discourse as a model for doctrinally rooted, modest apologetics.
 - Influential in curricula addressing faith-reason integration and in debates over the scope of natural knowledge of God.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological template: integrate doctrine, respect scientific findings, and present apologetics with intellectual humility.
 - Useful corrective to both triumphalist apologetics and skeptical dismissals of general revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open secret** - the core metaphor: God is both revealed and hidden in creation; nature discloses God but never exhaustively.
- **Natural theology** - study of what can be known about God from creation; redefined as doctrine-informed and interpretive.
- **General revelation** - God's disclosure in nature and providence; meaningful only when interpreted theologically.
- **Special revelation** - Christ and Scripture as decisive for rightly interpreting natural signs.
- **Epistemic modesty** - the stance that natural theology produces plausibilities, not conclusive demonstrations.
- **Hermeneutics of nature** - reading creation theologically; an interpretive model rather than straightforward observation.
- **Theological realism / critical realism** - commitment that creation genuinely corresponds to divine reality, but knowledge is mediated and fallible.
- **Anti-fideism** - rejection of the view that faith is entirely divorced from or inimical to reason; advocates constructive interplay.
- **Anti-triumphalist apologetics** - apologetic posture that avoids overstated claims and respects objections and alternative frameworks.
- **Doctrine-shaped apologetics** - the claim that theology (e.g., Christology, Trinity) frames and grounds interpretive moves in natural theology.
- **Design argument (reappraised)** - treated with caution: useful as a pointer but insufficient as standalone proof in modern scientific contexts.
- **Hiddenness problem (reinterpreted)** - divine hiddenness is part of the "open secret" dynamic, not merely an intellectual obstacle.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a moderate, doctrinal natural theology in systematic theology and apologetics texts.
 - As a **polemic** against both classical evidentialist natural theology and against radical fideism.
 - As a **methodological model** in theology-science coursework-integrating scientific findings with theological reading of nature.
