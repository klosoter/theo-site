### TITLE
**Images of the Spirit** - Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-20th-century Reformed biblical theology; Kline at the intersection of Westminster-Vosian redemptive-historical exegesis and Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) backgrounds.
 - Engages debates on the Holy Spirit's person and operations, the imago Dei, the legitimacy of images, and typology as a mode of biblical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible's God-given, theophanic manifestations of the Spirit (the Glory-cloud, fire, wind, overshadowing) function as archetypal "images" by which God reveals himself, structures covenant history, and patterns humanity's imaging vocation and eschatological destiny.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - The Glory-Spirit in creation: Gen 1:2's hovering Spirit as archetypal theophany that orders and consecrates the cosmos.
 - Image of God and glory: Humanity created as derivative image, with a destiny of Glory-investiture; Adam as priest-king in probation toward eschatological Sabbath-consummation.
 - Theophany in covenant history: The cloud-fire presence structures exodus, Sinai, tabernacle/temple, holy war, and prophetic visions; sacramental and judicial signs image the Spirit's judgment and life.
 - Christological climax: Christ as the definitive Image, Spirit-anointed Son, bearer of the Glory-cloud (baptism, transfiguration), and inaugurator of new-creation investiture.
 - Ecclesial and eschatological extension: The church as temple indwelt by the Spirit; present down payment and future glorification as full donning of the Glory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Vosian biblical theology; classic Reformed dogmatics (e.g., Bavinck). Dialogue with ANE studies on royal ideology and theophany; critical engagement with history-of-religions and demythologizing approaches that reduce ruach to impersonal force.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology:** Theophany and inspiration as Spirit's modalities; Scripture as canonically shaped by redemptive-historical theophany.
 - **Anthropology/Creation:** Imago Dei, cultural mandate, priest-king vocation, Sabbath teleology.
 - **Covenant theology:** Archetype-ectype pattern; probation, sanction, and sacramental imaging.
 - **Christology:** Jesus as Image/Glory-bearer; Spirit-Christology.
 - **Pneumatology:** Person and work of the Spirit in creation, redemption, judgment, and consummation.
 - **Eschatology:** Glory-consummation, Sabbath rest, temple-city fulfillment.
- **Closing line**
 - The Spirit's theophanic Glory is the archetype of God's presence, the pattern for human imaging, and the telos of creation realized in Christ and consummated in the Spirit-indwelt people of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Glory-Spirit** as the central theophanic reality; cloud-fire as canonical key.
 - **Image as vocation toward Glory**, not merely static ontology; investiture awaiting eschatological clothing.
 - **Typology anchored in theophany:** creation-to-consummation unity governed by Spirit-formed patterns.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters iconodulism by distinguishing God-forbidden man-made images from God-given theophanic images.
 - Rejects reduction of ruach to an impersonal force; affirms personal, covenantal agency of the Spirit.
 - Nuances imago Dei beyond rationalist or dominion-only readings; centers priest-king-Prophet vocation and glory-destiny.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Glory-Spirit; theophanic Glory; archetype/ectype applied to image and temple.
 - Glory-garb/investiture and Sabbath-consummation as eschatological categories.
 - Intrusion of eschatological judgment and life into history through Spirit-ordained signs.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant within Reformed biblical theology (Westminster/Vosian stream); informs temple/new-creation scholarship and Spirit-Christology.
 - Cited for covenantal typology, theophany, and the imago Dei-eschatology nexus; influences preaching and liturgical theology of presence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a coherent, canonical grammar for the Spirit's work across creation-redemption-consummation.
 - Serves as a bridge between exegesis and dogmatics, shaping loci in anthropology, Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Glory-Spirit**: The personal, theophanic presence of the Spirit in cloud-fire, archetypal for revelation and redemption.
- **Theophanic Glory (cloud-fire)**: Visible manifestations (Exodus, temple, transfiguration) structuring covenantal events.
- **Hovering Spirit (Gen 1:2)**: Creative consecration; prototype for overshadowing motifs in tabernacle and incarnation.
- **Archetype/Ectype**: God's own Glory as archetype; human and cultic images as ectypal reflections under covenant.
- **Imago Dei as glory-vocation**: Humanity made for priest-king service and destined for eschatological investiture.
- **Glory-garb/Investiture**: Radiant clothing motif (Adam, priesthood, Christ, saints) signifying Spirit-conferred authority and life.
- **Temple-mountain**: Sacred space where Glory dwells; from Eden to Zion to the church to the eschatological city.
- **Sabbath-consummation**: Eschatological rest/sign; creation's telos under the Spirit's presence.
- **Judgment by water and fire**: Flood, exodus, prophetic day of the Lord; sacramental and eschatological images of the Spirit's judicial activity.
- **Spirit-Christology**: Christ as anointed Image and bearer of the Glory, fulfilling and surpassing all theophanies.
- **Typology (redemptive-historical)**: Spirit-governed patterns linking creation, exodus, temple, Messiah, church, and new creation.
- **Covenant sanctions/signs**: Spirit-imaged blessings and curses; sacraments as Spirit-sealed signs of judgment and life.
- **Presence-ethics (intrusion)**: Holy presence brings proleptic eschatological standards into history.
- **Anti-idolatry paradigm**: Only God-instituted images (theophanies, sacraments) mediate presence; forbids fabricated representations.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition source for theophany, Glory, and Spirit's role in revelation (Bibliology).
 - As an exegetical model for temple, Sabbath, and image themes (Anthropology, Ecclesiology).
 - As a conceptual pivot for eschatology (glory-investiture, Sabbath telos) and soteriology (Spirit-wrought union and glorification).
 - As a polemical resource against iconodulism and impersonal views of the Spirit (Doctrine of God/Sin).
