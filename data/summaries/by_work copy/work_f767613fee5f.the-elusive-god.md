### TITLE
The Elusive God - Paul K. Moser

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century analytic philosophy of religion; interaction with anglophone epistemology and contemporary debates over religious epistemic warrant. Written against the backdrop of debates involving evidentialism, Reformed epistemology (Plantinga), and responses to the problem of divine hiddenness.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God is characteristically *elusive* in ordinary epistemic terms; therefore traditional epistemologies that treat religious belief as on a parity with empirical propositions misdescribe religious knowing. Moser urges a reorientation of religious epistemology toward modes of personal, relational, and practice‑grounded knowing.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: standard evidentialist and probabilistic strategies (e.g., Humean skepticism, Swinburnean probability methods) mislocate the primary epistemic issues concerning God.
 - Critique of rivals: challenges both strict evidentialism and the caricature of Reformed epistemology that reduces warrant to prima facie properly basic belief without relational content.
 - Positive proposal: advocates an epistemology that
 - privileges *relational acquaintance* and perceptual-like access to God over purely propositional accumulation of evidences;
 - recognizes the role of practices, dispositions, and moral/ existential formation in attaining religious knowledge;
 - accommodates divine hiddenness as a meaningful part of God's self‑disclosure rather than mere failure of evidence.
 - Implications: affects how one reads scripture, perceives revelation, and grounds rational confidence in theism and Christian claims.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne, Humean sceptics, and contemporary philosophers of religion concerned with hiddenness and warrant; also draws on religious thinkers who emphasize praxis and existential encounter (Kierkegaardian resonances).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (nature and modes), epistemology of religious belief, divine hiddenness, occasional discussion of Christology and incarnation as loci where God's elusiveness and disclosure intersect.
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically and philosophically, Moser relocates the problem of God's knowability: God's elusiveness calls for an epistemology anchored in personal encounter, communal practice, and embodied receptivity rather than in detached evidential proof.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats divine hiddenness not primarily as an objection to belief but as a normative feature of how God often chooses to be known - thereby reframing apologetic priorities.
 - Strong focus on *relational* and *practical* epistemic sources (acquaintance, worship, prayer, moral responsiveness) rather than on aggregated evidences.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against strict evidentialists: rejects the assumption that religious claims must be treated like empirical hypotheses to be adjudicated by the same evidential standards.
 - Against simplistic readings of Reformed epistemology: insists that "properly basic" does not mean context‑free or nonnormative; the formation of basic beliefs is shaped by practices and relations.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The central phrase "elusive God" functions as both diagnosis and methodological guide: elusiveness indexes the type of epistemic response required (habilitative practices, receptivity).
 - Emphasis on a practical epistemology of *acquaintance* as distinct from propositional justification.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among philosophers of religion concerned with divine hiddenness and epistemic humility; sympathetic reception from those wanting to integrate existential and analytic approaches.
 - Less adopted in systematic theology that remains committed to classical apologetic structures, though increasingly cited in pastoral and practical-theological conversations about faith formation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative reorientation that helps theologians and apologists take seriously the formative contexts of belief and the limits of purely evidential argumentation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elusive God**
 - Central motif: God's self‑presentation resists simplistic capture by propositional evidence; invites relational knowing.
- **Reorienting religious epistemology**
 - The programmatic call to shift epistemic focus from detached evidence to practices and encounters.
- **Relational acquaintance**
 - Knowledge that resembles perceptual or personal acquaintance rather than mere belief in a set of propositions.
- **Divine hiddenness**
 - Reinterpreted as a constitutive feature of divine‑human epistemic relations, not merely an objection to theism.
- **Evidentialism (critique)**
 - Targeted for overextending empirical standards to religious claims.
- **Reformed epistemology (engagement)**
 - Recognized but revised: Moser accepts some of Plantinga's insights while arguing for richer practice‑centered warrant.
- **Practices and dispositions**
 - Worship, prayer, moral formation, and communal life as epistemic means.
- **Epistemic humility**
 - A virtue recommended in response to God's elusiveness and the limits of human epistemic instruments.
- **Personal vs. propositional knowledge**
 - Contrast between knowing God personally and merely assenting to doctrines about God.
- **Incarnational access**
 - Suggestion that Christology and incarnation provide distinctive loci where divine elusiveness and disclosure intersect.
- **Warrant (broadened)**
 - Warrant includes reliable practices and transformative experiences, not just evidential credentials.
- **Apologetic implication**
 - Advocates pastoral apologetics that cultivate conditions for acquaintance rather than only presenting arguments.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for "elusiveness" and practice‑based epistemology in philosophy of religion.
 - As a **polemic** against strict evidentialist apologetics and simplistic natural theology.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for correlating spiritual formation with epistemic access to God.
