### TITLE
Theological Anthropology: A Guide for the Perplexed - Marc Cortez

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century, within contemporary Reformed and evangelical theology; aimed at seminarians and advanced students as part of the "Guide for the Perplexed" pedagogical series.
 - Responds to pressures from analytic philosophy of mind, cognitive science, feminist and liberation critiques, and renewed Trinitarian and ecclesial theologies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To provide a systematic, biblically rooted account of what it means to be human that resists reductionist naturalism and individualistic liberalism by locating human identity in creation as Imago Dei, disrupted by sin, and ultimately restored in union with Christ within covenantal, ecclesial, and eschatological horizons.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Biblical and historical foundations - reading Genesis, Pauline anthropology, patristic and reformational traditions on the Imago Dei and body-soul questions.
 - Part II: Diagnostics - critiques of contemporary alternatives (Cartesian dualism, reductive naturalism, secular individualism) and articulation of sin, concupiscence, and original sin in a modern idiom.
 - Part III: Redemption and telos - centrality of Christ and union with Christ, sanctification, vocation, and eschatological restoration of human persons and the image of God.
 - Integrative moves: roots human personhood theologically (Trinitarian and covenantal), affirms embodied sociality, and reads moral life and vocation as participation in covenantal covenantal/eschatological reality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural corpus (Genesis, Pauline corpus, eschatological texts).
 - Historical interlocutors: Augustine, Calvin, Jonathan Edwards; also significant engagement with Barth and contemporary Reformed theologians.
 - Contemporary conversation partners: N. T. Wright, Oliver O'Donovan, Stanley Hauerwas, feminist theologians, analytic philosophers of mind, cognitive science literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (as resource for social-relational anthropology), creation (Imago Dei), fall and original sin, Christology (union with Christ), soteriology (regeneration, sanctification), ecclesiology (anthropology as ecclesial), eschatology (restoration, resurrection), vocation and ethics, embodiment and gender questions.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Human identity is best understood theologically as embodied, relational persons created in the Imago Dei, distorted by sin, and finally restored to communal flourishing through union with Christ within the covenantal and eschatological life of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **union with Christ** as the organizing principle of theological anthropology - not merely juridical justification but constitutive of renewed personhood.
 - Integrates **Trinitarian relationality** and **covenantal sociality** to resist atomistic individualism; persons are primarily social and ecclesial beings.
 - Emphasis on **embodiment and resurrection** over platonic dualism; bodily continuity is central to eschatological hope.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects classical Reformed tendencies toward abstracted individualism by emphasizing ecclesial formation and community as constitutive.
 - Opposes reductive naturalistic accounts (neuroscience-only explanations) and Cartesian bifurcation of mind/body.
 - Dialogues critically with feminist and liberation critiques, attempting to incorporate concerns about justice and relationality while preserving doctrinal categories.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes Imago Dei language toward **relational-functional** and **eschatological-restorative** dimensions rather than exclusively ontological predicates.
 - Uses "unional-constitutive" language to describe how Christ's person and work shape redeemed human identity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Reformed and evangelical seminary settings as a concise, accessible synthesis.
 - Cited in debates over bioethics, sexual ethics, and church formation; used as a bridge between historical doctrine and contemporary challenges.
- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically strong: clear synthesis for courses in anthropology.
 - Hermeneutical utility: models how to read Genesis, Paul, and patristic resources together with modern critiques.
 - Keeps theological anthropology tethered to worship, church life, and eschatological hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - central category; read as relational-functional and eschatological, bearing both dignity and vocation.
 - Distinguishes **image** (created status) from **likeness** (restored, Christ-shaped state).
- **Union with Christ** - constitutive principle for redeemed human identity and formation.
- **Embodiment / bodily continuity** - rejection of Platonic dualism; bodily resurrection is telos of personhood.
- **Original sin / fall** - affirms inherited corruption that affects structures and desires, not merely isolated acts.
- **Covenantal sociality** - human personhood framed within covenantal relationships and ecclesial participation.
- **Trinitarian relationality** - God's triune life as theological ground for human sociality and relational ontology.
- **Eschatological telos** - anthropology oriented to consummation: restored image, communal worship, new creation.
- **Grace / sanctification** - cooperative but grounded in Christ's decisive work; formation is church-centered.
- **Vocation** - ethical outworking of restored image in cultural, familial, and ecclesial practices.
- **Body-soul unity** - rejects substance dualism; affirms psychosomatic unity historically and theologically.
- **Social ontology** - persons defined by intersubjective, ecclesial relations rather than autonomous atomism.
- **Moral anthropology** - desires, faculties, and moral responsibility interpreted within fallredemption-teleology.
- **Gender and embodiment** - treats gender within creation order and redeemed vocation while engaging contemporary critiques.
- **Creation-order vs. cultural contingency** - discerns normative goods rooted in creation while acknowledging cultural contingency and sin's distortion.
- **Resurrection** - climactic doctrine for anthropology; secures continuity and transformation of embodied personhood.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed anthropology courses and introductory syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist naturalism and liberal individualism in ethics and bioethics debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Genesis and Pauline anthropology in pastoral theology and preaching.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions linking Trinitarian theology, ecclesiology, and practical vocation.
