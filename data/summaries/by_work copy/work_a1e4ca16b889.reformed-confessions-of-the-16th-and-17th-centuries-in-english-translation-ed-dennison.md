### TITLE
**Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation** (ed. Dennison) - Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession (1561), Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Canons of Dort (1619)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-late 16th to early 17th c. Reformed consolidation under persecution and polemic: Low Countries (Belgic), Palatinate (Heidelberg), Dutch Republic after the Remonstrant controversy (Dort).
 - Milieu: magisterial Reformation, post-Tridentine Catholic polemics, disputes with Anabaptists, Lutherans, and later Socinians; maturation of Reformed orthodoxy and ecclesial identity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To confess a catholic, biblical Trinitarian and Christocentric faith, articulate grace-alone soteriology, and define the church's marks and means under Scripture's supremacy.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Belgic Confession**: 37 articles; Scripture and revelation (arts. 2-7), God and Trinity (8-11), creation/providence (12-13), anthropology and sin (14-15), Christology and atonement (18-21), justification/sanctification (22-24), church and sacraments incl. marks and discipline (27-35), eschatology (37).
 - **Heidelberg Catechism**: Q/A framed by Guilt, Grace, Gratitude; pastoral Christology, justification by faith, Spirit-wrought union, Decalogue and Lord's Prayer for sanctification.
 - **Canons of Dort**: Five Heads of Doctrine addressing Remonstrants: election/reprobation, atonement's intent, total depravity, effectual calling/regeneration, perseverance; with rejections of errors.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Continuity with ecumenical creeds (Apostles, Nicene, Athanasian); Augustinian soteriology; Calvin, Bucer, Beza in background.
 - Interlocutors: Rome (Trent), Anabaptists (church, sacraments, magistrate), Lutherans (Supper, Christ's presence), Remonstrants (synergism), Socinians (anti-Trinitarian, anti-satisfaction).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology**: sufficiency, clarity, authority, canon; distinction from apocrypha.
 - **Theology proper/Trinity**: one essence, three persons; divine simplicity, immutability.
 - **Christology**: true God and true man, two natures unconfused, ascension and heavenly session, priestly satisfaction and imputed righteousness.
 - **Pneumatology**: effectual calling, regeneration, faith, assurance, sanctification; Spirit's use of means.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: marks of the church, discipline, two sacraments, spiritual presence in Supper, infant baptism.
 - **Anthropology/hamartiology**: original sin, total inability, need for grace.
 - **Eschatology**: intermediate hope, final judgment, bodily resurrection, rejection of chiliasm.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: the triune God glorifies Himself by uniting sinners to Christ through the Spirit by the Word and sacraments, forming a disciplined, confessing church that perseveres in hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Heidelberg's warm pastoral idiom of comfort and assurance; Guilt-Grace-Gratitude as pedagogical arc.
 - Belgic's clear articulation of Scripture's attributes and the marks of the true church.
 - Dort's precise account of effectual grace and perseverance within a pastoral frame.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Rome: sola Scriptura, once-for-all sacrifice vs. Mass, justification by faith alone.
 - Against Lutherans: rejection of bodily ubiquity; affirm spiritual real presence.
 - Against Anabaptists: legitimacy of magistrate, oaths, infant baptism, visible church order.
 - Against Remonstrants: unconditional election, particular redemption's intent, irresistible grace, certain perseverance.
 - Against Socinians: full deity of Son and Spirit, satisfaction and substitution.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Marks of the church; means of grace; comfort as soteriological frame; internal vs. external call; law/gospel pedagogy; church discipline as a mark.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Normative in Continental Reformed churches; catechetical and liturgical use; shaped federal and pastoral theology; heavily cited in ecumenical dialogues and confessional standards.
- **Enduring value**
 - Doctrinal clarity with pastoral warmth; integrative scope from Scripture to eschatology; stable reference for preaching, catechesis, and polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture's sufficiency, clarity, and final authority; apocrypha distinguished.
- **Marks of the Church**: pure preaching, right sacraments, discipline; provides ecclesial discernment.
- **Means of Grace**: Word and sacraments as Spirit's instruments for faith and growth.
- **Triune God**: one essence, three persons; anti-Socinian guardrails; worship regulated by revelation.
- **Two Natures of Christ**: true God and true man in one person; ascended bodily presence in heaven.
- **Satisfaction and Imputation**: Christ's priestly work counted to believers; basis of justification.
- **Law and Gospel**: law exposes guilt and guides gratitude; gospel promises Christ.
- **Effectual Calling/Regeneration**: Spirit renews will, grants faith; distinguishes internal from external call.
- **Election and Reprobation**: unconditional election; sober, pastoral handling of reprobation.
- **Particular Redemption**: atonement's intent for the elect; infinite worth, definite efficacy.
- **Perseverance of the Saints**: God preserves; believers persevere through means.
- **Providence**: all things governed by God for the church's good.
- **Sacraments**: baptism as covenant sign (incl. infants); Supper as spiritual feeding, not re-sacrifice.
- **Assurance**: grounded in promise, Spirit's witness, and fruit; not presumption.
- **Last Judgment and Hope**: bodily resurrection, vindication, rejection of chiliasm.

- **How this work is used**
 - Doctrinal baseline across loci: definitions for Trinity, Christology, Scripture, church, sacraments.
 - Polemical touchstone against Roman, Lutheran, Remonstrant, and Socinian positions.
 - Exegetical-catechetical model: Heidelberg's Q/A shapes teaching and preaching.
 - Conceptual pivot for soteriology: Dort frames grace, faith, and perseverance within covenantal church life.
