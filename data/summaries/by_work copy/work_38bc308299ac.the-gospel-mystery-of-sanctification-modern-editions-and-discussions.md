### TITLE
The Gospel Mystery of Sanctification - Walter Marshall (English Puritan; treatise published posthumously, late 17th century; widely reprinted in modern Reformed editions)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the English Puritan milieu of the 17th century and published posthumously; addresses pastoral concerns in a context shaped by Reformed orthodoxy, experiential piety, and disputes over law, grace, and holiness.
 - Modern interest renewed by Reformed publishers and pastors seeking a corrective to both legalism and antinomian distortions of the Christian life.
- **Central thesis**
 - True sanctification is a gracious, gospel-produced work of God received by faith through union with Christ; believers grow in holiness not chiefly by self-exertion but by trusting the promises and power of Christ applied by the Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Diagnose errors: the book identifies and rejects two principal distortions - seeking holiness by legalistic self-effort and misconstruing the gospel as license (antinomianism).
 - Theological foundation: sanctification grounded in justification, imputation, and mystical union with Christ - what Christ has done and gives is the believer's spring of holiness.
 - Means and instrumentality: faith (as instrument), the Spirit, the Word, and the promises are the channels by which sanctification is applied.
 - Practical application: instruction in mortification and vivification, assurance, and pastoral counsel for living out gospel holiness amid sin and weakness.
 - Pastoral tone: sustained attention to experiential realities; Marshall aims to change how believers aim at holiness (look to Christ) rather than how they strive.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Operates within the broader Puritan/Reformed conversation (consonant with Owenian emphases on mortification and union with Christ) though primarily pastoral and corrective rather than polemical against a named opponent.
 - Modern interlocutors include Reformed pastors and sanctification theorists who cite Marshall for gospel-centered praxis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification, justification, union with Christ, imputation, the Spirit, law and gospel, promise theology, mortification/vivification, assurance, means of grace.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: sanctification is primarily the gospel's work received by faith - believers become holy because Christ's life, death, and righteousness are divinely applied to them, and faith is the instrument that rests on God's promise.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Gospel as means of sanctification** - Marshall insists the gospel itself (not merely commands or moral exhortation) is the primary instrument of holiness.
 - **Faith as receiving, not producing, sanctification** - faith is portrayed as the hand that lays hold of Christ's sanctifying benefits rather than as human effort that generates holiness.
 - **Interplay of passivity and activity** - believers are passive in relation to receiving grace (dependent on Christ) yet active insofar as faith produces fruit; this nuance helps avoid both quietism and self-reliance.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects legalism by denying that sanctification is earned by stricter obedience or inward resolutions.
 - Counters antinomian misunderstandings by insisting that true faith necessarily issues in mortification, obedience, and progressive holiness.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasizes **promise theology**: believers live by the promise of God applied in Christ; this framing reorients pastoral exhortation from duty-centered to promise-centered.
 - Stresses **experiential appropriation** of justification as the spring of sanctification (not merely its forensic status).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within later Reformed and evangelical circles as a corrective pastoral classic; often reprinted by conservative Reformed publishers and used in pastoral training and spiritual formation.
 - Cited by those seeking a robustly gospel-centered alternative to both moralism and laxity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, theologically coherent, and pastorally rich account of how justification and sanctification interrelate; ideal for pastors, spiritual directors, and students wrestling with lived holiness and assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive work of being made holy; for Marshall, rooted in and sustained by union with Christ and received by faith.
- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration that grounds the believer's standing; Marshall ties justification forensic imputation to the believer's sanctifying life.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological and covenantal ground of all spiritual life and holiness; Christ's life communicates to believers.
- **Faith (as instrument)**
 - The hand that receives Christ's benefits; not a work that produces righteousness but the means by which righteousness and sanctifying grace are applied.
- **Mortification**
 - The putting to death of sin; described as fruit of appropriation of Christ rather than merely moral resolve.
- **Vivification**
 - The impartation of new life by the Spirit; complementary to mortification and rooted in Christ's life.
- **Imputation**
 - Transference of Christ's righteousness and obedience to believers; used to secure both justification and the believer's ability to pursue holiness.
- **Promise theology**
 - Emphasis on God's promises in the gospel as the believer's ground for hope, sanctification, and perseverance.
- **Means of grace**
 - Word, sacraments, Spirit, and faith as channels of sanctifying power - Marshall privileges the gospel-message as primary.
- **Law and Spirit**
 - Law viewed as rule and accuser; the Spirit as the enabler of obedience. Marshall navigates their relationship to avoid legalism.
- **Assurance**
 - Experimental confidence that flows from appropriation of Christ's righteousness and observable fruit of sanctification.
- **Pastoral theology / experience**
 - Marshall's method integrates doctrinal precision with counsel for the believer's inner life.
- **Promise vs. Performance**
 - Key contrast: resting on promise (faith) vs. depending on performance (self-effort).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for gospel-centered sanctification in Reformed pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic** resource against both legalism and antinomianism - a model for balanced reformulation.
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for teaching mortification and vivification rooted in union with Christ.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates about the role of justification language in sanctification and assurance.
