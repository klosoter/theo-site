### TITLE
Imputation: Christ's Active Obedience as the Ground of Justification - Alan D. Strange

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed context; part of late 20th-early 21st century debates over justification.
 - Responds to trends that minimize or deny the imputation of Christ's active obedience (including strands of the New Perspective on Paul, impartation-only models, and some revisionist proposals arising from the Federal Vision debates).
 - Aimed at pastors, seminarians, and systematic theologians defending classical Reformed soteriology.

- **Central thesis**
 - The imputation of Christ's **active obedience** (his perfect law-keeping life) to believers is a necessary and distinct ground of justification alongside the imputation of his passive obedience (suffered penal death). Forgiveness alone cannot account for the positive righteousness required in the divine declaration of righteous status.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical-exegetical core: close reading of Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, 2 Corinthians, Philippians) and forensic language to show the necessity of Christ's obedience being counted to believers.
 - Theological-historical core: retrieval of the classical Reformed formulation (covenant theology, federal headship, double imputation) from Calvin through later orthodox and modern Reformed writers.
 - Systematic synthesis: shows how covenant of works/merit and covenant of grace frameworks explain how Christ's obedience fulfills law-claims and is legally credited to believers.
 - Polemical moves: critiques of views that equate justification with pardon, or that restrict imputation to forgiveness of sins only, arguing these undermine the legal/forensic nature of justification and the believer's positive standing before God.
 - Pastoral implications: defends assurance, gospel preaching, and the distinction between justification (declarative, forensic) and sanctification (transformative, participatory).

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Appeals to classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, Turretin, Owen, Murray) and engages contemporary critics of forensic imputation and proponents of impartation or covenantal redefinitions.
 - Uses standard Pauline and Reformation-era exegesis as primary warrant; dialogues with New Perspective and Federal Vision critiques without limiting engagement to specific personalities.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic, declarative), atonement (active vs passive obedience), imputation (double imputation), covenant theology (works/grace), Christology (representative/mediatorial obedience), union with Christ, law and righteousness, sanctification vs justification.

- **Closing line**
 - Strange positions the imputation of Christ's active obedience as indispensable: to justify is not merely to remit guilt but to credit Christ's righteousness to sinners so they may be declared righteous before God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes the positive, legal crediting of Christ's law-fulfilling obedience as constitutive of justification, not auxiliary or merely illustrative.
 - Careful boundary-drawing between justification (forensic accounting) and sanctification (moral transformation), resisting conflations that blur declarative status.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters views that reduce justification to pardon or to an imparted righteousness alone; argues these undermine forensic language in Scripture and classical covenantal anthropology.
 - Corrects some modern readings that either collapse active and passive obedience into one category or deny the need for active obedience to be imputed.

- **Conceptual/terminological notes**
 - Reaffirms and polishes the language of **double imputation** and **active/passive obedience** while insisting on precise legal language (credit/charge, merit/fulfillment).
 - Rejects vague uses of "righteousness of God" that avoid forensic accounting.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted and cited in conservative Reformed teaching and preaching; used as a clarifying resource in seminaries defending classical doctrines of justification.
 - Functions as a reference point in polemics against New Perspective and Federal Vision tendencies; less persuasive to revisionist camps but respected for exegetical care.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a concise, systematic defense of a central Reformed claim; exemplary in combining exegetical argument with covenantal-historical theology; valuable for classroom and pulpit formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's lifelong perfect fulfillment of the law; credited to believers as positive righteousness.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and penal death to remove guilt; grounds for forgiveness.
- **Imputation**
 - Legal accounting: Christ's obedience credited to believers; believers' sins credited to Christ.
- **Double imputation**
 - The paired exchange: our sins imputed to Christ; Christ's obedience imputed to us.
- **Forensic/forensic justification**
 - Justification as a legal declaration of righteousness by God, not intrinsic moral perfection.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace**
 - Framework explaining law-claims and Christ's representational fulfillment on behalf of believers.
- **Representative (federal) headship**
 - Christ as covenantal representative whose acts are legally counted for his people.
- **Righteousness (alien/positional)**
 - Positional righteousness that is credited, distinct from inherent sanctifying righteousness.
- **Merit**
 - The concept that Christ's obedience has worth before God and is applied to sinners; handled carefully to avoid semi-Pelagian connotations.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The relational ground for imputation; believers share legally in Christ's status by union.
- **Pardon / forgiveness**
 - Removal of penal guilt (passive obedience); insufficient by itself for the declaration of positive righteousness.
- **Sanctification vs justification**
 - Sanctification: participatory moral growth; justification: declarative status change.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for **imputation** in Reformed systematic theology and textbooks.
 - As a polemical resource against **impartation-only** or non-forensic models of justification (including New Perspective/Federal Vision variants).
 - As an exegetical model for interpreting Pauline **justification texts** and for teaching the covenantal logic of Christ's representative obedience.
