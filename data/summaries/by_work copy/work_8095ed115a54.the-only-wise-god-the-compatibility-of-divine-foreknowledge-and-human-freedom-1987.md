### TITLE
The Only Wise God: The Compatibility of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom (William Lane Craig, 1987)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic-evangelical theology (1987). Part of a broader revival of interest in Molinism within Anglo-American philosophy of religion; responds to deterministic readings of providence and to earlier Thomist and Reformed accounts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defends the compatibility of **divine exhaustive foreknowledge** with **libertarian human freedom** by means of Molinist middle knowledge (knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of a threefold order of divine knowledge: natural (what God could know), middle (what free creatures would do in any hypothetical situation), and free (what God actually knows after decreeing a world).
 - Argues that God's middle knowledge (knowledge of counterfactuals of freedom) is **non-causal** and yet sufficient for God to actualize a world where free creatures make particular choices without God determining those choices.
 - Uses the notion of a **transworld divine decree**: God selects/creates one feasible world out of many based on middle knowledge, thereby ordering providence while preserving libertarian responsibility.
 - Applies the model to the **problem of evil**: God's middle knowledge enables Him to create the best or morally optimal world given free creaturely choices, thus providing resources for a theodicy without making God the moral author of evil.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on and rehabilitates **Luis de Molina** (middle knowledge), interacts with Thomist and Reformed accounts of providence, and engages contemporary analytic critics (compatibilists, open-theists, and later reactions like the grounding objection).
 - Uses possible-worlds semantics and classical metaphysical categories common to analytic philosophy of religion.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine omniscience (foreknowledge), providence, human freedom (libertarianism), divine decree, sin and moral responsibility, basic theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig's central theological gravity: **God's sovereign wisdom is compatible with genuine libertarian freedom because God's middle knowledge enables a providentially ordered actual world without deterministically causing human choices.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp analytic formulation of Molinism for contemporary apologetics: systematic use of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)** and possible-worlds language to make Molinism operational for providence and theodicy.
 - Emphasis on the epistemic priority of middle knowledge (logically prior to the decree) while denying any causal determination by God of free acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Thomistic denial of middle knowledge and with deterministic Reformed accounts that make God the immediate cause of all events.
 - Opposes open-theist moves that limit divine foreknowledge by instead preserving exhaustive foreknowledge without loss of libertarian freedom.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized clear deployment of **transworld decree** and rigorous defense of CCFs in contemporary evangelical circles.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in revitalizing Molinism among evangelicals and analytic philosophers of religion; widely cited in debates about providence and theodicy.
 - Provoked sustained criticism (e.g., grounding objection regarding the metaphysical status of counterfactuals) and became a focal point in the mid/late-1990s to present discussion between Molinists, Thomists, and open-theists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, teachable model connecting technical philosophy (counterfactuals, possible worlds) with pastoral/theological concerns (freedom, responsibility, the problem of evil). Remains a go-to resource for students learning Molinist responses to theodicy and divine foreknowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle knowledge**
 - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance (CCFs).
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)**
 - Conditional propositions about what a free agent would do if placed in a specific possible situation.
- **Natural, Middle, and Free Knowledge**
 - The tripartite schema Craig uses to locate divine epistemic states relative to creaturely freedom and God's decree.
- **Transworld decree**
 - God's choice to create one particular feasible world among many, made in light of middle knowledge.
- **Libertarian freedom**
 - The view that free actions are not causally determined by prior states or divine causation and are compatible with moral responsibility.
- **Exhaustive divine foreknowledge**
 - God's complete knowledge of future contingent human actions without causing them.
- **Providence (Molinist model)**
 - God arranges the external circumstances and chooses the actual world such that His purposes are achieved while respecting libertarian choices.
- **Theodicy application**
 - Molinism supplies a strategy: given middle knowledge, God can permissibly permit moral evil to bring about greater goods that depend on genuinely free choices.
- **Possible-worlds semantics**
 - Formal framework used to describe Feasible Worlds, actual world selection, and truth-values of CCFs.
- **Grounding objection**
 - Later criticism querying what metaphysically grounds the truth of counterfactuals of freedom; Craig's work precedes but is central to responses to this objection.
- **Actual world / feasible world**
 - Distinction between the world God chooses to actualize and the array of possible worlds God knows via middle knowledge.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition and model source** for Molinist middle knowledge in lectures and papers on providence.
 - As a **polemic** against theological determinism and open theism in apologetics.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual pivot** when mapping biblical texts about divine foreknowledge and providence onto a coherent philosophical theology.
