### TITLE
A Disputation on the Holy Scripture Against the Papists, Especially Bellarmine and Stapleton (1849 English translation) - William Whitaker (originally late 16th century; Eng. trans. 1849)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written by William Whitaker (1548-1595), Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, in the late Reformation era of English Protestantism.
 - Composed as systematic polemic against Roman Catholic casuists and controversialists (notably Robert Bellarmine and Thomas Stapleton); translated into English in 1849 amid 19th-century Protestant interest in Reformation apologetics.
 - Part of the English Reformed academic milieu that sought to defend sola scriptura against the post-Tridentine magisterial claims of the Roman Church.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Scripture is **self-attesting and supreme** in matters of faith and doctrine; the Roman claim that the Church (tradition + magisterium) is the ultimate judge of Scripture is circular and illegitimate.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary: Define terms (Scripture, Church, tradition, magisterium) and the question of authority.
 - Positive case for Scripture:
 - Scripture bears **intrinsic marks** (prophecy, typology, unity, sanctity, efficacy) that authenticate it.
 - The **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** grants the believer assured knowledge of Scripture's divine origin.
 - Historical and apostolic credentials (apostolicity, antiquity, witness of the primitive church) support the canon.
 - Negative case against Papal/magisterial claims:
 - The Church cannot be judge of Scripture without presupposing Scripture; therefore Roman procedure is circular.
 - Tradition and ecclesiastical decrees must be tested by Scripture, not vice versa.
 - Practical consequences: doctrinal formulation, sacramental theology, and ecclesial obedience must submit to Scripture's authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Robert Bellarmine (Jesuit apologist) and Thomas Stapleton (Catholic controversialist).
 - Resources: extensive appeal to Scripture itself, patristic authorities (esp. primitive church), Augustine, and Reformed scholastics; uses classical apologetic criteria (prophecy, miracles, inner witness of Spirit).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture (authority, canon, perspicuity), ecclesiology (magisterial claims), tradition, infallibility, and implicitly sacramentology and soteriology insofar as they depend on authority.

- **Closing line**
 - Whitaker's disputation centers the conviction that **Scripture alone possesses the marks and internal witness necessary to be the final standard for Christian faith and the only proper judge of tradition and ecclesiastical claims.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, methodical articulation of **self-attestation (testimonium internum)**: Scripture's authority is not merely external (church recognition) but an internal, Spirit-wrought assurance available to the faithful.
 - Careful logical demolition of the **circularity** in claiming the Church as ultimate judge of Scripture.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Roman assertions of ecclesiastical primacy by exposing procedural and epistemic circularity; refines earlier Protestant appeals to Scripture by combining internal and external proofs in a disciplined apologetic.
 - Contrasts with Bellarmine's heavier reliance on ecclesial tradition and magisterial authority by refusing to grant autonomous, infallible interpretive power to the post-apostolic Church.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic pairing of **external marks** (historical, apostolic) with **internal marks** (sanctifying power, prophetic unity, Spirit-witness) as complementary grounds for canonicity and authority.
 - Clarifies the epistemic role of the Spirit in conferring certitude, not merely assent.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed academic circles; served as a staple of English Protestant polemical literature.
 - 1849 translation renewed interest among 19th-century evangelicals and scholars engaging Romish controversy and historical apologetics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of Reformed apologetic method: disciplined, philological and theological, useful for teaching Scripture's normative claims and for training in confessional polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation (testimonium scripturae)** - Scripture bears witness to its own divine origin; primary epistemic basis in Whitaker.
- **Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** - the Spirit's witness in the believer that grants certitude beyond external proofs.
- **Sola Scriptura** - principle affirmed and defended as normative; Scripture alone as final norm.
- **Magisterium** - ecclesiastical teaching authority; critiqued for circular claims to judge Scripture.
- **Tradition** - assessed and subordinated to Scripture; may have value but not independent infallibility.
- **External marks of Scripture** - apostolicity, antiquity, miracles, prophetic fulfillment, early church reception.
- **Internal marks of Scripture** - moral efficacy, unity, sanctity, capacity to produce faith and obedience.
- **Circularity (epistemic)** - key rhetorical and logical criticism of Roman method: Church uses Scripture as ground while claiming Scripture's authority from the Church.
- **Canon** - argued as determined by apostolic origin and intrinsic marks rather than solely ecclesiastical declaration.
- **Infallibility** - discussed negatively regarding the Church; affirmed regarding Scripture in function.
- **Perspicuity / clarity** - implied claim that Scripture is sufficiently clear for foundational truths when illuminated by the Spirit.
- **Apostolicity** - criterion for canonicity and authenticity of doctrine.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - Scripture contains all necessary doctrine for faith and practice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the doctrine of self-attesting Scripture and the Spirit's internal testimony.
 - As a **polemic model** in Protestant controversies with Roman Catholicism, especially on canon and magisterial authority.
 - As an **exegetical and apologetic model** combining internal and external criteria for canonicity and authority.
