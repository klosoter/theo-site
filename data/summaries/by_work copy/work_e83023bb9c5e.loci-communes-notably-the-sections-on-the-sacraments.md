### TITLE
**Peter Martyr Vermigli, Loci Communes** (esp. sacramental loci)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-16th c. Reformed theology; Italian exile shaped by Strasbourg, Oxford, and Zurich.
 - Compiled posthumously (1576, by Robert Masson) from Vermigli's commentaries and disputations.
 - Milieu: post-Lutheran controversies and the Roman response framed by Trent; dialogue with humanist exegesis and medieval scholastic method.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Sacraments as means of grace**: divine signs and seals that truly communicate Christ by the Spirit to believers, while rejecting both Roman ex opere operato and Lutheran local presence.
 - Integration of **divine decrees (election/reprobation)** with ecclesial means: efficacy is of the Spirit to the elect through faith within the visible church.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Nature of a sacrament: **word + element = sign and seal** of covenantal promise; instrumental means under the Spirit's efficient causality.
 - **Baptism**
 - Continuity with circumcision; infants admitted as covenant heirs.
 - Mode indifferent; emphasis on promise and incorporation, not necessary regeneration ex opere operato.
 - **Lord's Supper**
 - True, spiritual participation in Christ by faith; denial of transubstantiation and consubstantiation.
 - **No manducatio impiorum**: the wicked receive the sign to judgment, not Christ Himself.
 - **Fencing/admission**: self-examination, ministerial discipline, and public order guard the Table.
 - **Decrees and providence**
 - Augustinian predestination; God's concurrence with secondary causes; God not author of sin.
 - **Prelapsarian speculation**
 - Adam's probation; tree of life as a sacrament of promised life; no necessity of incarnation if Adam had not sinned.
 - **Ecclesiology**
 - Marks of the church: pure preaching and right administration of sacraments; discipline supports both.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic: **Augustine**, Chrysostom.
 - Medieval: **Aquinas**, Lombard; Aristotelian causal analysis.
 - Interlocutors: Roman scholastics (anticipating Trent), Lutheran sacramental union theologians; English debates (Cranmer's circle; opposed to Gardiner's positions).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture's authority; providence, decrees; anthropology and Adam; Christology (against localizing Christ's body); soteriology (faith as instrument); ecclesiology and sacraments.

- **Center of gravity**
 - A **Word-and-Spirit economy**: God's eternal decree executed through the preached Word and rightly used sacraments in the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Scholastic precision in service of Reformed aims**: causal analysis of sacraments (efficient, instrumental, final).
 - **Sign-res-seal** triad deployed pastorally: the seal strengthens faith in what the Word promises.
 - **Tree of life as sacrament** clarifies prelapsarian covenantal logic.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against Rome: rejects **ex opere operato** and transubstantiation; insists on faith and Spirit for efficacy.
 - Against Lutheranism: denies ubiquity-based presence and **manducatio impiorum**; Christ's body remains locally in heaven, communicated spiritually.
 - Refines Zwinglian memorialism by insisting on **real spiritual feeding**.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Use of **relative presence** and **sacramental union** as non-local, Spirit-caused relation of sign to Christ.
 - Deployment of **secondary causality** to locate efficacy in God while affirming creaturely instruments.
 - Clear covenantal link between **baptism and circumcision**, grounding infant baptism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped Zurich and wider Reformed orthodoxy; significant for **39 Articles** (esp. Art. 29 on the wicked not eating Christ).
 - Influenced Zanchi, Beza, Polanus, and later Reformed scholastics; a resource in post-Tridentine polemics and Anglican-Reformed dialogue.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable **sacramental grammar** uniting exegesis, doctrine, and pastoral practice.
 - Bridges patristic-Augustinian insight with Reformation commitments for teaching and catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament (sacramentum)**: a divine ordinance where the **Word with element** signifies and seals grace to faith.
- **Sign and thing signified (signum/res)**: visible sign relates truly yet non-locally to Christ and His benefits.
- **Seal (obsignatio)**: confirms God's promise; strengthens, does not create, faith.
- **Instrumental cause**: sacraments as instruments; **Spirit** as efficient cause; **faith** as receiving instrument.
- **Ex opere operato vs. ex opere operantis**: denies automatic efficacy; affirms Spirit's work in believers using the ordinances.
- **Spiritual presence**: Christ truly given by the Spirit, not by local or substantial change of elements.
- **Manducatio impiorum**: rejected; the wicked receive the sign alone, to judgment.
- **Sacramental union**: a real, relative relation instituted by God; not a physical union of substances.
- **Fencing the Table**: ministerial discipline and self-examination regulate admission to the Supper.
- **Covenant continuity**: baptism as new-covenant correlate to circumcision; **infant baptism** warranted.
- **Divine decrees (election/reprobation)**: Augustinian, coordinated with means; God not the author of sin.
- **Secondary causes and concurrence**: preserves divine sovereignty with real creaturely operations.
- **Prelapsarian sacrament**: **tree of life** as sign and pledge of life to Adam under probation.
- **Visible/invisible church**: outward administration vs. inward grace to the elect.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Definition source** for Reformed sacramentology and causality.
 - **Polemic touchstone** against Roman and Lutheran eucharistic doctrines.
 - **Exegetical model** for 1 Cor 10-11; Gen 2-3 on Adam and the tree of life.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking decrees, church marks, and pastoral discipline.
