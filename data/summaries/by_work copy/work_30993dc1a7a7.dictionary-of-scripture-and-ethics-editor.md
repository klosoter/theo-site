### TITLE
**Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics** (ed. Joel B. Green)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century (Baker Academic). Situated in contemporary evangelical and academic conversation seeking to reassert the primacy of biblical studies for ethical reflection while dialoguing with philosophy, theology, and social sciences.
 - Emerged amid renewed interest in integrating rigorous exegesis with applied ethics in seminaries and university theology faculties.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible must be the decisive resource for Christian ethics, but biblical interpretation requires interdisciplinary tools; ethics without hermeneutical grounding is impoverished, and exegesis without normative reflection is incomplete.
 - Seeks to map conceptual resources in Scripture that shape moral formation, communal life, and public witness.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Alphabetical dictionary format composed of concise, peer-reviewed entries by specialists.
 - Major moves:
 - Provide exegetical surveys of biblical texts relevant to ethical themes.
 - Articulate theological and ethical concepts derived from Scripture.
 - Bring ethical theory into conversation with biblical theology and pastoral practice.
 - Entries range from technical lexical/exegetical notes to synthetic treatments (e.g., law, covenant, virtue, human nature).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Contributors include biblical scholars, ethicists, systematic theologians; engages classical sources (Scriptures, patristic and medieval writers) and modern ethical theory (virtue ethics, deontology, consequentialism), historical theology, and contemporary social thought.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Extensive: revelation, covenant, law, grace, Christology, atonement, ecclesiology, eschatology, human nature (notably psychosomatic unity), sin, justification, virtue and vice, prophetic justice, wisdom literature, vocation.

- **Closing line**
 - A pastoral-academic reference designed to make Scripture the regenerative center of ethical reflection, demonstrating that robust exegesis and theological integration produce durable moral resources for church and society.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on **scriptural exegesis as the normative locus** for ethical theology rather than starting from abstract moral theory.
 - Integrative orientation: biblical-theological, historical, and practical dimensions are brought into sustained conversation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects approaches that treat ethics as detachable from biblical narrative or that privilege systematic ethics over textual fidelity.
 - Contrasts with purely philosophical ethics by foregrounding narrative, covenantal, and communal categories drawn from Scripture.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes cross-disciplinary entries that reframe classic ethical categories in biblical idioms (e.g., reframing "virtue" through wisdom, covenant, and formation language).
 - Emphasizes terms like **psychosomatic unity** to counter Cartesian splits and to link anthropology with ethical responsibility.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and broader Protestant seminaries as a go-to reference for integrating Bible and ethics.
 - Praised for breadth and scholarly accessibility; critiqued by some for unevenness in entry depth and occasional confessional slant.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a classroom resource, sermon aid, and starting-point for specialized research; continues to shape curricular conversations about how Scripture informs moral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture and Ethics** - foundational rubric: how biblical texts supply norms, virtues, narratives, and practices for moral life.
- **Biblical exegesis** - treated as normative method: textual, canonical, and theological readings underpin ethical conclusions.
- **Covenant** - central framework for duties, identity, and communal obligations; ethics as covenantal fidelity.
- **Law (Torah)** - examined both as concrete commandments and as theological matrix for community formation.
- **Wisdom** - moral formation through proverbial teaching, practical discernment, and character formation.
- **Virtue ethics** - reframed in biblical categories (e.g., fruit of the Spirit, wisdom formation) rather than merely Aristotelian models.
- **Human nature** - emphasized as **psychosomatic unity**:
 - Rejects sharp mind/body dualism; interprets biblical anthropology (Genesis, Psalms, Pauline texts) as integrated embodiment with ethical implications (care for bodies, embodied practices, social embodiment).
- **Sin** - both cosmic disorder and personal/community failure; diagnostic and restorative emphases.
- **Grace and justification** - normative for ethics: motivation and horizon for moral formation.
- **Prophetic ethics** - justice, mercy, and lament as central public commitments.
- **Eschatology / Kingdom of God** - eschatological vision shapes present moral priorities and hope.
- **Community / Ecclesiology** - church as moral locus of formation, discipline, and witness.
- **Vocation** - everyday callings as arenas of ethical responsibility.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: concise, authoritative definitions and biblical-theological summaries of contested terms.
 - Exegetical model: exemplar for pastors and scholars to derive ethical claims from careful biblical reading rather than abstract theorizing.
 - Conceptual pivot: employed to locate debates (e.g., anthropology as psychosomatic unity) within wider scriptural and theological frameworks for teaching and pastoral application.
