### TITLE
The Creation Account in Genesis 1:1-3: Part III: The Initial Chaos Theory and the Precreation Chaos Theory (Bibliotheca Sacra, 1975) - Bruce K. Waltke

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1970s evangelical academic milieu; Bibliotheca Sacra as an evangelical journal. Waltke writing as a conservative-critical Hebraist engaged with contemporary debates over Genesis 1 (creation ex nihilo, gap theories, ANE parallels).
 - Reaction to readings that import Near Eastern cosmogonies or posited a temporal gap/chaotic antecedent to the Genesis creation days.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Waltke contrasts two interpretive models - the *Initial Chaos Theory* (chaos as the created initial state that God orders in the six days) and the *Precreation Chaos Theory* (chaos existed prior to the creative fiat and God reorders an already chaotic material) - and defends the former while rejecting the latter as exegetically and theologically problematic.
 - Underlying doctrinal stakes: creatio ex nihilo, divine sovereignty, the goodness and orderliness of the created world, and the extent to which ANE mythology should shape Genesis interpretation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Terminological and syntactic analysis of Genesis 1:1-3 (relation of v.2 to v.1; waw-consecutive, narrative dependency).
 - Lexical treatment of key Hebrew terms: tohu wa-bohu, tehom, bara, asah, and yom; demonstration that these describe an *initial* formlessness within the created order rather than evidence of prior ruin.
 - Critique of the precreation/gap model:
 - Shows it depends on extra-biblical mythological parallels and speculative gaps not demanded by the Hebrew.
 - Argues it undermines clear theological assertions about God's immediate creative activity and creatio ex nihilo.
 - Defense of an ordered six-day formation model: God brings order out of the initial created formlessness by successive divine fiat.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages with proponents of the gap/re-creation approach (theological-historical advocates of a temporal precreation ruin).
 - Interacts with scholarship on ANE cosmogonies and the chaoskampf motif; engages Hebraic philology and comparative literature cautiously, resisting uncritical assimilation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (primary), revelation (hermeneutics of Genesis), implications for providence and the goodness of creation; implicit repercussions for anthropology and fall if precreation ruin is adopted.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Waltke centers the reading of Genesis 1 on a theologically robust Hebraic exegesis that affirms God as sovereign Creator who orders an initially formed but formless universe, rejecting hypotheses that posit a prior chaotic or ruined cosmos antecedent to the divine creative fiat.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful syntactic and lexical defense of Genesis 1:2 as dependent on v.1 rather than descriptive of a prior destroyed creation.
 - Balanced use of ANE parallels: acknowledges similarities but restrains transfer of mythic structures into Hebrew theology.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects gap/re-creation readings by showing their dependence on extra-biblical speculation and by exposing theological costs (e.g., weakening creatio ex nihilo).
 - Contrasts with readings that over-privilege chaoskampf parallels, arguing for priority of canonical Hebraic grammar and theology.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and reinforces the distinction between *initial chaos* (created state) and *precreation chaos* (extra-biblical antecedent), giving sharper hermeneutical labels for debate.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted within conservative and Reformed circles as a measured philological refutation of the gap theory; cited by later evangelical commentators as a model for combining linguistic precision with doctrinal concern.
 - Influential in curbing over-eager syncretism with ANE myth when it conflicts with Hebrew textual data.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact exemplar of exegetical restraint: prioritize Hebrew syntax and theological coherence before importing speculative chronological gaps or mythic constructs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Initial Chaos Theory** - Chaos as the created, formless state described in v.2 that God orders during the Six Days.
- **Precreation Chaos Theory (Gap Theory / Re-creation)** - The claim of an antecedent chaotic or ruined creation preceding the Genesis week; Waltke rejects this as exegetically unnecessary.
- **tohu wa-bohu** - "formless and void"; Waltke reads it as descriptive of the initial condition within creation, not of a prior catastrophe.
- **tehom** - "the deep"; examined for semantic ties to ANE motifs (Tiamat) but not taken to prove dependence on mythic cosmogony.
- **bara** (create) vs **asah** (make/shape) - distinctions used to argue that God both brings into being and subsequently forms/order the cosmos.
- **yom (day)** - treated in the structural argument for a sequence of formative acts rather than a reordering of a preexistent ruined material.
- **chaoskampf** - scholarly motif of deity vs chaotic sea; acknowledged but not determinative for Hebrew theology of Genesis.
- **creatio ex nihilo** - defended implicitly by rejecting precreation chaos that would place uncreated chaotic matter prior to God's fiat.
- **divine fiat** - God's spoken commands as operative in ordering the initial formless creation.
- **Hebrew syntactic argument** - the rhetorical center: v.2 is syntactically subordinate to v.1, supporting initial-state reading.
- **ANE parallels** - used critically: valuable for background but insufficient to override Hebrew grammar and theology.
- **canonical restraint** - methodological principle: let Hebrew text and theological claims govern comparative speculation.
- **exegetical polemic** - the article functions as a targeted rebuttal of gap/re-creation models within evangelical exegesis.

How this work is used:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1 with priority to Hebrew grammar and lexical detail.
- As a **polemic** or reference source in debates against gap/re-creation theories and overextended ANE assimilation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed/evangelical literature defending creatio ex nihilo and the coherence of the six-day formative framework.
