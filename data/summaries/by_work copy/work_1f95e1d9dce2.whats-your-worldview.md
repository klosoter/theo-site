### TITLE
What's Your Worldview? - James N. Anderson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written within the late 20th/early 21st-century evangelical apologetic and Christian education milieu. Aimed at students, church study groups, and lay readers needing a compact primer on articulating and testing worldview commitments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Every person lives by a worldview of ultimate commitments; making those commitments explicit is the first step in faithful witness and sound Christian discipleship. Christianity offers the most coherent, morally adequate, and existentially satisfying account of reality.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define what a worldview is and why it matters (ultimate questions and life implications).
 - Provide a diagnostic framework for identifying one's own presuppositions and thinking habits.
 - Survey major non-Christian options (naturalism, pantheism, relativism, pluralism, secular humanism) and show common failures.
 - Set forth the contours of a Christian worldview organized around revelation, creation, fall, redemption, and consummation.
 - Offer practical exercises and conversational strategies to clarify commitments and engage others pastorally and apologetically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on the broader tradition of Christian worldview thinkers (e.g., Francis Schaeffer's emphasis on cultural diagnosis, C.S. Lewis's moral argument instincts), interacts polemically with secular humanism, postmodern relativism, New Age spirituality, and contemporary atheism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and authority (role of Scripture), creation and providence, anthropology and sin, Christology (as center of redemption), soteriology (redemptive solutions to the human predicament), teleology/eschatology (purpose and destiny), and ethics (grounding moral norms).
- **Closing line:** The work's theological center of gravity is the claim that explicit Christian theism best secures truth, meaning, and moral accountability and therefore must be both clearly taught and winsomely defended.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Practical, pedagogical focus: designed to help readers *name* and *test* their presuppositions rather than introduce technical philosophy.
 - Strong stress on everyday consequences: worldview is measured by how it shapes life choices, not merely abstract coherence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Less academic than scholarly analytic philosophy; more structured and dialogical than nostalgic polemic. Contrasts with purely evidentialist handbooks by foregrounding existential and coherence tests alongside empirical considerations.
 - Offers a corrective to relativism by insisting on objective questions and answers without descending into sectarian cant.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes a user-friendly diagnostic vocabulary for lay engagement (e.g., "ultimate commitments," "life-answers").
 - Practical categories for testing worldviews (explanatory scope, moral adequacy, existential vitality, empirical adequacy).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Modest but steady use in evangelical study groups, introductory courses, and church education materials; cited occasionally in broader site outlines as a compact primer.
 - Not a major academic landmark, but influential in shaping practical pedagogy for worldview formation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Effective bridge text between academic worldview theory and parish-level discipleship.
 - Useful for equipping Christians to articulate convictions and interact compassionately yet firmly with diverse cultural positions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Worldview:** A comprehensive set of beliefs about ultimate reality that orients thought and action.
- **Ultimate commitments:** Core, often implicit, presuppositions that shape interpretation of facts and values.
- **Presupposition:** Basic assumptions prior to argumentation; determining how evidence is read.
- **Explanatory adequacy:** A test of how well a worldview accounts for the facts of experience and history.
- **Moral adequacy:** Whether a worldview supplies an objective, knowable basis for moral obligations.
- **Existential plausibility:** The capacity of a worldview to satisfy deep human longings for meaning and hope.
- **Empirical adequacy:** Fit between worldview claims and observable reality/science.

- **Creation/Fall/Redemption/Consummation:** The canonical schema used to organize Christian answers to origin, sin, salvation, and destiny.
- **Naturalism:** Non-theistic framework denying divine agency; critiqued for explanatory and moral shortcomings.
- **Relativism/postmodernism:** Challenges claims to objective truth; handled by appeal to coherent truth-claims and lived experience.
- **Christian theism:** Posited as the comprehensive option providing coherence, moral grounding, and hope.
- **Apologetic posture:** Combines clarity about presuppositions with evidential conversation and pastoral gentleness.
- **Diagnostic exercises:** Practical tools to reveal implicit commitments and foster group discussion.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an introductory **definition source** for "what is a worldview" in classrooms and small groups.
