### TITLE
The Story Retold: A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament - Gregory K. Beale & Benjamin L. Gladd

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical biblical-theological milieu (post-1990s surge in canonical and redemptive-historical studies).
 - Builds on Beale's sustained work on NT use of the OT and on canonical/typological readings (e.g., Beale's earlier monographs).
 - Oriented to seminary instruction: textbook for introducing NT theology in a canonical, covenantal frame.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament retells and fulfills Israel's story: Jesus is the climactic recapitulation of Israel's vocation, and the NT authors intentionally reinterpret Israel's Scriptures and institutions to show Christ as true Israel, true temple, and inaugurator of new creation and covenantal eschatology.
 - Doctrinal problem addressed: how to maintain organic continuity between OT and NT without collapsing typology into mere allegory or treating discontinuity as radical replacement.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method and canonical framing - argues for an intertextual/canonical reading shaped by typology, fulfillment, and recapitulation.
 - Part II: Narrative retelling - shows how each NT book retells key episodes/themes of Israel's history (promise, exodus, presence, kingship, temple, covenant).
 - Part III: Theological implications - develops themes: Christology as true Israel, ecclesiology as new temple/community, eschatology as inaugurated new creation.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish NT authors' hermeneutic: frequent and systematic use of OT texts as authoritative typological fulfillment.
 - Demonstrate continuity: covenants, temple motifs, priestly/kingly offices find their fulfillment in Christ and the church.
 - Articulate the new-covenant and new-creation framework as the center of NT theological synthesis.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages canonical and redemptive-historical interpreters (Brevard Childs, Vosian and Reformed traditions), and contemporary NT scholars emphasizing intertextuality (e.g., N.T. Wright as representative of covenantal/kingdom emphases).
 - Dialogues with approaches that either over-emphasize continuity (simplistic typology) or over-emphasize discontinuity (radical split or Marcionite readings).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation / Scripture (canonical and intertextual use)
 - Covenant theology (promise-fulfillment continuity)
 - Christology (Jesus as true Israel, true Temple, definitive Israelite figure)
 - Atonement and sacrifice (fulfillment and transformation of temple-sacrificial language)
 - Ecclesiology (church as new temple / covenant community)
 - Eschatology (inaugurated eschatology, realized and future aspects)
 - Implicitly informs Trinitarian reading of God's covenant work across both Testaments.

- **Closing line**
 - The New Testament is best read as a theological retelling: the story of Israel finds its decisive recapitulation in Christ, who inaugurates the new-creation covenant and reconstitutes the people and temple of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong canonical-typological method: NT books as deliberate "rewritings" of Israel's narrative rather than only moralizing or allegorical reapplications.
 - Emphasis on the **temple/new-creation** motif as a central organizing theological shape across NT writings.
 - Clear articulation of *recapitulation* (not merely fulfillment) - Christ re‑lives and completes Israel's vocational story.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects simplistic supersessionist narratives by insisting on promise-fulfillment continuity: Israel is not merely discarded but recapitulated and transformed in Christ.
 - Counters reductionist typology that treats OT types as merely predictive; insists on complex intertextual patterns and NT hermeneutical intention.
 - Distinguishes itself from readings that detach NT theology from canonical OT context (e.g., purely Hellenistic or individualistic interpretations).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "fulfillment" language around narrative recapitulation and temple/new-creation semantics.
 - Systematizes the concept of "story retold" as a pedagogical and exegetical program for introductory NT theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries as a textbook alternative to thematic/systematic intros.
 - Builds on and reinforces Beale's scholarly trajectory; influential among teachers emphasizing OT-NT continuity and canonical reading.
 - Cited in conversations on typology, canonical hermeneutics, and new creation theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, pedagogically effective synthesis of canonical, typological, and covenantal approaches.
 - Especially valuable for bridging exegetical detail (OT quotations/intertexts) with constructive theological frameworks for the NT.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Story retold** - NT as intentional narrative re-presentation of Israel's history centered on Christ.
- **Typology / Recapitulation** - OT persons/events prefigure Christ; Christ also re-performs and fulfills Israel's vocation.
- **Fulfillment (plenary)** - not mere end-point prediction but theological reconfiguration and realization in Christ.
- **Temple motif / New creation** - temple language reinterpreted as fulfilled in Christ and the church within a new-creation framework.
- **Covenant continuity** - covenant promises to Israel are carried forward and fulfilled in the new covenant inaugurated by Jesus.
- **Canonical intertextuality** - systematic use of OT texts by NT authors as authoritative interpretive lenses.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - kingdom/new-creation is both present in Christ and awaiting consummation.
- **Christ as true Israel** - Jesus embodies and accomplishes Israel's identity and mission.
- **Church as new temple** - ecclesiology framed as corporate presence of God; liturgy/mission interpreted eschatologically.
- **Atonement re-visioned** - sacrificial and priestly motifs are reinterpreted through Christ's person and work.
- **Scripture hermeneutics** - Beale & Gladd model a discipline-sensitive, canonical-grammatical, typological hermeneutic.
- **Narrative-theological pedagogy** - organized around the story line rather than atomized doctrines.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for a canonical-typological method in biblical theology.
 - As an exegetical model for NT authors' use of the OT (intertextual analysis and proof-texting placed in narrative context).
 - As a conceptual pivot in systematic discussions of covenant, Christology, and ecclesiology (new temple/new creation framework).
