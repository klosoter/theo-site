### TITLE
One God, One Lord: Early Christian Devotion and Ancient Jewish Monotheism (1988) - Larry Hurtado

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century study (1988) situated amid debates on Second Temple Judaism, the origins of Christian worship, and the chronology of high Christology. Engages philology, liturgy studies, and comparative Judaism.
 - Reaction to models that locate Jesus-worship primarily in Hellenistic or later theological developments; dialog with scholarship on monotheism (Second Temple sources, Philo, Josephus, DSS).

- **Central thesis**
 - Early Christianity developed distinctive devotional practices directed to Jesus (prayer, hymns, invocation, cultic reverence) *within* an otherwise vigorous ancient Jewish monotheism. This devotion is an early, authentic phenomenon that coexists with - and reshapes - Jewish monotheistic confession rather than abandoning it.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates the robustness of Jewish monotheism in the relevant milieu (OT, Philo, DSS, Josephus).
 - Surveys New Testament and early Christian liturgical/textual evidence (Pauline letters, Gospels, primitive hymns, baptismal creeds, prayers) showing reverence and worship addressed to Jesus.
 - Analyses linguistic moves: use of kyrios (Lord) drawn from LXX translations of YHWH, application of theos (God) and lordship language to Jesus in confession and prayer.
 - Argues for an early "binitarian" pattern (one God, one Lord) in Christian devotion - a functional proto-Trinitarian devotion prior to fully developed doctrine.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primary: Paul (esp. 1 Cor 8:6), early Christian hymnic material, liturgical and epigraphic evidence.
 - Comparative: Philo, Josephus, Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint usages.
 - Interlocutors: scholars arguing for late Hellenistic origins of Jesus-worship; wider debates on Jewish monotheism and Christian origins.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (development of divine status for Jesus), Trinity (proto-Trinitarian/binitarian devotion), worship and liturgy, continuity with Jewish monotheism.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Early Christian worship of Jesus is best understood as an early, liturgically grounded enlargement of Jewish monotheism - a devotional formation that anticipates theological formulations of divine plurality without dissolving the oneness of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes *devotional practice* (prayer, hymnody, invocation) as primary evidence for early Christology rather than late dogmatic formulations.
 - Treats 1 Cor 8:6 as paradigmatic: a theological reflex preserving one God while giving unique lordship-role to Jesus.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges evolutionary models that place Jesus-worship as a later Hellenistic accretion; argues instead for early origin within Jewish streams.
 - Counters claims that early Christian devotion necessarily implied polytheism; shows mechanisms preserving monotheistic boundary.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Sharp distinction between theological *doctrine* (explicit trinitarian formulas) and *devotional patterns* (practices indicating divine status).
 - Use of "one God, one Lord" motif as analytical lens for proto-Trinitarian devotion.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in studies of early Christology and worship; reframed debates about when and how Jesus came to be worshiped.
 - Provided methodological model for integrating liturgical, epigraphic, and textual evidence; paved way for Hurtado's later works (e.g., Lord Jesus Christ, 2003).

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to narrow doctrinal chronologies; valuable for teaching Christology and the development of Trinitarian thought from praxis as well as doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monotheism (ancient Jewish)** - robust, boundary-maintaining confession in Second Temple context; background against which Christian devotion must be read.
- **Devotion to Jesus** - collective liturgical practices (prayer, hymn-singing, invocation, veneration) directed to Jesus as distinct from mere respect or prophetic honor.
- **Kyrios (Lord)** - Septuagintal title for YHWH; its application to Jesus is central to claims of divine status.
- **Theos (God)** - language occasionally applied to Jesus in Pauline and early Christian contexts; examined carefully for theological import.
- **One God, One Lord motif** - analytic formula (exemplified in 1 Cor 8:6) describing the coexistence of monotheistic confession with devotion to Jesus.
- **Binitarian / proto-Trinitarian pattern** - early devotional pattern implying a two-fold relational expression of divine reality prior to formal Trinitarian doctrine.
- **Liturgical evidence** - prayers, hymns, creeds, baptismal formulas used as primary source material for reconstructing belief.
- **Cultic practice** - concrete worship actions (eucharist, invocation, prayer to Jesus) that signify religious status.
- **Divine agency** - conceptual move where Jesus functions as God's agent/agentive instrument, facilitating appropriation of divine roles.
- **Septuagint usage** - key for understanding semantic transfer of divine titles (kyrios) to Jesus.
- **1 Corinthians 8:6** - central exegetical locus: succinct expression of the theme "one God, one Lord."
- **Hellenistic vs Jewish origin debate** - Hurtado argues for Jewish-rooted development rather than solely Hellenistic innovation.
- **Practice-before-doctrine hermeneutic** - methodological stance: ecclesial practice often precedes formal theological articulation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "early Christian devotion to Jesus" in studies of Christology and worship.
 - As a **polemic resource** against claims that early Christian worship implies polytheism or purely Hellenistic origins.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading NT texts (esp. Paul) in light of liturgical evidence and the one God/one Lord pattern.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in tracing the development from devotional practice to doctrinal formulations about the Trinity.
