### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Inerrancy - edited by Stephen B. Chapman and Marvin R. Wilson 
(Handbook-format, multi-author volume treating the doctrine of biblical inerrancy in its historical, theological, exegetical, and apologetic dimensions)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century theological milieu: evangelical attempt to reassess and consolidate the doctrine of inerrancy after intra-evangelical controversies and the rise of historical-critical methods.
 - Situated in the wake of the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy and ongoing debates over "limited" or "graded" inerrancy, postliberal and canonical critiques, and scientific/historical objections.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To clarify what is meant by the Bible's truthfulness and reliability, defend a coherent doctrine of inerrancy (broadly evangelical) while engaging contemporary objections from critical scholarship and other theological traditions.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical overview of the doctrine from patristic and Reformation antecedents to modern articulations (Warfield, Chicago Statement).
 - Theological loci: inspiration, revelation, authority, and the doctrine of Scripture's trustworthiness.
 - Hermeneutical and exegetical responses to alleged discrepancies, genre, and redaction.
 - Technical intersections: textual criticism, ancient Near Eastern parallels, science and Scripture, and pastoral implications for preaching and teaching.
 - Apologetic and ecclesial consequences: authority in doctrine and praxis, seminary training, and public witness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Proponents: B. B. Warfield, Chicago Statement drafters, contemporary evangelical scholars.
 - Critics and alternative voices: historical-critical scholars, canonical critics, postliberal theologians, and some Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant perspectives.
 - Primary engagement with Scripture, patristic sources, Reformation confessions, and modern technical literature in textual criticism and biblical studies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, authority of Scripture, perspicuity, accommodation, propositional vs. dynamic models of revelation, canon, and the interface with Christology and soteriology insofar as authority undergirds these doctrines.
- **Closing line**
 - The volume aims to hold together a robust evangelical claim about Scripture's truthfulness-rooted in divine revelation and careful exegesis-while mapping the methodological and pastoral work required to answer modern critical challenges.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Multi-disciplinary integration: historic theology, biblical scholarship, textual criticism, and apologetics in one synthetic resource.
 - Practical theology orientation: attention to seminary curricula, preaching, and denominational usage alongside technical debate.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - More ecumenical and dialogical tone than earlier polemical inerrancy tracts; engages critical scholarship rather than simply rebutting it.
 - Moves beyond simplistic "literalism vs. error" dichotomies to nuance genres, intention, and hermeneutical presuppositions.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions among **inerrancy**, **infallibility**, **plenary verbal inspiration**, and **graded/limited inerrancy** with attention to methodological consequences.
 - Emphasizes a taxonomy of alleged "difficulties" (textual, historical, scientific, theological) to match responses to problem-type.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a substantial, reference-level statement within conservative evangelical circles and as a measured scholarly engagement for critics.
 - Used in seminary settings as a corrective to both uncritical literalism and skeptical dismissal of Scriptural authority.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a teaching resource that models how to pair doctrinal clarity with technical engagement; valuable for students wrestling with contemporary objections.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy** - claim that Scripture, properly interpreted, does not affirm error in what it intends to teach.
- **Infallibility** - related claim focusing on Scripture's unfailing reliability for faith and practice; often contrasted with inerrancy.
- **Plenary verbal inspiration** - doctrine that all parts of Scripture are the product of divine inspiration, down to propositional content (as articulated in many essays).
- **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)** - watershed formulation frequently cited and evaluated throughout the volume.
- **Graded / limited inerrancy** - alternative positions that allow error in non-redemptive or incidental material; discussed and critiqued.
- **Historical-grammatical method** - hermeneutical baseline defended for determining authorial intent and resolving alleged discrepancies.
- **Textual criticism** - technical discipline treated as foundational: establishment of the text is prerequisite for inerrancy claims.
- **Genre and accommodation** - recognition that poetic, metaphorical, and phenomenological language affects what counts as literal truth.
- **Accommodation** - doctrine that God condescends to human capacities in revelation; used to explain nontechnical language in Scripture.
- **Canon / canonical criticism** - discussion of how final form and canonical reception shape claims about authority and correctness.
- **Problem passages taxonomy** - practical framework for categorizing and responding to difficult texts (e.g., chronology, numbers, parallelistic variation).
- **Apologetic usage** - inerrancy defended as necessary for coherent proclamation and public witness.
- **Perspicuity** - idea that Scripture is sufficiently clear for necessary salvation-related truths; balanced against complexities of interpretation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical seminarians and pastors seeking careful distinctions (inerrancy vs. infallibility; plenary inspiration).
- As a **polemic and apologetic manual** when addressing skeptical claims about biblical contradictions or scientific conflict.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how textual criticism, genre sensitivity, and historical methods bear on doctrinal claims about Scripture.
