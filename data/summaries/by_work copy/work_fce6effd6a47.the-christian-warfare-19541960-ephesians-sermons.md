### TITLE
The Christian Warfare (Ephesians sermons, 1954-1960) - Martyn Lloyd-Jones

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Preached as expository series in Westminster Chapel, London (mid 1950s). Lloyd-Jones operating within mid‑20th century conservative evangelicalism with strong Puritan and Reformed affinities; pastoral, revivalist impulse amid postwar Britain.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life is fundamentally a sustained spiritual conflict rooted in union with Christ; believers are called to active, disciplined warfare using the resources given in Christ and by the Holy Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Ephesians chapters on the believer's position and practical warfare:
 - Union with Christ provides status, resources, and authority.
 - Identification of enemies: demonic powers and the world-system.
 - Practical means of warfare: armor of God, prayer, watchfulness, sanctification.
 - Role of the Spirit: both indwelling and empowering for battle and witness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (Ephesians). Frequent appeal to Puritans, Reformers, and classical expositors; engages contemporary revivalists and Pentecostal/charismatic claims cautiously. Pastoral case studies and congregational application used throughout.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology, Christology (union and headship), Pneumatology (indwelling, baptism, filling), Soteriology (positional vs progressive), Sanctification and holiness, Angelology/demonology, Prayer, Spiritual gifts.
- **Closing line**
 - Lloyd-Jones centers the Christian life as militant holiness: victorious living is neither naive triumphalism nor passive assurance but disciplined dependence on Christ and the Spirit in ongoing spiritual warfare.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the objective positional realities in Christ as the foundation for subjective spiritual struggle; blends high doctrine (union with Christ) with concrete pastoral tactics (prayer, watchfulness).
 - Presents the armor of God as functional equipment, not merely metaphorical decoration: each piece corresponds to disciplines and Spirit-empowered attitudes.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both pietistic quietism (minimizing real spiritual conflict) and sensationalism (reducing the Spirit to emotional phenomena).
 - Critiques any spirituality that divorces sanctification from doctrinal truth or that treats gifts as ends in themselves.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight integration of Pauline cosmic language (principalities/powers) with daily pastoral strategies for holiness - treating cosmic conflict as immediately relevant to congregational life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among 20th century evangelicals and Reformed pastors; widely used as a model of expository pastoral preaching on spiritual warfare and sanctification.
 - Adopted in revivalist and renewal contexts for its emphasis on the Spirit, while appreciated by conservative critics for its doctrinal sobriety.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for pastors and spiritual directors seeking a theology of warfare that is biblical, pastoral, and formation-focused rather than sensational or purely theoretical.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christian warfare**
 - The daily, Spirit-enabled struggle against sin, flesh, and hostile spiritual powers.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Foundational positional reality that supplies authority, identity, and resources for warfare.
- **Armor of God**
 - Practical categories (truth, righteousness, gospel readiness, faith, salvation, Word, prayer) treated as instruments and disciplines.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Lloyd-Jones treats this as an aspect of union and empowerment: distinct emphases between indwelling and subsequent empowering experiences are acknowledged, but always subordinated to scriptural test and sanctifying fruit.
- **Filling of the Spirit**
 - Ongoing condition to be sought by prayer and obedience; correlated with effectiveness in witness and warfare.
- **Spiritual gifts**
 - Corporate endowments for building the church; should be exercised under the governance of holiness and truth rather than for individual display.
 - Related to sanctification: gifts are means, not ends, and must be tested by fruit and conformity to Christ.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive, disciplined growth in holiness; intimately connected to warfare, dependent on the Spirit and exercised through spiritual disciplines.
- **Prayer / Intercession**
 - Central instrument in warfare; Lloyd-Jones elevates continual, watchful prayer as the decisive practice in sustaining the battle.
- **Principalities and powers**
 - Real spiritual adversaries; their activity explains cultural and personal opposition and necessitates cosmic-scale theology applied pastorally.
- **Victory / Overcoming**
 - Not merely future eschatological hope but present possibility through Christ and persistent reliance on the Spirit.
- **Watchfulness / Vigilance**
 - Ethical and spiritual posture required to maintain the armor and resist deception.
- **Word as sword**
 - Scripture functionally used in refutation and formation; emphasis on doctrinal clarity as a weapon.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for teaching Ephesians with pastoral application.
 - As a **pastoral theology resource** on sanctification, prayer, and Christian formation.
 - As a **polemical reference** within debates on baptism of the Spirit and charismatic practice: affirming Spirit empowerment while insisting on sanctifying fruit and doctrinal control.
