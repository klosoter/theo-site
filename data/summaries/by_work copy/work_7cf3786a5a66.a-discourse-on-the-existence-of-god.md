### TITLE
A Discourse on the Existence of God - Stephen Charnock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-century English Puritan / Reformed milieu; Charnock (1628-1680) a Nonconformist divine working in post-Restoration England. Rooted in scholastic and Puritan patterns of pastoral theology and natural theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - God's existence is rationally demonstrable and morally evident: the created order, conscience, and revealed Scripture jointly warrant conviction of a living, necessary God whose attributes are known both absolutely and relatively.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Opening: denial of atheism and its insufficiency; method set as philosophical demonstration aided by Scripture.
 - Major moves:
 - Cosmological reasoning: contingency of creatures points to a necessary First Cause.
 - Teleological/design considerations: order, beauty, final causes in nature imply intelligent, purposive agency.
 - Moral and religious experience: conscience, worship, and providential governance testify to God's reality.
 - Exposition of attributes: treatment of God's **absolute attributes** (aseity, simplicity, immutability, eternity, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence) followed by **relative attributes** (Creator/creature distinction, Lord, Judge, Redeemer).
 - Apologetic thrust: objections from deists, epicureans, and skeptics met with philosophical and scriptural responses.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reliant on Scripture (Psalms, Romans), patristic and scholastic categories, and engagement with contemporary sceptical or deistic voices rather than systematic rebuttal of a single philosopher; implicitly responds to mechanistic and skeptical trends emerging in the 17th century.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (natural and special), providence, divine attributes (absolute vs relative), creation (including ex nihilo implications), and the moral knowledge of God.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on the conviction that God is both philosophically necessary and experientially known - a self-existent, morally relevant Being whose absolute perfections ground relational claims upon creatures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful distinction and ordered exposition of **absolute** versus **relative** attributes as the key to connecting metaphysical proofs with moral and redemptive concerns.
 - Pastoral-philosophical tone: apologetic aims blend with devotional ends - knowledge of God is for worship and obedience, not mere speculative assent.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects overly abstract metaphysical proofs by insisting on the moral and providential aspects of God's existence; contrasts with deist minimalism that admits a remote creator but denies providential concern.
 - Less speculative than late scholastic excesses; more theologically integrated than purely naturalistic accounts.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic amplification of the absolute/relative attribute schema as an organizing principle for natural theology and practical piety.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clear teaching on attributes and apologetics; influenced later Puritan and Reformed manuals on theism and pastoral instruction. Cited by subsequent theologians as a compact resource for integrating natural theology and doctrine of God.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to read natural signs in light of Scripture; useful for teaching attributes, pastoral apologetics, and for resisting modern deistic or reductionist accounts of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; not contingent on anything else. Central to Charnock's rebuttal of contingency-only accounts.
- **Necessary Being** - The metaphysical status required to ground contingent reality; the terminus of cosmological reasoning.
- **Contingency** - Characteristic of creatures; used as inferential stepping-stone to God's necessity.
- **Absolute attributes** - Perfections intrinsic to God (e.g., simplicity, immutability, eternity, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence). Charnock treats these as grounding God's being.
- **Relative attributes** - God's relations to creatures (Creator, Lord, Judge, Redeemer); the bridge from metaphysics to covenantal/moral claims.
- **Simplicity** - Divine unity without composition; used to deny creaturelike complexity in God's essence.
- **Immutability** - God's unchangeableness; grounds trust in providence and promises.
- **Providence** - God's governance of creation; evidential for His ongoing existence and care, countering deism.
- **Teleology / Design** - Order and final causes in nature argued as indicators of intelligence and purpose.
- **Natural knowledge of God** - The human capacity (via creation and conscience) to know God, which Charnock affirms but locates beneath and supported by scripture.
- **Conscience / Moral sense** - Interior witness to God's law and existence; used as experiential proof.
- **Ex nihilo creation** - Implied by God's aseity and sovereignty; underscores Creator-creature distinction.
- **Cosmological argument** - Contingency-to-necessity chain as central apologetic strategy.
- **Teleological argument** - Uses design to point toward wisdom and goodness in God.
- **Polemic against deism/atheism** - Charnock's practical and philosophical counters to modern skeptics.
- Uses across loci:
 - Definition source for the distinction **absolute vs relative attributes** in dogmatic treatments.
 - Polemic and pedagogical model in pastoral apologetics and instruction on providence and worship.
