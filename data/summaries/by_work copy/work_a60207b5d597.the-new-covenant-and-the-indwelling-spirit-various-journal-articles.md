### TITLE
The New Covenant and the Indwelling Spirit (selected journal articles) - James M. Hamilton Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical scholarship (21st century). Produced in seminary/journal venues addressing biblical theology, covenant theology, and pastoral application.
 - Situated within the covenantal-reformed milieu that emphasizes continuity between Old and New Testaments and the Christological fulfillment of covenant promises.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Covenant's defining mark is the promised outpouring and indwelling of the Spirit; understanding the Spirit's role clarifies how regeneration, union with Christ, and the application of redemption belong to covenantal economy.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful readings of Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36, Joel, Luke-Acts, and Pauline passages to show promise → inauguration → application.
 - Covenant-historical move: the Old Testament promises of a renewed heart and Spirit find their definitive fulfillment in Christ's person and work, mediated by the Spirit in the church.
 - Doctrinal implication: regeneration (new heart) and indwelling are inseparable with respect to Christ's covenantal administration, though historically and experientially they may be distinguished.
 - Pastoral conclusion: assurance and covenant identity flow from the Spirit's work as the guarantor of the New Covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: biblical texts (prophets, Luke-Acts, Paul, Hebrews).
 - Theological interlocutors: Reformed covenant theologians (historical and recent), Pentecostal/charismatic emphases on Spirit experiences, and dispensational contrasts stressing discontinuity.
 - Secondary engagement with systematic treatments of the Spirit (Murray, Berkhof, recent evangelical pneumatology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace / new covenant), pneumatology (indwelling, outpouring, baptism of the Spirit), Christology (mediatorial work), soteriology (regeneration, adoption, sanctification), ecclesiology (signs and sacraments as means), eschatology (inaugurated eschatology).
- **Closing line**
 - Hamilton locates the heart of covenant theology in the Spirit's covenantal work: Christ secures the promised Spirit, and the Spirit makes the covenant's benefits concrete in the believer (new heart, union, and sanctification).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the *covenantal* character of pneumatology: the Spirit is primarily the executor and seal of covenant promises rather than only the source of charismatic phenomena.
 - Links prophetic promises (Jeremiah/Ezekiel) tightly to Christ's mediatorial office and the Spirit's mission in the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that privatize Spirit Baptism to subjective experiences alone; insists on biblical-ecclesial markers (union with Christ, sacramental signs).
 - Counters dispensational fragmentation by arguing for substantial continuity in the Spirit's promised work across covenants, fulfilled in Christ.
 - Qualifies charismatic excesses by distinguishing normative covenantal indwelling from extraordinary charismatic gifting.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Presents the phrase "Spirit as covenant-applier" (functional term) to describe the Spirit's role in applying redemption secured by Christ.
 - Emphasizes a triadic economy: Father promises the covenant, Son purchases and mediates, Spirit executes and seals.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries for its exegetical clarity and pastoral sensitivity; often cited in discussions on baptism, assurance, and the relationship of regeneration to sanctification.
 - Influential as a corrective resource in debates between covenantal and charismatic emphases.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating biblical exegesis, covenant theology, and pastoral practice concerning the Spirit and regeneration.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Covenant** - The covenantal administration inaugurated by Christ that fulfills prophetic promises of inward renewal.
- **Indwelling Spirit** - The Spirit's abiding presence in believers as the means of actualizing New Covenant promises.
- **Regeneration** - God's act giving a new heart; presented as the Spirit's primary covenantal work.
- **Outpouring of the Spirit** - Prophetic motif (Joel, Jeremiah) fulfilled eschatologically in Christ and enacted in the church.
- **Spirit as covenant-applier** - Functional term: the Spirit applies redemption purchased by Christ to believers.
- **Baptism of the Spirit** - Presented in covenantal terms as incorporation into Christ and his covenant people, not merely an isolated charismatic event.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological ground for indwelling: the Spirit unites believers to Christ and so effects covenant blessings.
- **Sanctification** - Ongoing Spirit-work that follows and flows from regeneration and indwelling.
- **Covenant signs (baptism, Lord's Supper)** - Means by which the Spirit seals and confirms covenant promises to the elect.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The new covenant is already/yes-but; Spirit's presence is a foretaste and guarantee of final consummation.
- **Promise of the Spirit** - Theologically decisive promise that identifies the New Covenant.
- **Application of redemption** - How Christ's work is effectually brought to believers: principally by the Spirit.
- **Charismata vs. covenant gifts** - Distinguish extraordinary gifts as not identical with the normative covenantal indwelling.
- **Adoption** - Spirit's internal testimony and effect in making believers heirs in the covenant.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Joel, Luke-Acts, and Paul with covenantal coherence.
 - As a **polemic resource** against theological positions that divorce the Spirit's work from covenantal frameworks (extreme dispensationalism or unbounded charismatic individualism).
 - As a **definition source** for teaching the relation of regeneration, indwelling, and baptism of the Spirit within Reformed pastoral theology.
