### TITLE
**Peter J. Gentry, "The Covenant of Creation,"** SBJT 2009. 
Short-form theological article arguing for the canonical and theological priority of a covenantal structure embedded in Genesis 1-2 and its hermeneutical consequences for later covenants.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology (2009) amid renewed conservative-Reformed interest in covenant theology, Sabbath ethics, and the Adam-Christ typology debate.
 - Engages contemporary Reformed and evangelical covenantal scholarship (post-Klinean and post-Murray conversations).
- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1-2 expresses a transcendent, normative **Covenant of Creation** that establishes God's authoritative ordering of creation (including Sabbath and dominion) and functions as the foundational covenantal frame for subsequent biblical covenants.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base: close reading of Genesis 1-2 (commands, blessing, sabbath, mandate to image-bearing) as covenantal acts rather than merely descriptive history.
 - The Covenant of Creation provides the **normative obligations** and blessings that later covenants (e.g., Mosaic) presuppose and apply, not wholly replace.
 - Consequent theological moves:
 - Sabbath belongs to creation-order covenant rather than merely Mosaic ritual law.
 - The Mosaic covenant must be read in continuity with creation obligations; some elements commonly described as "works" find their substantive antecedent in creation.
 - Re-evaluates how Adam's covenantal headship functions typologically for Christ.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Klinean covenant theology (Meredith Kline) and other Reformed treatments of the covenant of works (John Murray, Durham school).
 - Interacts with biblical studies on Genesis, covenantal language, and Old Testament law.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (creational baseline), law and Sabbath, federal headship, typology (Adam-Christ), revelation (creational revelation), and implications for redemptive-historical reading.
- **Closing line**
 - Gentry centers covenant theology on creation: the Covenant of Creation is the ontological and moral matrix that grounds law, Sabbath, and the shape of God's covenantal dealings through redemptive history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Genesis 1-2 as explicitly covenantal in force, not merely prologue or history; the sabbath and creation mandate are covenantal norms binding on all humanity and later covenants.
 - Moves the emphasis from a parity between a pre-fall "covenant of works" and later covenants to a broader **creation covenant** that undergirds covenantal obligations throughout Scripture.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects what Gentry sees as a narrow Klinean focus on an Adamic covenant-of-works as juridical contract; instead highlights the ongoing normative status of creation order.
 - Pushes back on readings that confine Sabbath or moral ordering to Mosaic legislation only.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames creation-language (blessing, image-bearing, sovereign mandate, sabbath) as covenantal categories-bridging natural law, creation theology, and covenant theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary Reformed and evangelical discussions on Sabbath ethics, creation theology, and the covenant of works debate.
 - Provoked both adoption (those seeking stronger continuity between creation and covenant ethics) and critique (those defending a more classical covenant-of-works formulation or different readings of Kline).
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching covenant continuity, for grounding Sabbath theology in creation, and for prompting re-examination of how Genesis frames later covenantal obligations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Creation** - Genesis 1-2 as an original covenant establishing obligations (mandate, sabbath), blessings, and covenantal authority.
- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)** - The idea that the Mosaic or Adamic covenant contains substantive elements of "works"; Gentry reframes these elements as rooted in creation covenantal norms.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - Read in continuity with creation; not absolute replacement but specific administration of creation-order obligations.
- **Klinean intrusion ethics** - Meredith Kline's model that divine commands "intrude" into history; Gentry engages and nuances Kline's juridical model by stressing creation's ongoing normative status.
- **Sabbath ethic** - Interpreted as an ordinance of the creation covenant rather than a post-Sin Mosaic imposition.
- **Image-bearing / dominion mandate** - Covenantal duties given at creation that structure human vocation and covenant responsibility.
- **Federal headship (Adam-Christ typology)** - Uses creation-covenant framework to clarify how Adam's role anticipates Christ's federal headship.
- **Covenantal continuity** - The hermeneutical principle insisting redemptive covenants presuppose creation-order norms.
- **Royal grant vs. covenant contract** - Engagement with genre-theory; Gentry favors covenantal reading of creation over purely royal-grant models.
- **Normative creation-order / natural revelation** - Creation as a continuing source of divine normative disclosure relevant to law and ethics.
- **Canonical frame** - Genesis as the canonical lens for reading later covenants.
- **Substance vs. form** - Distinguishes the underlying covenantal substance (creation obligations) from later legal forms (Mosaic stipulations).
- **Typology and redemptive-historical reading** - Uses covenant of creation to inform Christological typology and covenant-historical continuity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for courses on covenant theology and Sabbath doctrine.
 - As a **polemic/critical resource** against narrow or purely juridical readings of the covenant of works (notably Klinean strictures).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Mosaic law and Sabbath in continuity with Genesis and for framing Adam-Christ typology.
