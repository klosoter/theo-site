### TITLE
The Same God Who Works All Things - Adonis Vidu

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary Reformed theological scholarship (early 21st century). Engages postliberal and confessional Reformed traditions while addressing debates in analytic philosophy of religion, historical theology, and pastoral theology about God's control, prayer, and suffering.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** God is the provident Lord who actively and continually works all things without negating genuine creaturely agency. The book seeks to recover a robust doctrine of providence that is both faithful to Reformed confessional commitments and responsive to modern challenges (deism, open theism, process thought, naturalistic explanations).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical and biblical exegesis establishing scriptural patterns for divine action (creation, preservation, governance).
 - Theological retrieval of Reformed orthodox formulations (decree, concurrence, preservation) with critical appropriation.
 - Philosophical clarification of divine and creaturely causation (primary/secondary causality; freedom and contingency).
 - Practical and pastoral implications: prayer, providential suffering, divine hiddenness, Christian assurance.
 - Concluding constructive proposal: a covenantal-trinitarian account of providence that grounds God's comprehensive activity in the faithful life of the triune God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and Reformed Orthodox writers, Augustine, selected modern analytic philosophers of religion, critics including open theists and process theologians; engages contemporary Reformed voices for constructive dialogue.
- **Doctrines treated:** Providence (central); also touches on God's sovereignty, decree, concurrence, creation, providential governance, freedom, prayer, theodicy, and implicitly the Trinity and covenant as theological contexts.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** God's providential action is neither remote determinism nor passive absence but the faithful, pervasive working of the triune God who preserves, governs, and brings good out of contingent creatures and events.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Whole-life providence:** Emphasizes that God's work is not limited to occasional intervention; he works in all spheres (cosmic, historical, personal) in a unified manner.
- **Covenantal framing:** Situates providence primarily within covenantal faithfulness rather than abstract metaphysics, linking divine governance to God's promises and relations with creatures.
- **Reformed retrieval with philosophical clarity:** Reclaims classical Reformed doctrines (decree, concurrence, preservation) while using recent analytic tools to clarify causal language and avoid caricatures of determinism.
- **Balancing sovereignty and contingency:** Argues robust divine control can coexist with authentic creaturely contingency and moral responsibility, avoiding both deterministic fatalism and the undercutting of divine providence.
- **Pastoral sensitivity:** Connects doctrine to prayer, suffering, and hope-showing how a strong doctrine of providence supports Christian comfort and discipleship.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** Challenges open theism and process theology for truncating divine sovereignty; critiques simplistic compatibilist readings that efface creaturely freedom; seeks a middle path that preserves biblical categories.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Uses a covenant-trinitarian vocabulary to reconceive classical notions like concurrence and preservation as relational acts of a faithful God rather than merely metaphysical operations.
- **Reception and influence:** Valued in Reformed academic circles as a clear, modern articulation of providence; used in seminary courses on doctrine of God and practical theology; influential among those seeking an alternative to both libertarian and deterministic extremes.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a careful, teachable framework for integrating biblical exegesis, historical theology, and analytic philosophy on providence-useful for preaching, pastoral care, and advanced study.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Providence:** God's ongoing activity of preserving, governing, and directing creation toward his purposes.
- **Concurrence:** The doctrine that God cooperates with secondary causes so that created actions are genuinely theirs while also being God-ordained.
- **Preservation:** God's sustaining action that keeps creation in existence moment by moment.
- **Decree (eternal):** God's eternal will by which he ordains ends and means-presented in covenantal and relational terms.
- **Primary/secondary causality:** Distinction used to explain how God is the primary cause without eliminating secondary, creaturely causation.
- **Contingency and freedom:** Affirmation that creatures are contingent and morally responsible, even under divine providence.
- **Covenantal-trinitarian framework:** Interprets providence as rooted in the faithful relations of the Trinity and God's covenantal commitments.
- **Theodicy / suffering:** Providence is linked to God's redemptive purposes; suffering is addressed pastorally without reducing it to a problem solvable by abstract metaphysics.
- **Prayer and providence:** Prayer is portrayed as real participation in God's governance, not mere petition to a distant Deity.
- **Hiddenness / assurance:** Providential hiddenness is reframed as part of covenantal faithfulness that calls for trust.
- **Divine sovereignty:** Robustly affirmed but reinterpreted to preserve relational and ethical dimensions.
- **Concurrence paradox:** The problem of how God can cause without coercing-Vidu offers a covenantal solution rooted in relational agency.
- **Faithful operation (operari):** Emphasizes God's active, faithful working in history and personal life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **doctrinal definition source** for contemporary Reformed accounts of providence.
- As a **polemic resource** against open theism and process approaches.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading biblical texts about God's activity in history.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking systematic theology, philosophy of religion, and pastoral theology.
