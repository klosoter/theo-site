### TITLE
The Significance of Covenants in Biblical Theology (SBJT 2012) - Peter J. Gentry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2012 in SBJT; situated in contemporary Reformed/biblical-theological scholarship reacting to both classic Reformed covenant theology and newer movements (dispensationalism; progressive covenantalism). Gentry writes from an evangelical, covenantal standpoint with attention to systematic and exegetical consonance.
- **Central thesis:** Covenants are the primary organizing principle of Scripture; reading the Bible covenantally yields a coherent, Christ-centered redemptive-historical progression in which covenants reveal how God orders law, promise, and salvation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establish covenants as theological and canonical lenses rather than merely legal instruments.
 - Trace major covenantal stages (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) and show their mutual continuity and development toward Christ.
 - Analyze the character of the Mosaic covenant within that trajectory, arguing for its legal/works dimension while locating it functionally within the covenant of grace economy.
 - Respond to rival schema (dispensational discontinuity; some progressive covenantal readings) and defend a unified covenantal framework that preserves both law and promise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Reformed covenantal tradition (Calvinic and post-Reformation synthesis).
 - Modern interlocutors: dispensational critics (emphasizing discontinuity) and progressive covenantalists (emphasizing typological/eschatological reading over legal categories).
 - Scholarly conversation with interpreters who treat the Mosaic covenant as carrying a "works" modality (e.g., Klinean strains) and those who deny such categorization.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (canon and hermeneutics), covenant (structure and typology), law and gospel, Christology (fulfillment and telos of covenants), soteriology (federal headship and obedience), ecclesiology (people of God continuity).
- **Closing line:** Gentry situates covenant theology as the indispensible hermeneutic for reading Scripture Christocentrically: covenants are the scaffolding that preserves continuity of God's saving plan while accounting for typological progression toward the New Covenant in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats covenants primarily as canonical-structural categories rather than merely doctrinal abstractions; emphasizes their function in biblical narrative and canonical theology.
 - Balances the juridical/works features of certain covenants with the overarching presence of promise and grace - resisting both reduction to mere law or mere promise.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects dispensationalism by arguing for fundamental continuity and shared promises across covenants, challenging sharp epochal breaks.
 - Qualifies some progressive-covenantalist tendencies that downplay the Mosaic covenant's legal/works character; insists on analytic precision when calling covenants "grace" or "works" types.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reasserts language such as "covenant of works as to substance" for the Mosaic arrangement while insisting on its typological role within the covenant of grace economy - a calibrated synthesis rather than wholesale adoption of any single prior label.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued among Reformed and evangelical biblical theologians as a robust defense of covenantal reading against dispensational critiques.
 - Taken up by teachers and pastors seeking a clear redemptive-historical framework that preserves both law and promise.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a succinct, defensible model for organizing biblical theology around covenants; useful for exegetes, systematicians, and homileticians who require both canonical sensitivity and theological rigor.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenantal hermeneutic:** Reading Scripture through covenantal structures as the primary organizing principle.
- **Adamic covenant:** The original covenantal order; foundational for federal-headship and the law/promises distinction.
- **Covenant of works:** Covenant paradigm emphasizing law/obligation; historically linked to Adam; used by Gentry to describe substantive aspects of Mosaic stipulations.
- **Covenant of grace:** The redemptive promise-structure fulfilled in Christ, undergirding successive covenants.
- **Mosaic covenant:** Treated as possessing a **works-as-to-substance** character but functioning typologically within the covenant of grace; legal demands highlight obedience while pointing to Christ's fulfillment.
- **Typology / redemptive-historical progression:** Covenants as stages that prefigure and culminate in Christ; continuity maintained through recurring promises and figures.
- **Continuity / discontinuity:** Key analytic pair; Gentry argues for significant continuity with calibrated distinctions, opposing sharp dispensational breaks.
- **Law and promise dynamic:** How covenantal law functions under promise - law exposes sin and anticipates Christ; promise secures salvation.
- **Federal headship:** Corporate representation (Adam, Christ) as the mechanism for covenant blessings or curses.
- **Fulfillment in Christ:** Covenants culminate and find their telos in the person and work of Jesus.
- **Exegetical model:** Gentry offers covenantal mapping as an interpretive grid for reading covenant texts.
- **Polemic uses:** 
 - Employed against dispensationalism to argue for canonical unity and covenantal continuity.
 - Used within intra-Reformed debates to defend readings that describe the Mosaic covenant as having a covenant-of-works character "as to substance" while preserving its place in the economy of grace.
