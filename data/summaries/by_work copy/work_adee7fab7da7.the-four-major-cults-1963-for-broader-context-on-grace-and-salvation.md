### TITLE
**Anthony A. Hoekema, The Four Major Cults (1963): Rival Authorities and the Eclipse of Grace**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1960s North American Reformed apologetics; growing visibility of Jehovahs Witnesses, Latter-day Saints, Christian Science, and Seventh-day Adventists; debates on biblical authority, modern sects, and evangelical identity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Groups that claim Christian identity yet add or supplant Scripture with new authorities inevitably distort the gospel of sovereign grace, leading to defective views of God, Christ, salvation, and the last things.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - For each movement: origins and founders; sources of authority; doctrinal system (God, Christ, man, sin, salvation, church, last things); practical ethos; theological evaluation.
 - Demonstrates a recurring pattern: extra-biblical authority -> hermeneutical control -> Christological reduction -> soteriological legalism or denial of sin -> eschatological misplacement of hope.
 - Offers concise biblical counters grounded in Reformed confessional theology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Primary sources (Watchtower literature, NWT; LDS Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price; Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health; Ellen G. White, SDA doctrinal statements); earlier critics (e.g., van Baalen); classic Reformed dogmatics (Bavinck, Berkhof) and confessional norms (Three Forms of Unity, Westminster).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and canon; Trinity and Christology; anthropology (original sin, guilt, pollution, death); soteriology (grace, faith, repentance, regeneration, justification, sanctification, merit); ecclesial authority; eschatology (judgment, eternal states).
- **Closing line:** The book locates the heart of the matter in the sovereignty of divine grace in Christ versus the absolutizing of human or institutional authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Authority diagnostic:** A sustained linkage from extra-biblical revelation to soteriological error.
 - **Grace-centered critique:** Measures systems by their treatment of sin, the cross, and the freeness of salvation.
 - **Pastoral-apologetic tone:** Clear yet restrained; urges informed engagement rather than caricature.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Contrasts Trinitarian, Chalcedonian orthodoxy with JW anti-Trinitarianism and LDS theogony.
 - Opposes legalistic or investigative schemes (SDA sanctuary doctrine) to justification by faith.
 - Counters Christian Science denial of matter, sin, and death with biblical realism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Cults** defined theologically (claims Christian identity; adds new, controlling authority; deviates on central dogmas), not sociologically.
 - Highlights **hermeneutical authoritarianism** as the mechanism of control.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became a Reformed standard prior to Walter Martins later synthesis; valued for primary-source fidelity.
 - Contested especially regarding SDA classification, yet remains a reference point in Reformed curricula.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A map of how distortions of revelation cascade across loci.
 - A compact resource for contrasting ordo salutis by grace with works-based schemes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Extra-biblical authority:** New scriptures or inspired interpreters (Watchtower, Eddy, White, LDS canon) that norm Scripture.
- **Hermeneutical authoritarianism:** Institutional control of interpretation (e.g., NWT; prophetic rulings) that secures doctrinal conformity.
- **Trinity and Christology:** Tests of orthodoxy; denial or diminution leads to altered salvation.
- **Original sin (guilt, pollution, death):** Biblical anthropology rejected or minimized (esp. Christian Science), undermining need for grace.
- **Common grace vs saving grace:** Clarifies that providential kindness differs from regenerating grace; cults often blur or bypass saving grace.
- **Regeneration and effectual calling:** Monergistic new birth versus organizational initiation or moral reform.
- **Faith and repentance:** Evangelical response to the gospel, contrasted with institutional loyalty or ritual performance.
- **Justification vs sanctification:** Forensic acceptance in Christ versus life-long growth; legalism collapses the distinction.
- **Good works and merit:** Proper fruit of grace, not the ground; cultic systems tend toward merit schemas.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** Reformed frame exposing return-to-works tendencies in sectarian ethics.
- **Historia salutis vs ordo salutis:** Christ-accomplished redemption distinguished from its application; confusion yields perfectionism or investigative schemes.
- **Final judgment and eternal states:** JW annihilationism and SDA conditional immortality critiqued; affirms bodily resurrection and eternal destinies.
- **Assurance:** Grounded in Christ and promise, not in institutional standing or performance metrics.
- **Scripture and canon:** Sufficiency and clarity versus additive canons and controlled translations.

- **How the work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for cult in theological (not merely sociological) terms.
 - As a **polemic and diagnostic** for tracing authority errors into soteriological and eschatological deviations.
 - As a **teaching aid** to contrast Reformed ordo salutis with works-centered alternatives.
 - As an **exegetical caution** about translation control and interpretive monopolies.
