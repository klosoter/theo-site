### TITLE
The Power of Godliness (1657, posthumous) - John Ball

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritan milieu; published posthumously (1657) in the aftermath of Civil War-era religious ferment and amid active debates about church order, sanctification, and assurance.
 - Reflects pastoral concerns of the Reformed/Puritan tradition: interior piety, public morality, and the ordering of the covenant community.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - True godliness is not mere profession or external conformity but an operative, spiritual *power* rooted in union with Christ and enacted through the covenantal economy of grace; the primary pastoral problem is distinguishing authentic saving religion from nominalism and antinomian license.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: widespread formalism and superficial religion produce social and spiritual decay.
 - Theological foundation: Scripture and Reformed doctrine teach that godliness flows from effectual calling and the Covenant of Grace, producing measurable sanctification.
 - Practical outworking: means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer, discipline) are instruments through which divine power effects holiness in believers and the church.
 - Pastoral application: tests of true godliness, pastoral methods for cultivating experiential faith, and critiques of rival positions (formalism, antinomianism, popish sacramentarianism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy reliance on Scripture; conversant with Calvinist soteriology and mainstream Puritan pastoral theology.
 - Implied engagement with contemporary Puritan figures and debates (e.g., positions similar to those found in Owen, Howe, Baxter), and polemical contrast with antinomian tendencies and Roman sacramental claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification and union with Christ, justification (as background), assurance, Covenant of Grace, means of grace and sacramental efficacy, church discipline and ecclesiology, practical ethics.
- **Closing line**
 - A compact Puritan manifesto: **godliness is an inward, covenantal power manifested in sanctified life and social order - sustained by the Covenant of Grace and realized through the means of grace.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses the language of *power* to describe godliness: emphasizes causality (grace produces effect) rather than mere status or outward conformity.
 - Stresses a tight link between private experiential piety and public ecclesial health.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects formalism by insisting on experiential marks of grace.
 - Opposes antinomian readings that sever moral obligation from justification; opposes Roman Catholic sacramentalism that locates power primarily in rites rather than covenantal promise and Spirit-work.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames sanctification as a power-disposition: godliness functions like a formative energy within the covenant community.
 - Articulates tests of godliness that combine internal affections with outward fruits in the covenantal setting.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but steady influence in Reformed pastoral literature; cited among Puritan devotional and catechetical resources.
 - Served later pastors and theologians as a concise pastoral-theological statement linking covenant theology and sanctification.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Useful as a case study in Puritan pastoral theology, covenantal piety, and debates over assurance and antinomianism.
 - Helpful for courses on Reformed sanctification, pastoral theology, and the practical implications of Covenant of Grace formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Godliness (piety)** - operative spiritual power producing moral transformation, not merely external conformity.
- **Power of Godliness** - central phrase: godliness conceived as active, efficacious grace.
- **Covenant of Grace** - primary theological ground for assurance and sanctification; the work's anchor (see site topic: Covenant Of Grace).
- **Effectual calling** - the divine act by which believers are united to Christ and given the capacity for true godliness.
- **Sanctification** - progressive moral transformation; the visible measure of authentic covenantal membership.
- **Means of grace** - preaching, sacraments, prayer, discipline as channels through which God exerts the power of godliness.
- **Assurance** - experiential confidence grounded in covenantal promises and the fruits of godliness.
- **Antinomianism** - rejected; the work argues that genuine grace necessarily yields moral obligation and fruit.
- **Formalism (nominalism)** - doctrine critiqued: profession without power is spiritually bankrupt.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - evaluated by covenantal promise and Spirit-work rather than ritualism alone.
- **Church discipline & polity** - practical outworking: community structures enforce and cultivate godliness.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological basis for the power of godliness.
- **Pastoral tests of grace** - short lists of marks distinguishing true from false piety.
- **Reformed covenant theology** - situates sanctification within the Covenant of Grace (see site topic: Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition).
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the phrase "power of godliness" in Puritan/Reformed pastoral theology.
 - As a **polemic** against formalism and antinomianism within 17th-century English Protestant debates.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for linking covenant doctrine to means of grace and congregational discipline.
