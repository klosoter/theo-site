### TITLE
**Peter Lombard, Sentences (Libri Sententiarum) - medieval commentaries (notably Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Composed mid-12th century (c. 1150s) by Peter Lombard; became the standard theological textbook in cathedral schools and nascent universities throughout the 13th century.
 - The scholastic milieu: synthesis of patristic authorities with developing dialectical method; increasing reception of Aristotelian categories by later commentators.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To provide a systematic compilation of authoritative sententiae (patristic, canonical, scriptural statements) arranged to enable resolution of theological questions concerning God, creation, Incarnation, sacraments and last things.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Four books: (1) Trinity and God, (2) Creation and sin (incl. angels, man, original sin), (3) Incarnation and virtues, (4) Sacraments and eschatology.
 - Method: presentation of authorities, posing of disputed questions, reference to sententiae, followed by quaestio-style resolution - promoting harmonization of authorities through dialectical distinction.
 - Major argumentative moves:
 - Use of patristic citations as primary data points.
 - Employment of logical distinctions (persona/natura, genus/species, causa) to solve apparent contradictions.
 - Development of sacramental theology as the locus where doctrinal theory and pastoral practice meet.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary authorities: Augustine, Gregory the Great, Jerome, Ambrose, pseudo-Dionysius, Gratian (canon law).
 - Major medieval commentators: Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, William of Auxerre, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus later engaged the Sentences as training text.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, God's attributes, creation, angels, anthropology, original sin, Incarnation (hypostatic union), **communicatio idiomatum**, grace, justification, sacraments, ecclesiology, eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - The Sentences function as the medieval curricular nucleus: a patristically rooted, dialectically organized handbook that channels theological energy into the central medieval problems of person/nature, grace/sin, and the sacramental mediation of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic juxtaposition of patristic authority rather than original speculative treatise: Lombard privileges *auctoritas* over speculative novelty.
 - A pastoral-ecclesial framing: sacraments and law receive sustained treatment as means of grace within the life of the Church.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond loose patristic commentary by imposing scholastic ordering and explicit distinctions; differs from purely Augustinian or Dionysian streams by pragmatic arrangement for dispute.
 - Aquinas and Bonaventure use Lombard as a conversational platform - Aquinas refracts Sentences through Aristotelian metaphysics, Bonaventure through Augustinian-mystical anthropology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Standardization of the four-book schema as a pedagogical device.
 - Systematization of distinctions (e.g., degrees of causality, modes of predication) that become technical vocabulary in later scholasticism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Remained the obligatory textbook for bachelor and master-level theology; every major medieval theologian wrote a "commentary on the Sentences."
 - In Reformed and later Protestant contexts: the Sentences became a target of critique as emblematic of scholastic method; nonetheless Reformers and post-Reform scholastics often engaged its questions and distinctions (e.g., on sacrament, justification).
- **Enduring value**
 - Essential for understanding medieval doctrinal development, the history of theological method, and how particular doctrines (especially Christology and sacramental theology) were problematized and resolved in premodern theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sententiae / Libri Sententiarum** - Lombard's collected authoritative statements organized for scholastic debate.
- **Quaestio** - the question-and-answer disputational unit used in commentaries; the procedural backbone of scholastic argument.
- **Auctoritas** - patristic and canonical citations treated as primary theological data.
- **Distinctio** - logical distinction employed to resolve apparent contradictions among authorities.
- **Persona / Natura** - technical distinction (person vs nature) central to Christological formulations and debates.
- **Hypostatic Union** - the doctrine that underlies Christological solutions in the Sentences and its commentaries.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - the rule permitting attribution of properties of the divine and human natures to the single Person of Christ; medieval commentators refine kinds (e.g., genus, causal, or appropriative modes) and apply it to soteriology and sacramental language.
 - Contrast: appropriation (appropriatio) vs strict identity of natures; used to adjudicate statements like "God suffered" or "the human nature is omnipotent" by clarifying predicational modes.
- **Sacramentum** - sacrament as sign and instrument of grace; a principal locus in Book IV discussions.
- **Gratia / Justificatio** - Lombard frames debates on grace that later scholastics dissect with Aristotelian causality.
- **Lex / Iustitia** - law and righteousness discussed in relation to grace, merit, and ecclesial order.
- **Affectio / Moral Virtues** - moral theology receives a systematic account linking virtues to sacramental life and salvation.
- **Responsio / Determinatio** - concluding moves in quaestiones where commentators give their determinations grounded in authority and reason.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - authoritative citations and technical distinctions used to define medieval theological terms.
- **Polemic** - a battleground for later Reformers and scholastics over sacraments, justification, and method.
- **Exegetical model** - exemplifies how patristic exegesis is harmonized via scholastic distinction.
- **Conceptual pivot** - supplies the problem-sets (person/nature, sacrament/word, grace/law) that shape subsequent systematic theologies.
