### TITLE
**Augustine, Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late Augustine (c. 421); pastoral-catechetical manual written to Laurentius; post-Nicene, Latin Catholic milieu; composed amid anti-Manichaean and anti-Pelagian controversies; mature synthesis of Augustine on creation, grace, and the Christian life.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** A compact guide to Christian doctrine ordered by the theological virtues, showing how faith (what is believed), hope (what is prayed for), and love (how we live) cohere in Christ by the Spirit to the glory of the triune God; addresses the problem of evil within providence and the necessity of grace for salvation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Faith (Creed):** Exposition of the Apostles Creed; one God, Trinity of persons; creation ex nihilo; the incarnation of the Mediator; sin and original guilt; the cross as sacrifice; resurrection and life everlasting; evil as privation and divine providence that brings good from evil.
 - **Hope (Prayer):** Exposition of the Lord's Prayer as the content of Christian hope; petitions train desire for God's kingdom, daily provision, forgiveness, deliverance; perseverance and the eschatological fulfillment in the vision of God.
 - **Love (Morality):** Charity as the form of all virtues and fulfillment of the law; ordering of loves; good works as fruit of grace; the Spirit poured into hearts enabling obedience; the church as the forgiven community.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Scripture (especially Genesis, Psalms, Gospels, Romans), Apostles Creed, Lord's Prayer; Nicene trinitarian settlement; against Manichaeans (substantial evil) and Pelagians (autonomous merit); pastoral concerns raised by Donatists (church and forgiveness).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and the rule of faith; creation/providence and theodicy; Trinity and divine missions; Christology of the Mediator; sin, grace, predestination, justification, perseverance; Spirit and sanctification; sacraments (esp. baptism); church and forgiveness; eschatology/beatific vision; unity of the two Testaments.
- **Closing line:** The whole Christian life is rightly ordered love, grounded in faith's confession and sustained by hope's prayer, as God in Christ by the Spirit heals sin and brings his saints to the enjoyment of himself.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Tripartite catechesis by **faith-hope-love** aligning Creed, Prayer, and Life.
 - **Privatio boni:** evil as lack of good; God permits evil to draw forth greater good.
 - **Grace first and last:** prevenient, operative grace gives faith, renews the will, and grants perseverance.
 - **Spirit as Love and Gift:** charity poured into hearts is the Spirit's own work and presence.
 - **Missions reflect processions:** the Son and Spirit sent in time from the Father (and the Son) without dividing the one divine work.
- **Corrections/contrasts:**
 - Against **Manichaeism:** no co-eternal evil; creation is good, evil parasitic.
 - Against **Pelagianism:** no saving good without grace; merit itself is God's gift.
 - Nuanced **freedom under grace:** affirms responsible will yet denies autonomous initiation of faith.
 - Church as a **forgiven community** over against rigorist purity claims.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves:**
 - **Rule of faith** as hermeneutic; **Lord's Prayer** as a map of hope.
 - **Ordo amoris** and the contrast of **use/enjoyment** (uti/frui) to direct life toward God.
 - **Appropriation** language for Trinitarian operations; **sacrament as sign** with res.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Classic Western catechetical model; mined by medievals and Reformers.
 - Reformed theology appropriates Augustine on original sin, grace, perseverance, and the Trinity; echoes in confessions on providence and the use of Creed/Prayer for catechesis.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A compact, doctrinally rich map linking Trinity, Christology, soteriology, and ethics.
 - Pedagogically powerful: anchors dogma in worship and discipleship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
