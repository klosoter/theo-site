### TITLE
Examination of the Council of Trent (Examen Concilii Tridentini) - Martin Chemnitz

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in Latin by Martin Chemnitz (1522-1586) and published across the 1560s-1570s as the Lutheran systematic reply to the Council of Trent (1545-1563).
 - Situated in the post-Reformation confessional consolidation period; part of early Lutheran scholastic engagement with Roman Catholic doctrinal formulations.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Council of Trent's decrees depart from Scripture and the patristic tradition; Chemnitz aims to demonstrate the theological errors and to defend classical Lutheran doctrine (especially justification) against Tridentine definitions.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodical, clause-by-clause examination of Trent's canons and decrees:
 - Historical-critical appeal to Scripture and Church Fathers to test Trent's claims.
 - Theological analysis of each locus: justification, sacraments, mass, penance, indulgences, ecclesiastical authority, Marian and devotional doctrines.
 - Forensic defense of sola fide and critique of synergistic and merit-based soteriology.
 - Repeated pattern: state the Tridentine text, expose tensions with Scripture/patristic witness, offer Lutheran alternative and theological justification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Council of Trent and its authoritative pronouncements.
 - Sources: Scripture, patristic corpus, medieval scholastics (critically), Roman theologians, and Lutheran confessions (Augsburg, Smalcald Articles).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, grace and merit, original sin; sacraments (Eucharist, baptism, penance), mass as sacrifice, transubstantiation vs. sacramental union; ecclesiology and papal authority; indulgences, Purgatory, Marian doctrines; Christology (notably communicatio idiomatum) as it bears on Eucharistic presence and soteriology.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Chemnitz insists that true doctrine is Scripture-bound and patristically grounded: justification by faith alone and the Lutheran account of sacraments must stand against Trent's mixture of Scripture, tradition, and juridical formulations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous, juridical-polemical method: textual, historical, and theological triage of Trent's canons.
 - High value placed on patristic consensus as a corrective to late-medieval innovations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Challenges Trent's sacramental and soteriological formulations while correcting what Lutherans saw as both medieval excesses and Roman use of "works-righteousness."
 - Distinguishes Lutheran sacramental doctrine (sacramental union, real presence) from Roman transubstantiation and from Reformed symbolic readings.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes Lutheran responses using emerging scholastic categories without abandoning confessional roots; clarifies technical uses of communicatio idiomatum in Lutheran Christology and Eucharistic theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a principal Lutheran refutation of Trent; highly influential for Lutheran orthodoxy and later polemics.
 - Used by both confessional Lutherans and later historians as a primary source for Protestant-Catholic controversies of the 16th century.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of confessional apologetics: thorough, evidenced, and patristically attentive; still valuable for studies of doctrinal formation, ecumenical dialogue, and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Examen Concilii Tridentini**
 - Chemnitz's systematic critique of the Council of Trent; the work's title and programmatic aim.
- **Council of Trent**
 - The Roman Catholic council (1545-1563) whose decrees are the target of the Examen.
- **Justification (iustificatio)**
 - Central dispute: forensic, monergistic justification by faith versus Trent's affirmation of infused grace and cooperative human response.
- **Grace and merit**
 - Chemnitz opposes Tridentine teaching that mixes habitual grace with human merit; affirms sola gratia/sola fide.
- **Sacraments**
 - Detailed critique of Trent's sacramental theology; defense of Lutheran sacramental union and limits on sacramental efficacy.
- **Transubstantiation vs. Sacramental Union**
 - Chemnitz rejects Roman transubstantiation; defends the real, sacramental presence ("in, with, under") against both Roman and purely symbolic accounts.
- **Mass as sacrifice**
 - Trenchant rebuttal of Trent's characterization of the Mass as propitiatory sacrifice; reframes Eucharist as communion and proclamation of Christ's one sacrifice.
- **Purgatory / Indulgences**
 - Critique of Trent's reaffirmation; defends sufficiency of Christ's merit and criticizes juridical/monetary abuses.
- **Papal authority / Tradition**
 - Argues Scripture's supremacy and patristic limits the papal claims and late-traditional additions found at Trent.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Chemnitz employs this Christological principle to:
 - Explain how divine attributes can be coherently connected to the human nature of Christ without confusion.
 - Support Lutheran Eucharistic claims about the real presence and the possibility of Christ's presence at many places by virtue of the personal union (used against Roman transubstantiation and Reformed denials of ubiquity).
- **Real presence**
 - Affirmed as a real, sacramental union rooted in the person of Christ; not to be conflated with transubstantiation.
- **Forensic language**
 - Use of juridical categories (imputation, declaration) to articulate justification doctrine.
- **Patristic appeal**
 - Frequent citation of Church Fathers as normative interpretive witnesses.
- **Use across loci**
 - Polemic: primary refutation of Tridentine canons in confessional disputes.
 - Doctrinal definition: source for Lutheran positions on justification, sacraments, and Christology.
 - Exegetical and historical model: exemplar of patristic-scholastic method applied to council documents.
