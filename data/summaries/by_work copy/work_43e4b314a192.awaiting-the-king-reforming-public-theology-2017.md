### TITLE
Awaiting the King: Reforming Public Theology (James K. A. Smith, 2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published amid renewed interest in Christian civic engagement, liturgical theology, and cultural formation (post-2000s evangelical and Reformed conversations). Smith addresses discipleship-shaped public theology as a corrective to abstract, neutrality-assuming models of church-state relations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Public theology must be reformed around an **eschatological imagination**: Christians participate in the public sphere not primarily by offering neutral policy blueprints but by embodying practices that anticipate the coming kingdom. Cultural change is driven by formation (liturgies), not only ideas.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modern public theology presumes an atomized, cognitive subject and treats culture as a problem to be solved by argument.
 - Anthropological correction: human beings are **liturgical animals** formed by practices and loves; therefore formation precedes persuasion.
 - Eschatological frame: the church lives between inauguration and consummation - it is a pilgrim body that practices alternative social worship.
 - Practical outworking: reform public theology toward practices, institutions, and embodied witness (education, liturgy, civic rituals) that embody the King's coming.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Philosophical and social formation: Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor.
 - Theological and public-theological interlocutors: H. Richard Niebuhr (Christ-and-culture debates), Stanley Hauerwas, John Calvin and Augustine as formative resources.
 - Cultural criticism and pedagogy: engagement with contemporary church practice and secular institutional formation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (primary), anthropology (the Fall and formation), ecclesiology (church as embodied witness), sacramental imagination and worship, public theology methodology; secondary interaction with Christology and covenantal motifs insofar as they shape missional identity.
- **Closing line:** Smith's theological center of gravity: the church's chief public task is to form people liturgically as citizens of the coming kingdom - to live now the future they proclaim.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **formation over information**: conversion of loves via practices rather than mere propositional argument.
 - Recasts public theology as a set of embodied practices that anticipate eschatological fulfillment - "waiting" as political and theological posture.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Challenges liberal/neutral public theology that assumes rational persuasion will reshape culture; rebukes models that ignore the formative power of noncognitive practices.
 - Reorients Niebuhr-style Christ-and-culture categories toward an **inaugurated eschatology**: neither full accommodation nor total withdrawal, but faithful anticipatory presence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Liturgies of the heart" / cultural liturgies: secular institutions as formative rituals that shape affections.
 - "Awaiting" as a theological posture that grounds civic witness in patient, embodied anticipation rather than triumphalism or retreat.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles for rethinking public witness; influential in theological education, Christian higher education, and discussions of cultural formation.
 - Crosses disciplines: used by ethicists, liturgiologists, and political theologians to bridge worship and public engagement.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a durable methodological pivot: practice-centered public theology that integrates liturgical theology, anthropology, and eschatology for formation-focused discipleship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Awaiting** - Orienting posture of the church between inauguration and consummation; grounds patience and witness.
- **Eschatological imagination** - Reading present cultural action through the lens of the coming kingdom; shapes priorities for public engagement.
- **Liturgies (cultural and ecclesial)** - Practices (rituals, routines) that form desires and habits; secular institutions are treated as rival liturgies.
 - Cultural liturgies = nonchurch practices that cultivate loves contrary to the gospel.
- **Liturgies of the heart** - Interiorized formations that result from habitual practices; explain durable moral change.
- **Formation over information** - Educational axiom: practices shape people more deeply than propositions alone.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - Kingdom is already but not yet; church's witness is participatory and anticipatory.
- **Public theology (reformed)** - A theology that attends to how ecclesial practices bear upon public life, not merely policy stances.
- **Anthropology of desire** - Humans are desire-driven creatures; conversion requires reorientation of loves.
- **The Fall and its consequences** - Smith emphasizes sin's social and formative consequences: corruption of practices and institutions that then function as rival liturgies.
- **Christ-and-culture critique** - Smith revises classical typologies (e.g., Niebuhr) by insisting on eschatological practices rather than static categories.
- **Embodiment** - The church's public witness must be incarnational, using bodies and institutions as sites of formation.
- **Civic friendship / civic practices** - Practical initiatives (schools, congregational engagement) that cultivate common goods in anticipatory fashion.
- **Sacramental imagination** - Practices and signs that mediate the kingdom's presence; not only sacraments but everyday rituals.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating liturgical theology with public/political theology.
 - As a **definition source** for formation-centered anthropology and critiques of secular neutrality.
 - As a **polemic/resource** in debates about Christians' civic posture (engagement vs. accommodation), offering an eschatological alternative to both.
