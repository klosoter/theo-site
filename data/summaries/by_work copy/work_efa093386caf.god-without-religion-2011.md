### TITLE
God Without Religion (2011) - Andrew S. Farley

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2011 amid a rising "grace movement" within evangelicalism that reacted against perceived legalism in American church culture.
 - Situated in charismatic/evangelical pastoral literature but aiming at theological correction of lay and ministerial practice.
- **Central thesis**
 - The problem is not God but "religion": systems of rules, self-effort, and performance that distort the gospel.
 - True Christian identity rests on the finished work of Christ; believers are already accepted, forgiven, and righteous in Christ (positional realities). Sanctification is therefore both **definitive** (what God has declared) and **progressive** (the ongoing experiential outworking), not a ladder of merit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic opening: defines "religion" as human attempts to earn God's favor; documents pastoral and personal harms.
 - Exegetical claim: reads key Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) to stress imputation, justification by faith, and freedom from the law.
 - Pastoral application: offers a paradigm shift from behavior-driven spirituality to identity-driven transformation; practical steps for living in grace.
 - Polemical chapters: counters popular legalistic piety and certain motivational Christianities that rely on guilt, shame, or performance to produce holiness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Pauline corpus as normative source (Romans/Galatians).
 - Engages implicitly with streams of evangelical legalism, "lordship salvation" type critiques, and charismatic/pastoral practice.
 - Alludes to historical categories (justification, imputation) rather than sustained engagement with systematic theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, imputation, finished work)
 - Sanctification (treated as both definitive/positional and progressive/experiential)
 - Ecclesiology and pastoral theology (how churches form believers)
 - Briefly touches on law and gospel distinction, Christian identity, and the nature of repentance and obedience.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on a single theological gravity: Christians must live out of who they are in Christ (positional grace) rather than scrambling under religion's demands; sanctification flows from declared righteousness, not as its condition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between "religion" (human performance systems) and authentic Christianity as a relationship grounded in Christ's finished work.
 - Insistence that sanctification is rooted in a definitive, positional reality-"you are already righteous"-which then enables progressive growth without performance-based identity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pastoral methods that use fear, guilt, or law to motivate obedience; contrasts with motivational salvation-by-works tendencies in some evangelical praxis.
 - Pushes back against interpretations of sanctification that make progressive experiential growth the basis of acceptance rather than the fruit of it.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes language that frames religion as the main adversary for modern Christians rather than merely sin or the world.
 - Reframes "freedom from the law" in pastoral categories to alleviate spiritual anxiety and foster identity-based discipleship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely popular among lay readers, especially within grace-oriented and charismatic networks; used pastorally to counter legalistic church cultures.
 - Criticized by some Reformed and conservative evangelicals for potential underemphasis on ongoing repentance, accountability, and the role of means of grace.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable corrective for pastors and laity burdened by performance Christianity; a concise pastoral theology stressing positional truths that can reshape pastoral counseling and discipleship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religion**
 - Human systems of performance and rule-keeping that substitute for resting in Christ.
- **Grace**
 - Unmerited favor; the operative principle by which believers are accepted and transformed.
- **Finished work / Christ's finished work**
 - The once-for-all atonement and accomplishment securing justification and identity.
- **Justification**
 - Declarative act of God imputing righteousness; foundational to the book's soteriology.
- **Imputed righteousness**
 - Righteousness accounted to believers by faith, enabling a definitive sanctification claim.
- **Sanctification (Definitive)**
 - Positional holiness: believers are set apart in Christ as a present reality.
- **Sanctification (Progressive)**
 - The experiential, ongoing growth in conformity to Christ arising out of positional reality, not preceding it.
- **Law**
 - Moral/ceremonial demands that are often misused as tools for sanctification in religious systems.
- **Freedom from the law**
 - The believer's liberation from law-based acceptance; freedom used to pursue holiness through grace.
- **Identity in Christ**
 - Core pastoral hinge: conduct and growth flow from who one is, not from attempts to become accepted.
- **Performance-based religion**
 - A diagnosing category for practices that make obedience a currency for divine approval.
- **Repentance and obedience**
 - Treated as fruits and responses to grace, not as purchasing mechanisms for justification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the evangelical-popular distinction between religion and grace-based Christianity.
- As a **pastoral polemic** against legalism and guilt-driven discipleship models.
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing Pauline positional language (useful for courses on Paul, pastoral theology, and sanctification debates).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in counseling and church reform to shift identity formation from behaviorism to gospel identity.
