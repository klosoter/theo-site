### TITLE
The Directory of Church Government (attributed to Thomas Cartwright) - Puritan proposal for Presbyterian polity, offices and discipline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Circulated among English Puritans in the late 16th / early 17th century; attributed to Thomas Cartwright (1535-1603), a leading Puritan ecclesiastic and advocate of continental Reformed church order.
 - Emerges from the Elizabethan Puritan movement pressing the Church of England for reform; interacts with Geneva and Scottish Presbyterian models and with Anglican apologists (e.g., Richard Hooker).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The true biblical form of church government is presbyterial: rule by a plurality of elders (ministers and lay ruling elders), constituted in local sessions, regional presbyteries, provincial synods, and a general assembly - not by an episcopal hierarchy.
 - The work addresses how the church should preserve doctrine, administer sacraments, and exercise discipline independent of episcopal arbiteriness while respecting civil order.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural warrant: appeal to New Testament patterns (apostolic eldership, congregational oversight) and Reformed exegesis to justify presbyterial structures.
 - Offices defined: distinction and duties of ministers/teaching elders, ruling elders, and deacons; procedure and rite for ordination.
 - Courts and appeals: local session responsible for immediate oversight; presbytery for inter-congregational issues; provincial synods and general assembly for wider causes and doctrinal adjudication.
 - Discipline: processes for admonition, suspension, excommunication; safeguards for due process and public correction for scandal or heresy.
 - Church-state relation: the church must exercise spiritual jurisdiction autonomously; civil magistrate may support public order but should not impose episcopal innovations that undermine church purity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Calvinist Geneva and Beza, Scottish Presbyterian practice, Continental Reformed writers, and patristic/New Testament texts; stands in polemic relation to Anglican defenders (Whitgift, Hooker) and Separatists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (office, polity, marks of the true church), sacramentology (administration tied to ordered ministry), authority and discipline, the relation of church and civil magistrate; implicit assumptions about Scripture, covenant order, and pastoral office.
- **Closing line**
 - The Directory argues that ecclesial fidelity requires ordered, collegial eldership and graduated church courts so that doctrine, worship, and discipline are preserved by accountable, corporate ministry rather than hierarchical episcopacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong stress on parity among pastors (no rule of bishops over presbyters) and on the function of lay ruling elders as corporate governors alongside teaching elders.
 - Detailed procedural rules for discipline and appeals, aiming to prevent arbitrary episcopal power and preserve canonical fairness.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Correction of Anglican episcopacy: rejects the divine right of bishops and the medieval hierarchical model; opposes Hookerian appeal to tradition and ecclesiastical polity as adiaphora that can compensate for perceived disorder.
 - Contrast to Separatists: insists on ordered inter-congregational courts (presbytery/synod) rather than full congregational independence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the dual-role language of "teaching" and "ruling" elders and formalizes the session-presbytery-synod-general assembly ladder as the normative Reformed court system for England.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely circulated among Puritan networks; a key text in developing English Presbyterian proposals that later informed Parliamentarian and Westminster-era polity debates.
 - Influenced English nonconformity and provided an authoritative template for Puritan attempts to reorganize parish life when political openings occurred.
- **Enduring value**
 - A primary resource for reconstructing Elizabethan Puritan ecclesiology; valuable for teaching about early modern Reformed polity, discipline, and the politics of church order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbyterianism** - the system of church government by elders embodied in sessions, presbyteries, synods, assemblies.
- **Presbyter / Elder (presbyteros)** - ministerial office; bifurcated into:
 - **Teaching elders** (ministers): preach, administer sacraments, oversee doctrine.
 - **Ruling elders**: lay officials who govern, discipline, and assist in pastoral oversight.
- **Session** - the local church court composed of the minister(s) and ruling elders; primary locus of discipline and pastoral care.
- **Presbytery** - regional assembly of ministers and elders that supervises several congregations, ordains ministers, and adjudicates appeals.
- **Synod / General Assembly** - higher provincial (synod) and national (assembly) courts for doctrinal adjudication and communal regulations.
- **Ordination** - corporate act of setting apart ministers by presbytery with public recognition and laying on of hands.
- **Discipline** - structured process (admonition, suspension, excommunication) administered by the session with appeals to higher courts.
- **Excommunication** - last resort sanction for unrepentant sin or heresy, exercised to preserve purity and bring about repentance.
- **Magistrate / Church-state relation** - civil authority supports public order; church retains spiritual jurisdiction and disciplinary autonomy.
- **Parity of ministers** - rejection of episcopal preeminence; ministers share authority within courts.
- **Appeals process** - formalized pathway from session to presbytery to synod/assembly to protect rights and ensure consistent doctrine.
- **Ecclesiastical courts** - juridical institutions for internal governance distinct from civil courts.
- **Marks of the true church** - right preaching, sacraments rightly administered, and proper discipline under ordained elders.
- How this work is used:
 - As a definitional source for classic Puritan/Presbyterian polity and office descriptions.
 - As polemic and counter-model in debates with Anglican episcopacy and Separatist congregationalism.
 - As an exegetical/practical model for reconstructing discipline, ordination, and inter-church courts in Reformed ecclesiology.
