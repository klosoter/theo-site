### TITLE
The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine Expounding the Westminster Confession - A. A. Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid- to late-19th century Princeton/New School controversies; rooted in conservative Princeton Calvinism (son and colleague of Charles Hodge). Written as a confessional, catechetical explication of the Westminster Confession for American Presbyterianism amid challenges from revivalism, Arminianism, and emerging theological liberalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To present, defend, and apply the Westminster system as a coherent, biblical, and pastoral theology; to show the Confession's doctrines as the faithful synthesis of Scripture for the church, especially on sin, grace, covenant, and salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition clause-by-clause of the Westminster Confession and Larger/Shorter Catechisms.
 - Biblical and historical proofs for each article, with systematic theological synthesis.
 - Doctrinal application: show consequences for worship, church order, and pastoral practice.
 - Rebuttal of heterodox alternatives (Arminianism, Pelagian tendencies, rationalism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Westminster divines, John Calvin, Augustine as received authority, contemporary opponents (Arminians, evangelicals who minimize doctrine, 19th-century liberal critics), and the Hodge family theological legacy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, the Trinity, God's decrees, creation and providence, original sin, total depravity and total inability, covenant theology (works and grace), Christology, soteriology (effectual calling, justification, sanctification), sacraments, church and civil order, last things.
- **Treatment of Total Depravity and Total Inability:** Hodge reaffirms the WCF language that sin has corrupted every faculty; humans retain natural faculties but are morally and spiritually incapable of turning to God without sovereign, efficacious grace. He stresses moral responsibility alongside bondage of the will and rejects both Pelagian self-sufficiency and fatalistic determinism.
- **Closing line:** A. A. Hodge's Confession is a disciplined, pastorally-minded restatement of classical Reformed orthodoxy: authoritative, scripturally grounded, and polemically precise in defense of covenantal Calvinism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Methodical clause-by-clause exposition that marries confessional fidelity with systematic clarity.
 - Pastoral tone that aims to make complex doctrinal items doctrinally robust yet usable in preaching and catechesis.
 - Strong stress on covenant theology as the organizing principle for Scripture and salvation history.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Arminian and semi-Pelagian assertions of natural human ability; insists on the Westminster formulation of "total inability."
 - Opposes both rationalist minimization of supernatural revelation and sectarian anti-creedal individualism; resists hyper-Calvinist tendencies that deny human responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not an innovation so much as clarification: insists on precise use of terms like "inability" (moral/spiritual) vs. "inability" misunderstood as metaphysical impotence or excuse for irresponsibility.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used as a standard manual in American Presbyterian seminaries and among conservative Reformed bodies; helped consolidate 19th-century confessional identity.
 - Continues to function as a bridge between historic Confessionalism and later systematic theology in Reformed circles.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of confessional exposition: canonical, historically informed, and pastorally oriented.
 - Helpful resource for teaching doctrines of sin and grace, particularly for defending the biblical case for total depravity and effectual calling.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession:** The organizing text Hodge explicates; authoritative frame for doctrine and polity.
- **Total Depravity:** Human nature wholly affected by sin so every faculty is corrupted; not equal to utter identical wickedness in all, but universal corruption of will, understanding, and affections.
- **Total Inability:** Moral and spiritual incapacity to return to God apart from sovereign grace; distinct from loss of natural faculties and not an excuse for guilt.
- **Original Sin:** Adam's first sin as federal head; hereditary corruption and guilt have definitional and soteriological consequences.
- **Federal Headship / Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace:** Structural principles for understanding sin, law, promise, Christ's mediatorial role, and justification.
- **Effectual Calling:** The particular, efficacious operation of the Spirit that overcomes inability and results in conversion; distinguishes general offer of the gospel from saving effectual work.
- **Imputation (of Adam's guilt and of Christ's righteousness):** Key forensic moves: Adam's guilt imputed to posterity; Christ's righteous obedience imputed to believers for justification.
- **Particular Redemption (Limited Atonement):** A. A. Hodge defends the Reformed particularity of the atonement in covenantal and soteriological logic.
- **Common Grace vs. Special Grace:** Differentiates God's restraining, providential favor to all from the special, saving operations that overcome total inability.
- **Responsibility and Liberty:** Maintains human culpability and genuine volition though the will is bound; rejects deterministic nihilism.
- **Scriptural Authority:** Scripture as normative and final court of appeal for all doctrinal claims.
- **Use in loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for confessional terms (esp. sin and inability).
 - As **polemic** against Arminianism and liberal reductionism.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading confessional texts and applying them in preaching and catechesis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** that ties covenant theology to practical pastoral applications regarding sin, grace, and the call to repentance.
