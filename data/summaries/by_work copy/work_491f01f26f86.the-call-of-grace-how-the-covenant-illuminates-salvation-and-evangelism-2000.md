### TITLE
The Call of Grace: How the Covenant Illuminates Salvation and Evangelism (Norman Shepherd, 2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2000 amid renewed interest and controversy over covenant theology within late 20th-century Reformed circles.
 - Intersects debates later labeled the *Federal Vision*, especially controversies about monocovenantalism and the doctrine of justification.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The covenantal structure of Scripture must shape both soteriology and evangelism: the **covenant of grace**, when properly understood as a single covenant administered in different ways, clarifies what it means to be saved and how the church summons sinners to faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of classical covenant theology reframed to insist on the **objective, corporate reality** of covenant membership (baptism and church belonging are real signs of entrance into covenant life).
 - Pastoral implications: evangelism is a call to covenant repentance, faith, and church incorporation rather than merely an appeal to abstract forensic justification.
 - Doctrinal integration: shows how justification, faith, repentance, union with Christ, and sanctification coherently arise from covenantal relations rather than isolated juridical propositions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Reformed covenantal tradition (Calvin, 17th-century federal theologians) but reinterprets emphases familiar to later Federal Vision advocates.
 - Targets antinomian tendencies and a privatized, purely forensic reading of justification; engages implicitly with critics of covenantal objectivity.
 - Directly relevant to discussions tagged as **Federal Vision Monocovenantalism** and **Federal Vision And Justification By Faith**.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (one covenant / administrations), justification, faith, repentance, union with Christ, sacraments (baptism), soteriology, ecclesiology, evangelism.
- **Closing line**
 - Shepherd's center of gravity: salvation is best understood as entrance into and life within the covenant community - an objective, corporate reality that reshapes how one speaks of faith, justification, and evangelistic summons.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on the **objective, corporate** status of covenant membership (baptismal signification) rather than a purely individualistic or merely forensic spirituality.
 - Evangelism presented as calling people into covenantal relation and covenantal obedience, not only into a transfer of legal status.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects what Shepherd saw as the excesses of hyper-forensic accounts that separate justification from covenantal union and ongoing faithfulness.
 - Contrasts with classical sola fide formulations by insisting that **justifying faith is a covenantal, relational faith** that entails repentance and covenantal obedience.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Renewed use of **monocovenantal** language to assert continuity between Old and New Covenant administrations while preserving distinct signs and economies.
 - Emphasis on **covenant call** as the primary form of evangelistic proclamation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within streams that fed into or sympathized with the Federal Vision movement; provided theological backbone for monocovenantal readings.
 - Controversial: critics argue it blurs justification and sanctification and risks compromising *sola fide*; defenders argue it restores biblical covenantal coherence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to overly individualistic soteriology and for pastors who wish to ground evangelism and baptism in covenantal theology.
 - Provokes helpful clarifications about how corporate and forensic aspects of salvation relate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of grace**
 - The single covenantal framework through which God saves; different administrations (types, signs) but one covenant reality.
- **Monocovenantalism**
 - The claim of a single, continuous covenant of grace across biblical administrations; central to Shepherd's reorientation.
- **Objective covenant membership**
 - The idea that baptism and church incorporation confer a real, objectively existing standing in the covenant community.
- **Covenant call**
 - Evangelistic summons framed as invitation to covenant repentance, faith, and church life rather than only imputed righteousness.
- **Faith (covenantal faith)**
 - Faith understood as trust that entails covenantal commitment and obedience, not merely a forensic acknowledgment.
- **Justification**
 - Treated within covenantal relations: forensic declaration remains, but Shepherd emphasizes its relation to faith-as-covenant-union and life in the covenant.
 - Relation to critique: this usage is central to debates summarized under **Federal Vision And Justification By Faith**.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The relational bond that grounds both justification and sanctification within covenantal life.
- **Baptism (sign and efficacy)**
 - Baptism as the sign of objective entrance into the covenant community; sacramental sign functions ecclesially and not merely symbolically.
- **Repentance**
 - Integral to the covenant call; inseparable from saving faith in Shepherd's account.
- **Sanctification**
 - Treated as the expected covenantal fruit of union with Christ and membership in the covenant community.
- **Evangelism**
 - Recast as proclamation of covenant promises and obligations; pastoral praxis for calling sinners into covenant life.
- **Corporate or objective status**
 - Terminology used to push back against privatized soteriology and to insist on visible, ecclesial markers of salvation.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary monocovenantal readings and for articulating covenantal evangelism.
 - As a **polemic and exegetical model** in debates over justification: cited both by proponents of the Federal Vision (to argue covenantal coherence) and by critics (to press concerns about the integrity of sola fide).
