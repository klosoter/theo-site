### TITLE
Calvin's Political Theology and the Public Engagement of the Church - Matthew J. Tuininga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary scholarly monograph situated within late 20th-early 21st century debates over Reformation political thought and modern public theology. 
 - Addresses both early modern Geneva (Calvin and immediate circle) and modern receptions in Reformed political theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Calvin provides a robust, distinctive framework for Christian public engagement that is neither theocratic coercion nor privatized pietism; rather, it is a **covenantal, pastoral, and juridical** theology of the church that shapes public life while recognizing limits to ecclesial coercion.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Close readings of Calvin's Scriptural commentaries and Institutes to recover his normative account of church, magistracy, and law. 
 - Reconstructs how Calvin's pastoral practice in Geneva operationalized theological convictions (discipline, catechesis, worship) into civic formation. 
 - Distinguishes Calvin's positions from competing models (Lutheran two kingdoms, radical Reformation, later theonomist readings). 
 - Synthesizes Calvin's resources into a model for contemporary public theology that preserves both Christian distinctiveness and political pluralism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries, Geneva ordinances), contemporaries in Geneva and Reformed Geneva practice. 
 - Secondary interlocutors: Lutheran two-kingdom formulations, later Reformed theorists (e.g., Beza, Geneva magistrates), and modern scholars of political theology.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Covenant** (public and communal dimensions), **law** (Mosaic, natural), **magistracy** (role and limits), **church** (office, discipline, sacraments), **providence and sovereignty**, and implications of **original sin** for political order.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Calvin's political theology roots the church's public engagement in covenantal formation and pastoral discipline: the church shapes the common good by proclaiming the Word and forming conscience, while respecting the distinct offices and jurisdictional limits of civil authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphasizes the church as **formative institution**: not merely a moral voice but a disciplining, catechetical presence that cultivates civic virtue. 
 - Frames magistracy as a God-ordained office *with* coercive powers but *with* theological limits-magistrates are ministers for order, not ecclesial pastors.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects caricatures that paint Calvin as advocating ecclesiastical theocracy; stresses Calvin's careful jurisdictional distinctions. 
 - Distinguishes Calvin from strict Lutheran two-kingdom separation by showing Calvin's greater emphasis on the church's formative public role. 
 - Challenges modern theonomic or coercive reconstructions that ignore Calvin's pastoral restraint and legal nuance.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Recasts "public engagement" in covenantal categories-public religion as covenantal sociality rather than mere political lobbying or privatized faith. 
 - Uses Geneva practice to illustrate an integrated vocabulary of **Word‑shaping**, **discipline**, and **magisterial justice**.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Useful to contemporary Reformed public theologians seeking a middle way between privatism and dominionism. 
 - Has become a touchstone in seminaries for courses on Calvin and political theology; referenced in debates over Christian social witness and church-state relations.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Careful primary-source exegesis of Calvin combined with attention to institutional practice makes the work durable for students learning the interplay of doctrine and polity. 
 - Serves as a corrective to simplistic portrayals and as a model for historically grounded constructive public theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Magistracy:** Calvin's account of civil office as God‑ordained for order and justice, with jurisdictional limits distinct from ecclesial authority. 
- **Covenant:** Communal and public covenantal bonds that ground social obligations and church engagement with civil life. 
- **Church discipline:** Pastoral practice for moral formation and public witness; central to Calvin's shaping of civic virtue. 
- **Word (preaching):** Primary means by which the church forms conscience and public life; normative for political engagement. 
- **Law (Mosaic and natural):** Distinction between civil uses of law, moral law as guide for conscience, and the role of law in civil governance. 
- **Common good:** A theological category shaped by covenantal duties and church formation rather than purely secular utilitarian calculation. 
- **Two kingdoms (contrast):** Calvin's position compared to Lutheran bifurcation-less separation, more formative ecclesial role in the public square. 
- **Providence and sovereignty:** Doctrinal background that tempers political ambition with humility about God's rule over history. 
- **Original sin:** Grounds limits on political utopianism and necessitates both church discipline and magistral constraint. 
- **Pastoral-political nexus:** Term for how pastoral care, preaching, and catechesis function as public theology. 
- **Mixed regime / republican rhetoric:** Calvin's occasional use of republican language to justify civic participation and mixed magistracy. 
- **Public worship & sacraments:** Instruments by which ecclesial identity translates into public moral formation. 
- **Resistance / lesser magistrate (nuanced):** Calvin's cautious allowance for resistance in extreme cases, framed by juridical and pastoral criteria rather than revolutionary license.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for Calvin's nuanced stance on church-state relations. 
 - As a **polemic** against both privatizing pietism and coercive theonomism. 
 - As an **exegetical model** showing how Calvin's scriptural exegesis informs institutional practice and public theology. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching covenantal public engagement in Reformed ethics and political theology courses.
