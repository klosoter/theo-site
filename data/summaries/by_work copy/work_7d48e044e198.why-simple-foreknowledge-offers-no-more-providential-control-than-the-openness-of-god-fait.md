### TITLE
Why Simple Foreknowledge Offers No More Providential Control than the Openness of God (John Sanders, Faith and Philosophy, 1997)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century debate over providence and divine knowledge: rise of Open Theism against classical foreknowledge models (classical theism, Molinism, and Arminian variants).
 - Sanders writing from the Open Theist perspective to address objections that openness sacrifices divine control or providence.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Simple foreknowledge (God's timeless/eternal knowing of future free acts) does not secure greater providential control than the Open Theist model;** foreknowledge alone is knowledge, not causal control, and so cannot be invoked to undermine the openness account's coherence with divine providence.

- **Core argument / major moves**
 - Clarify the conceptual distinction: **knowledge versus causal determination** - foreknowledge does not, by itself, constitute providential causation.
 - Show that defenders of simple foreknowledge often smuggle in additional causal assumptions (e.g., timeless decree, divine immutability, or predestination) to claim control; those assumptions, not mere foreknowledge, do the work.
 - Compare the practical governance available under each model:
 - Under simple foreknowledge, God may still exercise providence by planning and willing events, but that control rests on antecedent decrees rather than on foreknowledge per se.
 - Under openness, God governs providentially via responsive, relational strategies without forfeiting responsibility or effectiveness.
 - Argue that claims that openness renders God impotent misunderstand relational providence and confuse modal categories (knowledge vs. power).

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical theists and Molinists (who argue foreknowledge or middle knowledge protects divine providence).
 - Implicit engagement with critics who equate foreknowledge with determinism (e.g., some traditional Calvinist readings).
 - Open Theist allies and resources are used to develop the alternative account.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, omniscience, divine sovereignty, human freedom, foreknowledge (simple and middle), divine immutability, divine condescension/relationality.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: **foreknowledge by itself does not furnish superior providential control; Open Theism offers a viable, relational account of divine governance that preserves God's sovereignty and effective providence without conflating knowledge with causation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp conceptual separation of knowledge and causation: Sanders stresses that knowing an outcome is not equivalent to causing it, a point used strategically to undermine critics who claim openness weakens providence.
 - Emphasis on **divine condescension and relational risk** as virtues: God's willingness to enter a dynamic relation with creatures is a form of providential greatness, not weakness.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Molinist claims that middle knowledge (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom) is necessary to secure providence; Sanders argues simple foreknowledge neither improves nor secures greater control.
 - Challenges classical readings that implicitly equate foreknowledge with predestination or sovereignty-as-control.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasting providence as **responsive, strategic governance** rather than as exhaustive foreordaining control secured by foreknowledge.
 - Use of modal and epistemic distinctions to defuse deterministic inferences from foreknowledge.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Open Theist circles as a concise defense against a common critique.
 - Provoked further debate from Molinists and classical theists, sharpening exchanges on the theological significance of different notions of divine knowledge.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies a frequent equivocation in debates (knowledge vs. causation) and offers a compact, portable argumentative resource for teaching open theist alternatives in courses on providence and divine attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Simple foreknowledge** - God's prior knowledge of future free acts without this knowledge being grounded in divine causation.
- **Openness of God** - View that future free actions are not exhaustively settled and God knows the future in a dynamic, responsive manner.
- **Providential control** - The degree to which God secures ends by determining or shaping events; Sanders interrogates what counts as "control."
- **Knowledge vs. causation** - Central analytic distinction: knowing an event vs. causing it; Sanders insists conflation is illicit.
- **Middle knowledge** - Molinist notion (knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom); treated as rival attempt to secure providence.
- **Divine condescension** - God's self-limiting relational stance; valued positively as part of providence in Sanders' account.
- **Relational providence** - God's governance understood as interactive and adaptable, not strictly deterministic.
- **Divine sovereignty** - Reinterpreted so sovereignty need not equal exhaustive foreordination; sovereignty compatible with responsive governance.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - Molinist tool; Sanders critiques their alleged necessity for providential assurance.
- **Immutable omniscience** - Classical conception often conflated with control; Sanders urges separating immutability from control claims.
- **Risk in providence** - Theological notion that God may allow genuine contingency as part of relational governance.
- **Deterministic foreknowledge** - The mistaken inference that foreknowledge implies causal determination.
- **Strategic governance** - Sanders' preferred language for how God providentially brings about ends without micro-control.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against the charge that Open Theism undermines providence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses/discussions clarifying the knowledge-versus-causation distinction and reframing sovereignty.
 - As a succinct **definition-source** for describing Open Theist claims about divine condescension and relational risk.
