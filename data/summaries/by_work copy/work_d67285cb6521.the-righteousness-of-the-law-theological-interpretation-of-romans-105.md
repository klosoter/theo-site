### TITLE
The Righteousness of the Law: Theological Interpretation of Romans 10:5 - Lee Irons

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary (early 21st century) theological-exegetical scholarship within broadly Reformed/evangelical circles.
 - Written against the backdrop of debates on Paul and the Law, especially the New Perspective on Paul (Sanders, Dunn, Wright), and renewed interest in the theological interpretation of Scripture.
 - Aims to bridge careful exegetical work on Paul with constructive theological concerns about justification and the relation of law and gospel.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's phrase **"the righteousness of the law" (dikaiosynē tou nomou)** in Romans 10:5 must be read theologically: it identifies the law's demand for covenantal life which people cannot achieve, and which Christ fulfills as the true "end" (telos) of the law. Thus justification comes not from human obedience but from Christ's fulfillment received by faith.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical parsing of Romans 10:4-5, with attention to Paul's citation of Leviticus 18:5:
 - Clarifies the force of **telos** in Romans 10:4 as "goal/fulfillment" rather than merely "termination."
 - Analyzes the phrase **"righteousness of the law"** grammatically and semantically, showing Paul contrasts a law-grounded claim to life with the righteousness that is by faith.
 - Contextual reading of Leviticus 18:5 within covenantal stipulations:
 - Shows original law text promises life conditional on obedience (a covenant stipulation), which becomes a standard that exposes human inability.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - The law's righteousness is genuine as a divine standard but cannot be a means of justification for sinners; Christ embodies and accomplishes the law's life-demand, making righteousness accessible through faith.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Corrects readings that reduce "works of the law" to ethnic boundary markers; argues Paul's principal concern is soteriological - the law's role as demand and the need for Christ's fulfillment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Pauline corpus (Romans), Old Testament law (esp. Leviticus 18:5), OT covenant frameworks.
 - Secondary interlocutors: New Perspective proponents (Sanders, Dunn, Wright), classical Reformers (Luther, Calvin) as background for justification debates, and contemporary theological interpreters.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, covenant, law and gospel, Pauline hermeneutics, Christology (fulfillment/active obedience), soteriology, and theological method (theological interpretation of Scripture).

- **Closing line**
 - Paul's citation of Leviticus shows the law truly demands life but cannot grant it; Christ is the law's goal and its fulfilled righteousness - and that fulfilled righteousness is received by faith, not human achievement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight integration of grammatical-exegetical detail with systematic theological claims about law, fulfillment, and justification.
 - Emphasizes **telos** as constructive: the law's goal is realized in Christ rather than being merely abolished or superseded.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that limit "works of the law" to ethnic markers; insists Paul retains a moral/covenantal critique of law as means of life.
 - Refines both New Perspective and some traditional Reformed caricatures by acknowledging the law's genuine normative force while denying its salvific efficacy apart from Christ.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced account of **"righteousness of the law"** as a phrase that functions both descriptively (the law's own demand) and polemically (a foil to righteousness by faith).
 - Stresses a twofold way of speaking about the law: normative covenantal standard vs. instrumental path to life.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical teaching for clarifying Romans 10:5 and enriching preaching on law/gospel tensions.
 - Cited in debates over Pauline theology as a corrective to simplistic New Perspective vs. old Protestant dichotomies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact exegetical-theological model for reading Paul's OT citations.
 - Useful for courses on Pauline theology, justification, and hermeneutics that must negotiate contemporary scholarly disputes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **dikaiosynē tou nomou ("righteousness of the law")**
 - Read as the law's demand for covenantal life; a real standard that humans fail to meet.

- **telos ("end/goal")**
 - Argued to mean fulfillment/goal (Christ) rather than mere cessation of the law.

- **works of the law**
 - Treated primarily as claims to obtain life by law-keeping, not narrowly ethnic boundary markers.

- **righteousness by faith**
 - Contrasted with law-grounded righteousness; Paul's alternative is Christ's fulfillment received through faith.

- **Leviticus 18:5**
 - Key OT locus cited by Paul; originally a covenantal promise conditioned on obedience, here reinterpreted theologically in light of Christ.

- **covenant nomism**
 - Engaged as background but refined: covenant obligations are real yet insufficient as means of justification apart from Christ.

- **imputation / active obedience**
 - Implicit theological framework: Christ's fulfilling obedience secures the law's righteousness imputed to believers.

- **Pauline hermeneutics / theological interpretation**
 - Method: careful reading of Paul's OT citations with theological sensitivity to canonical and Christocentric fulfillment.

- **justification**
 - Re-articulated as forensic declaration grounded in Christ's fulfillment and received by faith, not deserved by law-keeping.

- **law and gospel**
 - Clarified relationship: law defines God's requirement; gospel supplies the fulfillment in Christ for sinners to receive.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Romans 10:4-5 and OT citations in Paul.
- As a **polemic/resource** in debates over the New Perspective, defending a nuanced Reformed reading.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in soteriology courses linking law's demand, Christ's fulfillment, and faith-shaped reception.
