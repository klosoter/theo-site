### TITLE
The Art of Prophesying - William Perkins (Puritan homiletical and exegetical method; applied to doctrines including Divine Decrees, Election and Reprobation)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late Elizabethan / early Jacobean Puritan milieu (Perkins 1558-1602; The Art of Prophesying circulated posthumously, c. 1607). Emerges within English Reformed pastoral formation and the broader Calvinist revival in late 16th-early 17th centuries.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Preaching (prophesying) must be a disciplined, text-centered, pastorally-oriented exercise: sound grammatical-historical exegesis, ordered argumentation, and explicit application join to convey doctrine (including painful doctrines such as election and reprobation) in a way that builds faith, repentance and assurance.
- **Core argument or structure:** Perkins gives a practical manual for ministers; major moves are:
 - Choose a text and ascertain its literal sense through context, grammar and historical circumstances.
 - Formulate a clear **proposition** (doctrine) derived from the text.
 - Prove the proposition from Scripture and cogent reasons (use of "places" and parallel texts).
 - Divide the proposition into heads and subpoints for orderly treatment.
 - Apply the doctrine to life with distinct **uses**: consolation of the elect, humiliation of sinners, and pressing duties.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** He stands in the Calvinist/Reformed tradition (explicitly building on Calvinic exegesis), reacting against scholastic abstraction, medieval allegory, and sectarian or popish abuses. Implied interlocutors include Roman Catholic casuists and more speculative scholastics; his method also contests lax or theatrical preaching within the English church.
- **Doctrines treated:** Primary emphases on Scripture (authority and plain sense), hermeneutics, homiletics, pastoral theology; soteriology appears as an applied locus (notably **election**, predestination and reprobation), assurance, repentance and sanctification.
- **Closing line:** Perkins makes homiletics the junction where disciplined grammatical-historical exegesis and sober Reformed doctrine (including the doctrine of divine decrees) are converted into pastoral forms that both instruct the mind and govern the heart.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Preaching as "prophesying" - an exercised, prophetic ministry rooted in Scripture rather than rhetorical ornamentation.
 - Strong insistence that doctrine must flow from the text before system; dogmatics serves exposition, not vice versa.
 - Systematic pairing of **proofs** (Scripture places) with **uses** (practical applications) - especially for hard doctrines.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejection of medieval allegory and scholastic casuistry in favor of the plain (sensus literalis) and pastoral reading.
 - Contrast to overly speculative scholastic treatments of predestination: Perkins insists ministers ground predestinarian teaching directly in texts and pastoral uses, not merely in abstruse metaphysics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Methodized homiletical steps (text → proposition → proofs → division → uses) later become pedagogical standard in Puritan and Reformed ministerial training.
 - The notion of "uses" as the normative pastoral end of every doctrinal exposition.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonized in Puritan ministerial handbooks; influential among English and New England Puritans and in Reformed seminary practice.
 - Shaped later homiletic manuals and the handling of controversial soteriological topics (e.g., election/reprobation) in pastoral preaching.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a durable model for marrying exegetical discipline with pastoral urgency; useful for teaching ministers how to handle difficult doctrines without abandoning textual fidelity or pastoral charity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prophesying:** Expository preaching; Scripture-centered, prophetic proclamation with pastoral intent.
- **Text (and context):** The immediate scriptural sentence plus surrounding verses and historical setting - the primary unit for doctrine.
- **Literal sense (sensus literalis):** Perkins' default hermeneutic; the starting point for doctrine and application.
- **Proposition:** A concise doctrinal statement drawn from the text to be proved and applied.
- **Proofs / Places:** Scriptural passages and parallel places used to confirm the proposition; ordered demonstration rather than mere assertion.
- **Division (partitio):** Structuring the proposition into heads and subpoints for clarity and pedagogy.
- **Uses:** The practical applications of doctrine - consolation, exhortation, humiliation, reformation of life; the pastoral goal of preaching.
- **Grammatical-historical method:** Emphasis on grammar, sense, and authorial intent as controls on meaning.
- **Pastoral ends:** The telos of preaching - conversion, assurance, sanctification, communal order.
- **Plain style:** Preference for clarity and edification over rhetorical flourish.
- **Doctrine → Application linkage:** Doctrine is not an end in itself but the warrant for concrete life-change.
- **Election / Predestination:** Treated as scriptural doctrine to be proved from places and applied pastorally (assurance for the elect; exhortation to duty; careful pastoral handling of mystery).
- **Reprobation:** A difficult teaching to be proclaimed with textual proof, doctrinal clarity and pastoral sensitivity.
- **Double predestination:** Perkins aligns with Reformed formulations that God eternally ordains both election and passing by (reprobation); ministers must ground such claims in Scripture and uses.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary **homiletical method** and pedagogical definition for ministerial training.
- As a **polemic** against allegorical, speculative and popish methods, and as a procedural counter to lax preaching.
- As an **exegetical model** for handling delicate doctrines (election, reprobation) - showing how to prove, divide, and apply doctrinal truth without abandoning pastoral charity.
