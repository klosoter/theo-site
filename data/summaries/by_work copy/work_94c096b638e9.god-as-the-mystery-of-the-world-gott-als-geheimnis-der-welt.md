### TITLE
God as the Mystery of the World (Gott als Geheimnis der Welt) - Eberhard Jüngel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century German Protestant theology (post-war, 1960s-1970s milieu). Jüngel writes within a Lutheran-receptive stream heavily engaged with Karl Barth, existential hermeneutics (Bultmann/Kierkegaard), and continental philosophy (phenomenology, Heideggerian questions of being).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The key claim: God must be spoken of as the *mystery of the world* - not as a distant metaphysical being discoverable by unaided reason (analogia entis), nor as an absolute unknowable, but as the decisive, revelatory mystery that simultaneously conceals and discloses the world's being.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs doctrine of God around the category of *mystery* (Geheimnis) that is the condition of intelligibility for world and revelation.
 - Affirms **analogia fidei**: knowledge of God is possible only by God's self-disclosure in Christ; theological predication is faith-grounded.
 - Rejects a purely natural analogical knowledge (analogia entis) that would collapse God into creaturely categories.
 - Articulates a positive account of God-world relation: God is not merely absent but is the constitutive, disclosed mystery by which the world is what it is.
 - Develops implications for Trinity, incarnation, creation, and human knowledge: Trinitarian being grounds revelation; Christ is the site of disclosed mystery; theology remains the church's faithful discourse on that revealed relation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Karl Barth (affinity on critique of natural theology), Thomas Aquinas (analogia entis as foil), Friedrich Schleiermacher, Rudolf Bultmann, and continental philosophers (Heideggerian terminology). Dialogue with modern systematic and philosophical theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, doctrine of God (theology proper), Trinity, Christology (incarnation as disclosure), creation, anthropology (human relation to the revealed mystery), and epistemology of theological language.
- **Closing line**
 - Jüngel's theological center of gravity: God is the world's constitutive **mystery** - revealed in Christ and authoritative for all theological speech - preserving divine otherness while securing the possibility of faithful knowledge (analogia fidei).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Treats *mystery* affirmatively: mystery is not unintelligibility but the productive condition of the world's intelligibility; revelation both unveils and retains transcendence.
 - Stresses the ontological priority of God's self-revelation: God's being becomes knowable only through the event of disclosure (Christ).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Aligns with Barth in rejecting autonomous natural theology (analyticia entis) but seeks a more constructive account of how God relates to the world than mere dialectical negation.
 - Counterposes **analogia fidei** to analogia entis with renewed philosophical and systematic rigor: theological predication is analogical because grounded in faithful reception of revelation, not speculative metaphysics.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates *Geheimnis* as a central theological category with precision (not mystical vagueness).
 - Reframes revelation as an ontological event that shapes both ontology and epistemology of theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in post-war Protestant theology and ecumenical discourse; used as a constructive alternative to both Thomistic natural theology and radical dialectical theologies that eschew positive predication.
 - Sparked debate over the limits of natural knowledge of God; engaged theologians seeking a middle path between realist metaphysics and strict revelationism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching doctrine of God, reception-history of analogical reasoning, and integrating Christology with epistemology; remains a go-to resource for articulating a non-speculative but positive theology of God's relation to the world.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mystery (Geheimnis)** - central predicate: the form in which God is the world's constitutive disclosure; not mere ignorance but the world-making presence of God.
- **Analogia fidei** - hermeneutical principle: theological predicates are grounded in faith-anchored revelation (Christ) rather than creaturely metaphysics.
- **Analogia entis** - critiqued position: the classical Thomistic idea of a structural analogy between God and creature is rejected as insufficient and theologically dangerous.
- **Revelation (Offenbarung)** - eventual and ontological: revelation is the decisive disclosure in Christ that makes possible true predication about God.
- **Disclosure / concealment** - dialectical pair: revelation both unveils God and preserves divine otherness; theology must hold the tension.
- **God-world relation** - constructive correlation: God is not remote noumenon but the mystery by which the world attains being and intelligibility.
- **Trinitarian being** - grounding of revelation: the relational life of God explains how God can be both distinct and communicative.
- **Christology (incarnation)** - locus classicus of revelation: the incarnation is the concrete self-relation in which the divine mystery is disclosed.
- **Theological language / predication** - analogical and faith-shaped: words about God draw legitimate but analogical correspondence from revelation.
- **Creation** - world as disclosure-receiver: creation's being depends on the disclosed mystery; creation is not ontologically autonomous.
- **Presence/absence** - theological motif: God's presence is real where revelation occurs; absence denotes the withholding aspect of mystery.
- **Epistemology of theology** - faith-conditioned knowledge: theological knowledge is possible but non-naturalistic; it is evidential within the horizon of revelation.
- **Transcendence vs immanence** - balanced: transcendence preserved without severing God from the world's intelligibility.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a revelatory-constrained doctrine of God and an affirmative theological use of "mystery."
 - As a **polemic** against analogia entis and classical natural theology, defending analogia fidei.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments linking Trinity, Christology, and epistemology - useful in lectures and seminars on doctrine of God and revelation.
