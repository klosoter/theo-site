### TITLE
Paul, the Law, and the Covenant - A. Andrew Das

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary New Testament scholarship situated in the debate between traditional Reformation readings and the New Perspective on Paul (NP/P). Engages Second Temple Jewish background, covenantal studies, and recent exegetical work on Romans and Galatians. Aimed at both academic and pastor-theologian audiences seeking a covenantal reading of Paul.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's argument about law must be read through the covenantal matrix: the Torah functioned within Israel's covenantal life but does not secure the covenant promises; Christ inaugurates the covenantal remedy that realizes covenant promises for both Jews and Gentiles. The problem addressed is how Paul locates the failure and fulfillment of the Sinai covenant in relation to justification and the identity of God's people.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical-theological groundwork: reconstructs Second Temple covenantal thinking (including covenantal nomism) and locates Paul within that horizon.
 - Exegetical core: close readings of pivotal Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) to trace how Paul uses nomos, pistis, ergon, and ethnos language.
 - Theological synthesis: argues Paul diagnoses the law's inability to produce life within the covenant and thus presents Christ as the covenantal locus of promise, faith, and new identity.
 - Pastoral/systematic implications: considers ecclesial identity (Jew and Gentile as one covenant people), the role of Torah for believers, and the meaning of justification and sanctification in covenantal terms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Interacts with E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright (NP/P stream), classical Reformation interpreters (Luther, Calvin), and modern Pauline commentators (Moo, Cranfield, Barclay). Uses Second Temple Jewish literature, LXX, and tight canonical exegesis of Pauline letters.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology, law (Torah), justification, soteriology, ecclesiology (nature of the covenant people), Pauline Christology, sin and redemption, faith/faithfulness.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Paul reframes Torah not as the final source of covenant blessing but as a covenantally situated institution whose ultimate telos is fulfilled in Christ, who alone secures the covenant promises for a unified people of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats **covenant** as the primary hermeneutical key for Paul rather than solely a soteriological or forensic category.
 - Balances the law's institutional place in Israel with its inability to accomplish covenantal life apart from Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back on simplistic readings that reduce Paul to either anti-Judaism or a mere critic of works-righteousness.
 - Critically engages the New Perspective by insisting that attention to covenantal failure and fulfillment preserves both Jewish background and Pauline innovation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines use of **"works of the law"** to include covenant boundary functions and not merely individual merit-earning; emphasizes the diagnostic role of law in Paul's soteriology.
 - Recasts pistis-language as fundamentally covenantal trust/faithfulness tied to the promise-keeping God.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles for bringing covenant theology into dialogue with recent Pauline scholarship.
 - Cited by scholars seeking a middle path between classical Protestant and NP/P positions; used in advanced courses on Paul and covenant.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a careful exegetical-theological model that preserves Jewish context, Pauline particularity, and systematic coherence; especially useful for integrating biblical theology with pastoral concerns about law and Christian identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** The organizing category for Paul's thought; explains why law, promise, and people-language cohere in his argument.
- **Nomos (Law):** Treated as covenantal Torah-authoritative for Israel's life-but unable to procure covenant blessings apart from Christ.
- **Works of the law:** Not merely meritorious acts; often boundary markers (circumcision, food, sabbath) that define covenant membership and are subject to Pauline critique.
- **Covenantal nomism:** Historical backdrop-Israel's law-embedded covenantal status-which Das adapts to show Paul's continuity and critique.
- **Justification:** A covenantal declaration tied to faith in Christ and the fulfillment of covenant promises, not simply a forensic transaction detached from communal identity.
- **Pistis (faith/faithfulness):** Read as relational, covenantal trust and the faithfulness of Christ as well as human faith responding to promise.
- **Israel/People of God:** Paul's redefinition of corporate identity-ethnic markers lose salvific exclusivity as the covenant promise is fulfilled in Christ.
- **Fulfillment in Christ:** Christ as the covenantal culmination who brings promise, life, and true obedience.
- **Boundary markers:** The ritual and ethnic signs regulated by law that Paul reinterprets or supersedes in light of covenant fulfillment.
- **Faithfulness of God:** Emphasizes God's covenantal fidelity as the ground for justification and inclusion.
- **Flesh vs. Spirit:** Paul's anthropological categories tied to covenantal life and the inability of the fleshly adherence to law to effect promised life.
- **Promise/Inheritance:** Covenant terminologies Paul uses to articulate salvation as gift rooted in God's promise, not law-earning.
- **Diagnostic function of law:** Law reveals sin and the limits of covenantal life without the Christ-event.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for reading Paul covenantally (useful in biblical theology and systematic treatments of law).
- As a **polemic resource** against reductionist readings (both some classical Protestant and some NP/P extremes).
- As an **exegetical model** for Romans and Galatians emphasizing covenant categories over isolated forensic metaphors.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in sermons and curricula that aim to integrate covenant theology with Pauline soteriology.
