### TITLE
**The Bible and the Future** (1979) - Anthony A. Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century Reformed theology, postwar biblical-theological renewal (Vos, Ridderbos), responding to evangelical dispensational dominance.
 - Bridges confessional Reformed dogmatics and New Testament eschatology; Eerdmans publication aimed at pastors, students, and scholars.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Biblical eschatology is inaugurated in Christ and awaits consummation**; read the whole Bible through the lens of the already and the not yet, yielding an **amillennial** synthesis that affirms one people of God and a **renewed earth** as the final state.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Inaugurated eschatology**: Kingdom present in Christ's first coming; Spirit as firstfruits and down payment.
 - **Interadvental age**: Signs of the times, tribulation, antichrist-principle; mission in tension of hope and suffering.
 - **Intermediate state**: Believers with Christ yet incomplete; no soul-sleep; communion with Christ prior to resurrection.
 - **Parousia**: Single visible return, general resurrection, and universal judgment; rejects a secret rapture.
 - **Millennium** (Rev 20): Symbolic of the present reign of Christ and saints; **binding of Satan** limits deception of the nations; first resurrection understood spiritually.
 - **Consummation**: New heaven and new earth; continuity and discontinuity; cultural renewal under God's glory; eternal life and eternal punishment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive: **Augustine**, **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, **Vos**, **Ridderbos**, **Cullmann**, **Ladd** (selectively).
 - Critical engagement: **Darby**, **Scofield**, **Walvoord**, **Ryrie** (dispensationalism); realized eschatology (C. H. Dodd); triumphalist postmillennialism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and hermeneutics**, **covenant and people of God**, **Christology** (resurrection, exaltation, reign), **Pneumatology** (firstfruits, arrabon), **Anthropology** (death, resurrection body), **Soteriology** in eschatological frame, **Ecclesiology** (mission, suffering), **Hamartiology** (man of sin), **Eschatology** proper (parousia, millennium, judgment, final state).
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Christ's present reign guarantees a future new earth**; Christian life is hopeful realism in the already/not yet.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **New earth** as the definitive hope, not disembodied heaven.
 - **One people of God** across covenants; rejects Israel-church dualism.
 - **Single, climactic parousia** with general resurrection/judgment; no pretribulational rapture.
 - **Present millennium** and **spiritual first resurrection**; Satan bound with respect to deceiving the nations.
 - **Signs of the times** as interadvental realities culminating in intensification, not a strict timetable.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **dispensational premillennialism**: literal millennialism, secret rapture, two-track redemptive plan.
 - Against **historic premillennialism**: post-parousia earthly millennium before final judgment.
 - Against **triumphalist postmillennialism**: maintains pervasive suffering and opposition until the end.
 - Against **realized eschatology**: insists on future bodily consummation; affirms eternal punishment.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Consolidates **inaugurated eschatology** for Reformed dogmatics; tight use of **already/not yet** across loci.
 - Clarifies **continuity/discontinuity** of creation-culture in the new earth.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard Reformed textbook; shaped late-20th-century amillennial consensus in seminaries and churches.
 - Frequently cited as an exegetical model for Revelation 20, 1 Thess 4, Rom 8, 2 Thess 2.
- **Enduring value**
 - Integrates exegesis with systematics and pastoral application; offers a coherent hermeneutic for complex texts and a robust new-creation ethic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Already and Not Yet**: Redemptive blessings inaugurated in Christ, awaiting consummation.
- **Kingdom of God**: God's reign present in Christ and the Spirit, consummated at the parousia.
- **Amillennialism**: No earthly, temporal thousand-year reign; millennium equals present church age.
- **Millennium (Rev 20)**: Symbolic period; Christ reigns, saints reign with Him; not a future earthly kingdom.
 - **First Resurrection**: Spiritual (regeneration/heavenly reign of the departed faithful).
 - **Binding of Satan**: Restriction of deceptive power among the nations during the gospel era.
- **Signs of the Times**: Interadvental indicators (gospel to nations, tribulation, apostasy, antichrist), intensifying toward the end.
- **Antichrist**: Both recurring pattern and final personal opponent before Christ's return.
- **Intermediate State**: Conscious fellowship with Christ for believers; not the final goal; awaits bodily resurrection.
- **Parousia**: Single public return of Christ; resurrection and judgment occur then; no secret rapture.
- **General Resurrection and Judgment**: One resurrection of just and unjust; universal, final assize.
- **New Earth**: Final state of redeemed creation; embodied life; God dwelling with His people.
 - **Continuity/Discontinuity**: Purged, transformed creation; real renewal without sin or curse.
- **Spirit as Firstfruits/Arrabon**: Present pledge guaranteeing future inheritance and transformation.
- **Israel and the Church**: One covenant people fulfilled in Christ; promises to Israel realized in the multi-ethnic church.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Definition source** for inaugurated eschatology and amillennial readings of Rev 20.
 - **Polemic benchmark** against dispensationalism and over-realized eschatologies.
 - **Exegetical model** for key texts (1 Thess 4; 2 Thess 2; Rom 8; Rev 20-22).
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking soteriology, creation, and mission to the telos of the new earth.
