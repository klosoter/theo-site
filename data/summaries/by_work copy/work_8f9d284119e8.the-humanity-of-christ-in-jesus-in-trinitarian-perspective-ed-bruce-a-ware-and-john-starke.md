### TITLE
The Humanity of Christ - Bruce A. Ware (in Jesus in Trinitarian Perspective, ed. Bruce A. Ware & John Starke)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early-21st-century evangelical/Reformed theological renewal; systematic and Trinitarian retrieval of classical Christology in conversation with contemporary debates (kenotic readings, "peccability" proposals, and pastoral concerns about the reality of Christ's temptations).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Ware argues that the incarnate Son possessed a genuinely human nature (including a true human will and experience of temptation) while being **impeccable** - able to be tempted but not able to sin - by virtue of the hypostatic union with the divine person of the Son.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Affirmation of Chalcedonian two natures in one person as theological starting point.
 - Careful parsing of human attributes assumed: bodily frailty, hunger, fatigue, growth, and a genuine human will/affections.
 - Distinction between **temptability** (real capacity to be tempted) and **peccability** (capacity to commit sin); Ware defends temptation without peccability.
 - Scriptural exegesis (Gospels, Hebrews, Paul) to show both Jesus' genuine human frailty and persistent sinlessness.
 - Theological rationale: the personal union with the divine Son secures impeccability without denying true humanity; divine immutability/holiness grounds inability to sin in the person of the Son.
 - Implications drawn for soteriology: only an impeccable, yet truly human, mediator can render perfect representative obedience and atoning suffering.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical patristic and conciliar formulations (Athanasius, Chalcedon), Augustine and Reformation affirmations (e.g., Calvin), and contemporary interlocutors who press peccability or radical kenosis proposals.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union), Trinity (personal identity of the Son), incarnation, sin and temptation, impec-ability vs peccability, atonement (active and passive obedience), mediation.
- **Closing line:** Ware centers the claim that the Son's personal union with genuine human nature secures a real humanity that is nevertheless incapable of sin - a theological fulcrum that preserves both authentic temptation and saving, representative perfection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Precision in language: stresses **temptability without peccability**, rescuing experiential realism without conceding sin in Christ.
 - Links impeccability explicitly to the personhood of the Son (not merely to a moral disposition of a human nature).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects over-psychologizing that reduces Christ's sinlessness to superior self-control or moral resolve.
 - Counters kenotic or peccability proposals that make Christ morally capable of sin, arguing these undermine atonement and Trinitarian identity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the functional distinction between human faculties assumed (will, appetite, emotions) and moral status (incapacity to sin) rooted in the Son's divine personhood.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well-received in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, pastorally sensitive restatement of classical Christology.
 - Frequently cited in debates over Christ's temptations and in defenses of substitutionary atonement.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact, disciplined model for teaching the compatibility of genuine human experience and Christ's sinlessness.
 - Valuable for pastors, preachers, and systematicians who need a tight link between Trinitarian identity and soteriological efficacy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability:** Christ's inability to sin; Ware argues this flows from the Son's divine personhood united to human nature.
- **Peccability:** Theoretical capacity to sin; Ware rejects peccability for the incarnate Son while allowing real temptation.
- **Temptability / Temptation:** Real exposure to enticement and suffering; distinguished from actual sinning and argued to be genuine in Jesus.
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of divine Son and human nature; the decisive ground for impeccability in Ware's account.
- **Chalcedonian Two Natures:** Framework used to preserve full deity and full humanity without confusion or division.
- **Kenosis (limited use):** Ware pushes back on radical kenotic readings that empty the Son of divine attributes in the incarnation.
- **Divine Impassibility / Divine Holiness:** Employed to explain why the person of the Son could not sin; not used to deny Christ's real feelings or suffering.
- **Human Will (assumed will):** Affirmed as genuinely human and operative; yet never morally defecting because of personal union.
- **Representative Obedience:** Ware emphasizes that impeccability is necessary for Christ's active obedience on our behalf.
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** Both preserved: active obedience (perfect life) and passive obedience (suffering/death) require sinlessness.
- **Mediation:** Christ as truly human mediator whose impeccability secures valid representation before God.
- **Authentic Humanity:** Ware insists on the reality of Jesus' human experiences (hunger, fatigue, sorrow) even while denying peccability.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for contemporary evangelical formulations of impeccability.
 - As a **polemic** against peccability and extreme kenotic proposals.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Gospel and Hebrews texts on temptation and sinlessness.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian personhood to soteriological claims about atonement and representation.
