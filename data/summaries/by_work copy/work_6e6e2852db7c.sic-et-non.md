### TITLE
Sic et Non - Peter Abelard (c. 1121-1123)
- A compiled katalog of apparent contradictions among patristic and scriptural authorities, designed as a pedagogical tool for dialectical theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 12th century scholastic milieu in France (Brittany/Notre-Dame School); rise of dialectical method and cathedral schools; reaction against uncritical appeal to patristic authority.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** There is no simple parity between auctoritas (patristic statements) and settled doctrinal truth; apparent contradictions must be catalogued and resolved by reasoned distinction and argument.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Collection of c. 158 concise "questions" each presented as a set of opposing patristic or scriptural sentences - typically a series of terse "yes" and "no" statements.
 - Little systematic resolution in the original work: the method is heuristic - provoke analysis rather than supply final answers.
 - Implicit procedural moves: (1) identify contradiction, (2) inspect contexts and linguistic sense, (3) apply distinctions, (4) weigh authorities against Scripture and reason.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Patristic authors: Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Gregory, Chrysostom, others.
 - Scriptural citations placed alongside patristic sententiae.
 - Immediate interlocutors include contemporaries in cathedral schools and critics such as Bernard of Clairvaux (later polemical engagement).
- **Doctrines treated (selected):**
 - Christology and Incarnation; Trinity; grace and free will; sin; sacraments; explicit and implicit material on the death of Christ, its necessity, and its scope.
 - The work functions as a repository of patristic claims that feed later systematic treatment of **atonement necessity and extent**.
- **Closing line:** Sic et Non's theological gravity is methodological: it places **reasoned distinction** between authorities and Scripture at the center of doctrinal formation, thereby reshaping how questions like the necessity and scope of the atonement are debated.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Method over dogma: theology as dialectical inquiry rather than mere compilation of authorities.
 - Emphasis on textual and contextual discrimination of patristic statements.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges the medieval tendency to treat patristic sententiae as univocal prooftexts; opposes slavish appeal to auctoritas without rational reconciliation.
 - Provoked monastic critics (e.g., Bernard) who feared erosion of assent and ecclesial unity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of juxtaposition as a pedagogical device (the "yes/no" schema).
 - Proto-scholastic deployment of distinctions (later formalized in scholastic logic and via the notion of differentiae).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Indirect influence: established a method later adopted and refined by scholastics (Peter Lombard, Aquinas) and by Protestant scholasticism in organizaing loci and treating competing authorities.
 - For debates on atonement: Sic et Non supplies a patristic dossier that later theologians exploited either to defend **universalist, universal atonement**, or **particularist/elective** readings; it also stimulated attention to competing models (satisfaction, ransom, moral influence).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A model for critical source-gathering and for training students to resolve theological tension.
 - Useful as a historical index of patristic plurality and as a methodological exemplar for examining contested doctrines such as the necessity and extent of Christ's atoning work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sic et Non** - the title and method: juxtaposing affirmative and negative authoritative statements.
- **Auctoritas** - patristic authority presented as data to be interrogated, not simply accepted.
- **Quaestio** - the question-form used to frame doctrinal tension.
- **Distinction (distinctio)** - procedural tool for resolving apparent contradiction by separating senses or contexts.
- **Collatio** - collation or comparison of sources; central operation of the book.
- **Ratio** - reasoned argument used to adjudicate between authorities; elevates rational judgment over mere citation-counting.
- **Sententiae patrum** - the patristic sentences collected; treated as arguable premises.
- **Necessity of the Passion** - locus where Sic et Non records conflicting patristic claims about whether Christ's death was metaphysically or soteriologically necessary.
- **Extent of the Atonement** - entries capture patristic variance on whether Christ died for all or for the elect.
- **Satisfaction** - early patristic statements on Christ satisfying divine justice are juxtaposed with alternative emphases.
- **Substitution** - authority texts that imply vicarious bearing of penalty appear alongside those stressing exemplary or restorative functions.
- **Moral influence** - patristic lines that anticipate non-juridical accounts are present among the contrasting sententiae.
- **Scripture vs. Patristic weight** - recurring tension: Scripture as standard for evaluating patristic statements.
- **Pedagogical heuristic** - how the work functions in classrooms: provocation to dialectical resolution.
- **Historical-index use** - scholars use Sic et Non as a compact catalogue of patristic positions relevant to atonement discussions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **historical dossier** on patristic claims about atonement necessity and extent - a primary resource for tracing variant early views.
- As a **methodological model** for dialectical theology and for forming disputations in doctrine - used pedagogically and polemically.
