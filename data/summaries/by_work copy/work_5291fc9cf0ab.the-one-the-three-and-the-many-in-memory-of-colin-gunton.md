### TITLE
The One, the Three, and the Many: In Memory of Colin Gunton - Bruce McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Trinitarian renewal in British and continental theology; occasioned by the death of Colin Gunton and ongoing debates between Barthian, Rahnerian, and social-Trinitarian trajectories.
 - Situated within renewed interest in placing the doctrine of the Trinity at the center of systematic theology and in rereading Barth for contemporary use.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:**
 - How to construe the relation between the economic Trinity (God's self‑act in revelation, especially in Christ) and the immanent Trinity (God's inner life) without collapsing God's inner freedom or severing doctrine from revelation.
 - McCormack advances that **Barth's reformulation of Rahner's rule** secures revelatory primacy while avoiding Rahner's problematic identity claim.

- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of **Rahner's Rule**: the general principle that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity (and vice versa).
 - Critical appraisal of Rahner: shows where a simple identification risks projecting human categories into God and undermines divine freedom.
 - Presentation of **Barth's reformulation**: Barth preserves the essential epistemic connection (what God has done reveals who God is) but insists the content, form, and norm of that revelation are decisively Christological and eschatological; the immanent Trinity must be known only through God's acts.
 - Application to Gunton and social Trinitarian debates: McCormack reads Gunton as rightly emphasizing relationality and the sociality of the Godhead but warns against substituting modal or metaphysical schemas that detach trinitarian doctrine from the Christ-event.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutors: **Karl Rahner**, **Karl Barth**, **Colin Gunton**.
 - Secondary resources: patristic formulations of economic/immanent distinction, contemporary social‑Trinitarian literature, Barthian dogmatics (esp. Church Dogmatics).

- **Doctrines treated:**
 - **Trinity** (economic vs immanent), **revelation**, **Christology**, doctrine of God (divine freedom and personhood), theological method (normativity of revelation).

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:**
 - Barth's Christologically grounded reformulation of Rahner's rule preserves the epistemic priority of God's acts in history while safeguarding the distinctness and freedom of the immanent Trinity-thus offering a corrective to both Rahnerian identity claims and social‑Trinitarian metaphysical excesses.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **revelatory primacy**: knowledge of God must be anchored in the concrete historical self‑revelation in Christ, not reconstructed from metaphysical presuppositions.
 - Emphasizes **Barth's dynamic relational ontology** over static metaphysics - persons are known in action and relation, not via antecedent metaphysical substances.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges Rahner's one‑to‑one identity ("economic = immanent") as insufficiently Christocentric and liable to metaphysical assimilation.
 - Counters Guntonian social Trinitarianism where it risks reversing the order (making relationality ontologically prior to revelation) or appealing to extra‑biblical metaphysics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines "Rahner's Rule" into a **Barthian reformulation**: a principle that preserves correspondence but reframes it under the norm of Christ-event and God's self‑determining freedom.

- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely engaged among scholars trying to reconcile Barthian dogmatics with social Trinitarian concerns; influential for debates about method (revelation‑first) and for critiques of speculative social models.
 - Used as a resource in Reformed circles to defend a revelation‑anchored Trinitarian theology against speculative anthropology-based models.

- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies methodological stakes in contemporary trinitarianism; supplies a balanced corrective between excessive identity claims and speculative relationalism; pedagogically useful for teaching Barth vs Rahner debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The general principle equating the economic and immanent Trinity; McCormack explicates and critiques its naïve formulations.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed in history, especially in Christ; for McCormack (via Barth) this is epistemically primary.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God's internal life; must be inferred from economic acts but not telescoped into prior metaphysics.

- **Barth's reformulation**
 - The corrective that preserves correspondence while insisting revelation in Christ is normative and decisive.

- **Christological normativity**
 - The claim that Christ's person and work determine theological claims about God's being and relations.

- **Divine freedom**
 - Emphasis that God's inner life is not mechanically determined by created categories; revelation is free self‑disclosure.

- **Social Trinitarianism**
 - The movement emphasizing persons and relations; McCormack uses Barth to critique forms that invert revelatory priority.

- **Relational ontology**
 - The idea that relations constitute personhood; assessed against Barthian insistence on revelation as the basis for claiming relational ontology.

- **Analogia relationis / analogia fidei**
 - Categories for mapping human‑divine correspondences; used cautiously to avoid ontological projection.

- **Christ-event**
 - The historical center (incarnation, cross, resurrection) through which God's triune identity is disclosed.

- **Normativity of revelation**
 - The methodological assertion that theological constructs must be ruled by what God has done.

- **Eschatological dimension**
 - The forward‑looking aspect of revelation that shapes Barth's and McCormack's reading of Trinity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Barthian reformulation of Rahner's Rule and for clarifying economic/immanent relations.
- As a **polemic** against speculative social‑Trinitarian systems that detach doctrine from revelation.
- As an **exegetical/modeling resource** for Christologically centered Trinitarian theology and for teaching methodological priorities in dogmatics.
