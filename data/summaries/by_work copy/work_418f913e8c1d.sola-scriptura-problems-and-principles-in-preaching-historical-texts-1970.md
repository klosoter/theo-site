### TITLE
Sola Scriptura: Problems and Principles in Preaching Historical Texts (1970) - Sidney Greidanus 
Site usage: 1 reference - topic: **Christ In OT And NT**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical milieu (1970). Response to mid-century homiletical trends that either privatized biblical authority or treated historical texts as merely illustrative.
 - Emerging interest in biblical-theological, redemptive-historical preaching within conservative seminaries and churches.

- **Central thesis**
 - Preaching historical (especially Old Testament) texts must be governed by the principle of **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture interprets Scripture, so sermons must be both historically responsible and canonically Christ-centered. Avoid both allegorizing and reductive moralizing.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose prevailing errors in preaching historical texts: moralistic-exemplaristic readings and ungrounded allegory.
 - Articulate hermeneutical principles rooted in Scripture's own self-witness:
 - Respect the literal-historical sense of the text.
 - Recognize progressive revelation and canonical development.
 - Seek legitimate typology and fulfillment grounded in the New Testament.
 - Provide practical guidelines for sermon construction:
 - Exegesis -> theological point -> application that flows from redemptive-historical meaning.
 - Distinguish between what the text meant then, how it functions in the canon now, and how it is preached today.
 - Emphasize Christ as the telos of Scripture (Christocentric reading) while maintaining historical integrity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit dialogue with:
 - Traditional Reformed sources (Calvinic canon-within-canon, analogy of faith).
 - Nineteenth- and twentieth-century homileticians who favored moralizing or purely historical-critical approaches.
 - Early proponents of typological preaching and emerging redemptive-historical teachers.
 - Uses New Testament fulfillment texts as hermeneutical controls.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and the authority of Scripture (Sola Scriptura).
 - Christology (Christ as fulfillment/telos).
 - Canonical hermeneutics and typology.
 - Covenant and redemptive history as the organizing framework for biblical narrative.

- **Closing line**
 - **Preaching historical texts faithfully requires a Sola Scriptura hermeneutic that preserves historical sense, recognizes canonical fulfillment in Christ, and shapes proclamation so that Scripture itself governs sermon meaning.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight integration of **Sola Scriptura** with homiletics: not just a doctrine of authority but a practical rule for sermon method.
 - Insistence that typology must be validated by New Testament usage; typology is canonical, not speculative.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic/moralizing homiletics that reduces biblical narrative to ethical examples.
 - Counters both naive allegory (free spiritualizing) and cold historical-critical reductionism that severs redemptive meaning.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized language and methodological clarity for "redemptive-historical" preaching before it became widespread.
 - Clear operational distinction between **historical-literal sense**, **canonical redemptive-historical sense**, and **contemporary application**.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and conservative evangelical homileticians; anticipated later, more extensive treatments (e.g., Greidanus 1999).
 - Adopted in preaching curricula as a corrective to moralistic sermonizing and to simplistic allegory.
 - Criticized by some for potentially underplaying immediate moral application or for relying on NT warrant that may itself need exegetical defense.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, usable hermeneutic that bridges careful exegesis and Christ-centered proclamation.
 - Remains a staple reference for pastors learning to preach Old Testament narrative in a way that honors both history and fulfillment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura**
 - Scripture as final interpretive norm; sermon meaning must be governed by Scripture itself.

- **Redemptive-historical**
 - Reading biblical events as moments in the unfolding plan of salvation culminating in Christ.

- **Typology**
 - Legitimate patterns/foreshadowing of Christ in earlier events, validated when the New Testament treats them as such.

- **Fulfillment**
 - NT interpretation that locates the telos of earlier texts in the person and work of Christ.

- **Literal-historical sense**
 - The text's original, communicative meaning in its historical and literary context.

- **Canonical sense / canon within canon**
 - The interpretive move from a text's original meaning to its function within the whole canon, especially regarding Christ.

- **Moralistic-exemplaristic reading**
 - A discouraged approach that reduces narrative to ethical examples without redemptive-historical grounding.

- **Allegorizing**
 - Undisciplined spiritualization of texts; opposed as illegitimate unless NT warrant exists.

- **Progressive revelation**
 - The notion that later revelation (culminating in Christ) clarifies earlier texts; used to justify canonical typology.

- **Analogy of faith**
 - Reformed principle: interpret difficult texts in light of clearer teaching elsewhere in Scripture.

- **Christocentric hermeneutic / christotelic reading**
 - Interpreting Scripture with Christ as the focal goal and interpretive horizon.

- **Exegesis -> proclamation -> application**
 - Methodological sequence Greidanus recommends for sermon formation.

- **Historical-critical method (qualified)**
 - Employed to secure the literal-historical sense but subordinated to canonical theology and proclamation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for redemptive-historical preaching and Sola Scriptura applied to homiletics.
- As a **polemic** against moralistic and allegorical sermonizing.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching Old Testament narratives with canonical and Christological sensitivity.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Reformed doctrinal commitments (Scripture, covenant, Christ) to practical sermon method.
