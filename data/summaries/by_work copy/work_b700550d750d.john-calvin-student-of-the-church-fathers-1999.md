### TITLE
**John Calvin: Student of the Church Fathers** (Anthony N. S. Lane, 1999)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century reassessment of Calvin's relation to tradition; part of a wider scholarly move against the caricature of Calvin as anti-patristic. Lane writes within Reformation studies and patristics reception history, aiming to correct older historiography that minimized Calvin's debt to the Fathers.
- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin should be understood as a careful, constructive *student* of the church fathers: he selectively appropriated patristic theology (especially Augustinian and Greek Fathers) to shape Reformed doctrine while subordinating all tradition to Scripture.
 - Applied to adoption: Calvin's doctrine of adoption is rooted in patristic filiation language but reworked within his soteriological and forensic framework.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Calvin's textual practice: frequent, contextualized citations of patristic writers in exegesis and theology.
 - Demonstration of specific patristic sources Calvin uses (Augustine as primary, with Chrysostom, Athanasius, Cyril, etc.) and how he adapts them.
 - Case studies (notably soteriological loci such as justification and adoption) showing continuity and creative development.
 - Methodological claim: Calvin is neither slavish imitator nor total innovator-he is a critic-conserver who reads Fathers through Scripture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary patristic interlocutors: Augustine (central), John Chrysostom, Athanasius, Cyril; selective use of Greek patristic corpus.
 - Historiographical interlocutors: earlier portrayals of Calvin as anti-patristic; the competing streams of scholastic Reformed theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Focused applications include **adoption** (chief example), with collateral treatment of **justification**, **union with Christ**, **Holy Spirit**, **sacramental theology**, and ecclesiology as they intersect with patristic motifs.
- **Closing line**
 - Lane's central theological gravity: Calvin's articulation of adoption exemplifies his wider method-patristic continuity reinterpreted in evangelical, Scripture-led categories so that sonship becomes both forensic status and filial reality grounded in union with Christ and sealed by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses Calvin's engagement with the **Greek Fathers** (not only Augustine) and his pastoral-exegetical use of patristic materials, not merely rhetorical citation.
 - Presents adoption as a locus where patristic filiation language is reconfigured into Reformed soteriology.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters the older thesis that Calvin rejected patristic authority; shows Calvin's selective affirmation and critical use.
 - Distinguishes Calvin's approach from medieval scholastic appropriation-less system-bound, more exegetical and pastoral.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Highlights Calvin's balancing of **forensic categories** (legal adoption, inheritance) with **ontological filial language** (real participation in Christ), showing a terminological fusion influenced by Fathers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influenced later Reformed and patristic scholarship by legitimizing a ressourcement reading of Calvin-useful for contemporary retrieval of patristic theology within Protestant frameworks.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a careful model for reading Reformers in their patristic context; especially valuable for teaching how adoption, sonship, and the Spirit function in Calvin's soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adoption (adoptio)** - Calvin's doctrine: legal incorporation into God's family (forensic) and real filial status through union with Christ; Lane traces its patristic contours.
- **Filiation / Sonship** - Patristic language Calvin inherits; used to express believers' new identity in Christ beyond mere legalism.
- **Forensic justification** - Calvin retains legal categories; adoption is a corollary status conferred by justification.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological ground for adoption; Calvin interprets patristic union motifs in Pauline terms.
- **Holy Spirit (seal/guarantee)** - Spirit as witness and pledge of adoption; Lane shows patristic echoes in Calvin's pneumatology.
- **Patristic appropriation** - Calvin's method of selecting, adapting, and critiquing Fathers under Scripture's authority.
- **Exegetical rather than systematic use** - Calvin often cites Fathers to illumine texts rather than to supply systematic prooftexts.
- **Augustinian priority** - Augustine is primary source and filter; Calvin inherits Augustinian emphases on grace and filiation.
- **Greek Fathers** - Calvin's engagement with Chrysostom, Athanasius, etc., giving broader patristic resources than often assumed.
- **Forensic-filial synthesis** - Lane's description of Calvin's blending of legal standing and familial reality in adoption language.
- **Ressourcement posture** - Calvin as returning to early sources in order to reform doctrine; not identical to modern ressourcement but analogous.
- **Scripture's supremacy** - All patristic usage is subordinate to Scripture in Calvin's method (central controlling norm).
- **Pastoral-exegetical orientation** - Calvin reads Fathers to aid proclamation and pastoral care, not simply for antiquarian fidelity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for claims of Calvin's patristic continuity, especially regarding adoption and sonship.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how patristic citations function in Calvin's commentaries on adoption texts (e.g., Romans).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates between Reformed scholastic readings and more historically informed Retrieval projects.
