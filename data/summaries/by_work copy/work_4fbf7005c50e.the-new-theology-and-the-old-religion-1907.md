### TITLE
The New Theology and the Old Religion (1907) - Charles Gore

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century England amid the rise of Christian modernism and the so-called "New Theology" (notably the movement popularized by R. J. Campbell and continental Ritschlian/Harnackian currents).
 - Gore writes as an Anglo-Catholic bishop/theologian defending classical Anglican orthodoxy against liberal reinterpretations of core doctrines.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The theological innovations of the "New Theology" misrepresent the Christian faith by subordinating or reconstructing central Christian doctrines (especially Christology and the atonement) to modern philosophical and moral ideals. Gore argues for the continuity of the historical, sacramental, and creedal "old religion."
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: defines the tendencies of the New Theology - demythologizing, moralization of religion, and reconstruction of Christ in humanist terms.
 - Christology: examines claims about the Son's person and work; critiques radical kenosis theories that imply ontological loss of divine attributes.
 - Doctrine of revelation: defends incarnation as the unique, objective self-revelation of God, not merely an ethical exemplar or religious experience.
 - Ecclesial and sacramental consequences: warns that the New Theology undermines the corporate, sacramental life and the authority of tradition.
 - Method: combines biblical exegesis, patristic and conciliar appeals (Chalcedon), and systematic theological argumentation.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Directly addresses English modernists (notably R. J. Campbell and similar public theologians).
 - Engages continental influences (Ritschl, Harnack) and historical resources (Scripture, Fathers, Chalcedon).
 - Draws on Anglican catholic sensibilities and pastoral concerns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (incarnation, hypostatic union, kenosis debates)
 - **Trinity** (implications of kenosis for divine attributes)
 - **Atonement** (objective vs. moralized readings)
 - **Revelation and authority** (historicity, creeds, sacramental mediation)
 - **Ecclesiology** (role of church and sacraments in maintaining orthodoxy)
- **Closing line**
 - Gore insists the Christian faith must preserve the risen, divine Son's objective work and the Church's creedal continuity; reform must not abandon the metaphysical and historical claims that anchor salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A measured Anglo-Catholic retrieval of patristic and Chalcedonian categories against modern reductionisms; insists on the objective, metaphysical reality of the Incarnation and atonement.
 - Pastoral concern: theological corrections are tied to ecclesial and pastoral consequences (sacramental life, public preaching).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges Ritschlian/Harnackian tendencies to make Christ primarily an ethical teacher or religious ideal.
 - Rejects radical kenoticism that interprets Philippians 2 as ontological self-emptying involving loss of divine attributes.
 - Allows disciplined use of "self-limitation" language but reasserts the permanence of the Son's divine person and agency.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Distinguishes between moral/relational self-limitation and ontological divestment in kenosis discussions; presses for precise use of hypostatic and Trinitarian terminology in popular theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Read widely in Anglican circles as a classic conservative rebuttal to early 20th-century liberalism.
 - Helped shape Anglican and broader Protestant responses to modernist reinterpretations of Christology and atonement.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a concise model of combining historical-ecclesial concerns with doctrinal precision; useful for seminars on kenosis, modernism, and Anglican apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Theology** - umbrella term for early 20th-century liberal theologies that reframe Christian doctrines in modern ethical/experiential categories.
- **Old Religion** - Gore's shorthand for the creedal, sacramental, apostolic Christianity preserved in historic tradition.
- **Kenosis** - the "self-emptying" of the Son (Phil. 2); Gore:
 - Accepts kenosis as realening (functional self-limitation) within the economy of redemption.
 - Rejects kenosis understood as ontological subtraction of divine attributes.
- **Hypostatic Union** - the Chalcedonian doctrine that Gore defends as non-negotiable: full deity and full humanity in the one Person of Christ.
- **Incarnation (objective self-revelation)** - incarnation is presented as an ontological event of divine self-communication, not merely moral influence or religious exemplum.
- **Atonement (objective / sacramental emphasis)** - opposes reduction to mere moral influence; maintains substitutional, objective elements mediated by the Church and sacraments.
- **Divine immutability / attributes** - Gore stresses these as theological guardrails; any theory of Christ must account for God's continuity of being.
- **Revelation and Authority** - the balance between personal divine revelation in Christ and the ecclesial/historical custody of that revelation (creeds, sacraments).
- **Ritschlianism / Harnackianism** - representative continental streams that inform the New Theology; Gore critiques their tendency to privatize and moralize doctrine.
- **Anglican Catholicism** - Gore's confessional matrix; colors his appeal to tradition and sacramental theology.
- **Patristic witness** - employed to show historical continuity against novelty claims.
- **Moralization of religion** - Gore's critique of reducing doctrine to ethical ideals.
- **Historicity** - insistence on historical facts (death, resurrection) as non-negotiable theological anchors.
- **Ecclesial consequence** - link between doctrinal revision and practical erosion of church life and sacraments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against modernist/kenotic extremes - often cited in debates over kenosis and modernist Christologies.
- As a **definition source** for conservative Anglican readings of kenosis and the limits of theological reform.
- As an **exegetical-ecclesial model** showing how doctrinal fidelity is argued from Scripture, tradition, and pastoral consequences.
