### TITLE
The Baptized Body (2007) - Peter J. Leithart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2007 amid renewed interest in sacramental and ecclesial theology within contemporary Reformed circles.
 - Emerged from debates associated with the **Federal Vision** movement and a wider recovery of patristic/sacramental emphases against nominalistic individualism in North American Presbyterianism.
- **Central thesis**
 - Baptism is not merely a sign or declaration but constitutive of Christian identity and communal life: the church is the **baptized body** - an embodied, visible, sacramental organism shaped by baptism, the means of grace, and covenantal belonging.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses a modern defect: separation of word and sacrament, privatization of faith, and attenuation of the church as a visible, corporate body.
 - Reclaims biblical and patristic resources to argue that baptism effectually incorporates persons into Christ and the church, producing a baptized existence (koinonia, obedience, prayer, worship).
 - Reframes the relationship of preaching, sacraments, and prayer as integrated **means of grace** that form the communal life of the baptized.
 - Consequences traced into ecclesiology (visible church), covenant theology (monocovenantal readings), and soteriology (implications for justification and assurance).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws heavily on Scripture, early church fathers, Augustine and Calvin for sacramental exegesis.
 - Engages contemporary Reformed interlocutors and critics of the Federal Vision debates; implicitly contrasts with strict invisible-church models and forensic-only readings of justification.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Baptism** (efficacy and incorporation), **ecclesiology** (visible vs invisible church), **covenant theology** (continuity/monocovenantalism), **soteriology** (union with Christ, justification), **means of grace** (preaching, sacraments, prayer).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: the church is primarily a **baptized, sacramental body** whose identity, ethics, and assurance flow from incorporation into Christ through baptism and the ongoing, embodied economy of the means of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly **baptismal ontology**: personal and communal identity is shaped by the fact of baptism rather than only by invisible regeneration.
 - Integration of **preaching, sacraments, and prayer** as mutually constitutive means of grace forming the baptized life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges the classic **visible/invisible church distinction**, arguing it undercuts ecclesial and sacramental realism; insists on taking the visible body seriously without collapsing into voluntarism or nominal membership.
 - Pushes against a purely forensic account of salvation that severs justification from covenantal life and baptismal incorporation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Coining and sustained use of the phrase **"baptized body"** to reconceptualize ecclesial ontology and moral formation.
 - Emphasis on **baptismal ethics** - baptism as shaping obedience, prayer, and communal worship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within segments of Reformed and Presbyterian circles sympathetic to Federal Vision or sacramental renewal.
 - Highly contested: critics argue it blurs justification by faith, threatens assurance, or departs from confessional formulations; defenders praise its pastoral and liturgical corrective.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes a renewed study of baptism, ecclesial visibility, and sacramental theology; useful corrective to Protestant privatism and a catalyst for liturgical and pastoral reforms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptized body**
 - The church understood primarily as an embodied, baptized organism; identity and ethics flow from incorporation into Christ via baptism.
- **Baptismal incorporation**
 - The claim that baptism actually unites a person to Christ and to the church in ways that shape status and life.
- **Means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer)**
 - Treated as an integrated triad; preaching and sacraments are not opposed but cooperate to form the baptized life.
 - Specific focus on how **preaching** functions sacramentally to incorporate and nurture the baptized.
- **Visible and invisible church (critique)**
 - Leithart critiques a strict bifurcation; insists on taking the **visible** (baptized, corporate life) seriously without denying hidden realities.
- **Monocovenantalism / Federal Vision**
 - Affirms strong continuity of God's one covenant across testaments; shapes his reading of sacraments, election, and communal promise.
- **Covenantal faithfulness**
 - Ethics and assurance tied to covenantal belonging and baptismal participation, not merely private imputed righteousness.
- **Justification debates (FV and justification by faith)**
 - Engages contested FV claims: sees justification as related to baptismal incorporation and covenantal standing, provoking controversies over imputation and forensic categories.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological category; baptism is primary sacramental sign and means of that union.
- **Visible saints / mixed body**
 - Treats the church as a mixed, visible assembly, but one whose baptized status has real normative force.
- **Sacramental realism**
 - Robust realism about signs and their participatory effects.
- **Baptismal ethics**
 - The implication that baptism forms mutual obligations, worship habits, and communal prayer life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for baptismal ecclesiology and sacramental formation.
- As a **polemic** against strict visible/invisible distinctions and privatized Protestant piety.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading NT baptism and union with Christ sacramentally.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Federal Vision discussions about monocovenantalism and the contours of justification by faith.
