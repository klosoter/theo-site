### TITLE
Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account - Steven J. Duby

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed dogmatic theology addressing longstanding classical-theistic doctrine in the late 20th-21st century milieu.
 - Moves against trends that either marginalize simplicity as speculative metaphysics or reject it on the basis of modern analytic objections.
- **Central thesis**
 - Divine simplicity is a central, coherent dogmatic claim: God is metaphysically simple (no parts, no real composition), and this doctrinal claim is both theologically necessary and scripturally defensible within orthodox Trinitarian faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of what divine simplicity means in classical terms: identity of God's attributes with God's essence; denial of metaphysical composition; God as ipsum esse subsistens/actus purus.
 - Historical-theological genealogy: tracing simplicity through Augustine, medieval scholastics, Reformed scholastics, and Reformation confessions to show continuity and variety of emphases.
 - Doctrinal correction: distinguishes dogmatic commitments from speculative metaphysical reconstructions that go beyond confessional bounds.
 - Engagement with contemporary objections: addresses challenges from epistemology (how we speak of God), metaphysics (composition, properties), moral theology (passibility and emotions), and Trinitarian theology (relations without composition).
 - Systematic implications: shows how simplicity impacts doctrine of attributes, aseity, immutability, providence, revelation, and the doctrine of the Trinity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine and medieval tradition (notably Thomistic categories), Reformed figures (e.g., John Owen, Calvinistic scholastics), and contemporary analytic/theological critics of simplicity.
 - Scripture and confessional materials are used as dogmatic anchors rather than mere historical curiosities.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (unity of attributes with essence), aseity, immutability, impassibility, eternity, relation of God to creation (creator-creature distinction), Trinity (relations and persons), and implications for revelation and knowability.
- **Closing line**
 - Simplicity, rightly understood and guarded against caricature, functions as a doctrinal hinge: it protects the Creator/creature distinction while enabling coherent talk about God's unity, attributes, and saving acts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presents simplicity as a dogmatic, confessional claim-not merely as abstract metaphysics-thereby relocating the debate within church theology rather than academic metaphysics alone.
 - Stresses theological economy: attributes are not separate properties that multiply God; they are unified in the one divine essence.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against two errors:
 - Reductionist modernism that treats simplicity as unintelligible and discards it.
 - Overly scholastic reconstructions that turn simplicity into an isolated metaphysical system divorced from Scripture and Trinitarian commitment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes careful differentiation between metaphysical "simplicity" and rhetorical/analogical language about God; insists on disciplined use of classical categories within dogmatic method.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Particularly influential in Reformed dogmatic circles and contemporary doctoral work on classical theism; used as a corrective in seminaries that wish to recover classical attributes while engaging modern objections.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, defensible, confessionally oriented account of simplicity that is pedagogically useful and theologically robust for systematic treatments of the doctrine of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God has no metaphysical parts; attributes are not additional constituents but are identical to God's simple essence.
- **Actus purus (pure act)**
 - God as actuality without potentiality; explains immutability and aseity.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence from creation; tied to simplicity by denying derivation of God's being.
- **Immutability**
 - God's non-changing nature; simplicity undergirds a stable ontology of God.
- **Impassibility**
 - Denial that God is passible in a way that compromises divine simplicity or sovereignty; distinguishes anthropomorphic language.
- **Essence-existence relation**
 - Classical claim that in God essence and existence are not compositionally distinct; used to safeguard God's unique mode of being.
- **Attributes (communicable/ incommunicable)**
 - Attributes (wisdom, power, goodness) are not independent properties but expressions of the one divine essence.
- **Creator-creature distinction**
 - Simplicity reinforces ontological distinction by denying compositional continuity between God and creatures.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)**
 - Methodological principle for speaking of God analogically without collapsing divine simplicity into creaturely categories.
- **Trinitarian relations**
 - Treats relations of persons as compatible with simplicity by locating relationality in personal subsistence without metaphysical composition.
- **Revelation and predication**
 - How Scripture predicates attributes of God without implying parts; hermeneutical caution against literalizing anthropomorphism.
- **Metaphysical objections**
 - Engages worries about incoherence, freedom, and relationality; offers theological responses rather than purely analytic dismissal.
- **Ongoing pedagogical use**
 - Used as: definition source for classical simplicity in syllabi; polemical resource against simplistic modern criticisms; conceptual pivot in systematics when moving from doctrine of God to Trinity, attributes, and providence.
- **Typical loci of deployment**
 - As a definitional/dogmatic reference in theology lectures; as a polemic in debates with contemporaryists; as an exegetical guardrail when reading biblical language about God.
