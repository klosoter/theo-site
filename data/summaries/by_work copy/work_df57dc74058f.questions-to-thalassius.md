### TITLE
Questions to Thalassius - Maximus the Confessor

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 7th century Byzantine milieu (pre- and intramural to the monothelite controversies); Maximus writes as an ascetic-theologian and court exile who preserves and sharpens Chalcedonian language.
 - Situated within post-Chalcedonian debates over how to speak of Christ's natures, operations and wills (see: Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To explain how the **two natures** of Christ (divine and human) relate to the **one person (hypostasis)**, especially in respect to properties, operations and will; to avoid both absorption (Eutychianism) and separation (Nestorianism).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presented as question-and-answer exegesis addressing attribution of actions and properties.
 - Major moves:
 - Distinguish what belongs to a nature (physis) from what belongs to a person/hypostasis.
 - Show that properties and operations properly belong to the nature from which they arise, while the person is the single agent who subsumes actions without confusing natures.
 - Treat will and operation carefully: natural properties and operations are ascribed to natures even when the unified person performs or experiences them (anticipating later dyothelite argumentation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Addressee: Thalassius; draws on Cappadocians, Cyril of Alexandria, the Chalcedonian Definition, and patristic lexical resources; implicitly argues against Monophysite and later Monoenergist/Monothelite tendencies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: Christology (hypostatic union, two natures, communication of idioms), anthropology of Christ (will, operation), and relevant talk of passibility/impassibility.
 - Secondary: implications for Trinitarian language insofar as person/nature distinctions are analogically applied.
- **Closing line**
 - Maximus insists on a Chalcedonian balance: **two distinct natures, each with its properties and operations, united in one hypostasis so that the one Person acts and suffers without confusion or division** (see: Hypostatic Union).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous lexical pruning: persistent separation of category terms (physis, hypostasis, prosopon, ousia) to avoid theological slippage.
 - Emphasis on the logic of attribution: what properly belongs to a nature versus what may be predicated of the person who subsists in those natures.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Clarifies and defends Chalcedonian formula against both monophysite absorption and Nestorian compartmentalization.
 - Anticipates and provides conceptual resources later used against Monoenergism/Monothelitism by insisting on the coherence of ascribing human operations to the human nature without implying two persons.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of "operation" (energeia) and "will" (thelema) as technical categories tied to nature vs person; careful balancing of "communication of idioms" so that properties may be ascribed without ontological confusion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Eastern Orthodox Christology; Maximus is a key interlocutor at Constantinople III where dyothelitism is affirmed.
 - In Western/Reformed traditions his work is less directly formative but respected as a technical resource for Christological nuance.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined method for resolving predication problems in Christology; indispensable for teaching the hypostatic union and for contesting modern simplifications that collapse person/nature distinctions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Physis (nature)** - the principle of properties and operations; Maximus insists properties belong to natures.
- **Hypostasis (subsistent person)** - the singular subject who unites the two natures without confusion.
- **Prosopon (person/face)** - relational designation of the one who acts; used to guard against notion of two acting subjects.
- **Ousia (essence)** - shared being; used to differentiate common divine-human language from personal predication.
- **Idiomata (properties)** - the characteristics proper to each nature; central to communication-of-idioms debates.
- **Energeia (operation / activity)** - activity that issues from a nature; Maximus distinguishes natural operations from person-as-agent.
- **Thelema (will)** - the faculty tied to nature; discussed carefully in relation to whether Christ has one or two wills (foundation for later dyothelite defense).
- **Communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties)** - how properties of natures are legitimately ascribed to the one person without ontological mixture.
- **Concurrence / concursus** - cooperative description of how divine and human realities coexist in action.
- **Passibility / impassibility** - distinction showing divine impassibility and human passibility in Christ without dividing the person.
- **Assumption (assumptio)** - the taking-on of human nature by the Word; central to Maximus' anthropology of the incarnate life.
- **Natural operations vs. personal agency** - a methodological pair that Maximus uses to keep natures distinct yet person unified.
- **Dyophysitism (two-natures doctrine)** - Maximus's explicit alignment with Chalcedon (see: Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine).
- **Hypostatic union** - conceptual framing of the union Maximus defends (see: Hypostatic Union).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for precise explication of Chalcedonian categories and the hypostatic union.
 - As a **polemic and theological toolkit** against Monophysite and Monothelite errors.
 - As an **exegetical model** for attributing actions and experiences to Christ in sermons and dogmatic treatises.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Patristic and Byzantine theology for parsing person-nature predication.
