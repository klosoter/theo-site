### TITLE
Reading Genesis Well: Navigating History, Poetry, Science, and Truth in Genesis 1-11 (Jack Collins, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2018 by an evangelical Old Testament scholar (Jack Collins, Covenant Theological Seminary). Writes from conservative Reformed commitments but aims to engage scientific and scholarly conversations about origins.
 - Situated in debates among Young Earth Creationism, old-earth/concordist readings, and recent literary/functional approaches associated with John Walton.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - One can and should read Genesis 1-11 as theologically authoritative and broadly historical without collapsing the text into modern scientific frames or denying literary genres; Genesis yields theological truth about origins, human identity, sin, and covenant while interlocuting responsibly with science.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method - argues for a disciplined hermeneutic that attends to genre, poetical and narrative features, ancient Near Eastern context, canonical placement, and theological aims.
 - Part II: Genesis 1-11 exegesis - treats creation (Genesis 1), Eden and the Fall, Cain/Abel, genealogy and Babel, and the Flood with sustained attention to history/poetry distinctions.
 - Part III: Interaction with science - assesses where Genesis requires historical/hypothetical claims (e.g., the existence of Adam) and where it leaves room for scientific models (e.g., cosmology, chronology).
 - Concludes with pastoral and theological implications: image of God, Adam as covenant/federal head, human sinfulness, and Christ as fulfillment.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages ancient interpreters and Reformers (broadly), modern exegetes and scientists: John Walton (functional ontology), proponents of concordism and Young Earth Creationism, and scientists addressing human origins.
 - Draws on Biblical theology, ANE parallels, linguistic and literary studies, and population genetics literature (dialogue with scientific claims about humanity's origins).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical authority; creation and cosmology; image of God; original sin and federal headship of Adam; covenant (Adamic/creation covenant themes); Christology (Adam-Christ typology) and soteriology implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Collins aims to preserve Genesis 1-11 as both theologically central and plausibly historical: read carefully, Genesis anchors Christian doctrine of humanity and fall without forcing the biblical text into contemporary scientific categories.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A balanced hermeneutic that insists on canonical-theological reading while taking scientific claims seriously - neither capitulating to modern scientism nor retreating to anti-intellectualist literalism.
 - Clear defense of the **historicity of Adam** and his role as **federal head**, while acknowledging legitimate methodological differences about how to relate biblical days to modern science.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects excesses of Young Earth literalism by criticizing eisegetical impositions of modern chronology onto the text.
 - Pushes back on extreme non-historical or purely functional readings (e.g., some readings of Walton) by arguing Genesis intends real persons/events foundational for covenantal theology.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Promotes a "read Genesis well" hermeneutic: disciplined attention to genre + theological intentions + historical claims - a middle path between concordism and purely literary approaches.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among conservative evangelicals and Reformed scholars seeking a mediating position; praised for clarity and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Criticized by some YEC stalwarts for perceived openness to scientific chronologies and by some literary/functional proponents for insisting on historical claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a model for evangelical engagement with science and for courses on Genesis, providing a hermeneutical framework useful in preaching, teaching, and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historicity of Adam**
 - Collins argues for a real first human (Adam) who functions as covenant/federal head - necessary for traditional doctrines of original sin and corporate guilt.
- **Federal headship**
 - Adam as representative: his sin constitutes corporate consequences for humanity; Collins treats this as non-negotiable for orthodox soteriology.
- **Days of Creation**
 - Treated as theologically decisive but interpretively flexible: Collins surveys 24-hour, day-age, analogical, and framework views, advocating a hermeneutic that honors the text's aims while engaging science.
- **Functional ontology (John Walton)**
 - Discussed critically: Collins acknowledges Walton's insights about ANE context but resists reducing Genesis 1 to only functional assignments divorced from material origins.
- **Genre and literary features**
 - Emphasizes narrative, poetry, genealogy, and canonical placement as keys to interpreting historical claims.
- **Canonical-theological reading**
 - Reading Genesis with attention to its role in the canon and its theological motifs (image of God, covenant, promise).
- **Image of God**
 - Central to anthropology; Collins ties the image to relational and representative functions, supporting the need for a historical Adam to ground corporate human identity.
- **Accommodation and revelation**
 - Argues Scripture accommodates human language and ancient categories while faithfully conveying truth; hermeneutic must discern accommodation vs. doctrinal claim.
- **Interaction with science**
 - Not a concordist program; promotes respectful dialogue - science can inform non-theological details (e.g., chronology) but cannot overturn central theological claims.
- **Original sin / Fall**
 - Treated as a historical event with real ontological consequences for humanity; linked to federal headship.
- **Flood and Babel**
 - Treated as historically grounded narratives carrying covenantal and theological import, though methodological caution is urged in correlating with archeology.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Exegetical model: used in seminars and commentaries as a disciplined hermeneutic for Genesis 1-11.
 - Polemic and dialogue: serves as a bridge in debates between YEC, old-earth theists, and functional/ancient-context interpreters, particularly on Adam and the days of creation.
