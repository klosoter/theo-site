### TITLE
**Evangelical Theology: Lectures on Doctrine - A. A. Hodge**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid- to late-19th century American Presbyterianism; Princeton Seminary milieu; conservative Reformed reaction to Enlightenment rationalism, revivalist voluntarism, and emerging higher criticism.
 - Lectures shaped for seminary instruction and pastoral formation; stands in the confessional tradition (Westminster Standards).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To present a systematic, Biblical, and confessional exposition of evangelical (Reformed) doctrine that vindicates divine sovereignty in salvation and the complete ruin and incapacity of unregenerate human nature.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Method: Scriptural exegesis allied to careful philosophical/psychological analysis of terms (nature, will, power).
 - Major moves:
 - Establish Scripture and confessions as normative for doctrine.
 - Define human nature after the Fall: corruption is universal and radical.
 - Demonstrate **total depravity** (comprehensive moral corruption) and **total inability** (incapacity to perform saving spiritual good).
 - Explain divine remedy: particular redemption, effectual calling, regeneration as a supernatural act.
 - Apply soteriological logic to sanctification, ecclesiology, sacraments, and eschatology.
 - Practical emphasis: pastoral implications for preaching, evangelism, and assurance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Scripture and Westminster Confession/Assembly divines.
 - Historical interlocutors: Augustine and Calvin (positive models); Arminius/Wesley and Pelagian tendencies (as foil); contemporary rationalists and Unitarians.
 - Uses classical patristic and Reformation tradition to buttress claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture, God (attributes, sovereignty), Trinity, Christology (person and work), atonement, human nature/original sin, total depravity, total inability, regeneration, justification, sanctification, sacraments, church, last things.

- **Closing line**
 - A. A. Hodge centers evangelical theology on the twin certainties of God's sovereign grace and the radical incapacity of fallen humanity, arguing that only sovereign, supernatural regeneration can render a sinner spiritually competent.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precision in psychological language about the will: insists the unregenerate will is not neutral but bound and inclined to sin - hence "inability" is real and comprehensive.
 - Integrates pastoral application with propositional dogmatics: doctrine shapes preaching and evangelistic method.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects revivalist voluntarism and moral-suasion models that presuppose an ability to choose God apart from regeneration.
 - Polemically opposes Arminian notions of prevenient grace that make prevenient moral ability decisive for salvation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic insistence on distinguishing degrees of inability (moral vs. physical) and on defining "total" as comprehensive moral impotence, not metaphysical annihilation.
 - Uses contemporary philosophical categories to sharpen classical Protestant formulations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard text in conservative Reformed seminaries; reinforced Princetonian orthodoxy.
 - Influential in late-19th and early-20th century American Presbyterian and Reformed circles; used against liberalizing tendencies and Arminian theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, disciplined presentation of total depravity and human inability; valuable for doctrinal instruction, pastoral theology, and confessional apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity**
 - The pervasive corruption of all faculties (mind, will, affections) after the Fall; sin permeates human nature.

- **Total Inability**
 - The unregenerate person's inability to perform saving spiritual good or to respond savingly to God without divine regeneration.

- **Regeneration (New Birth)**
 - A supernatural, immediate act of God that creates spiritual life and enables faith and repentance.

- **Sovereign Grace**
 - God's free, efficacious action in election, calling, and salvation; salvation originates in God, not in human will.

- **Effectual Calling**
 - The internal call of the Spirit that infallibly brings the elect to salvation; distinguished from external proclamation.

- **Imputation**
 - Forensic crediting (e.g., of Adam's sin to the race; of Christ's righteousness to believers) as foundational to guilt and justification.

- **Bondage of the Will**
 - The philosophical-theological claim that the will, taken by sin, lacks freedom to choose spiritual good apart from grace.

- **Particular Redemption (Definite Atonement)**
 - The view that Christ's atonement is efficacious for the elect; Hodge treats this within Westminster parameters.

- **Common Grace**
 - Non-saving favors God gives to humanity broadly; distinguished from saving, effectual grace.

- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture as ultimate norm for doctrine and the primary warrant for systematic theology.

- **Confessionalism**
 - Use of Westminster Standards as doctrinal compass and summary of evangelical/Reformed teaching.

- **Anthropological Terms**
 - Nature, faculty, inclination: used to diagnose the scope and depth of sin.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for articulating and teaching total depravity and total inability in Reformed curricula.
- As a **polemical manual** against Arminianism, revivalist voluntarism, and liberal anthropology.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading passages on sin, will, and regeneration (e.g., Romans, Ephesians).
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrinal theology with pastoral practice (preaching, evangelism, assurance).
