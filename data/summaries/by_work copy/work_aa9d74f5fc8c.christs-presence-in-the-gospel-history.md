### TITLE
Christ's Presence in the Gospel History - Hugh Martin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid to late 19th century Scottish Presbyterian context; part of the Reformed biblical-theological revival in Britain. Martin writes from a conservative evangelical standpoint responsive to historical-critical currents and pastorally oriented homiletics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ is personally and functionally present throughout the unfolding gospel history; understanding this presence requires attention to Christ's threefold office (Munus Triplex: Prophet, Priest, King) as the organizing principle of his activity and manifestation in Scripture, church, and sacraments.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - exegetical base: close reading of Gospel narratives showing continuity between OT anticipation and NT fulfillment of Christ's person and roles;
 - theological synthesis: articulation of the unity of Christ's person with distinct exercise of offices across history and ministry contexts;
 - pastoral application: implications for preaching, sacraments, and ecclesial life where Christ's presence is mediated by Word and covenant signs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary authority: Scripture (especially the four Gospels and Pauline teaching);
 - Reformation and Reformed tradition resources (Calvinic doctrine of offices, Scottish divines);
 - Implicit polemics with contemporary liberal exegesis and emerging critical skepticism about Christ's historical and mediatorial continuity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and offices), revelation, covenant, incarnation, mediation/mediatorship, sacraments and ecclesiology, typology and fulfillment.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Martin insists that the gospel history is not merely a sequence of events but the continuous presence and self-communication of the incarnate Christ, intelligible only when read through the lens of his prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats Christ's presence as simultaneously historical and sacramental: present in the narrative, present in preaching, and present in the covenant signs.
 - Systematic use of the Munus Triplex as the hermeneutical key to Gospel history rather than a merely didactic schema.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrective to reductionist readings that separate the "historical Jesus" from the "Christ of faith"; Martin insists on continuity of person and office.
 - Pushback against liberal theology that treats gospel narratives as mythic reminiscence; emphasizes concrete, mediatorial presence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integrates classic Reformed language about offices with pastoral categories of presence and mediation; frames sacramental efficacy in terms of Christ's active ministerial offices.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Modest but durable influence in Reformed homiletical circles and Scottish Presbyterian teaching; cited in later treatments of ministerial office and sacramental theology.
 - Less prominent in broader academic theology but valued in confessional contexts for clarity on mediation and pastoral practice.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, serviceable model for reading gospels theologically; useful for preachers, sacramental theology courses, and courses on Christology that wish to connect doctrine with pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus Triplex (threefold office):** Prophet, Priest, King - the central organizing category for Christ's presence and activity across gospel history.
- **Christ's Presence (praesentia Christi):** Martin's technical concern: personal, active, covenantal presence manifested historically and sacramentally.
 - contrasted with metaphysical presence (ontological alone) and mere memory/ideal presence.
- **Mediation / Mediatorship:** Christ as the sole mediator whose offices are the means by which presence and benefits are communicated.
- **Typology and Fulfillment:** Reading OT persons/events as anticipations that find concrete fulfillment in the incarnate Christ exercising his offices.
- **Incarnation:** The ground of historical presence; without the incarnation the offices could not be historically realized.
- **Revelation (historical and propositional):** Revelation is both narrated history (gospel events) and the propositional proclamation of who Christ is.
- **Sacramental Efficacy:** Sacraments as instruments wherein Christ's priestly and prophetic presence is mediated to the church.
- **Covenant Continuity:** Emphasis on the unity of redemptive history; covenant frames Christ's continuous presence.
- **Homiletical Presence:** Preaching as the ordinary locus where Christ, by his prophetic office, is present and speaks.
- **Priestly Expiation and Intercession:** Priesthood conceived as historical action (atonement) and ongoing intercession for the covenant people.
- **Royal Rule (kingly office):** Manifest in lordship, governance of the church, and eschatological consummation.
- **Historical Criticism (as interlocutor):** Martin often engages negatively with critical approaches that sever theological continuity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Munus Triplex applied to gospel historiography and pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against liberal and purely historical-critical accounts that deny mediatorial continuity.
- As an **exegetical model** for sermons and courses showing how Gospel narratives disclose Christ's offices.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, sacramentology, and ecclesiology in Reformed teaching.
