### TITLE
Tractatus super Psalmos (Treatises on the Psalms) - Hilary of Poitiers (c. mid-4th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-4th century Latin West. Composed largely in the context of Hilary's episcopate at Poitiers and his exile (c. 356-361). The work belongs to the anti-Arian theological milieu and the broader post-Nicene attempt to secure orthodox Trinitarian language in the West.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Read the Psalter christologically and Trinitarianly to demonstrate the Son's divine, eternal relation to the Father (against Arian/Adoptionist claims) and to situate the Spirit within the same eternal communion.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical treatises on individual Psalms that oscillate between literal, allegorical, and typological readings.
 - Use of key royal and messianic psalms (e.g., Ps. 2, 45, 110) to argue the Son's eternity, kingship, and priesthood.
 - Repeated move: show that Old Testament language that names God properly belongs to the Son and Spirit by virtue of eternal relations (generation and spiration), not by adoption or functional bestowal.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Scriptural text (Psalter) as primary source.
 - Implicit and explicit polemic against Arians and Eunomians; theological sympathy with Athanasius and Eastern defenders of Nicene terminology.
 - Patristic exegetical tradition (typology and allegory) employed with rigorous doctrinal ends.
- **Doctrines treated:**
 - **Trinity** (central): emphasis on eternal generation of the Son and the place of the Spirit.
 - **Christology:** Son as eternal Logos, reigning and priestly.
 - **Revelation and typology:** Old Testament persons/events as foreshadowing New Testament realities.
 - Sanctification and ecclesial application of psalms.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Hilary reads the Psalms as doctrinal proof-texts: the Son is eternally begotten of the Father and shares the divine identity, and the Spirit participates in the one Godhead by a real, eternal relation - Scripture itself bears witness to the internal life of the Trinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm insistence that Old Testament divine predicates can belong to the Son by virtue of **eternal generation** rather than mere adoption or mission.
 - Close linking of messianic kingship and priesthood (Ps. 110) to ontological Sonship.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects Arian reduction of the Son to a creature or a created honor; insists on uncreated divinity and co-inherence with the Father.
 - Moves beyond purely moral or functional readings of the Psalms to press their metaphysical implications for intra-Trinitarian relations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Latinizing Eastern Trinitarian vocabulary in exegetical practice - treating **generation** and **spiration** as real relations that explain the application of divine predicates across Persons.
 - Uses the Psalms to argue not only Christological but also pneumatological claims (though treatment of the Spirit is less systematic than in De Trinitate).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Western Latin tradition as an early, forceful anti-Arian psalmody; cited by later medieval and Reformation theologians as patristic support for eternal generation.
 - Provided a model for reading the Old Testament christologically and for fusing exegesis with Trinitarian dogmatics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies how biblical exegesis can serve doctrinal formation.
 - Offers a compact early-Western articulation of eternal generation that aids comparative studies with Augustine and Eastern Fathers.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Generation:** Hilary's principal locus - the Son is begotten from the Father without beginning; this explains why the Son can bear divine titles and actions in the Psalms.
- **Spiration (procession of the Spirit):** Treated less systematically but affirmed as an eternal relation that grounds the Holy Spirit's place within the one God.
- **Hypostasis / Persona:** Uses relational language to distinguish the Son and Spirit as real personal properties within the one divine substance.
- **Ousia / Substantia:** Underlying unity of God affirmed; Hilary insists on one divine reality shared by Persons.
- **Logos / Verbum:** Christ as the eternal Word; Psalms' divine speech and promises belong to the Logos.
- **Typology/Allegory:** Methodological principle: historical events and kingship types in the Psalter prefigure Christ and Trinitarian realities.
- **Messianic kingship (Ps. 2):** Used to show the Son's eternal sonship and royal authority derived from the Father.
- **Priesthood (Ps. 110):** Employed to prove the Son's sanctifying, eternal priestly role - a divine office consistent with eternal Sonship.
- **Divine predicates in the Old Testament:** Hilary's rule: such predicates belong to the Son and Spirit by eternal relations, not by later bestowal.
- **Anti-Arian polemic:** The Psalms become evidence against Arian claims of novelty or createdness of the Son.
- **Co-inherence (perichoresis) - implicit:** While not fully developed terminologically, Hilary affirms mutual indwelling as implication of shared divine life.
- **Sanctification/ Ecclesial use:** Psalms retain pastoral application but their primary theological use in Hilary is doctrinal demonstration.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for the doctrine of eternal generation in Western patristic surveys.
- As a **polemic resource** against Arianism and for arguing Son's substantive divinity from Old Testament texts.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how to read Psalms christologically and Trinitarianly for doctrinal construction.
