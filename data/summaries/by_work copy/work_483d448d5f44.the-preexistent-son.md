### TITLE
The Preexistent Son: Recovering the Christologies of Matthew, Mark and Luke - Simon J. Gathercole

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary New Testament scholarship (early 21st century). Situated within debates about the origins and development of Christian Christology and the historical Jesus.
 - Reaction to models that place high Christology late or primarily in John; engages Second Temple Jewish backgrounds, LXX usage, and synoptic narrative-critical methods.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke) presuppose and preserve traditions that portray the Son as **preexistent** - not merely exalted post-resurrection, but possessing a prior, heavenly identity - and this preexistence is recoverable by careful exegetical and contextual study.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes criteria for identifying preexistence-language and motifs in Greek and Jewish contexts (e.g., heavenly origin, coming on clouds, divine agency).
 - Survey of the Synoptic material:
 - Infancy narratives (Matthew, Luke) as indicators of origin from God/heaven.
 - Son of Man sayings and eschatological coming as evidence of a heavenly figure who exists prior to earthly life.
 - Titles and functions (forgiving sins, accepting worship, commanding nature) that signal divine prerogatives and therefore preexistence.
 - Interprets narrative features (angelic voice, transfiguration, trial confessions) as consistent with an early high Christology rather than later theological augmentation.
 - Weighs alternative hypotheses (low pre-Easter Christology, adoptionism, purely functional exaltation) and argues they fail to account for the breadth of synoptic data.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary texts: the Synoptic Gospels, Septuagint, selected Second Temple literature, early Christian creedal/parenic material.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: engages contemporary Christology scholars and those advancing low or functionalist models of early Christology (e.g., positions represented in historical-Jesus debates); interacts with arguments from Hurtado, Bauckham, Dunn and others on timing and shape of Christological development.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Central: Christology (preexistence, incarnation, divine agency).
 - Secondary: revelation, soteriology (implications of preexistence for forgiveness and atonement), hints toward Trinitarian reflection.
- **Closing line**
 - Gathercole locates a substantive, theologically significant preexistence of the Son within the Synoptic tradition, challenging narratives that marginalize early high Christology and pressing the church and academy to read the Gospels as bearing early ontological claims about Jesus.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Persistent argument that preexistence is not primarily a Johannine innovation but is already embedded in Synoptic tradition; his analysis is textually attentive and linguistically grounded.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters "late high Christology" and adoptionist readings by showing how a range of synoptic episodes coherently point to preexistence, not merely post-resurrection exaltation or functional agency.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and refines criteria for identifying preexistence in narrative texts (e.g., distinguishing heavenly origin motifs from mere exaltation language).
 - Emphasizes the interaction of titles, deeds, narrative placement and Old Testament intertext to discern ontological claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in discussions defending early high Christology; used by scholars and pastors as a corrective to readings that minimize the Synoptic Christological claims.
 - Influential in prompting renewed exegetical attention to Son of Man and infancy material as theological, not merely literary, loci.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a careful, methodical case for preexistence in canonical Gospels that is useful for advanced classroom work, sermon formation, and further scholarly debate about the shape of earliest Christian belief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Preexistence** - the Son's existence prior to his earthly life; Gathercole argues this is discernible in Synoptic material.
- **Son of Man** - read as an apocalyptic/heavenly figure; key locus for claims about heavenly origin and coming on clouds.
- **Heavenly origin / coming from heaven** - narrative motif (voice from heaven, angelic announcements) used as evidence of preexistence.
- **Divine agency** - actions (forgiving sins, accepting worship) indicating ontological status beyond mere human prophetic function.
- **Infancy narratives** - Matthew and Luke passages treated as doctrinal claims regarding origin and identity, not only theological reflection.
- **Titles: Lord / Son of God** - linguistic markers whose synoptic usage contributes to the case for preexistence.
- **Septuagint and Second Temple context** - background literature used to show how Jewish categories could support preexistence motifs.
- **Functional vs. ontological Christology** - distinction underscored; Gathercole argues the Synoptics point to ontological preexistence rather than only functional exaltation.
- **Narrative christology** - method: reading the Gospels as theological narratives that encode christological claims.
- **Eschatological enthronement** - the Son's future coming and judgment language tied to prior heavenly status.
- **Markan priority / tradition criticism** - methodological commitments informing his reading of how preexistence traditions are transmitted.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional and exegetical source for arguing that preexistence is present in the Synoptics.
 - As a polemic resource against low or purely functional models of early Christology.
 - As an exegetical model for integrating Jewish background, LXX usage, and narrative features to detect theological claims.
