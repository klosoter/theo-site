### TITLE
Luke: Historian and Theologian - I. Howard Marshall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the late 20th century within evangelical academic publishing; responds to mid-20th-century critical scholarship that split Luke's theology from his historiography.
 - Situated amid debates over historical reliability, redaction criticism, and the rise of narrative and canonical approaches to Luke-Acts.

- **Central thesis**
 - Luke is both a careful historian and a coherent theologian: his narrative is historically responsible but shaped by an explicitly theological program centered on the Spirit as the agent of redemptive history.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological preface: criteria for assessing Luke's historicity and theological claims; fair but sympathetic use of critical tools.
 - Literary-historical analysis: examination of Luke's sources, composition, and historiographical conventions.
 - Theological synthesis: tracing major themes (Christology, salvation history, mission) with special attention to pneumatology.
 - Major move 1: Establish Luke's intent to present an orderly, trustworthy account (preface, use of sources).
 - Major move 2: Show how theological motifs (fulfillment, salvation, universality) are woven into historical narrative.
 - Major move 3: Argue the Spirit functions as the driving agent in the transition from Israel to the church-an inaugurated eschatology.
 - Case studies: key passages that exemplify Luke's historical-theological method (birth narratives, Sermon on the Plain, Acts 2, Pentecost, Spirit-empowered mission).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engagement with form-critics, redaction critics, and historians skeptical of Luke's reliability (e.g., Bultmannian tendencies).
 - Dialogue with evangelical exegetes and historians who defend Luke's historical basis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and salvation history (recapitulation of Israel's story in Christ).
 - Pneumatology: the Spirit as active, present, and eschatological.
 - Christology: Jesus as fulfillment of Scripture and inaugurator of the new age.
 - Ecclesiology and mission: church as Spirit-formed witness to Gentile inclusion.
 - Eschatology: already/not-yet tension and incremental restoration.

- **Closing line**
 - Luke presents a historically anchored theology in which the Spirit is the principal agent moving redemptive history from Israel to a Spirit-empowered, universal witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, balanced defense of Luke's dual vocation: credible historiography allied to deliberate theological shaping.
 - Pneumatology is central-Marshall highlights the Spirit not merely as theological concept but as active agent in history and mission.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects reductionist readings that either demythologize Luke (removing theological force) or sacralize him (ignoring historical method).
 - Contrasts with scholars who treat Luke's theology as secondary to his historical reporting; demonstrates mutual dependence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines the language of "Spirit in redemptive history" by emphasizing both continuity with Israelic promise and the Spirit's inaugurative, present activity in the church.
 - Articulates a clear model of inaugurated eschatology in Lukan terms: present empowerment with future consummation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed seminaries as a model for integrating exegesis, history, and theology.
 - Influenced subsequent Lukan studies on pneumatology and mission; cited as a corrective to overly critical historiography.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological exemplar for combining historical-critical rigor with theological sensitivity.
 - Particularly valuable for courses on Luke-Acts, pneumatology, and mission theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Luke-Acts**
 - Unity of composition and purpose; single narrative arc from Gospel to the spread of the church.

- **Historiography**
 - Luke's use of Greco-Roman historical conventions combined with Hebrew historiographic impulses; criteria for assessing reliability.

- **Redemptive history (salvation history)**
 - God's saving activity across history, with Luke narrating the climax in Christ and the ongoing work of the Spirit.

- **Pneumatology / The Spirit**
 - Central actor: initiates Jesus' ministry, empowers witnesses, forms the church, signals eschatological inbreaking.

- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The kingdom is both present (through Spirit-empowered activity) and awaiting future completion.

- **Fulfillment**
 - Jesus' life/events as fulfillment of Scripture; Luke frames Jesus as culmination of Israel's story.

- **Continuity and discontinuity**
 - Relation between Israel and the church: continuity of promise, discontinuity in mission and scope (Gentile mission).

- **Witness / Testimony**
 - Key theological-historical function: the church as Spirit-empowered witness to the ends of the earth.

- **Sources and tradition criticism**
 - Marshall's treatment of source material (e.g., Lukan use of Mark, Q, L) within a theological narrative.

- **Narrative theology**
 - Use of plot, character, and theology in historical narration to convey doctrinal truths.

- **Mission theology**
 - The Spirit as commissioning force for the church's mission; basis for universal outreach.

- **Eschatological tension**
 - The dialectic of present power vs. future consummation in Lukan thought.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for integrating Lukan historiography with theology-clarifies what "historian-theologian" means.
 - As a **polemic** against extreme critical reductions of Luke and against readings that divorce history from theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Lukan passages with attention to both historical context and theological intent.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pneumatology and mission studies to argue for the Spirit's central role in redemptive history.
