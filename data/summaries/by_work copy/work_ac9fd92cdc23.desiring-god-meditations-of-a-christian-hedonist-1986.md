### TITLE
Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986) - John Piper

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed revival of robust affections; reaction to moralistic and therapeutic strains in American Christianity.
 - Written amid renewed interest in Jonathan Edwards and resurgence of conservative Reformed pastoral theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.** The proper Christian life is not duty divorced from delight; true obedience issues from renewed affections.
 - Problem addressed: pietistic moralism that separates duty from joy, and secular hedonism that mislocates human flourishing.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirmation that desire/joy is normative for Christian life; pleasures reordered toward God constitute the Christian telos.
 - Theological rationale:
 - God designed creatures for joy; Scripture reveals God as the supreme satisfier.
 - Regeneration and effectual calling alter affections so that God becomes the supreme delight.
 - Worship, prayer, sanctification, evangelism, and suffering are intelligible as means by which God shapes and intensifies joy in Him.
 - Pastoral application: sermons, meditations, and practices to cultivate delight in God as central to growth.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy indebtedness to **Jonathan Edwards** (Religious Affections, The End for Which God Created the World).
 - Engages Reformed tradition broadly (Calvinic concerns for glory, sovereignty), while critiquing contemporary pietism and moralistic therapeutic trends.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Regeneration and effectual calling** (core focus for how desires change)
 - Sanctification, justification, union with Christ
 - Providence, worship, mission, prayer, and the ultimate telos of glorification
 - Implicitly addresses revelation (Scripture as means to kindle delight), doctrine of God (supreme good), and soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: Christian life is the cultivation of God-exalting joy; true obedience is affectionate, God-centered delight wrought by regeneration and effectual calling.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Coined and popularized the phrase **"Christian Hedonism"** - not crude pleasure-seeking but the claim that seeking joy in God is the highest duty.
 - Places **desire/affection** not merely as consequences of doctrine but as primary theological categories shaping sanctification and mission.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects **moralism** (obedience without heartfelt joy) by insisting that duty must be grounded in delight.
 - Distinguishes from **secular hedonism** by making God the proper object of pleasure; contrasts with cheap grace by insisting joy flows from real union with Christ.
 - In conversation with classic Reformed emphases on God's glory, Piper reframes glory and goodness as mutually intelligible through the language of delight.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitation of "hedonism" with a theological qualifier; integration of pastoral aesthetics with rigorous soteriology.
 - Affections as a theological locus: regeneration is described primarily as reorientation of appetite toward God.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential across modern evangelical and Reformed circles; shaped preaching, discipleship, and missionary motivation.
 - Adopted in youth ministries, seminary courses on pastoral theology, and popular devotional literature.
 - Criticized by some scholars for potential subjective overemphasis and under-theologizing of objective justification language.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to lifeless moralism; supplies a usable pastoral theology of desire that links soteriology and sanctification.
 - Valuable for integrating biblical exegesis, pastoral application, and pastoral formation around the centrality of joy in God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christian Hedonism** - The governing motto: "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him." Reclaims pleasure language for theology.
- **Delight / Joy** - Primary ethic and motive for obedience; not optional fruit but constitutive of Christian maturity.
- **Glory of God** - Interpreted through the lens of God-exalting joy; God's glory and human joy are unified, not opposed.
- **Regeneration** - Described as the God-wrought reordering of desires; central to how believers come to find joy in God.
 - Relation to effectual calling: calling is the divine action that brings about regeneration and concomitant new pleasures in God.
- **Effectual Calling** - God's sovereign, efficacious summons that produces new affections and results in conversion; not merely external proclamation.
- **Desire / Affections** - The crucial theological category: motives, loves, and appetites that determine behavior and worship.
- **Sanctification** - Progression of increased delight in God; disciplines are means to deepen appetite for God.
- **Union with Christ** - Basis for Christian enjoyment of God; union supplies objective grounds for subjective delight.
- **Sovereignty of God** - Underwrites effectual calling and the providential ordering of desires.
- **Scripture** - Means by which God reshapes desires; exegesis of Psalms, John, Romans used to ground claims about joy.
- **Worship** - Primary locus where joy in God is both expressed and formed.
- **Pleasure** - Reinterpreted: legitimate and normative when ordered to God; distinguished from self-centered pleasure.
- **Evangelism / Mission** - Motivated by love for God and desire to see others enjoy Him; not merely duty but joy-sharing.
- **Faith** - Trust that receives God's goodness and sustains delight.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the theological category "Christian Hedonism" in homiletics and devotional theology.
 - As a **polemic** against moralistic and therapeutic tendencies in pastoral practice.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for connecting soteriology (regeneration/effectual calling) to discipleship and worship.
