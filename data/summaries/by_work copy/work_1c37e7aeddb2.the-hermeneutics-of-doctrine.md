### TITLE
**The Hermeneutics of Doctrine** - Anthony C. Thiselton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century conversation: intersection of the hermeneutical turn in philosophy (Gadamer, Ricoeur), linguistic philosophy, and renewal of doctrinal retrieval in theology.
 - Responds to pressures from postmodern critique, historical-critical exegesis, and cultural-linguistic models of doctrine.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Doctrine is an interpretive, linguistic, and performative practice rather than mere static propositional content; therefore hermeneutics must be internal to doctrinal formation and application.
 - The central problem: how to account for doctrinal stability and normative claim while acknowledging historical contingency, linguistic mediation, and community reception.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Argues for a dialectical model that brings philosophical hermeneutics, speech-act theory, and theological retrieval into conversation.
 - Major moves:
 - Critique of reductionist models: propositionalist (doctrine as abstract truth-claims) and sociological constructivist accounts.
 - Retrieval of tradition: doctrines are answers to concrete questions in contexts; tradition functions as a living interpretive resource.
 - Methodological proposal: doctrines function as performative-linguistic acts within the Christian community mediating text, worship, ethics, and identity.
 - Normativity arises from a dialogical fusion of horizons: Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience interact under the guidance of the Spirit.
 - Applies the method to concrete doctrinal loci to show hermeneutical consequences (e.g., eschatology, Christology, pneumatology).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Philosophical hermeneutics: Gadamer, Ricoeur.
 - Linguistic and speech-act theorists: Austin, Searle, Wittgenstein.
 - Theological interlocutors: Brevard Childs, Karl Barth, influential modern exegetes and systematicians.
 - Engages both continental and analytic resources to bridge biblical exegesis and systematic theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity, Christology, Pneumatology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, Eschatology.
 - Notable applications: **Resurrection and New Creation** (read as transformative narrative and eschatological ontology), **Spirit and Union with Christ** (pneumatological mediation of participatory union).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Doctrine is best understood as a hermeneutical-practical language enacted by a community shaped by Scripture and Spirit, balancing historical rootedness with ongoing interpretive appropriation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Treats doctrine as a performative-linguistic act: doctrines do things (constitute identity, summon obedience, interpret experience).
 - Strong insistence on dialogical retrieval: tradition must be read and reinvented through conversation, not mere repetition.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects rigid propositionalist readings that isolate doctrines from communal practice and narrative.
 - Challenges purely sociological or relativizing readings by restoring normative and cognitive force to doctrine without reverting to foundationalist certainties.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrates speech-act theory into doctrinal methodology to show how doctrinal sentences perform within worship, ethics, and identity.
 - Emphasizes "fusion of horizons" as normative hermeneutical movement for doctrinal revision and continuity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among evangelical and Reformed scholars seeking a robust hermeneutical account of doctrine.
 - Adopted as a corrective in systematic theology syllabi and cited in discussions of theological method, biblical theology, and ecclesial formation.
 - Stimulated interdisciplinary dialogue between biblical scholars and systematicians.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a practicable framework for reading Scripture doctrinally without flattening historical-critical insight.
 - Useful in pastoral and confessional settings for teaching how doctrine mediates life and worship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics of doctrine**
 - The claim that doctrinal formulation and interpretation are intrinsically hermeneutical acts.

- **Doctrinal retrieval**
 - Reengaging historical doctrinal resources through contemporary interpretive engagement.

- **Speech-act theory**
 - Use of Austin/Searle to show doctrines as performative utterances within the church.

- **Dialogical hermeneutics / fusion of horizons**
 - Gadamerian movement between past text/tradition and present understanding that preserves normativity.

- **Interpretive community**
 - The church as the community that grounds doctrinal meaning and reception.

- **Canonical-linguistic reading**
 - Treating Scripture and doctrine as mutually interpreting linguistic wholes rather than isolated propositions.

- **Existential appropriation / performativity**
 - Doctrine transforms the believer's identity and practices, not merely cognitive assent.

- **Eschatological-ontological shift**
 - Reading resurrection and new creation as shaping present ontology (already/not-yet), not only future hope.

- **Pneumatological mediation**
 - The Spirit grounds and enlivens doctrinal reception, especially union with Christ and participatory language.

- **Union with Christ (hermeneutical pivot)**
 - Used by Thiselton as an interpretive center for soteriology and ecclesiology, emphasizing participatory, relational language.

- **Resurrection and New Creation (hermeneutical matrix)**
 - Serves as an example of how narrative-eschatological readings reframe doctrinal categories (ontology, ethics, worship).

- **Performative-normativity**
 - How doctrinal speech-acts produce normative claims in communal life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for integrating hermeneutics and systematic theology.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading doctrinal loci (notably Resurrection and New Creation; Spirit and Union with Christ) in narrative- and pneumatologically sensitive ways.
- As a **polemic** against both reductionist propositionalism and relativistic constructivism, offering a conceptual pivot for constructive doctrinal theology.
