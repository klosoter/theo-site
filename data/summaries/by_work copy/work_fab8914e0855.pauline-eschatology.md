### TITLE
**Pauline Eschatology** - Geerhardus Vos (1930)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late Princeton theologian; pioneer of Reformed biblical theology. Written against liberal moralism and the Religionsgeschichtliche school, in conversation with Jewish apocalyptic studies and early 20th-c. New Testament scholarship. Anticipates later debates on realized and inaugurated eschatology (before Dodd, Cullmann).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Pauls theology is structured by eschatology. In Christ and the Spirit the age to come has already invaded this age, so every soteriological benefit is an eschatological blessing applied proleptically, with a consummate not yet still to come.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Two-age schema:** This age vs. the age to come frames Pauls worldview; the overlap explains Christian existence.
 - **Christ the second Adam:** The resurrection installs the new humanity and cosmic order; union with Christ mediates eschatological life.
 - **The Spirit as eschatological gift:** The arrabon (down payment) and firstfruits secure believers future; sanctification is new-creation power.
 - **Soteriology re-cast:** Justification, adoption, sanctification, and perseverance each have an already and not yet; the last judgment is anticipated in present forensic verdict.
 - **Bodily resurrection and parousia:** The climactic, bodily renewal confirms the goodness of creation and the corporate scope of redemption.
 - **Interim conditions:** Intermediate state, suffering, and ethics belong to an intrusion of the future into the present, shaping endurance and holiness.
 - **Opposition and crisis:** The Man of Sin and apostasy function within Gods eschatological plan, not as myth but as historical consummative conflict.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Pauls letters closely (esp. Romans, 1-2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1-2 Thessalonians). Interacts with Weiss and Schweitzer on apocalyptic, with Ritschlian moralism, and with history-of-religions claims of Hellenistic derivation; aligns critically with Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration (implicitly via exegesis), Christology (last Adam, resurrection), Pneumatology (Spirit as eschatological gift), Soteriology (union, justification, sanctification, adoption, perseverance), Anthropology/Creation (image, body, cosmic renewal), Doctrine of Sin (Adamic solidarity), Ecclesiology and Sacraments (as eschatological signs), Last Things (parousia, judgment, resurrection).
- **Closing line:** The works center of gravity is the inaugurated reign of the risen Christ, by the Spirit, forming a semi-eschatological church that lives from the future toward the consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Eschatology precedes and structures soteriology; ordo salutis must be governed by historia salutis.
 - Present justification as an anticipatory last-day verdict; adoption and sanctification as first installments of glorification.
 - Corporate, Adam-Christ solidarity explaining both sin and redemption.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against liberal moralism: the kingdom is not mere ethics but redemptive intrusion.
 - Against thoroughgoing apocalyptic (Weiss/Schweitzer): inaugurated, not merely future, eschatology; historical incarnation and resurrection, not timeless mysticism.
 - Against Hellenistic-derivation theses: Pauls categories are covenantal-apocalyptic rooted in Scripture, not Greek metaphysics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Classic articulation of the **two ages** and the **already/not yet**; Spirit as **arrabon/firstfruits**; eschatological reading of justification and adoption.
 - Robust use of union with Christ to integrate personal salvation and redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for Westminster tradition (Murray, Stonehouse, Machen); seminal for Ridderbos, Kline, and especially Gaffin (Resurrection and Redemption).
 - Anticipates and informs broader evangelical consensus on inaugurated eschatology (Beale, Schreiner), while furnishing a Reformed corrective to later NT Wright-style apocalyptic emphases.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides an exegetically grounded, redemptive-historical framework uniting Christology, Pneumatology, and Soteriology under an eschatological canopy.
 - Clarifies ethics and ecclesiology as participation in the coming age.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Two Ages (this age / the age to come):** Master structure of Pauls thought; explains overlap of present and future realities.
- **Already / Not Yet:** Inaugurated fulfillment vs. future consummation across all loci of doctrine.
- **Union with Christ:** Covenantal-solidarity by which eschatological life is shared now; grounds every benefit of salvation.
- **Last Adam / Second Man:** Christ as head of new humanity; resurrection life versus Adamic death.
- **Resurrection (Christ and believers):** Hinge of history; Christs resurrection as firstfruits guarantees ours.
- **Spirit as Arrabon and Firstfruits:** Down payment and initial harvest of the eschaton; assures perseverance and future glory.
- **Justification as Eschatological Verdict:** Present, forensic declaration anticipating the last judgment.
- **Adoption and the Redemption of the Body:** Sonship now, bodily glorification later; ties family status to creation renewal.
- **Sanctification as New-Creation Power:** Ethical transformation sourced in the age to come.
- **Intrusion/Overlap of the Ages:** Future order penetrates present history, shaping worship, ethics, and suffering.
- **Parousia:** Visible return of Christ, climactic resurrection and judgment.
- **Intermediate State:** Conscious fellowship with Christ prior to resurrection, without denying bodily telos.
- **Man of Sin (2 Thess 2):** Personal eschatological opponent within Gods sovereign plan.
- **New Creation / Cosmic Scope:** Redemption extends to creation; glory is corporate and creational.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Definition source:** Standard for inaugurated eschatology and two-age exegesis.
 - **Exegetical model:** Redemptive-historical reading that integrates Pauls letters.
 - **Conceptual pivot in soteriology:** Reframes justification, adoption, sanctification as eschatological.
 - **Polemic utility:** Counters moralism, over-futurizing apocalyptic, and Hellenistic-derivation theories.
