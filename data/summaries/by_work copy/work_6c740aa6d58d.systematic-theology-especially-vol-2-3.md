### TITLE
Charles Hodge, Systematic Theology (Vols. 2-3): Christology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, Sacraments, and Eschatology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Princeton Theological Seminary, Old School Presbyterianism; published 1871-1873. Responds to Roman Catholic polemics, Lutheran sacramentalism, Arminian/Wesleyan soteriology, New England Theology (Taylorism), revivalist perfectionism (Finney), and rising German idealism/mediating theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Scripture, read with catholic-Reformed consensus and sound reason, yields a coherent, federal and forensic account of salvation in Christ, applied by the Spirit, embodied in the Church and her means of grace, and consummated in the last things.
- **Core argument / structure (focus on Vols. 2-3):**
 - Vol. 2: **Anthropology and Christology** (creation, image of God, fall, original sin), **Covenant headship**, **Person of Christ** (two natures, one person), **Atonement** (penal substitution), **Application of redemption** (calling, regeneration, faith, repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance).
 - Vol. 3: **Ecclesiology** (nature, attributes, marks; visible/invisible distinction; Presbyterian polity, officers, discipline), **Means of grace** (Word, sacraments, prayer), **Sacraments** (baptism and the Lord s Supper as signs and seals; efficacy by the Spirit, not ex opere operato), **Eschatology** (intermediate state, resurrection, judgment, heaven and hell; measured critique of chiliastic schemes).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine, Anselm, Calvin, Turretin, Westminster Standards; engages Bellarmine and Trent, Lutheran confessions, Arminius/Wesley, Grotius (governmental atonement), Socinians, Schleiermacher and mediating theologians, New School/Edwardsians and Finney.
- **Doctrines treated (highlighted emphases):**
 - **Covenant theology:** covenant of works and grace; Adam and Christ as federal heads.
 - **Christology:** full deity/humanity, communicatio idiomatum (qualified), vicarious obedience and suffering.
 - **Soteriology:** immediate imputation of guilt; monergistic regeneration; forensic justification by imputed righteousness; progressive sanctification via means; perseverance.
 - **Pneumatology:** Spirit s agency in regeneration, faith, sanctification, and sacramental efficacy.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** nature and government of the church; infant baptism grounded in covenant; spiritual presence in the Supper.
 - **Eschatology:** personal return of Christ, resurrection, eternal states; denies purgatory and annihilationism; cautious on millennialism.
- **Closing line:** The center of gravity is **union with the federal Christ, judicially reckoned righteous and progressively renewed by the Spirit within the covenant community through the ordained means of grace**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Immediate imputation** of Adam s sin and of Christ s righteousness as covenantal and forensic.
 - **Penal substitution** as the only coherent satisfaction of divine justice.
 - **Sacraments as signs and seals** whose efficacy is spiritual, conditional upon faith, and never mechanical.
 - **Presbyterian polity** as biblically normative, with parity of presbyters and graded courts.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Rome:** rejects transubstantiation, sacramentalism ex opere operato, and purgatory.
 - Against **Lutherans:** denies corporal presence; affirms spiritual real presence.
 - Against **Arminianism/Wesleyanism:** denies prevenient grace that equalizes will; affirms perseverance.
 - Against **New School/Governmental atonement:** insists on substitution, not merely moral government.
 - Against **perfectionism:** sanctification is progressive, never sinless in this life.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves:**
 - Tight use of **federal headship**, **mediate vs immediate imputation**, **forensic vs renovative** categories.
 - **Visible/invisible church** distinction operationalized for discipline and catholicity.
 - **Means of grace** as ordinary channels of the Spirit s work.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became the Old Princeton benchmark for confessional Reformed dogmatics; shaped Presbyterian education and ordination standards.
 - Critiqued later for common-sense realist epistemology and a relatively **ordo-centered** soteriology (less integrative use of union with Christ than later Reformed).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clear, polemically aware exegesis; confessional fidelity; stable reference on church, sacraments, justification, and atonement.
 - Useful compendium of historical theology and comparative dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works / Grace:** Two-Adam structure grounding guilt and redemption; undergirds imputation and infant baptism.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; explains original sin and justification.
- **Immediate Imputation:** Adam s guilt and Christ s righteousness reckoned without mediating moral transformation; forensic priority.
- **Original Sin:** Real corruption and guilt; denies Pelagian and semi-Pelagian mitigations.
- **Penal Substitution:** Christ bears the penalty of the law for the elect; rejects moral influence or governmental reductions.
- **Effectual Calling / Regeneration:** Monergistic new birth producing faith; distinguishes external call from inward efficacy.
- **Justification by Imputed Righteousness:** Non-infused, judicial acceptance on Christ s obedience and satisfaction.
- **Sanctification (Progressive):** Spirit-enabled growth through means; cooperation after regeneration; opposes perfectionism.
- **Union with Christ (Forensic and Vital):** Legal union foundational for justification; vital union for sanctification.
- **Means of Grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer as ordinary Spirit-uses; churchly context emphasized.
- **Visible/Invisible Church:** Institutional body vs the company of the regenerate; basis for catholic charity and disciplined polity.
- **Presbyterian Polity:** Eldership, parity of ministers, graded courts; Scripture-regulative defense.
- **Baptism (Covenantal, Infant-inclusive):** Sign and seal of covenant membership; no baptismal regeneration.
- **Lord s Supper (Spiritual Presence):** Real communion with Christ by the Spirit through faith; rejects trans- and consubstantiation.
- **Eschatology (Return, Resurrection, Judgment):** No purgatory; eternal destinies fixed; cautious about millennial schemes.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for imputation, justification, sacraments, and church polity.
 - As a **polemical baseline** against Roman Catholic, Arminian, Lutheran, and perfectionist positions.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating confessional standards with Scripture.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for covenantal and forensic categories linking anthropology, soteriology, and ecclesiology.
