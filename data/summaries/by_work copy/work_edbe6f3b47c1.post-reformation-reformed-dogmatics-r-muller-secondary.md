### TITLE
**Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (Richard A. Muller, secondary): Mapping Reformed Orthodoxy with Turretin and peers**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 16th to early 18th centuries, amid confessionalization, universities, and polemics with Roman Catholics, Socinians, Remonstrants, and Lutherans. Reformed scholasticism employs the academic tools of the era (Aristotelian logic, disputation) in service of exegesis and catechesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reformed orthodoxy is a learned, variegated, exegetically driven tradition, not a rationalistic decline from the Reformation, and not organized around a single central dogma. Its architecture is governed by principia, confessions, and Scripture, with careful continuity to patristic and medieval catholic theology.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Reconstructs the **method** and **sources** of Reformed scholastic theology: Scripture as principium cognoscendi, God as principium essendi, Spirit as internal principle; archetypal vs ectypal theology; analogical predication.
 - Surveys loci: **revelation and Scripture** (canon, inspiration, clarity, sufficiency; literal sense and rules of interpretation), **theology proper** (simplicity, aseity, immutability, will), **Trinity** (eternal generation, consubstantiality, autotheos of the Son, extra Calvinisticum), **creation and providence** (primary/secondary causality, concursus), **anthropology** (imago Dei, covenant headship), **sin**, **Christology** (two natures, communicatio idiomatum, munus triplex), **covenant theology** (works, grace, pactum salutis), **soteriology** (union with Christ, duplex gratia, ordo salutis), **ecclesiology and sacraments** (marks, ministry, Word and sacraments as means of grace).
 - Demonstrates intra-Reformed diversity on non-essentials while showing confessional unity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Calvin, Beza, Ursinus, Polanus, Perkins, Ames, Voetius, Turretin, Mastricht, Wollebius, Owen, Cocceius, Gomarus; patristic and medieval sources (Augustine, Lombard, Aquinas); Roman Catholic scholastics (Bellarmine, Suarez); Lutheran orthodox (Chemnitz, Gerhard); opponents (Socinians, Remonstrants).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and prolegomena; Scripture; God and attributes; Trinity; decrees; creation and providence; anthropology and sin; Christology; covenant and salvation; church and sacraments; eschatology.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is the principled, confessional, and exegetical ordering of doctrine under the triune God and Holy Scripture, rather than any single dogmatic thesis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Refutes the Calvin vs. the Calvinists narrative; denies a single central dogma (e.g., predestination) organizing the whole.
 - Highlights archetypal/ectypal distinction and principia as the architecture of the system.
 - Presents scholastic method as a disciplined, pastoral pedagogy harnessed to Scripture, not speculative rationalism.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Counters 19th-20th century declension narratives (Ritschlian, neo-orthodox, and some evangelical) that caricature Reformed orthodoxy as arid or anti-biblical.
 - Nuances continuity with medieval thought while rejecting uncritical Thomism; clarifies real diversity within confessional bounds.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Consolidates vocabulary: principium essendi/cognoscendi, voluntas Dei duplex, analogical predication, concursus, pactum salutis, autotheos, extra Calvinisticum, duplex gratia.
 - Methodological distinctions: ordo docendi vs ordo salutis; exegetical literal sense with theological uses.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became the standard Anglophone map of Reformed scholasticism; catalyzed retrieval of Turretin, Mastricht, Voetius, and others in academic and seminary contexts.
 - Informs contemporary work in theology proper, Trinity, Christology, and covenant theology; widely cited as a control on historical claims.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a conceptual grammar to read early modern Reformed sources accurately.
 - Serves as a corrective to atomistic proof-texting and to anachronistic systematic reconstructions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reformed orthodoxy:** Confessional, scholastic, exegetical tradition ca. 1560-1725; diverse yet bounded by symbols.
- **Scholastic method (disputatio/quaestio):** Structured questions, distinctions, objections, and replies for clarity and pedagogy.
- **Principium essendi / cognoscendi:**
 - Essendi: God as the ontological ground of theology.
 - Cognoscendi: Scripture (externum) and Spirit (internum) as the epistemic source.
- **Archetypal / ectypal theology:** God's self-knowledge vs creaturely participation; guards Creator-creature distinction and analogical language.
- **Analogical predication:** Divine names apply truly yet analogically; avoids univocity and equivocity.
- **Voluntas Dei duplex:** Decretive vs preceptive will; frames providence, law, and ethics.
- **Aseity and autotheos:** God's self-existence; the Son as God of Himself with eternal generation preserved.
- **Extra Calvinisticum:** The Logos is not exhaustively contained by the human nature; safeguards immensity and two-natures Christology.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Predication of properties to the person according to either nature; rejects mixture or confusion.
- **Pactum salutis:** Intra-trinitarian covenant ordering the economy of redemption; correlates with covenant of grace.
- **Foedus operum / gratiae:** Covenant of works with Adam; covenant of grace in Christ; frames law-gospel relations.
- **Concursus:** Primary and secondary causality; God's concurrence with creaturely acts without collapsing modalities.
- **Duplex gratia and union with Christ:** Justification and sanctification as twin benefits in union.
- **Perspicuity and sufficiency of Scripture:** Clarity in essentials; Scripture as the perfect rule of faith and practice.
- **Marks of the church and sacraments as means of grace:** Word, sacraments, and discipline; sacraments as signs and seals.
- **How this work is used:**
 - **Definition source:** Establishes standard early modern Reformed terminology and distinctions across loci.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Frames debates in theology proper, Trinity, Christology, and covenant with historical precision.
 - **Polemic control:** Tests modern claims about Reformed positions against primary-source patterns.
 - **Exegetical model:** Shows how scholastic method serves close reading of Scripture within confessional boundaries.
