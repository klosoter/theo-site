### TITLE
Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle - Henri Blocher 
Late twentieth-century evangelical-Reformed treatment; biblical-theological, historical, and systematic conversation with patristic, medieval, Reformation, and contemporary critiques.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Written from a French evangelical Reformed vantage; addresses late 20th-century challenges: secular evolutionary accounts, existentialist readings of sin, and internal Protestant disputes over federal vs seminal headship.
 - Method: close exegetical attention (Genesis, Romans) combined with historical-theological overview and systematic integration (creation, covenant, Christology).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The "riddle" of original sin is not merely doctrinal hair-splitting but a crucial interpretive knot tying human guilt, corruption, and death to divine revelation and redemption. Blocher seeks to clarify how original sin can be anchored in Scripture while answering modern objections.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Exegesis - reads Genesis 1-3 and Pauline texts (esp. Romans 5) to establish the narrative facts and theological inferences about Adam, the Fall, and effects.
 - Part 2: History of doctrine - surveys patristic, medieval, Reformation formulations; diagnoses confusions (e.g., conflating guilt and corruption).
 - Part 3: Systematic synthesis - proposes a balanced model that:
 - affirms real consequence (death, pollution, culpability) without exhaustive metaphysical speculation about mechanism;
 - differentiates kinds of transmission (legal imputation vs. ontological propagation) while holding both to be scripturally warranted;
 - grounds theology of sin in covenantal and Christological economy (Adam/Christ typology).
 - Part 4: Apologetic and pastoral application - addresses modern objections (naturalistic, existential, therapeutic) and insists on the scandal of grace as theological remedy.

- **Figures/sources/interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Augustinian formulations, medieval scholastics, Reformation (Calvin), modern Protestant voices (analytic and historical), and contemporary critics skeptical of a historical Adam or of imputation theories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology, sin (nature and origin), soteriology (Adam/Christ typology), revelation (general vs special), covenant, judgment and death.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Blocher holds that original sin must be defended as a real, revelatory datum-explaining human guilt, pollution, and death-so that Christ as the new Adam remains the definitive answer: sin's riddle is solved only in the economy of revelation and redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the question as a "riddle" to be illumined by Scripture rather than reduced to philosophical or scientific categories.
 - Persistent analytic clarity: distinguishes **guilt**, **pollution/corruption**, and **death** as distinct but related effects of the Fall.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both extreme Augustinian genetic determinism and modern existentialist or purely symbolic readings of Adam; resists purely naturalistic explanations that evacuate theological culpability.
 - Offers a middle path between strict federalism (solely legal imputation) and simple seminal transmission (solely biological heredity), arguing Scripture supports a composite account.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasizes the epistemic role of revelation (general and special) for recognizing sin's origin; treats theological categories as shaped by redemptive-historical exegesis rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded in evangelical and Reformed circles for its clarity and balance; used frequently as a corrective to both mechanistic and purely mythic approaches to the Fall.
 - Has influenced subsequent evangelical treatments that seek to keep historicity and theological significance in tension.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for pastors and teachers needing a disciplined, readable synthesis connecting Genesis, Paul, covenant theology, and contemporary critiques.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin** - Blocher's focal term: a real condition with moral, ontological, and judicial dimensions revealed in Scripture.
- **Guilt** - legal/forensic aspect; culpability before God entailed by Adam's act and by some form of imputation.
- **Pollution (corruption)** - moral and ontological depravity of human nature; explains proclivity to sin.
- **Death** - both physical mortality and spiritual alienation; seen as consequence and hallmark of the Fall.
- **Nature and origin of sin** - treats sin as rooted in a primordial act that has real consequences for human nature and history.
- **Imputation** - defends a qualified imputation: not merely juridical fiction nor reducible to genetics, but a theologically necessary account of how Adam's sin relates to humanity.
- **Federal vs seminal headship** - presents a mediated position: biblical evidence supports federal representation and real propagation; avoids collapsing one into the other.
- **General revelation** - provides knowledge of creatureliness and moral order; insufficient alone to diagnose original sin without special revelation.
- **Special revelation** - decisive for knowing the Fall, imputation, and Christ as remedy.
- **The Fall** - historical event with ongoing covenantal and ontological consequences; not merely mythic symbolism.
- **Christ as new Adam** - central soteriological pivot: Christ's obedience and righteousness reverses Adam's effects.
- **Transmission** - Boucher distinguishes mechanisms (ontological propagation, covenantal representation) without dogmatic metaphysical detailing.
- **Total depravity** - affirmed in functional terms: sin pervades human faculties though not total annihilation of image of God.
- **Death and eschatology** - connects present mortality with future consummation and reversal in Christ.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for careful distinctions (guilt vs pollution vs death).
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist naturalistic and merely existential readings of original sin.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 2-3 and Romans 5 in covenantal-Christological unity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology, revelation (general and special), and soteriology for sermon and classroom.
