### TITLE
**Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul's Soteriology** 
Author: Unknown

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed, biblical-theological milieu shaped by the Vosian redemptive-historical school.
 - Engages post-war Pauline studies, especially Heilsgeschichte vs existential readings, amid debates on ordo salutis and union with Christ.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's soteriology is structured by Christ's resurrection as the decisive eschatological act; all benefits of salvation flow from Spirit-wrought union with the crucified and risen Christ.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scripture-driven exposition: Romans 4:25, Romans 5-8, 1 Corinthians 15, Colossians 2-3, Ephesians 1-2.
 - Resurrection as soteriological hinge: Christ's vindication grounds believers' justification, sanctification, adoption, and glorification.
 - Union with Christ as the integrating reality that reframes ordo salutis within historia salutis.
 - Pneumatology: the Spirit as the presence of the risen Christ and the power of the new creation.
 - Already-not-yet eschatology governs the believer's status and transformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical-theological tradition: Calvin, Vos, Murray, Ridderbos.
 - Interacts critically with Bultmann, Kase mann, and Heilsgeschichte scholarship; converses with Lutheran-Reformed patterns on justification and sanctification.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Scripture and exegesis; Trinity implicitly via Spirit-Christ relation; Christology of cross and resurrection; Pneumatology; Anthropology and sin; Covenant and new age; Eschatology; Sacramental implications via baptismal union.
- **Closing line**
 - The heart of Pauline salvation is Spirit-wrought participation in the risen Christ, where justification and renewal arise together from the resurrection's inbreaking of the age to come.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Resurrection-centered soteriology: not only the cross for atonement, but the resurrection for justification and life.
 - Union with Christ as the controlling category for every salvific benefit.
 - Integration of ordo salutis within historia salutis, resisting abstract sequencing.
 - The Spirit as the eschatological gift, mediating the resurrected Christ to the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects cross-only reductions by locating the full scope of redemption in death-and-resurrection.
 - Pushes back on ordo salutis schematism that treats benefits as separable steps rather than coextensive in union.
 - Balances forensic and renovative aspects without collapsing or divorcing them.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Strong deployment of already-not-yet to reframe justification, sanctification, and glorification as resurrectional realities.
 - Emphasis on Christ's resurrection as forensic-vindicatory, grounding believer justification.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed theology as a standard on Pauline union with Christ and inaugurated eschatology.
 - Cited in debates on the relation of justification to union and on the Spirit's role in application of redemption.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent, exegetically anchored map linking Christology, Pneumatology, and Eschatology.
 - Pedagogically useful for integrating Romans and 1 Corinthians with systematics across loci.
