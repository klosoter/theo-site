### TITLE
Covenant Theology in Reformed Perspective - Mark W. Karlberg

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st‑century Reformed retrieval and confessional renewal. Written within ongoing debates over federal theology vs. dispensationalism and New Covenant Theology, and amid renewed interest in redemptive‑historical hermeneutics and sacramental theology in conservative Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The covenantal structure of Scripture is the primary organizing principle for biblical theology and systematic doctrine; a classical Reformed (federal) account-properly nuanced-best preserves biblical continuity, typology, sacramental promise, and Christ‑centered soteriology without collapsing important distinctions (works/grace, Israel/church).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical survey of covenantal formulations in the Reformed tradition (Calvin, Westminster, Bavinck, Vos, Murray) and critiques of rival systems (dispensationalism, New Covenant Theology).
 - Exegetical defense of the covenant of works, covenant of grace, and intra‑Trinitarian covenant of redemption as coherent readings of key texts (Genesis, covenantal narratives, prophets, Pauline argumentation, Hebrews).
 - Systematic integration: how covenant shapes doctrine of revelation, Christology (mediatorial work), soteriology (union with Christ, federal headship), sacraments (sign and seal continuity), ecclesiology (church as covenant people), law and ethics, and eschatology (consummation of covenant).
 - Practical and pastoral implications: preaching, catechesis, sacramental administration, and pastoral assurance grounded in covenantal promises.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin, Westminster divines, Geerhardus Vos, John Murray, Herman Bavinck, Meredith G. Kline, O. Palmer Robertson; critiques of dispensational authors and New Covenant proponents; appeals to biblical exegesis across Testament boundaries.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (covenantal ordering), covenant (works, grace, redemption), Trinity (as ground of covenant), Christology (mediatorial offices), soteriology (imputation, union), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), ecclesiology (covenant community/visible church), law and ethics, eschatology (covenant consummation).
- **Closing line:** A carefully argued, confessional defense that places the covenant of grace at the heart of biblical theology and systematic doctrine, showing that a robust federal framework preserves Christ‑centred unity and pastoral promise without flattening biblical distinction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses both the *legal (federal)* and *organic/typological* dimensions of covenant-avoids reducing covenant to either abstraction.
 - Emphasizes the intra‑Trinitarian foundation (covenant of redemption) as doctrinally necessary to account for Christ's mediatorial work.
 - Prioritizes typology and redemptive‑historical continuity in sacramental theology: signs and seals are covenanted promises pointing to Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters dispensational fragmentation by insistence on one covenantal economy of redemption with varied administrations.
 - Pushes back on certain Klinean or NCT moves that either overlegalize or undercut the continuity of promises between Israel and the church.
 - Clarifies misunderstandings in some modern treatments that conflate covenant form with cultural/historical dispensations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines distinctions between "administration" and "essence" of the covenant to aid biblical exegesis and pastoral practice.
 - Articulates a balanced language of federal headship that integrates forensic imputation with organic union language.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted in conservative Reformed training contexts as a clear, accessible synthesis; cited in polemical contexts against dispensational/NCT readings.
 - Valued by pastors and teachers for its practical attention to sacramental and catechetical implications.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Offers a teachable, confessional roadmap for integrating biblical theology, systematic doctrine, and pastoral application around the covenantal structure of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** The pre‑Fall pact with Adam, grounding accountability and the law‑promise schema.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The overarching covenant through which redemption is promised and accomplished in Christ; central organizing principle.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Intra‑Trinitarian agreement for Christ's mediatorial mission; doctrinally secures the unity of planning.
- **Federal Headship:** Legal representation (Adam, Christ) - explains imputation of sin and righteousness; linked to union with Christ.
- **Administration(s) of the Covenant:** Distinguishes historical forms (sacrifices, law, sacraments) from the covenant's essential promise.
- **Typology / Redemptive‑Historical Reading:** Christocentric patterning of persons/events as foreshadowing and fulfilling the covenant promises.
- **Sacraments as Sign and Seal:** Baptism and Lord's Supper as covenantal pledges; continuity in promise though varied form and administration through history.
- **Continuity vs. Discontinuity:** Balancing the unity of covenant of grace with legitimate distinctions (e.g., old/new administration; Israel/church).
- **Law and Gospel:** Law as covenantal requirement and tutor; gospel as fulfillment in Christ and the basis of covenant assurance.
- **Ecclesial Covenant Identity:** Church conceived as covenant people (visible/invisible distinctions) inheriting covenant promises.
- **Eschatological Consummation:** Covenant promises reach their full realization in Christ's return and new creation.
- **Redemptive Promises / Prophetic Fulfillment:** Messianic promises as covenantal milestones fulfilled in Christ.
- **Typological Continuity (Israel/Church):** Israel's history as covenantal parenthesis fulfilled and sustained in the church, with careful boundary maintenance.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for classical federal covenant categories in teaching and confession.
 - As a **polemic** and corrective against dispensationalism and New Covenant Theology on Israel‑church relations.
 - As an **exegetical and hermeneutical model** for reading OT types and NT fulfillment, and for shaping sacramental practice.
