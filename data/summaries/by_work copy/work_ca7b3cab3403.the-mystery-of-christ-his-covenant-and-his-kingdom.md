### TITLE
The Mystery of Christ, His Covenant, and His Kingdom - Samuel D. Renihan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed retrieval (21st-century) of Puritan and classical covenant theology.
 - Situated within evangelical Reformed academic and pastoral networks aiming to recover covenantal categories for biblical theology, preaching, and pastoral ministry.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The central claim: the Bible's presentation of Christ as the center of God's covenant life is best understood through the Pauline and Puritan notion of a "mystery" - an inaugurated, christologically-centered covenantal kingdom that is both present and eschatological.
 - The doctrinal problem addressed: how to maintain covenantal continuity between Testaments without collapsing typology or denying the novelty and finality of Christ's mediatorial work.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - exegetical foundation: close readings of key Pauline, Johannine, and covenantal texts that deploy the language of "mystery," kingdom, and covenant.
 - historical retrieval: systematic engagement with Puritan writers and classical Reformed formulations to recover a coherent Christocentric covenant hermeneutic.
 - theological synthesis: articulation of implications for soteriology (union with Christ, federal headship), ecclesiology (covenant community, sacraments), and eschatology (already/not-yet kingdom).
 - pastoral application: shows how covenantal categories shape preaching, sacramental practice, and pastoral care.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Puritan covenant theologians and classic Reformed systematicians (retrieval and critique).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: modern Reformed and evangelical theologians debating covenant continuity, New Covenant theology, and dispensational contrasts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (scriptural disclosure of the "mystery")
 - Covenant theology (covenant of redemption, covenant of grace)
 - Trinity (economic relations in covenant history)
 - Christology (mediatorial kingship, federal headship)
 - Soteriology (union with Christ, justification, sanctification)
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments (church as covenant community; signs/seals)
 - Eschatology (inaugurated kingdom and consummation)

- **Closing line**
 - Renihan locates the heart of biblical theology in the revealed "mystery" of Christ: a covenantal king who unites God's people in an inaugurated kingdom that both fulfills past types and drives toward eschatological consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats "mystery" as hermeneutical key: not merely hidden information now revealed, but a framework linking covenant, Christology, and kingdom reality.
 - Strong stress on Christ's federal headship as the linchpin of covenant continuity and distinctiveness.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrective to readings that compartmentalize covenants or turn them into calendrical epochs (dispensational separation).
 - Nuanced contrast with some modern "New Covenant" proposals that downplay continuity; Renihan affirms continuity with Christ as fulfillment, preserving genuine typological discontinuity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts traditional covenant categories through Pauline "mystery" language to emphasize inaugurated eschatology and present covenantal reality.
 - Clarifies the relations among covenant of redemption, covenant of grace, and kingdom language in pastoral theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Positive reception in conservative Reformed circles for clarity and pastoral traction; used in seminary syllabi and pastoral training.
 - Criticized by some New Covenant and dispensational proponents for presuppositions about continuity and federalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful bridge between historical Puritan theology and contemporary biblical-theological methods.
 - Durable resource for pastors and teachers seeking a coherent Christocentric covenant framework for preaching and sacramental instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mystery of Christ**
 - Pauline concept used as hermeneutical lens: hidden plan now revealed in Christ; drives theological synthesis.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Central covenantal structure whereby Christ mediates salvation; continuity across Testaments with Christ's fulfillment.
- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Eternal intra-Trinitarian pact that grounds the covenant of grace and Christ's mediatorial mission.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Christ as representative head whose obedience/atonement secures covenant blessings for the elect.
- **Christ's Mediatorial Kingdom**
 - Thekingdom mediated by Christ: present (rule by Spirit, church) and future (consummation).
- **Already / Not-Yet**
 - Eschatological framework applied to covenant life: inaugurated but awaiting fullness.
- **Typology and Fulfillment**
 - OT types (sacraments, offices, promises) find their telos in Christ; retention of real continuity without identity.
- **Sacraments as Covenant Signs**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper function as seals of covenant membership and participation in Christ's kingdom.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Key soteriological locus: believers' standing and ongoing life derive from covenantal union.
- **Covenant Community / Church**
 - The visible church as the covenant-constituted people governed by Christ's rule.
- **Law/Gospel Relation**
 - Law as covenantal standard fulfilled in Christ; gospel as covenantal promise realized in his work.
- **Eschatological Consummation**
 - Kingdom consummated when covenant promises reach final fulfillment in Christ's return.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for systematic treatments of covenant theology and Christocentric hermeneutics.
 - As a polemical resource against dispensational and overly novelty-seeking New Covenant readings.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Pauline "mystery" language into covenantal and kingdom theology.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking Puritan covenant pastoral practice to contemporary Reformed preaching and sacramental instruction.
