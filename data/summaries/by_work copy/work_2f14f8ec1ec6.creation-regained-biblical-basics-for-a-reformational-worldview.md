### TITLE
Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview - Al Wolters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the late 20th century (first edition 1985) within the neo-Calvinist / Reformational revival. Responds to secularization and to a perceived fragmentation of Christian life into "sacred" and "secular."
 - Draws on and refines Kuyperian and Dooyeweerdian horizons while aiming to root a Reformational worldview more explicitly in biblical exegesis and theological doctrine.
 - Site usage: 1 reference here; topic cited - **Vocation, Dominion, and the Cultural Mandate**.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible presents a coherent creational order and cultural mandate (Genesis 1-2) that makes vocation and cultural engagement intrinsic to human calling; redemption is primarily the restoration and renewal of that created order rather than an escape into a purely spiritual realm.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Genesis 1-2 to establish **creation as normative** for human life and calling.
 - Analysis of the Fall as distortion of creational structures, producing pervasive cultural brokenness.
 - Presentation of redemption in Christ as the means by which creation is being restored - not replaced - so Christians engage culture in redeemed vocation.
 - Practical implications for ethics, social institutions, arts, science, and politics: Christians serve creation through specific vocations under God's rule.
 - Final chapters synthesize theology and cultural practice: how a reformational worldview reframes Christian witness and public engagement.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages historically with **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Dooyeweerd** (philosophical Reformational thought), and classical Reformed sources (Calvinic emphases on providence and calling).
 - Interacts with contemporary critiques of secularization and compartmentalized Christianity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (normative order), **Fall** (disruption), **Redemption/Christology** (restoration), **Providence**, **Vocation** and **cultural theology**.
 - Secondary attention to covenantal structure and common grace as theological resources for cultural engagement.

- **Closing line**
 - Wolters' theological center of gravity: **Christian faith calls for the restoration of created vocations and cultural structures under Christ's lordship - hence the gospel is inherently cultural as well as personal.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes **vocation** the key hermeneutical lens for Christian life: every lawful human task is a God-given calling to serve created order.
 - Treats the **cultural mandate** (Gen 1:28) as constitutive for Christian social ethics and public theology, not merely an ancillary biblical theme.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against pietistic or dispensational tendencies that privatize faith or separate salvation from social/cultural responsibility.
 - Refines Kuyperian language by rooting worldview claims more tightly in biblical narrative and creational theology rather than primarily philosophical categories.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Creation regained" as a concise theological program: redemption construed as the recovery and renewal of creation's structures and purposes.
 - Recasts **dominion** language to emphasize stewardship, ordered responsibility, and vocation rather than domination or exploitation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and evangelical circles for shaping discussions on faith and culture, Christian education, and public engagement.
 - Adopted in theological curricula and by pastors seeking a biblically grounded alternative to sacred/secular bifurcation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for integrating biblical theology with cultural praxis; indispensable for courses on worldview, vocation, and Christian social ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation (creational order)** - The original, normative ordering of cosmos and human life that grounds moral and cultural norms.
- **Creation-regained** - Redemption's goal: restoration and renewal of the created order, not abolition of creation.
- **Cultural mandate (Genesis 1:28)** - The command to multiply, fill, and steward the earth; foundational for vocation and cultural activity.
- **Vocation** - Every legitimate human task understood as a calling under God to serve creation.
- **Dominion** - Reinterpreted as responsible stewardship and ordered rule, constrained by creatureliness and divine mandate.
- **Stewardship** - Ethical principle expressing care for created goods and institutions within vocation.
- **Common grace** - The theological category explaining how non-Christians can contribute to cultural flourishing and shared goods.
- **Sphere sovereignty** - Kuyperian-related idea (modified by Wolters) that different social spheres possess ordination and responsibility under God.
- **Sacred/secular divide** - The false dichotomy Wolters critiques; he argues for integrated theology of culture.
- **Redemption as restoration** - Christ's work is primarily restorative, healing creational structures toward eschatological renewal.
- **Antithesis** - The Reformed concept of opposition between Kingdoms recast to emphasize cultural transformation rather than isolation.
- **Worldview / Reformational worldview** - A biblically informed, creationally rooted lens for interpreting and shaping cultural institutions.
- **Normative creation** - The idea that creation itself provides norms for ethics, vocation, and culture.

- **How this work is used across loci**

 - As a **polemic** against sacred/secular dualism and privatized piety.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-2 into ethics and social teaching.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on Christian engagement in arts, science, politics, and education.
