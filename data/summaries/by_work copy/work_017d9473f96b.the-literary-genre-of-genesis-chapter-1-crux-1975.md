### TITLE
**The Literary Genre of Genesis, Chapter 1** (Crux, 1975) 
Author: **Bruce K. Waltke**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1970s evangelical scholarship seeking to reconcile high view of Scripture with emerging literary and form-critical methods. Crux as forum for Protestant theological reflection.
 - Reaction against both naive literalism (strict chronological-day accounts) and dismissive myth-reductionism that treated Genesis 1 as merely primitive cosmology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1 is best understood as a deliberately crafted literary/poetic composition with a theological-liturgy function; its primary aim is theological proclamation (God's sovereignty and creation order), not to serve as a modern scientific or chronographic report.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Linguistic and stylistic analysis: demonstrates formulaic refrains and parallel structures (e.g., repeated divine speech, "and it was so," day-closing formula: "there was evening and there was morning, the nth day").
 - Structural thesis: a chiastic or symmetrical seven-day schema with two triadic creative days (days 1-3 forming realms; days 4-6 populating those realms) and Sabbath climax on day 7.
 - Functional claim: the text operates as liturgical-catechetical material aimed at worship and theological instruction, and as an anti-myth polemic that contrasts Israel's monotheistic Creator with ANE polytheism.
 - Method: close reading of Hebrew syntax, verbal patterns, and comparison with ancient Near Eastern cosmogonies to show deliberate theological reorientation rather than borrowing of mythic motifs.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Engages form-critical and literary-critical interlocutors within OT studies; interacts implicitly with ANE comparative texts (e.g., Enuma Elish) and with both critical and conservative interpreters who debate genre.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (how God communicates foundational theological truth through form), doctrine of creation (God as sovereign, ordering the cosmos), implicit christological and covenantal bearings (as background presuppositions of Israelite theology).
- **Closing line**
 - Genesis 1 is a theologically driven literary composition: its canonical place is to declare the one transcendent Creator who orders and blesses creation, using structured poetic artistry rather than scientific reportage.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats genre as determinative for interpretation: recognizing poetic/liturgical genre redirects exegesis away from literalistic science debates toward theological meaning.
 - Highlights the day-structure as a rhetorical device (two sets of three days and a Sabbath) - not merely chronological scaffolding.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters both: (a) conservative literalists who press modern chronological expectations onto the text, and (b) skeptics who reduce Genesis 1 to mythic syncretism - arguing instead for a polemical reworking of ANE motifs into a monotheistic liturgy.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Re-emphasizes canonical function (text as worship/teaching tool) within evangelical exegesis; early evangelical move toward literary-critical methods without abandoning theological commitments.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among conservative and evangelical OT scholars as a model for a middle way: rigorous literary analysis allied with theological fidelity. Informed later commentaries and classroom treatments of the Days of Creation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical template: genre-sensitive reading that preserves doctrinal content without collapsing into apologetic literalism or skeptical reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Genre** - governs hermeneutical expectations; identifies Genesis 1 as literary/poetic rather than scientific prose.
- **Seven-day schema** - compositional framework (days 1-3 realms; 4-6 inhabitants; 7 Sabbath) central to Waltke's structural reading.
- **Formulaic refrains** - recurring phrases ("And God said," "and it was so," "evening and morning") used as literary markers.
- **Prose-poem / poetic narrative** - hybrid category Waltke uses to capture elevated, ritualized prose.
- **Liturgical-catechetical function** - the text's role in worship and instruction rather than chronological historiography.
- **Anti-mythic polemic** - Genesis 1 reframes and refutes ANE polytheistic cosmogonies, asserting monotheistic creation.
- **Canonical theology** - reading that gives priority to the text's function within Israel's faith community and the canon.
- **Structural parallelism** - the planned correspondences between days and acts that produce theological meaning.
- **Divine fiat language** - "Let there be..." statements underscore God's sovereign speech-act as creative.
- **Sabbath climax** - theological culmination of the narrative emphasizing rest and divine lordship.
- **Form-critical engagement** - use of form criticism to identify genre elements and function.
- **Theological exegesis** - method that integrates literary form with doctrinal consequences.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar of genre-sensitive, literary-critical reading of creation texts.
 - As a **polemic tool**: to challenge literalist readings that ignore literary form and to rebut reductionist myth theories.
 - As a **definition source**: for classifying Genesis 1 as poetic/liturgical within syllabi and commentaries.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: to shift debate from "science vs. Scripture" to "what theological claims is the text making?"
