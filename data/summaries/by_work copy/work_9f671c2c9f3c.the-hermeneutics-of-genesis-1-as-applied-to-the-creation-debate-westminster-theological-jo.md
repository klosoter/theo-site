### TITLE
**The Hermeneutics of Genesis 1 as Applied to the Creation Debate** - Bruce K. Waltke, Westminster Theological Journal (1988)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical/Reformed scholarship during heightened creation debates (young-earth literalism vs. old-earth/theistic evolution).
 - Response to conservative literalist readings popularized by organizations like Institute for Creation Research and to earlier medieval/Patristic readings.
 - Situated within a resurgence of biblical-linguistic and literary approaches to Old Testament interpretation.

- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1 must be read by sound hermeneutical principles (genre, context, grammar, ancient Near Eastern parallels, canonical function) rather than defaulting to a modern literalist or modern scientistic reading; properly read, the "days" of creation function as literary/structural devices that communicate theological truths about God as creator and the ordering of creation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose common exegetical errors: neglect of genre, overreliance on isolated proof-texting, conflation of modern chronology with ancient narrative intent.
 - Argue for a literary-grammatical reading: identify parallelism, chiastic patterns, and the day-structure as a scheme emphasizing order and function.
 - Show the ANE context: Genesis 1 polemicizes against polytheistic myths (e.g., Enuma Elish), asserting monotheistic divine decree rather than mechanistic processes.
 - Theologically interpret creation: focus on divine speech-act, sovereignty, Sabbath theology, and functional ordering (God assigns roles and purposes).
 - Apply these hermeneutical conclusions to the creation debate: Genesis 1 is not primarily a scientific account; it is formative revelation about God and the created order that allows for non-literal readings of "day" without abandoning core doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages with contemporary evangelical literalists (implicit critique), literary-form critics, and scholars emphasizing ANE parallels.
 - Draws on Hebrew linguistic tools, canonical theology, and Reformed doctrinal commitments.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical authority (method of reading Scripture).
 - Creation (creatio ex nihilo, divine decree).
 - Sabbath theology as interpretive key.
 - Indirect implications for providence and Christology via typology of temple/order.

- **Closing line**
 - Genesis 1 is best read as purposeful theological-literary revelation: it teaches who God is and how He orders creation rather than providing a modern timetable of material origins.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes literary-grammatical and canonical hermeneutics within a confessional Reformed frame.
 - Emphasizes the theological function of the "days" (ordering/assignment) over strict vậterial chronology.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects young-earth literalism by exposing category errors (mixing modern scientific chronology with ANE theological narrative).
 - Distinguishes itself from naive concordism and from uncritical accommodation to modern science; aims for a mediating interpretive posture.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Articulates a clear methodological rubric for reading Genesis 1 that integrates ANE context, Hebrew form, and canonical theology.
 - Frames the creation account as speech-act theology (divine decree) that legitimates a non-chronological sense for "day" when warranted.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative and moderate evangelicals seeking alternatives to young-earth positions without abandoning doctrinal conservatism.
 - Cited in subsequent debates over the framework hypothesis and by those advocating literary approaches in Reformed seminaries.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for rigorous exegetical engagement that is philosophically informed but theologically rooted; valuable for classroom use and pastoral counseling on Scripture and science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics** - Methodological principles Waltke insists on: genre, context, grammar, and canonical function.
- **Day(s) of Creation** - Treated as literary/functional units rather than automatically chronological 24-hour periods.
- **Framework hypothesis** - Implicitly supported: days as topical structure organizing function and order.
- **Speech-act / Divine decree** - Creation occurs by God's fiat; emphasis on performative word rather than mechanistic description.
- **Genre / Literary-grammatical reading** - Priority category for deciding literal vs. non-literal readings.
- **Ancient Near Eastern context** - Used diagnostically to reveal Genesis 1 as polemical and theological.
- **Sabbath motif** - Key canonical-theological lens: creation culminates in divine rest, shaping covenantal and cultic meanings.
- **Functional ontology** - Focus on God assigning roles and functions to creation (ordering), not only material origins.
- **Revelation and authority** - Scripture is authoritative but must be interpreted by sound hermeneutical rules.
- **Anti-myth polemic** - Genesis counters ANE polytheism and cosmogony; helps explain thematic form.
- **Historical-grammatical method** - Modified by Waltke to include literary and canonical layers.
- **Exegetical restraint** - Principle against forcing modern scientific categories onto ancient texts.
- **Theological priority** - Doctrine (God's sovereignty, purpose) governs interpretive decisions about scientific questions.
- **Canonical reading** - Genesis 1 read within the counsel of Scripture (e.g., Sabbath, Temple imagery).

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an **exegetical model** in OT courses to teach integrating Hebrew grammar, literary form, and ANE context.
 - As a **polemic** against young-earth literalism within conservative theology, providing a hermeneutical alternative.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for discussions at the interface of theology and science, permitting non-literal readings while upholding divine creation doctrines.
