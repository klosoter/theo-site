### TITLE
Against Christianity - Peter J. Leithart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical and patristic revival milieu. Leithart writes against modernist, pietistic, and nominalist strains in Protestantism, pressing for a retrieval of sacramental, liturgical, and political dimensions of early and medieval Christianity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Modern "Christianity" (a privatized, therapeutic, or purely propositional religion) has abandoned the biblical, imperial, and ecclesial faith. The solution is not mere reform but a return to the full catholic inheritance: Christ as king, the church as covenantal polis, and sacraments as constitutive of corporate identity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary Protestantism disembodies the church (reducing faith to belief/experience).
 - Retrieval: Reclaim the church as a visible, covenantal community governed by Christ the King.
 - Reconstruction: Reform theology and practice around covenantal polity, sacramental efficacy, and liturgical formation.
 - Practical implications: ecclesiology, worship, pastoral practice, and the church-state relation must be rethought to recover a public, social, and sacramental Christianity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical narrative, early church fathers, Augustine, Reformation scholastics, modern evangelicals, and interlocutors in the Federal Vision debates.
 - Critiques Enlightenment privatizers (broadly represented by liberal and deist tendencies) and pietistic reductionists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant** (central): covenant as constitutive of communal identity and continuation of Israel in the church.
 - **Ecclesiology**: visible church, corporate sacraments, polity.
 - **Christology & Kingdom**: Christ as sovereign king establishing a present kingdom manifest in the church.
 - **Sacramentology**: sacraments as means that constitute and sustain the covenant people.
 - Secondary treatments: revelation, justification (in relation to corporate identity), and eschatology (kingdom present and coming).
- **Closing line**
 - Leithart stakes a corrective claim: authentic Christianity is not a private faith but the public, visible, covenantal reign of Christ embodied in a sacramental polity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong reconfiguration of ecclesiology around **kingship** and covenantal polity rather than individual forensic standing.
 - Insistence on the **visibility** and corporate persistence of the church as the locus of salvation history - not merely as a mixed or sociological body.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against the Reformation-era sharpness of the **visible/invisible church distinction**: Leithart argues this dichotomy often leads to disengagement from ecclesial responsibilities rather than faithful covenant life (see Visible And Invisible Church Distinction).
 - Offers alternatives to pietistic and private-religion models by restoring communal and public dimensions.
- **Relation to Federal Vision / monocovenantalism**
 - Sympathetic overlaps with Federal Vision emphases on covenantal continuity and baptismal incorporation; Leithart stresses **monocovenantal continuity** between Israel and the church, using covenantal categories to undergird corporate sacraments and promises (see Federal Vision Monocovenantalism).
 - Not simply reiterative of Federal Vision: Leithart draws more heavily on patristic and political theology resources to make the case for ecclesial kingship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provocative in Reformed circles: praised by those seeking sacramental recovery; criticized by defenders of classic Protestant individualism and those wary of ecclesial maximalism.
 - Stimulated further debate on covenant, baptismal theology, and church polity among conservative Protestants.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes sustained rethinking of ecclesial identity, sacramental practice, and the political implications of Christ's rule; valuable for courses in ecclesiology, sacramentology, and contemporary Reformed theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (monocovenantalism)** - covenant as one unfolding covenantal economy; continuity of promise from Israel to the church (relates to Federal Vision Monocovenantalism).
- **Christ as King** - sovereignty language applied ecclesiologically and politically; grounds the church's public role.
- **Visible Church** - church as a concrete, institutional society where covenantal promises are administered; critique of an over-rescued invisible/subjective ecclesiology (see Visible And Invisible Church Distinction).
- **Invisible Church** - treated cautiously; Leithart warns against spiritualizing this category into an excuse for ecclesial neglect.
- **Sacramental Efficacy** - sacraments as operative, corporate means of grace that constitute identity (especially baptism and the Lord's Supper).
- **Corporate Identity** - theological anthropology pivoting on membership in Christ through covenantal signs and communal life.
- **Kingdom (Church and Kingdom)** - the kingdom is present in the church's life and mission; ecclesiology and political theology overlap (see Church And Kingdom).
- **Polity / Covenantal Polis** - the church as an ordered, communal commonwealth under Christ.
- **Patristic Retrieval** - method: appeal to pre-modern fathers for ecclesial practices and theological grammar.
- **Public Christianity** - critique of privatized faith; advocacy for visible, civic witness.
- **Baptismal Incorporation** - emphasis on baptism as constitutive of covenant membership and not merely signifying inner faith.
- **Eschatological Presence** - kingdom already/not-yet: the church manifests the present reign of Christ while awaiting consummation.
- **Political Theology** - articulation of church-state relations under Christ's kingship; rejects simple secular-sacred bifurcation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against privatized, pietistic Protestantism and for sacramental recovery.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for discussions of covenant continuity and ecclesial visibility (frequently cited in debates over Federal Vision and baptismal theology).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical covenant texts through a communal, kingly lens in courses on ecclesiology and church and kingdom.
