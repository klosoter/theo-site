### TITLE
**Wayne Grudem, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (1994)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context.** Late-20th-century evangelical resurgence after the inerrancy debates; broadly Reformed-baptist, complementarian, and sympathetic to responsible charismatic renewal. Written as a teaching text with Scripture-heavy argumentation and pastoral application.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem.** Scripture is clear, sufficient, and authoritative for doctrine and life; classic evangelical orthodoxy can be expounded in an accessible, pastorally oriented system that integrates exegesis, theology, and practice.
- **Core argument or structure.**
 - Doctrine of the Word: revelation, inerrancy, clarity, sufficiency, authority.
 - God: attributes, Trinity, decrees, providence.
 - **Anthropology and Creation:** image of God, sin, **dichotomy vs trichotomy**, work and culture, **days of creation** surveyed with guarded openness and anti-naturalistic evolution stance.
 - Christ and Redemption: person and work, atonement, calling, regeneration, conversion, justification, adoption.
 - **Sanctification and the Christian life:** definitive and progressive sanctification; means of grace; **spiritual gifts and sanctification** in the life of the church.
 - **Pneumatology:** person and work of the Spirit, **continuationism vs cessationism**, **baptism of the Holy Spirit** at conversion, fillings and empowerings, prophecy and tongues.
 - Church and sacraments: believers baptism, congregational polity.
 - Last things: historic premillennial leaning with charitable openness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors.** Classic Reformed sources (Augustine, Calvin, Hodge, Warfield, Berkhof); modern evangelical theologians (Packer, Erickson); exegetical interlocutors (D. A. Carson); charismatic voices (e.g., Wimber) and cessationist traditions (post-Warfield). Later reception engages EFS critics (e.g., Kevin Giles) and creation debates across YEC, framework, and day-age advocates.
- **Doctrines treated.** Revelation and canon; Trinity; attributes; creation and providence; anthropology and sin; Christology; soteriology (calling to glorification, including **common grace and preparatory grace**); ecclesiology; sacraments; eschatology; Christian ethics and prayer.
- **Closing line.** The center of gravity is a pastorally driven, Scripture-saturated evangelical system that seeks obedient doctrine under the Word and life in the power of the Spirit for the edification of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations.**
 - Strong didactic format: clear definitions, key texts, objections, applications, memory verses.
 - **Continuationist but non-Pentecostal:** affirms ongoing gifts while rejecting tongues as necessary evidence or a post-conversion Spirit baptism.
 - Defines NT prophecy as a mixed, non-canonical gift that can err in transmission while remaining Spirit prompted.
 - Presents multiple creation-day views while firmly rejecting theistic evolution; insists on a historical Adam and Eve.
- **Corrections or contrasts.**
 - Against classical Pentecostalism: denies a second, post-conversion baptism in the Spirit and tongues as initial evidence; urges repeated fillings for empowerment.
 - Against strict cessationism: argues exegetically for the ordinary continuance of gifts until Christ returns, while warning against abuse.
 - Against **trichotomy:** defends **dichotomy** of body and soul/spirit; critiques proof texts for a three-part anthropology.
 - Against Arminian **prevenient grace:** affirms **common grace** broadly but distinguishes it from effectual calling and regeneration.
 - In Trinity: articulates eternal relations of authority and submission (EFS or ERAS) while denying ontological subordination; this sparked substantial debate.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations.**
 - Careful parsing of baptism with/in/by the Spirit as one conversion event.
 - Functional authority-submission language for immanent Trinitarian relations (later labeled ERAS).
 - Practical taxonomy of gifts, their aims, and regulations in congregational life.
- **Reception and influence.**
 - Became a standard evangelical textbook; praised for clarity and usability.
 - Critiqued by some Reformed and patristic scholars over EFS; by cessationists over gifts; by Pentecostals over subsequence.
 - Shaped pastors in Baptist, non-denominational, and broadly Reformed-conservative contexts.
- **Enduring value.**
 - Reliable, teachable baseline across loci; rich Scripture indexing; balanced pastoral tone.
 - Useful for framing debates on gifts, creation, anthropological constitution, and Trinity with accessible entry points.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism.** The view that all spiritual gifts ordinarily continue until Christ returns; embraces regulative, edifying use.
- **Cessationism.** The view that miraculous gifts ceased with the apostolic era; Grudem critiques this as exegetically under-supported.
- **New Testament prophecy.** Non-canonical congregational speech, prompted by the Spirit yet fallible in reporting; to be weighed by the church.
- **Baptism with the Holy Spirit.** One-time initiation at conversion into the body of Christ; distinct from repeated fillings for power.
- **Filling of the Spirit.** Ongoing empowerments for holiness and ministry; to be sought by prayer and obedience.
- **Spiritual gifts (charismata).** Varied abilities given for the common good; governed by love, order, and edification; linked to sanctification in service.
- **Sanctification.** Both definitive (set apart) and progressive (growth in holiness); synergistic under sovereign grace.
- **Common grace and preparatory grace.** Non-saving favor preserving and enriching creation; may prepare for the gospel but does not save or neutralize sin.
 - Contrast: rejects prevenient grace as a universal enabling that restores libertarian ability.
- **Dichotomy vs trichotomy.** Human nature as body and soul/spirit (dichotomy) rather than body-soul-spirit (trichotomy); argues biblical terms for soul and spirit are often interchangeable.
- **Days of creation.** Surveys 24-hour, day-age, and framework views; opposes naturalistic evolution; maintains historical Adam.
- **Eternal functional subordination (ERAS).** The Sons eternal submission in role to the Father without ontological inferiority; contested and carefully distinguished from Arianism.
- **Pentecostal subsequence and initial evidence.** Critiqued: denies post-conversion baptism and tongues as universal initial evidence; affirms value of tongues as one gift.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a baseline definitional source in evangelical courses for Word, Trinity, salvation, church, and eschatology.
 - As a polemical and pastoral resource in debates over **continuationism vs cessationism**, **baptism of the Spirit**, and congregational prophecy.
 - As a conceptual pivot in **EFS** discussions, prompting retrieval of classical Trinitarian categories.
 - As a mapping aid for **anthropology** and **creation** debates (dichotomy, creation days) and for clarifying **common grace** in soteriology.
