### TITLE
De Natura (fragments) - Pelagius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 5th century CE; produced amid the Pelagian controversy in the Western Church (c. 400-418). Text survives only in fragments and patristic quotations (chiefly in Augustine and Jerome) and must be reconstructed from anti-Pelagian polemics and later synodal condemnations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defense of the goodness and integrity of human nature ("natura") and the sufficiency of free will for moral responsibility; rejection of transmitted guilt or innate corruption from Adam; affirmation that grace assists but does not override human moral capacities.
- **Core argument or structure:** (fragmentary)
 - Asserts that God created human nature good and endowed it with rational powers and moral liberty.
 - Distinguishes between sin as personal wrongdoing and any notion of inherited guilt or corruption from Adam.
 - Argues that divine grace is a gift of revelation, instruction, and aid (e.g., Scripture, baptism, Christ's example) that enables but does not coerce right action.
 - Appeals to Scripture and common experience to insist on human accountability and the possibility of living without fatal bondage to sin.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Principal interlocutors: Augustine (primary opponent in surviving sources), Jerome (critic), and the broader ecclesiastical authorities who judged Pelagian claims.
 - Associated figures: Caelestius (close associate; shares many positions) and synods condemning Pelagian propositions (e.g., Carthage 418).
 - Uses Pauline and Gospel texts, but read differently from Augustine (notably Romans and Psalms).
- **Doctrines treated:** Human anthropology (created nature, freedom), original sin (peccatum originale - denial of inherited guilt), concupiscence, grace (gratia), free will (liberum arbitrium), baptism, moral responsibility, imitation of Christ, divine justice.
- **Closing line:** The fragments of De Natura crystallize Pelagius's insistence that human nature remains essentially good and morally capable after creation, making human freedom and responsibility central and defining his alternative account of grace and sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the intrinsic goodness and sufficiency of created nature; moral agency is a natural endowment, not merely remedial.
 - Grace conceived primarily as revelation, teaching, and external assistance rather than an inner, irresistible regenerating power.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Augustinian formulations of original sin, inherited guilt, and total inability; rejects the idea of transmitted condemnation through Adam.
 - Contrasts with Manichaean/dualistic pessimism by affirming creation's goodness and human potential.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Technical emphasis on "natura" as morally competent; stress on "donum" of will rather than an emphasis on depravity.
 - Reframes concupiscence as an inclination needing guidance, not an ontological corruption that incapacitates moral choice.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Officially condemned as Pelagianism at multiple councils; regarded negatively in classical Reformed and Augustinian traditions as undermining the need for prevenient and efficacious grace.
 - Nevertheless influential as the principal foil that clarified Augustinian theology; contributed to later Semi-Pelagian debates and medieval discussions about merit, cooperation, and prevenient grace.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes precise questions about free will, moral responsibility, and the character of grace.
 - Useful pedagogically as a foil for Augustine and for exploring the spectrum between "total depravity" and "moral ability."

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natura (human nature):** Created, essentially good, endowed with reason and moral capacity.
- **Liberum arbitrium (free will):** A robust natural capacity for moral choice; decisive in Pelagius's anthropology.
- **Peccatum originale (original sin):** Denied as transmitted guilt; sin is personal, not inherited condemnation.
- **Corruptio / Depravatio:** Rejected as an ontological condition passed from Adam; at most inclinations (concupiscentia).
- **Concupiscentia (concupiscence):** Seen as disordered desire or habit, not constitutive guilt or incapacity.
- **Gratia (grace):** External aid, revelation, instruction, and support-enabling but non-coercive; grace cooperates with natural ability.
- **Meritum (merit):** Human works can be morally significant; emphasis on moral responsibility and reward/punishment.
- **Baptismus (baptism):** Instrumental for cleansing personal sin and incorporation, not for removing inherited guilt.
- **Imitatio Christi (imitation of Christ):** Ethical model; Christ as exemplar whose life is to be imitated through exercised will.
- **Donum arbitrii (gift of choice):** Emphasizes will as a divine gift that preserves moral accountability.
- **Lex / Mandatum (law/command):** Divine commands presuppose human capacity to obey; law functions as genuine obligation.
- **Revelatio / Scriptura:** Scripture as primary vehicle of grace and instruction rather than as vehicle of irresistible saving action.
- **Cooperatio (cooperation):** Human cooperation with grace is central; grace facilitates but does not override.
- **Judicium (divine judgment):** Based on personal deeds, not inherited penalty.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Pelagian positions on nature, free will, and grace.
- As a **polemic target** for Augustine and later orthodox theologians to sharpen doctrines of original sin, prevenient and efficacious grace.
- As an **exegetical model** for alternative readings of Pauline texts (esp. Romans) that emphasize moral exhortation over forensic inheritance.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates between moral ability and total depravity, and in medieval/early modern discussions of merit and cooperation.
