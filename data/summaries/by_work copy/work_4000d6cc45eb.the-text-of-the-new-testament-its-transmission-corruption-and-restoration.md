### TITLE
The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration - Bruce M. Metzger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑20th century Protestant academic milieu; first published 1964 with subsequent revisions as the standard English introduction to modern New Testament textual criticism.
 - Situated within the rise of rigorous philological methods and the broader recovery of early papyri and codices (e.g., P52, Sinaiticus, Vaticanus) that reshaped text‑critical debate.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament has been transmitted imperfectly through manuscripts; by applying principled textual criticism one can recover, with reasonable probability, the original text and thereby secure the basis for sound exegesis and doctrine.
 - The book addresses the tension between the doctrine of revelation/inerrancy and the empirical reality of variant readings in the manuscript tradition.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey of manuscript evidence: papyri, uncials, minuscules, lectionaries, major codices.
 - Description of the history of textual scholarship: Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott & Hort, Nestle, Aland, and the development of the eclectic critical text.
 - Methodology: external evidence (date, geographical distribution, text‑type) and internal evidence (transcriptional and intrinsic probabilities), with guiding principles (lectio difficilior, lectio brevior).
 - Practical consequences: examples of variants, editorial decisions, and the role of conjectural emendation.
 - Implications for canon, doctrine, and translation practice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott & Hort, Eberhard Nestle, Kurt Aland, UBS editorial practice.
 - Primary evidence: papyri (P52 etc.), Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandrinus, Byzantine manuscripts, Church Fathers, lectionary tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: relation of inspired autographs to extant manuscripts.
 - **Canon and tradition**: formation and stability of the New Testament corpus.
 - **Inerrancy / authority**: practical limits and theological responses to textual variation.

- **Closing line**
 - Metzger's central claim: disciplined, transparent textual criticism reconciles respect for Scripture's divine origin with historical realities of transmission, enabling responsible restoration of the New Testament text for doctrine and exegesis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear, non‑sectarian presentation aimed at both scholars and ministers; emphasizes methodological sobriety over ideological polemic.
 - Strong advocacy for reasoned eclecticism: neither blind majority rule nor uncritical preference for an early single codex.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges majority‑text assumptions popular in some conservative circles; refines Westcott & Hort by incorporating later papyrological finds.
 - Moves beyond 19th‑century mechanical rules toward a balanced weighing of internal and external evidence.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic articulation of **transcriptional vs. intrinsic probability** as decision criteria.
 - Popularized accessible terminology and practical heuristics (lectio difficilior / brevior) for non‑specialists.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard introductory textbook across denominational lines; heavily cited by translators, exegetes, and seminary courses.
 - Provoked critical responses from inerrancy and KJV‑only proponents; reinforced replacement of majority‑text editions by critical Greek texts (Nestle‑Aland / UBS) in many academic and translation projects.

- **Enduring value**
 - Balanced methodological framework that remains the go‑to pedagogical presentation of New Testament textual criticism.
 - Serves as a bridge between technical scholarship and pastoral/teaching needs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Textual criticism** - the discipline of reconstructing the earliest attainable text of the New Testament.
- **Manuscript evidence** - papyri, uncials, minuscules, lectionaries; each class evaluated for date, provenance, and reliability.
- **Codex Sinaiticus / Codex Vaticanus** - principal fourth‑century witnesses central to modern critical texts.
- **Text‑types (Alexandrian, Western, Byzantine)** - traditional groupings used to describe shared readings and tendencies.
 - Alexandrian: generally earlier, often preferred by modern critics.
 - Byzantine: later majority text, high in number but often secondary in textual genealogy.
- **External evidence** - age, geographical spread, and textual affiliation of witnesses.
- **Internal evidence** - transcriptional (how scribes copied) and intrinsic (authorial style, context) considerations.
- **Lectio difficilior potior** - "the more difficult reading is stronger" as a principle to resist smoothing.
- **Lectio brevior potior** - "the shorter reading is preferable" when supported by other evidence.
- **Conjectural emendation** - scholar's restorative emendation when no manuscript reading is satisfactory; used sparingly.
- **Eclectic text** - a critical text assembled by weighing evidence, not by following a single manuscript.
- **Autograph vs. transmission** - distinction between original inspired documents and their subsequent copies.
- **Critical apparatus** - notation of variant readings used to show editorial decisions; essential for transparency.
- **Transcriptional vs. intrinsic probability** - framework for internal evidence weighing.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for methodological terms and decision principles in textual criticism courses.
 - As a **polemic resource** against uncritical appeals to the majority text or inerrantist claims that ignore manuscript data.
 - As an **exegetical model** informing translators and commentators in choosing readings and explaining variants.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in canon and revelation discussions: clarifies distinction between inspired autographs and historically transmitted texts.
