### TITLE
Identity and Idolatry: The Image of God and Its Inversion (2015) - Richard Lints

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published 2015 amid renewed scholarly interest in the imago Dei and theological anthropology. Situated in contemporary Reformed theological debate over identity, culture, and ethics; responds to secular individualism, consumer culture, and identity politics by retrieving classical resources (Scripture, Augustine, Calvin, Barth) for a constructive ecclesial anthropology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Human identity is constituted primarily by the imago Dei; idolatry is the distortion or inversion of that image when created goods or social formations displace God as the ultimate end. Restoring human identity therefore requires theological correction of false loves and a Christocentric recovery of the image.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Clarifies competing ways of speaking of the image (substantialist/capacity, relational, functional, corporate) and argues for a doctrinally integrated, **Christ-centered relational-functional** account. 
 - Diagnoses modern idols (autonomy, consumerism, status/identity politics) as cultural forms that invert the image by making creaturely goods decisive for identity. 
 - Shows how Scripture (Genesis, Pauline texts, Colossians) and Trinitarian theology ground the image in relation to God and its restoration in Christ. 
 - Draws practical implications for ethics, ecclesiology, and pastoral formation-church as the place where the image is formed, ordered, and healed.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Primary biblical witnesses (Genesis 1-2, Colossians, Romans); classic patristic and Reformation figures (Augustine, Calvin); modern theologians (e.g., Barth selectively), and contemporary critics of modernity (social critics and ethicists). Conversation partners include both analytic and continental critiques of identity formation.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Theological anthropology (central), Christology (Christ as true image), Trinity (relational grounding), creation and providence (creation-order), sin and idolatry, soteriology (restoration of the image), ecclesiology (church's formative role), ethics/moral formation.

- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** 
 Human identity is formed and healed not by autonomy or cultural enframings but by participation in the life of the Triune God, whose image is truly revealed in Christ and renewed in the church; idolatry is the practical inversion that must be named and overturned by gospel-shaped formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Treats idolatry as the principal diagnostic category for cultural and personal distortions of identity, shifting the debate from abstract anthropology to concrete moral theology. 
 - Integrates relational and functional readings of imago Dei under a Christological umbrella rather than privileging an ontological "substance" account.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on isolated capacitarian accounts (reason/will) that detach the image from relational and covenantal contexts. 
 - Counters secular accounts that locate identity in autonomy or self-creation, reframing those as modern idols rather than legitimate anthropological goods.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Emphasizes "inversion" as a technical move: idolatry is not merely false worship but the reorientation of ends so that creaturely gifts become determining for identity. 
 - Develops a practical theology of image-restoration that centers ecclesial practices as formative (worship, sacraments, discipline).

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Well received in Reformed academic and pastoral circles as a concise, pastorally sensitive corrective to liberal individualism. 
 - Cited in discussions that bridge doctrine and cultural engagement; less influential in purely systematic or historical-critical scholarship but valued in ethics and church ministry contexts.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Reliable integrative treatment of imago Dei for seminars on theological anthropology, ethics, and pastoral theology. 
 - Useful for training pastors and lay leaders to identify cultural idols and to design formative practices that recover biblical identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Central category-constitutive of human identity; read relationally and functionally, fulfilled in Christ. 
- **Idolatry:** More than false worship-an inversion of ends whereby creaturely goods determine identity and allegiance. 
- **Inversion:** Technical descriptor for the process by which the image is twisted; helpful for diagnosing cultural phenomena. 
- **Relational account:** Emphasizes personhood as defined by relations (ultimately Trinitarian) rather than isolated capacities. 
- **Functional account:** Focuses on human role (vocation/stewardship) as part of how the image is expressed and corrupted. 
- **Substantialist/capacitarian view:** Classical view emphasizing capacities (reason, will); Lints critiques its alone-ness and reframes it within relationality. 
- **Christological fulfillment:** Christ as the true and definitive image (Colossians) who restores human identity-central corrective and anchor. 
- **Corporate image / ecclesial formation:** The church as community where the image is embodied and healed through practices. 
- **Covenantal anthropology:** Emphasis on persons constituted within relations of promise and faithfulness-contrast to individualistic models. 
- **Creation-order:** The created ordering of goods and vocations that must be respected lest they become idols. 
- **Soteriological restoration:** Salvation understood as healing the image, not merely legal acquittal; involves moral and communal transformation. 
- **Moral formation / spiritual disciplines:** Practical means by which the church reorients loves and reconfigures identity. 
- **Autonomy / modern idols:** Contemporary idols diagnosed as disordered loves shaping personal and social identity. 
- **Ethical-pastoral implications:** Application to pastoral care, public theology, and cultural witness.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for a Trinitarian, Christ-centered imago Dei in theological anthropology. 
 - As a **polemic** against modern autonomy/consumerist identity-making in ethics and public theology. 
 - As an **exegetical-model** linking Genesis and Colossians to ecclesial practice and soteriology. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on doctrine-ethics integration and pastoral formation.
