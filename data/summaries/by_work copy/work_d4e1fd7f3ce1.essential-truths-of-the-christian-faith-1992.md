### TITLE
Essential Truths of the Christian Faith (1992) - R. C. Sproul

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published amid late 20th-century evangelical revival of confessional Reformed teaching; product of Ligonier Ministries and Sproul's pastoral-apologetic ministry. Aimed at educated laity and church leaders seeking a concise, systematic introduction to core Christian doctrines within a classical Reformed framework.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christianity must be understood on God-centered, Scripture-grounded terms: the holiness and sovereignty of God and the radical sinfulness and inability of fallen humanity require divine initiative for salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirm Scripture as the final authority (inerrancy and sufficiency).
 - Establish God's attributes (sovereignty, holiness, providence) as determinative for theology and piety.
 - Present human sinfulness as comprehensive (Total Depravity) and human inability to respond as dependent on divine regeneration (Total Inability).
 - Unpack salvation as monergistic: election, effectual calling, justification by faith (penal substitution emphasized), regeneration, adoption, sanctification.
 - Conclude with ecclesiology and the means of grace: sacraments, preaching, prayer, and Christian life under covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and the Reformers (Calvin, the Westminster tradition); modern Reformed thinkers (Kuyper indirectly via Ligonier tradition); polemical engagement with Arminianism, liberal theology, and secular critiques of doctrinal orthodoxy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture (authority/inerrancy), God (Trinity, attributes), creation, providence, anthropology (Total Depravity/Total Inability), Christology (incarnation, atonement), soteriology (election, justification, regeneration, sanctification), ecclesiology, sacraments, eschatology in concise form.
- **Closing line capturing the center of gravity:** A concise, God-centered Reformed catechesis that insists on Scripture and divine sovereignty as the necessary framework for understanding sin, salvation, and the Christian life - with special stress on humanity's total corruption and the necessity of divine regeneration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Crisp pastoral apologetics: doctrinal clarity paired with pastoral application; theology as worship and practical piety.
 - Reiterates and sharpens the distinction between **Total Depravity** (pervasive corruption of nature) and **Total Inability** (the incapacity to effect spiritual renewal).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back directly against Arminian and pragmatic evangelical tendencies that downplay human inability and overemphasize human will in conversion.
 - Counters liberalizing readings of Scripture by reasserting inerrancy and objective truth claims.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical neologisms, but notable for accessible framing of classic Reformed terms for lay readers; popularized precise pastoral definitions (e.g., careful unpacking of "total" in Total Depravity).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as an introductory textbook; influential in Ligonier teaching programs and church education.
 - Praised for clarity and pastoral tone; critiqued by some for compression and polemical force when addressing opposing views.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a reliable, concise primer on Reformed orthodoxy, especially valuable for teaching the doctrines of sin and grace and for introducing lay leaders to systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity:** Human nature affected in every part by sin; not the worst possible sinfulness but pervasive inability to please God or achieve saving righteousness.
- **Total Inability:** The consequence of depravity: unaided human beings cannot effect their own regeneration or faith; emphasizes need for divine initiative.
 - Relation to Total Depravity: Sproul stresses the logical and pastoral distinction - corruption vs. incapacity to respond.
- **Sovereignty of God:** Central organizing principle; God ordains, governs, and sustains all things including salvation.
- **Scriptural Authority / Inerrancy:** Scripture as the final norm and reliable revelation for doctrine and life.
- **Monergism:** Salvation as an act of God alone (effectual calling, regeneration); used polemically against synergistic schemes.
- **Election:** God's eternal choice; grounded in divine purpose and mercy, not human foreseen faith.
- **Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide):** Legal declaration of righteousness through Christ's imputed righteousness; penal substitution often affirmed as the atonement model.
- **Regeneration:** Spiritual rebirth caused by the Holy Spirit; prerequisite for faith and repentance.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive work of grace following justification; cooperative in experience but rooted in Christ's work.
- **Covenant:** Framework for understanding continuity of God's dealings; sacramental life situated in covenantal structures.
- **Atonement / Penal Substitution:** Christ bears penalty due to sin; forgiveness is forensic and substitutionary.
- **Means of Grace:** Preaching, sacraments, prayer as channels by which God applies redemption.
- **Effectual Calling vs General Call:** Distinction emphasised to safeguard monergism and divine efficacy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for Reformed catechetical instruction and parish education.
 - As a **polemic** against Arminianism, theological liberalism, and reductionist evangelicalism on issues of sin and grace.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** for bridging biblical texts and systematic affirmations in accessible teaching contexts.
