### TITLE
**The Whole Christ: Legalism, Antinomianism, and Gospel Assurance** (2016), Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written amid renewed evangelical debates on law/gospel, assurance, and sanctification; retrieves the 18th-century Scottish Marrow Controversy to correct contemporary distortions.
 - Reformed, pastoral, and confessional milieu; aims to reunite doctrinal precision with cure-of-souls practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Legalism and antinomianism are not opposites but non-identical twins** sharing a root: separation of **Christ** from **his benefits** and a misapprehension of the **Father's character**. The gospel offers not benefits detached from the giver but **the whole Christ**, with all benefits in union with him.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical retrieval: Edward Fisher's The Marrow of Modern Divinity; Thomas Boston and the Marrow Men vs. ecclesiastical censure.
 - Diagnostic thesis: both errors arise where God's fatherly goodness is eclipsed; both mishandle the law/gospel relation.
 - Doctrinal synthesis:
 - **Union with Christ** as the integrating center; the benefits are indivisible because they are Christ himself communicated by the Spirit.
 - **Free offer and warrant of faith**: Christ is sincerely offered to all; the warrant rests on the divine promise, not prior qualifications.
 - **Assurance** grounded in Christ's person and promises; nourished through the means of grace; compatible with self-examination without becoming introspective moralism.
 - **Law's third use**: not as a covenant of works reborn, but as Christ's scepter guiding the sons whom he has redeemed.
 - **Repentance and faith**: repentance is evangelical fruit of faith in Christ, not a precondition for coming to him.
 - Pastoral application: preaching Christ clothed in the gospel; curing both antinomian and legalistic hearts with the same Christ-centered remedy.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Pro: Thomas Boston, Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine, James Hog; Walter Marshall; Calvin; Westminster Standards.
 - Contra or corrected: Scottish Assembly condemnations (Auchterarder context), neonomian tendencies (e.g., Baxterian moralism), antinomian misreadings (e.g., Crisp-leaning trajectories).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (person-and-benefits, totus Christus), **soteriology** (union, justification, sanctification, adoption, assurance), **doctrine of sin** (legal spirit vs lawless spirit), **covenant theology** (works/grace distinction, neonomianism rejected), **ecclesiology & sacraments** (means of grace, pastoral ministry), with eschatological notes on perseverance and final judgment relative to assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - Receive the **whole Christ** as freely offered by the Father; in union with him the law finds its proper place, repentance its source, and assurance its solid home.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Christ-and-his-benefits inseparability as the organizing principle of salvation.
 - Diagnosis of legalism/antinomianism from a shared misreading of the Father's heart.
 - Pastoral retrieval of Marrow themes for contemporary preaching and counseling.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **neonomianism**: denies any new-law scheme that makes repentance/obedience a condition to obtain Christ.
 - Against **antinomianism**: upholds the law's third use as Christ's gracious rule for adopted children.
 - Against **preparationism** and morbid introspection: the warrant of faith is the promise, not pre-faith contrition or evidences.
 - Nuances some revivalist and modern evangelical patterns that detach assurance from Christ's objective work or from the ordinary means.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Framing errors as twin distortions of the Father's character.
 - Consolidating ordo salutis around **union with Christ** rather than sequencing detached benefits.
 - The pastoral maxim: preach **Christ clothed in the gospel**; give Christ himself before calling for the fruits that flow from him.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely commended in Reformed and evangelical circles for clarity on law/gospel and assurance; used in seminary curricula, ministerial training, and elder education.
 - Bridges Presbyterian and Reformed Baptist contexts; engages ongoing debates on sanctification, the free offer, and so-called free-grace controversies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of historical retrieval for present pastoral crises.
 - A lucid, churchly synthesis aligning confession, exegesis, and cure of souls.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Marrow Controversy**: 18th-c. Scottish debate over The Marrow of Modern Divinity; focused on free offer, assurance, and law/gospel.
- **Free Offer of the Gospel**: God's sincere, universal offer of Christ; grounds evangelism and the command to believe.
- **Warrant of Faith**: The divine promise and offer of Christ, not prior repentance or moral fitness, authorize sinners to believe.
- **Legalism**: Seeking acceptance apart from Christ or treating the law as covenant-of-works for the justified; twin to antinomianism.
- **Antinomianism**: Severing sanctification and law from the gospel; denies the third use and the necessity of Spirit-wrought obedience.
- **Neonomianism**: Making the gospel a milder law of conditions; subtly relocates assurance to performance.
- **Union with Christ**: Spirit-wrought bond in which all benefits are received; the center of ordo and the antidote to both errors.
 - **Christ and his benefits**: Benefits are inseparable because they are Christ communicated.
- **Ordo salutis in Christo**: Ordering salvation within union, resisting fragmentation of benefits.
- **Adoption / Filial Fear**: Assurance nourished by knowing God as Father; filial, not servile, fear motivates obedience.
- **Third Use of the Law**: The law as rule of life for the justified under grace; Christ's scepter, not a ladder to life.
- **Assurance**: Not the essence of faith, yet ordinarily attainable; anchored in Christ's promises and confirmed via means and evidences.
- **Repentance and Faith**: Faith unites to Christ and yields repentance; repentance is not a prerequisite to come to him.
- **Preparationism**: Requiring pre-faith qualifications; rejected as undermining the free offer.
- **Means of Grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer; conduits by which Christ and assurance are communicated.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Christology**: Anchor for person-benefit inseparability; union-centric framing.
 - **Soteriology**: Norming source on free offer, warrant of faith, assurance, sanctification.
 - **Doctrine of Sin**: Diagnostic grid for legalism/antinomianism in hearts and churches.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments / Covenant**: Pastoral use of means of grace; law/gospel preaching; covenant-of-works vs grace clarity.
