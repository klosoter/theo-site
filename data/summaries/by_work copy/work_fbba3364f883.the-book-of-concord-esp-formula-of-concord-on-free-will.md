### TITLE
The Book of Concord - Formula of Concord on Free Will (English ed. Robert Kolb & Timothy Wengert, eds.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Lutheran Orthodoxy; Formula of Concord completed 1577 to settle intra-Lutheran controversies after Luther and Melanchthon.
 - Edited and translated into modern English by Kolb and Wengert (standard scholarly edition), used widely in contemporary Lutheran studies.
 - Milieu: reaction to Philippist syncretism, Crypto-Calvinism, Roman Catholic scholasticism, and the aftereffects of Erasmus-Luther debates on human will.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Clarify the nature and limits of human free will after the Fall, defending that in spiritual matters the will is bound by sin and can do no saving good apart from divine grace, while preserving human responsibility and ordered capacities in civil life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural and patristic grounding: appeals to Pauline texts and Augustine; draws heavily on Luther's "Bondage of the Will."
 - Distinguishes spheres of the will:
 - Civil/temporal freedom: retained for common life, moral decision-making, and societal duties.
 - Spiritual freedom: lost by original sin; human nature cannot turn itself to God without the Holy Spirit.
 - Rejects both Pelagian/semipelagian claims (that will contributes to initial salvation) and deterministic fatalism (that God causes sin or removes human accountability).
 - Affirms monergistic regeneration: God alone effects conversion; the human will cooperates only after the work of the Spirit.
 - Employs forensic categories (justification, imputation) to protect the doctrine of grace and prevent conflation of sanctification with justification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Builds on Luther and Augustine; responds to Erasmus, Melanchthonian modifies (Philippists), Roman Catholic casuists, and emergent Reformed positions.
 - Uses scholastic distinctions selectively but subordinates them to pastoral and confessional concerns.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (original sin), soteriology (grace, regeneration, justification), predestination (insofar as it interacts with free will), law and gospel, means of grace and vocation.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Formula affirms that salvation is by God's free, sovereign grace alone: human will is bound in spiritual matters and salvation is initiated and accomplished monergistically by God while human responsibility and moral order remain intact.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Precise balancing act: asserts the "bondage of the will" for spiritual good while preserving genuine human agency in civil/moral spheres.
 - Uses forensic and pastoral categories to keep the doctrine from becoming speculative metaphysics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived Melanchthonian synergism (that human will cooperates prior to grace).
 - Distinguishes Lutheran position from Roman Catholic semi-Pelagianism and from some Reformed formulations of predestination that verge into double predestination or necessitarianism.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines "bondage" language into a theological typology of wills (spiritual vs. civil), and clarifies "ability" vs. "will" - i.e., natural capacities vs. spiritual freedom.
 - Reasserts the centrality of forensic imputation as shaping anthropology and soteriology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became normative for confessional Lutheranism; central to Lutheran identity in later orthodoxy and revival movements.
 - Influenced Protestant debates on grace vs. free will; served as a key text in Lutheran-Reformed and Lutheran-Catholic polemics.
 - Modern scholarship (including Kolb & Wengert edition) emphasizes historical context, theological nuance, and pastoral intent.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a confessional attempt to hold paradoxes: divine sovereignty and human responsibility, grace and moral order.
 - Valuable for teaching Pauline anthropology, pastoral theology, and confessional identity maintenance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - human faculty to choose; in Formula: functionally limited by sin in spiritual matters.
- **Bondage of the will** - classic Lutheran phrase: will enslaved to sin regarding turning to God; requires divine liberation.
- **Original sin** - inherited corruption that incapacitates spiritual will and necessitates regeneration.
- **Grace (unmerited favor)** - prevenient only insofar as God alone initiates; operative and effectual in regeneration (monergistic).
- **Monergism** - doctrine that God alone effectuates regeneration and conversion (Formula insists on this in spiritual realm).
- **Synergism** - rejected insofar as it claims human cooperation in initiating salvation; Formula rejects pre-conversion cooperation.
- **Justification / forensic imputation** - central categories protecting that salvation is declared on account of Christ, not human merit.
- **Predestination** - affirmed in relation to salvation, but denied any active divine predestination to sin or damnation that would violate God's goodness.
- **Means of grace (Word and Sacraments)** - instruments through which God effects faith and regeneration, not contingent human actions.
- **Civil righteousness / earthly will** - sphere where humans retain moral responsibility and ability to govern society.
- **Regeneration / conversion** - work of the Holy Spirit that frees the will and produces faith; not the result of human decision.
- **Law and Gospel distinction** - hermeneutical key: law reveals inability and sin; gospel announces grace that effects true freedom.
- **Foreknowledge (praescientia)** - affirmed in a way that safeguards God's ordaining will and human culpability.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional confessional source for Lutheran doctrine of human will and grace.
 - As polemic ammunition against semi-Pelagian and some Reformed extremes; used in theological controversies.
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model for reading Pauline texts on sin, will, and grace; often cited in courses on soteriology and pastoral care.
