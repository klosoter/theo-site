### TITLE
The Lord's Supper in the Westminster Standards (WTJ 2018) - Glen Clary

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in Westminster Theological Journal (2018). Engages the seventeenth-century Westminster Standards (WCF, Larger & Shorter Catechisms) in light of contemporary confessional and ecclesial debates.
 - Situated within confessional Reformed scholarship seeking to clarify sacramental theology against both Roman Catholic and Lutheran readings and against minimalist memorialist readings common in evangelicalism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Standards teach a **real, spiritual presence** of Christ in the Lord's Supper: communicants truly feed upon Christ by the Spirit, yet the presence is not local or corporal.
 - The problem addressed: how to read the Standards consistently so as to avoid both a Lutheran physical presence and a Zwinglian mere-memorialism, while explaining sacramental efficacy.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegesis of key Standards texts (WCF ch. 29; Larger Catechism Qs. on the supper), clarifying pivotal phrases (e.g., "spiritual feeding and nourishment," "by faith," "communicated by the Holy Ghost").
 - Historical-theological tracing of Westminster divines' sources: Calvin, Bucer, covenantal theology, and polemics with the Church of England and continental parties.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - The supper is a sign and seal that **truly communicates Christ** to believers.
 - The Holy Spirit is the instrumental agent effecting spiritual feeding; the Word works with the sacrament.
 - Rejection of corporeal presence; insistence on objective efficacy when received in faith.
 - Pastoral implications: worthy receiving, the role of faith, and the discipline of the table.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Westminster Confession and Catechisms.
 - Secondary/theological interlocutors: John Calvin, Reformers (esp. Bucer), Lutheran sacramental theology (as foil), Zwinglian memorialists, and modern Reformed interpreters.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology (nature, signs, seals, efficacy)
 - Christology (presence of the risen Christ)
 - Pneumatology (Holy Spirit as communicator)
 - Covenant theology and union with Christ
 - Ecclesiology and pastoral discipline (worthy receiving, table practice)
 - Soteriology insofar as union/feeding relates to faith and nourishment

- **Closing line**
 - The article anchors Westminster sacramentology: the Lord's Supper is a spiritually efficacious means by which, through the Spirit and through faith, believers truly feed upon Christ-real presence without corporeal presence, sign and seal mediated by covenantal union.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes the **Spirit-mediated instrumentalism** of the Standards: the Holy Spirit, working by the Word and sacrament, is the means by which believers are fed with Christ.
 - Highlights the Standards' careful proportional language: both objective reality (Christ truly given) and subjective reception (faith necessary).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects readings that reduce the Standards to mere memorialism; refuses conflation with Lutheran corporeal presence.
 - Clarifies that Westminster is not ambiguous: it affirms a robust, non-physical realism about presence grounded in union with Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Stresses terminological precision: parsing phrases such as "communicated by the Holy Ghost" and "by faith," to show a twofold ontic-soteriological structure (objective gift + subjective appropriation).
 - Frames the supper in covenantal-union idiom as the key to interpreting "feeding" language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful and cited among confessional Reformed scholars, pastors, and catechists seeking authoritative clarification of Standards sacramentology.
 - Serves in intra-Protestant dialogues to demonstrate a middle path between memorialism and corporeal presence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, succinct exegetical-theological reading of Westminster sacramental language.
 - Valuable for teaching, confessional formation, and correcting both pietistic diminution and scholastic overreach about presence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Real, spiritual presence**
 - Christ is truly present to believers in the supper, but present spiritually, not locally or carnally.
- **Spiritual feeding and nourishment**
 - The language of "feeding" indicates real benefit and union; the feeding is by faith and the Spirit.
- **Sign and seal**
 - The sacrament is a visible sign and an effectual seal of the covenant promises.
- **Communicated by the Holy Ghost**
 - The Spirit is the agent who applies Christ's benefits in the sacrament.
- **By faith**
 - Reception requires appropriating faith; efficacy is not automatic but sure for those who worthily receive.
- **Objectivity vs subjectivity**
 - Westminster balances objective provision (Christ given) with subjective reception (faith, thanksgiving).
- **Non-corporeal presence**
 - Terminological safeguard against Lutheran corporealism; presence is real but not spatially localized in the elements.
- **Instrumental efficacy**
 - Sacraments function instrumentally when used with the Word; the Spirit uses them to sanctify and unite believers to Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Covenantal and mystical union provides the ontological ground for feeding on Christ.
- **Worthy receiving / fencing the table**
 - Pastoral discipline emphasizing the necessity of holiness and examined faith.
- **Memorialism (contrast)**
 - Memorialists reduce the supper to remembrance; Westminster rejects this impoverished view.
- **Sacramental realism (confessional)**
 - A middle realism: sacramental means truly confer grace when accompanied by faith.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Westminster sacramentology in ecclesial instruction and confessional statements.
 - As a **polemic** against both memorialist and Lutheran misreadings of the Standards.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting WCF and catechismal language via covenantal-pneumatological categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and catechesis to reclaim sacramental seriousness without sacramentalism.
