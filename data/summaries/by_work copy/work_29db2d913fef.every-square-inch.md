### TITLE
Every Square Inch - Bruce Riley Ashford 
An accessible, Kuyperian-informed handbook advocating comprehensive Christian cultural engagement (popular evangelical/Reformed public theology).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed conversation about public theology and cultural engagement. Builds on a renewed interest among evangelicals in Abraham Kuyper, common grace, and the cultural mandate as corrective to pietism and privatized faith.
 - Aimed at pastors, church leaders, and lay Christians seeking theological foundations for engagement in education, arts, politics, business, and media.

- **Central thesis**
 - **God's sovereignty and mission extend to every realm of creation**; Christians are called to faithful stewardship and transformative engagement across "every square inch" of life, not merely private piety or church activity.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Affirm the theological basis: creation, the cultural mandate (Genesis 1-2), and God's lordship over all spheres.
 - Articulate the doctrine of **common grace** as enabling non-redemptive cultural flourishing and providing space for Christian witness in institutions.
 - Reframe vocation: all legitimate callings are means of cultural stewardship and kingdom participation.
 - Offer practical principles and strategies for engagement (church-centered activism, institutional development, long-term cultural formation).
 - Conclude with pastoral exhortation to cultivate biblical imagination and sustained institutional presence rather than episodic activism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary intellectual debt to **Abraham Kuyper** (notably the aphorism that there is no square inch of creation Christ does not claim).
 - Engages classic Reformed thinkers (Calvin, Bavinck) and contemporary evangelical interlocutors concerned about pietism, civic withdrawal, or crude culture-war strategies.
 - Interacts implicitly with two-kingdom models, pietistic quietism, and political activist strands that collapse gospel distinctives.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, providence, and sovereignty; the cultural mandate; common grace; vocation and calling; mission and ecclesiology; elements of public theology and ethics; implicit Christology and eschatology as they motivate engagement.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Christians, grounded in the sovereignty of God and enabled by common grace, are called to redeem, steward, and cultivate every dimension of created life in anticipation of Christ's kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves beyond individualistic piety to a systemic, institutional vision of cultural engagement - the church as incubator for long-term cultural presence.
 - Stresses **common grace** as the theological linchpin that makes credible sustained cultural participation and cooperation with non-Christians.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic withdrawal and purely missionary/conversion models by insisting theological legitimacy for cultural work that is not directly evangelistic.
 - Distinguishes itself from facile culture-war activism by prioritizing institution-building, stewardship, and fidelity over partisan conquest.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Popularizes Kuyperian vocabulary in contemporary evangelical settings (e.g., "every square inch") and operationalizes it into practical church and lay strategies.
 - Integrates vocation, mission, and public theology into a unified praxis model for congregational formation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed-evangelical networks and seminaries as a concise primer on Kuyperian cultural theology.
 - Used in pastors' conferences, church training, and lay-study groups; often cited in debates about the proper Christian approach to politics, education, and media.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical tool: succinctly maps theological resources (creation, common grace, vocation) onto concrete engagement practices.
 - Serves as a bridge between historic Kuyperian resources and pragmatic church-level application for students and leaders.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Every Square Inch**
 - Phrase borrowed from Kuyper; shorthand for the claim that Christ's lordship extends over all creation and human activity.

- **Cultural mandate**
 - The Genesis commission to steward, cultivate, and exercise dominion - grounded as theological warrant for cultural engagement.

- **Common grace**
 - God's non-saving gifts that restrain sin and enable social and cultural goods; presented as the theological basis for cooperation and secular cultural flourishing.

- **Sphere sovereignty / sphere responsibility**
 - The idea that distinct social spheres (family, church, state, economy, education) have God-given roles; used to argue for responsible engagement rather than domination.

- **Vocation**
 - Broadly construed as calling in all legitimate professions and institutions; central to how believers exercise kingdom stewardship.

- **Domination vs. stewardship**
 - Reorients "dominion" language toward responsible stewardship of creation rather than exploitative control.

- **Public theology**
 - Theology articulated for shaping public life and institutions; the book functions as a primer for evangelical public theology.

- **Institutional formation**
 - Emphasis on building and sustaining institutions (schools, media, arts) as long-term cultural engagement strategy.

- **Mission as cultural transformation**
 - Mission includes evangelism but also cultural cultivation and renewal within created structures.

- **Two Kingdoms (contrast)**
 - Implicit critique of overly strict two-kingdom formulations that quarantine faith from cultural spheres.

- **Creation-Fall-Redemption framework**
 - Underwrites the logic of cultural mandate and the need for redemption of cultural structures.

- **Kingdom participation**
 - Language promoting active, faithful presence in shaping society as participants in God's reign.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for contemporary evangelical engagements with the cultural mandate and Kuyperian public theology.
- **Polemic** against pietistic withdrawal and simplistic culture-war approaches, advocating institutional patience.
- **Practical model** for church training in vocation, civic responsibility, and long-term cultural formation.
