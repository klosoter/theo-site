### TITLE
Divine Covenants and Moral Order: A Biblical Theology of Natural Law - David VanDrunen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed theological scholarship (late 20th-early 21st century). Engages debates in Protestant natural-law thought, public theology, and covenantal hermeneutics amid renewed interest in law-and-gospel relations in moral theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Natural law is best understood as a covenantal phenomenon**: the moral order accessible to human reason is not autonomous from redemptive history but is constituted and mediated by God's divine covenants as revealed in Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical-theological foundation
 - Exegetical survey demonstrating how Old and New Testament passages portray moral norms as embedded in covenants (creation, Noahic, Mosaic, Davidic, new covenant).
 - Historical-theological correction
 - Critiques Thomistic and modern Enlightenment accounts that ground natural law primarily in created nature independent of covenantal revelation.
 - Systematic-ethical application
 - Develops a consistent account of how moral norms apply across epochs (continuity and discontinuity), and how they inform conscience, civil law, and Christian public engagement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary scriptural corpus; engages Reformed covenantalists (e.g., Calvinic tradition, covenant theology), Thomas Aquinas and Thomists, Grotius/early modern natural law, and contemporary discussions in public theology and legal theory.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation (general and special)**, **covenant theology** (creation covenant, covenant of grace), **law** (moral, ceremonial, civil), **Christology** (fulfillment of the law), **ecclesiology**, **political theology** (magistrate authority), and implications for **eschatology** regarding moral accountability.
- **Closing line**
 - VanDrunen centers the moral order in the **sustaining, covenantal rule of God**: natural law is not an autonomous moral ontology but the covenantal ordering of creation fulfilled and interpreted in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Covenantal grounding** of natural law: moral norms arise from God's covenantal governance rather than only from ontological features of creation.
 - Emphasizes **biblical-historical contingency**: different covenant administrations mediate the moral order without collapsing into moral relativism.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges classical Thomistic accounts that posit a self-sufficient natural law grounded in the intrinsic purposes of created nature.
 - Offers an alternative to purely secular Enlightenment conceptions and to accounts that sever moral order from redemptive-historical revelation.
 - Modifies certain two-kingdom readings by showing civil obligations flow from covenantal stipulations and common grace rather than a wholly separate divine economy.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Use of the phrase **"covenantal natural law"** to denote a law concept that is at once natural and theologically mediated by covenant.
 - Distinction between **law as covenantal norm** and **law as metaphysical teleology**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed circles for public theology, legal and political ethics; taken up in debates on conscience, civil legislation, and church-state relations.
 - Criticized by some Thomists and secular theorists who view covenantal grounding as too sectarian for universal moral claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model linking exegesis, historical theology, and ethics; valuable for classrooms, public theology, and pastors navigating law and gospel in civic contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural law**
 - Moral knowledge intelligible to human reason; here, **interpreted through covenantal revelation** rather than as purely ontological.
- **Divine covenants**
 - God's administrations (creation/Noahic/Mosaic/Davidic/new covenant) that **mediate moral norms**.
- **Covenantal natural law**
 - VanDrunen's central term: natural law as **derivative of covenantal stipulation and revelation**.
- **Creation covenant**
 - The original ordering of moral duties rooted in God's sustaining governance of created purposes.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - The redemptive covenant that **reorients moral obligations** through Christ's fulfillment.
- **Law (moral, ceremonial, civil)**
 - Distinguishes moral norms' perennial force from ceremonial and civil stipulations' administrative particularity.
- **Common grace**
 - The doctrine explaining how non-Christians can apprehend and live by aspects of the moral order.
- **Authority of the civil magistrate**
 - Civil obligations derive moral warrant from God's covenantal governance and common grace, giving shape to church-state relations.
- **Law of nature and nations**
 - Early modern term reinterpreted covenantally: nations have moral duties under God's covenantal rule.
- **General revelation**
 - Source of natural-law knowledge; must be read in the light of covenantal and special revelation.
- **Christ's fulfillment**
 - Christ as interpreter and fulfiller of the law, shaping the continuity of moral norms.
- **Conscience**
 - Functioning under common grace and covenantal instruction; fallible but normative for moral responsibility.
- **Continuity and discontinuity**
 - Framework for discerning which norms persist across covenant administrations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Church And State Relations:** Employed as a theological basis for magistrates' moral authority and for arguing that civil law should reflect covenantal moral norms (used as a conceptual pivot in Reformed political theology).
 - **Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective:** Used to argue that present moral order is covenantally ordered but provisional pending Christ's eschatological consummation - a model for engaging culture with both critical restraint and hopeful transformation.
 - Used as an **exegetical model** for reading biblical law and as a **polemic** against both secular natural law and autonomous Thomism in public ethics.
