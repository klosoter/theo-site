### TITLE
All That Is in God: Evangelical Theology and the Challenge of Classical Christian Theism (2017) - James E. Dolezal

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-2010s evangelical theological conversation: reaction to openness/process theism, relational theism, and certain popular evangelical theologies that relativize classical attributes.
 - Aimed at evangelical scholars and pastors seeking retrieval of classical Christian theism (CCT) within evangelical commitments to Scripture and pastoral concern.

- **Central thesis**
 - Evangelical theology should recover and re-center **classical Christian theism**: God is ontologically self-subsistent and wholly the source of all perfections ("all that is in God"), and many contemporary evangelical revisions of divine attributes are unnecessary and theologically harmful.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary evangelicalism has drifted toward relational/open/process accounts that compromise divine transcendence and ontological primacy.
 - Retrieval: careful appropriation of classical theist categories (absolute vs relative attributes; divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) as coherent and biblically defensible.
 - Construction: defense of a theological method that places the classical divine attributes at the center of doctrine, with implications for revelation, providence, prayer, and Christology.
 - Pastoral and apologetic consequences: a robust classical God secures Christian worship, trust under providence, and the coherence of divine causality.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical sources (patristic and medieval theists) and the broader tradition of CCT.
 - Interlocutes with contemporary evangelical trends (open theism, relational theism, certain charismatic and experiential emphases) and correctives from analytic and Reformed theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: doctrine of God (attributes, simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
 - Secondary implications: revelation (God as transcendent author), providence and sovereignty, Trinity and economic/ontological relations, Christology (implications of divine attributes for the incarnation).

- **Site usages**
 - Dolezal treats the **Absolute and Relative Attributes** taxonomy as a central methodological tool (see his treatment of attribute classification).
 - He gives detailed argumentation for classical attributes-**Simplicity, Aseity, Immutability, Impassibility**-as essential elements of a coherent theism.

- **Closing line**
 - The book argues that recovering classical Christian theism preserves the integrity of God as the ontological ground of all being and secures evangelical commitments to Scripture, worship, and providence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong methodological move: place *ontology of God* (what God is) prior to certain experiential or relational concerns; argue that many pastoral tensions vanish when God's ontological primacy is upheld.
 - Rehabilitates classical attributes not as antiquated metaphysics but as theological necessities for coherent doctrine and praxis.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects evangelical concessions to openness/process views that make God contingent or mutable.
 - Contrasts with relational theologies that prioritize divine responsiveness over divine simplicity and aseity.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear, contemporary articulation of the **absolute vs relative attributes** distinction for evangelical audiences, showing how the distinction functions hermeneutically and doctrinally.
 - Systematic bridging of analytic precision and confessional theological retrieval.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Positively received among conservative Reformed and classical theist proponents as a timely corrective.
 - Provoked critique from relationalists and openness proponents who argue for greater emphasis on divine relationality and suffering.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a teaching text for integrating classical theism into evangelical theological curricula and for defending classical attributes in contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical Christian Theism (CCT)** - the traditional doctrine of God emphasizing transcendence, aseity, simplicity, immutability, impassibility.
- **Absolute attributes** - attributes that belong to God as God (e.g., aseity, simplicity); not derivative from creaturely relations.
 - Used as the primary doctrinal anchor in Dolezal's method.
- **Relative attributes** - attributes that describe God's relations to creatures (e.g., mercy, faithfulness); derivative and intelligible only insofar as they relate to creation.
- **Divine Simplicity** - denial of metaphysical composition in God; God's attributes are identical to His essence.
 - Dolezal defends simplicity as necessary to avoid metaphysical dependency.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence and self-sufficiency; God is not ontologically dependent on anything.
- **Immutability** - God's unchanging nature; speaks to God's faithfulness and reliability across time.
- **Impassibility** - God does not have passions or passive suffering in the way creatures do; preserves divine freedom and sovereignty.
- **Transcendence** - God's ontological priority over creation; core corrective to anthropomorphic reductions.
- **Providence** - divine governance understood in light of God's absolute attributes; avoids capricious or contingent deities.
- **Ontology-first method** - locating theological method in the being of God rather than primarily in experience or outcomes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the absolute/relative attributes distinction in systematic theology modules.
- As a **polemic** and resource against openness/process theism and for reaffirming classical attributes in evangelical apologetics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for reorienting doctrines of providence, prayer, and revelation around God's aseity and simplicity.
