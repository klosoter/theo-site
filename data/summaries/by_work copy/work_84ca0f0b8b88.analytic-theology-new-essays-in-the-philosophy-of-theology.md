### TITLE
Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology - edited by Oliver D. Crisp and Michael C. Rea

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Emergent early 21st-century movement that imports tools from Anglo‑American analytic philosophy into constructive Christian theology.
 - Responds to perceived vagueness in contemporary systematic theology and to the separation between professional philosophers of religion and confessional theologians.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Analytic methods (formal argumentation, conceptual analysis, model construction) can and should be deployed to clarify, defend, and develop central Christian doctrines without surrendering theological commitments.
 - Aims to show theology as disciplined, argumentative, and intelligible to philosophical scrutiny.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Collection of essays; general programmatic arc:
 - Articulate theological doctrines with conceptual precision.
 - Build metaphysical and epistemic models (sometimes formal) that capture doctrinal claims.
 - Test models against scriptural, historical, and philosophical constraints.
 - Offer revisions or syntheses where tensions appear.
 - Typical methodological moves:
 - Make theological claims explicit in propositional form.
 - Introduce analytic resources (possible worlds, quantified modal logic, theories of reference, metaphysics of persons) to resolve puzzles.
 - Distinguish levels (doctrinal formulation, metaphysical grounding, linguistic expression).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas (used as doctrinal touchstones).
 - Modern and contemporary interlocutors: classicists in analytic philosophy of religion (e.g., Plantinga, Swinburne), advocates of continental or confessional methods (e.g., Barth) as foil.
 - Employs contemporary metaphysics, logic, and philosophy of language as tools.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, divine simplicity, omniscience and foreknowledge, divine timelessness vs. temporality, providence and freedom, incarnation and Christology, atonement, revelation and epistemology of faith.
- **Closing line**
 - Programmatically, the volume stakes a claim: careful analytic work can conserve doctrinal fidelity while increasing clarity, argumentative accountability, and interdisciplinary engagement in Christian theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes formal clarity and explicit premise-structure in theological argumentation.
 - Emphasizes model-building: theology as theorizing that produces metaphysical or semantic models which can be evaluated.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with purely historical or exegetical approaches by privileging logical coherence and metaphysical articulation.
 - Pushes back against the caricature that analytic philosophy is antitheological; instead frames it as a method for robustly defending confessional claims.
 - Differentiates itself from philosophy of religion that treats religious belief as raw data; analytic theology aims to do systematic constructive work.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of analytic resources (possible‑worlds semantics, temporality theories, formal epistemology) to traditional dogmatic loci.
 - Clear articulation of levels of theological discourse (doctrinal, metaphysical, linguistic).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in anglophone evangelical and Reformed academic contexts; helped institutionalize "analytic theology" as a recognizable subfield.
 - Stimulated both uptake (courses, journals, follow-up volumes) and critique (accusations of reductionism, neglect of historical/ pastoral dimensions).
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a methodological manifesto and as a toolkit for graduate instruction in systematic theology and philosophy of religion.
 - Valuable for clarifying debates where ambiguity has obscured doctrinal disagreement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analytic theology**
 - Use: methodological label; the project of doing theology with analytic philosophy tools without conceding confessional commitments.
- **Model-building**
 - Use: constructing metaphysical or semantic frameworks to capture doctrines (e.g., models of Trinity, divine simplicity).
- **Conceptual analysis**
 - Use: dissecting theological terms (person, nature, will, omniscience) into clearer components for argument.
- **Divine simplicity**
 - Use: reinterpreted via analytic metaphysics to avoid paradoxes while preserving classical theism.
- **Timelessness vs. temporality (eternity, everlastingness)**
 - Use: analytic treatments contrast tenseless (timeless) and tensed (everlasting) models for God and explore implications for providence and prayer.
- **Omniscience & counterfactuals**
 - Use: debates about God's knowledge of future free actions; employs possible‑worlds semantics and theories of counterfactuals.
- **Trinitarian relations (social vs. classical models)**
 - Use: analytic scrutiny of personhood, relationality, and unity; assesses social trinitarianism and classical relational accounts.
- **Incarnation / hypostatic union**
 - Use: metaphysical articulation of two natures in one person using analytic metaphysics of persons and properties.
- **Providence & divine action**
 - Use: models of concurrence, secondary causation, and theodicy analyzed with modal and causal frameworks.
- **Revelation (propositional vs. non‑propositional)**
 - Use: analytic epistemology clarifies how belief formation, testimony, and propositional content function in revelation.
- **Possible worlds semantics**
 - Use: tool for discussing modality, omnipotence, and counterfactual knowledge.
- **Formal epistemology**
 - Use: used to assess warrant, religious epistemic practices, and sensus divinitatis claims.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for the methodological program "analytic theology."
 - As a **polemic** in methodological debates (arguing for analytic methods against perceived vagueness).
 - As a **conceptual pivot/exegetical model** when scholars import its clarity-demanding techniques into doctrine-specific scholarship (Trinity, providence, Christology).
