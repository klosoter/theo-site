### TITLE
Theological Essays (essays on revelation and analogy) - Eberhard Jüngel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-century post-war German Lutheran theology; Jüngel writing in the aftermath of Barthian renewal, dialoguing with Thomistic scholasticism, modern philosophy (Kant, Heidegger), and Protestant hermeneutics. Essays often address tensions between natural theology and revelation theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Theology must base predication of God on God's self-revelation (analogia fidei), not on a presumed ontological continuity between God and creature (analogia entis). Preserving divine freedom and the priority of revelation avoids grounding God in the creature and prevents idolatrous knowledge.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reject or diagnostically limit analogia entis as a theological foundation because it presupposes an ontological bridge from creature to Creator that compromises transcendence.
 - Affirm an analogia fidei: theological speech is structurally governed by the event of God's self-disclosure in Christ - human language of God is derivative, responsive, and trustworthy only insofar as it is anchored in revelation and faith.
 - Rework analogy as an event of communication (Sprachereignis): analogy is not ontic resemblance but a communicative, theological-missional correlation whereby God's names and actions authorize predication.
 - Emphasize Christocentrism: Christ is the decisive medium of revelation and the hermeneutical key for speaking about God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth (proximal interlocutor and corrective), Thomas Aquinas (primary target for analogia entis), Luther and Lutheran confessional tradition, modern philosophers (for language theory), contemporary Protestant systematicians.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Offenbarung), doctrine of God (theology proper), Christology (as locus of revelation), theological method (analogy, predication), issues touching on natural theology and theological anthropology.
- **Closing line:** Theology's truthfulness resides in being shaped by the God-who-reveals (Christ), so analogy in theology must be redefined as fidelity to revelation (analogia fidei), safeguarding divine freedom against any creaturely foundation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats analogy primarily as a linguistic-communicative event rather than a metaphysical relation of similarity.
 - Stresses the existential and Christological priority of revelation: faith mediates the possibility of speaking truthfully about God.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects Thomistic analogia entis by arguing it tends to domesticate God and collapse divine transcendence into creaturely categories.
 - Nuances Barth: while Barth radicalized the priority of revelation, Jüngel supplies a positive account of analogy (rather than mere negation) anchored in faith and speech.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting analogy as "analogy of faith" with an emphasis on the event-character of divine speech (Sprachereignis) and the authority of God's names as given in revelation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in contemporary Lutheran and broader Protestant debates on natural theology and theological method.
 - Stimulated renewed attention to the legitimacy and limits of natural theology, and to Christ-centered hermeneutics of doctrine.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a disciplined model for thinking about theological language, useful in courses on doctrine of God, revelation, and theological method.
 - Helps students navigate the tension between revelation's priority and the intelligibility of theological claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis:** The medieval/Thomistic doctrine that creaturely being analogously reflects divine being; critiqued by Jüngel for risking idolatry by grounding God in the creature.
- **Analogia fidei:** Jüngel's preferred principle: analogy grounded in faithfulness to God's revealed self, making theological predication derivative of revelation.
- **Revelation (Offenbarung):** The decisive, Christ-centered event that authorizes all true speech about God.
- **Divine freedom (Gottesfreiheit):** Emphasized to prevent God being reduced to a term derived from creatures; God's self-determination undergirds revelation.
- **Sprachereignis (language-event):** The notion that God's speaking is an event enabling analogical predication-analogy as communicative occurrence rather than ontological ratio.
- **Predication of God (Gottesprädikation):** How theological language ascribes names and attributes to God; valid only insofar as rooted in revelation.
- **Transcendence / Immanence:** Jüngel preserves a guarded balance-God remains transcendent, yet reliably known in the immanent event of revelation in Christ.
- **Christocentrism:** The insistence that Christ is the hermeneutical key and norm for all theological statements about God.
- **Natural theology:** Treated critically insofar as it claims access to God via creaturely being; Jüngel allows limited theological reflection but resists natural theology as substitute for revelation.
- **Theology as speech about God:** Theology is a responsive, faith-shaped discourse, not speculative metaphysics about a divinely hidden essence.
- **Correlation:** Human theological question and divine answer are held in a relation, but with revelation determining the shape of the answer.
- **Authority of divine names:** God's self-naming in Scripture/Christ grants legitimacy to theological language.
- **Idolatry (epistemic risk):** The danger when creaturely concepts are elevated to foundational status for knowledge of God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological pivot** in doctrine of God courses to teach limits of natural theology and the primacy of revelation.
- As a **polemic resource** against Thomistic analogia entis in ecumenical and Protestant-theological debates.
- As a **conceptual model** for Christ-centered hermeneutics in systematic theology and theological epistemology.
