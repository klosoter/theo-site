### TITLE
**Augustine, Sermones (Selected Sermons): Pastoral Theology for the Totus Christus**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late antique North Africa (c. 395-430), chiefly Hippo Regius. Preached in a Catholic community amid schisms (Donatists), moral rigorism, Manichaean residue, emerging Pelagian controversy, and ongoing anti-Arian orthodoxy. Liturgical calendar, catechumenate, and civic festivals shape occasions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How the humble incarnate Christ gathers, heals, and orders a mixed church through Word and Sacrament by the Spirit, unto love and the heavenly city. Pastoral application of Nicene faith to a concrete, divided people.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scripture proclaimed under the **regula fidei**; Christ interprets Scripture, Scripture forms Christ s body.
 - **Humility of the Mediator**: from form of God to form of servant, curing pride; imitation grounded in grace, not Pelagian striving.
 - **Totus Christus**: Head and Body; sacraments make and manifest ecclesial unity.
 - **Sacraments as signs and things**: visible signs confer the invisible grace promised by God, Christ as the true minister.
 - **Spirit and charity**: the Spirit as Gift binds a corpus permixtum in peace and discipline toward eschatological rest.
 - **Pilgrim eschatology**: hope endures amid temporal ambiguities; justice is imperfect until judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture (Old Latin text), Ambrose, Hilary; the seven rules of Tyconius for ecclesial exegesis; opponents include Donatists (efficacy and unity), Pelagians (grace and will), Manichaeans (creation and Christology), Arians (Trinity and Christ s deity).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and exegesis; Trinity and missions; Christology (two natures, mediation, deification by adoption); Pneumatology (Gift, Love, bond of unity); Church and sacraments (baptism, Eucharist, discipline); grace and will; covenant continuity; eschatology (pilgrimage, judgment, resurrection).
- **Closing line:** The sermons press hearers to become what they receive: by the Spirit s gift, the people are knit into Christ, the humble Head, as one Body on pilgrimage to the eternal Sabbath.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Totus Christus** (Head and Body) governing exegesis and ecclesiology.
 - **O sacrament of piety, sign of unity, bond of charity**; and Behold what you are; become what you receive (Eucharistic identity).
 - **Christus baptizat**: Christ, not the human minister, is the efficacious agent in baptism.
 - **Humilitas Christi** as the medicine for pride; imitation flows from infusion of charity.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Donatism**: sacramental validity does not depend on ministerial worthiness; the church is a **corpus permixtum** until judgment.
 - Against **Pelagianism**: prevenient and assisting grace heals the will; infants need baptism.
 - Against **Arianism**: coequality of Son and Spirit; missions reveal processions; inseparable operations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Signum / res** and **sacramentum / res** distinctions underpinning sacramental realism without crude materialism.
 - **Trinitarian missions** as hermeneutic of divine action; Spirit as **Donum** and **Caritas**.
 - Covenantal dictum: old and new sacraments differ in signs; the one saving **res** is Christ.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Medieval sacramental theology (Lombard, Aquinas) and Western **Filioque** grammar lean on Augustinian lines found in preaching.
 - Reformed retrieval: Calvin and others cite Augustine on signs, mixed church, grace, covenant continuity, and spiritual presence in the Supper.
 - Pastoral models of discipline, catechesis, and mystagogy; ecumenical resonance on unity and charity.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Integrates exegesis, doctrine, and cure of souls.
 - Supplies quotable, durable formulations for Trinity, Christ, church, sacraments, and grace.
 - Offers a realistic ecclesiology fit for mission in a contested public square.

### KEY TERMS & USES
