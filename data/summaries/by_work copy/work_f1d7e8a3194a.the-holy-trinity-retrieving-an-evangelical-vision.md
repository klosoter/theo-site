### TITLE
The Holy Trinity: Retrieving an Evangelical Vision - Matthew Levering

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century retrievalist project addressed to evangelical readership and wider ecumenical conversation.
 - Works within a broadly catholic-patristic framework while explicitly addressing weaknesses in contemporary evangelical Trinitarian theology.
 - Responds to post-Enlightenment tendencies (anti-metaphysical, functionalist, or therapeutic accounts of God) and to various modern models (social-Trinity trends, Barthian emphases, etc.).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelical theology needs a renewed, classical Trinitarian doctrine: not merely an economic framework for salvation history but an ontological account grounding worship, Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology.
 - Recovering classical categories (immanent vs. economic Trinity, procession, perichoresis, monarchy of the Father) will correct distortions and re-shape evangelical practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical grounding: NT texts display a Trinitarian pattern that requires both economic and immanent theological reflection.
 - Historical retrieval: recovery of patristic (Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine) and scholastic formulations to supply conceptual resources evangelicals have often set aside.
 - Systematic synthesis: integrate biblical, historical, and metaphysical insights to present a coherent Trinitarian theology that bears on worship, mission, sacraments, and Christian identity.
 - Practical implications: show how a robust Trinity reorients preaching, prayer, ecclesial life, and moral formation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy appeal to the Cappadocians and Augustine; conversation with medieval scholasticism and Reformation doctrinal statements.
 - Engages contemporary Protestant and Catholic theologians-both constructive interlocutors and critics (broadly Barthian, Rahnerian, and recent evangelical trajectories).
 - Uses biblical exegesis of key Pauline and Johannine passages as primary evidence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), Christology, revelation, soteriology, ecclesiology, worship and the sacraments, doctrine of God (attributes, relations), theological method (retrieval).

- **Closing line**
 - A programmatic call to make classical Trinitarian orthodoxy the organizing center for evangelical theology and praxis, restoring theological depth and ecclesial formation grounded in the God who is communion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that Trinitarian doctrine is not peripheral but central to all loci of theology-worship, mission, ethics, and pastoral life.
 - Strong retrieval method: using patristic metaphysics and classical categories to rehabilitate evangelical theology without abandoning evangelicals' Scriptural commitments.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects evangelical tendencies toward a merely "economic" or functional Trinity that treats Trinitarian language as shorthand for divine activity rather than as statements about God's being.
 - Challenges certain "social-Trinity" popularizations that risk atomizing the divine persons or making relations purely sociological.
 - Offers a mediating position between Barthian anti-metaphysical moves and overly speculative metaphysics by grounding metaphysical claims in Scripture and reception.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframing "retrieval" as both historicist and constructive: retrieving classical terms (perichoresis, procession, monarchy) with renewed pastoral and doctrinal application for evangelicals.
 - Emphasizes relational ontology (persons defined by relations of origin and procession) without capitulating to contemporary sociological analogies.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Attracts interest across confessional lines: used by some evangelical scholars seeking richer Trinitarian grammar and by Catholic/Orthodox readers as a commendation of classical formulations.
 - Cited in seminary curricula and ecumenical discussions as a corrective resource for underdeveloped Trinitarian theology in evangelical contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, historically informed, and pastorally attuned model for retrieving Trinitarian orthodoxy; valuable for doctrine courses, preaching formation, and ecumenical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God is in himself (relations of origin, eternal realities).
- **Economic Trinity** - God as revealed in history and salvation (works of Father, Son, Spirit).
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling of the divine persons; grounding of communion-language.
- **Hypostasis / Person** - The persons of the Trinity distinguished by relations, not by separable centers of being.
- **Ousia / Substance** - Divine unity; consubstantiality of Father, Son, and Spirit.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - Classical affirmation of the Father as source within the Trinity (ordered relations without subordination of nature).
- **Eternal generation / Procession** - The Son's generation and the Spirit's procession as central relational doctrines.
- **Social-Trinity (critique)** - The modern model that likens divine persons to human sociality; Levering problematizes its limits.
- **Modalism / Subordinationism (errors)** - Historical mistakes Levering diagnoses and corrects in contemporary formulations.
- **Retrieval (method)** - Recovering patristic and classical categories to renew evangelical theology.
- **Biblical exegesis (Trinitarian readings)** - Use of Pauline and Johannine texts to justify both economic and ontological claims.
- **Trinitarian worship** - Practical outcome: worship structured by Trinitarian doxology and liturgical practice.
- **Trinitarian soteriology/Christology** - How mutual relations of persons inform work of redemption and identity of Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Trinitarian categories in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist evangelical accounts and certain modern social-Trinity caricatures.
 - As a **model for exegetical reading** of NT trinitarian passages linking text to historical doctrine.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** to bring doctrine into liturgy, preaching, and ecclesial formation.
