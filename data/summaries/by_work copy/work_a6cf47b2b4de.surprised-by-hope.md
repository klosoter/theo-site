### TITLE
**Surprised by Hope** - N. T. Wright (SPCK 2007; HarperOne 2008)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century Anglophone Christianity, amid secular disenchantment and popular rapture theology. Aimed at correcting funeral practice, preaching, and discipleship shaped by disembodied heaven and privatized salvation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian hope centers on the bodily resurrection and the renewal of creation, not the evacuation of souls to heaven. Easter inaugurates God's new creation, which the Spirit applies now and consummates at Christ's parousia.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Diagnosis:** Western churches have absorbed Platonism (soul-escape), moralism (shrunk salvation), and pagan eschatologies (nihilism). This distorts mission, ethics, and worship.
 - **Biblical case:** OT hope (Isa 65-66; Dan 12), Jewish resurrection expectation, Jesus's bodily resurrection (Gospels), and Paul's argument (1 Cor 15; Rom 8) ground a future of bodily life within a renewed cosmos; Revelation 21-22 completes the picture.
 - **Intermediate vs final state:** Distinguishes paradise (conscious rest with Christ) from final resurrection and new creation - life after life after death.
 - **Parousia and judgment:** Parousia is royal appearing to set the world to rights; no secret rapture. Judgment is good news, the vindication and rectification of creation.
 - **Spirit and church:** The Spirit as firstfruits/arrabon empowers present participation in God's future through holiness, justice, beauty, evangelism, and sacramental life.
 - **Ethics and culture:** What we do in the Lord is not in vain; work done in Christ is taken up into God's future. Hope fuels robust public discipleship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Second Temple Judaism; Paul, John; critique of Dante-influenced imagery, popular dispensationalism (Scofield/Left Behind), and liberal demythologizing. Pastoral liturgies and hymnody scrutinized.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (resurrection, parousia, judgment, new creation), anthropology/creation (human vocation, embodied good), sin and death (the last enemy), pneumatology (Spirit as firstfruits), ecclesiology and mission, Scripture's narrative authority (biblical theology over abstract systematics).
- **Closing line:** God will do for the whole creation what he did for Jesus on Easter, and by the Spirit the church anticipates that future in the present.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Life after life after death** as the pastoral and doctrinal hinge.
 - Strong **anti-Platonic** insistence on bodily, earthy hope; continuity-with-transformation of creation.
 - **Missional telos:** present work "in the Lord" is not wasted; sacraments as signs of the future.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against rapture/evacuation eschatology; against universalized disembodied heaven.
 - Against reducing resurrection to metaphor; insists on historical, bodily Easter.
 - Reframes hell as final dehumanization/exclusion rather than divine sadism; judgment as restorative justice.
 - Prefers **biblical-theological** narrative to proof-texted systematics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinction between **intermediate state** and **final resurrection**.
 - **Parousia** as royal appearing; **putting the world to rights** for justification/judgment motif.
 - **Building for** (not building) the kingdom; Spirit as **arrabon/firstfruits**.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used across evangelical and mainline contexts for preaching, catechesis, and funeral reform.
 - Some critique from Reformed and confessional readers on hell and continuity language, yet broad uptake of new-creation emphasis.
- **Enduring value:** A clear, pastorally potent re-centering of Christian hope; exegetically serviceable on 1 Cor 15, Rom 8, Rev 21-22; shapes ethics, worship, and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection of the body:** Central eschatological claim; grounds Christian anthropology against dualism.
- **New heavens and new earth:** Final state as renewed creation; continuity/discontinuity model (1 Cor 15; Rev 21-22).
- **Intermediate state (paradise):** Conscious rest with Christ prior to resurrection; not the final goal.
- **Life after life after death:** Memorable shorthand distinguishing final hope from immediate postmortem bliss.
- **Parousia (royal appearing):** Christ's return to judge and renew; no secret rapture or cosmic abandonment.
- **Judgment/putting to rights:** God's vindicating justice; hope for the oppressed; criterion tied to union with Christ.
- **Hell as dehumanization:** Persistent resistance to God culminating in exclusion; cautions against lurid literalism.
- **Inaugurated eschatology (already/not yet):** Easter launched new creation; consummation awaits.
- **Spirit as firstfruits/arrabon (Rom 8:11,23):** Pledge and power of the future now; shapes sanctification and mission.
- **Biblical theology vs systematics:** Narrative, covenantal exegesis sets the frame; resists abstracted categories.
- **Human vocation/image-bearing:** Creation good; resurrection restores priestly-royal stewardship of the world.
- **Sin and death:** Death as the last enemy; sin as idolatry corrupting vocation and creation.
- **Delay of the parousia:** Space for mission; God's patience; church embodies future in the present.
- **Romans 11 (Israel's future):** Brief acknowledgment of God's covenant faithfulness and eventual inclusion, set within the larger new-creation horizon.
- **Christ and culture:** Work, art, justice "in the Lord" participate in and anticipate the kingdom.
- **How the work is used:**
 - **Definition source** for resurrection/new creation and the intermediate state.
 - **Polemic** against rapture/escapism and disembodied-heaven preaching.
 - **Exegetical model** for 1 Cor 15, Rom 8, Rev 21-22; pastoral application for funerals and mission.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking pneumatology, ecclesiology, and ethics to eschatology.
