### TITLE
The Robot Will See You Now? Artificial Intelligence And The Christian Faith - John Wyatt

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary moment (late 2010s-2020s): rapid advances in machine learning, deep learning, increasing deployment of AI in healthcare, pastoral care, and decision-making.
 - Written from the perspective of a practitioner-theologian (medical/ethical background) addressing Christians, healthcare professionals, and church leaders.
 - Intersects bioethics, theology of technology, and public Christian engagement with scientific innovation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian faith must critically appropriate AI: neither technophobic rejection nor naïvely celebratory assimilation.
 - Theologically informed ethics should shape AI design, adoption, and governance, especially where human dignity, pastoral presence, and caring professions are at stake.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: AI brings genuine benefits (diagnosis, triage, data analysis) but poses moral risks (depersonalization, bias, accountability gaps).
 - Theological resources: invocation of creation, imago Dei, incarnation, and sin to frame normative commitments for AI.
 - Practical prescriptions: guidelines for human-in-the-loop, safeguards for vulnerable persons, policy recommendations for transparency and stewardship.
 - Pastoral reflection: limits of algorithmic care; reaffirmation of embodied, relational, sacramental ministry.
 - Futures and warning: critique of transhumanist hopes for autonomy-displacing technologies; call for Christian discernment and participation in public debate.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary AI ethics discourse (algorithmic bias, accountability, automation of care).
 - Dialogues with technologists, clinicians, policymakers, and ethicists; interlocutors include secular AI commentators and Christian ethicists.
 - Draws on biblical, patristic, and Reformation resources to ground normative claims; occasional engagement with philosophers of technology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (imago Dei, personhood, vulnerability)
 - **Christology & Incarnation** (model for embodied, relational care)
 - **Creation & Providence** (technology as stewardship vs. mastery)
 - **Ethics and Sin** (power, idolatry of efficiency, structures of injustice)
 - **Eschatology** (limits of technocratic salvation; hope grounded in Christ)

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - AI is a powerful tool that must be shaped by a Christian vision of human dignity, embodied presence, and communal responsibility rather than allowed to redefine what it means to be human.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong practical focus on AI in clinical and pastoral contexts - not only abstract ethics but bedside consequences.
 - Emphasizes **embodiment and relational presence** as non-negotiable theological claims that constrain AI adoption in care.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Counters both techno-utopianism (transhumanist salvation narratives) and simplistic Luddism by providing a mediating, theologically robust ethic.
 - Challenges secular AI ethics that reduce concerns to privacy and safety without theological anthropology as horizon.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Proposes operational distinctions such as **"human-in-the-loop" vs "human-on-the-loop"** in pastoral care, and reframes algorithmic outputs as **"epistemic aids"** rather than replacements for moral agency.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable for church bodies engaging tech policy and health institutions seeking faith-based ethical frameworks.
 - Cited across Christian bioethical conversations; used in seminary modules on technology and ministry.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model: apply core theological doctrines (imago Dei, incarnation, sin) to concrete technological questions.
 - Serves as a bridge between practitioners (clinicians, pastors) and theological ethicists for ongoing interdisciplinary work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - computational systems performing tasks that normally require human intelligence; treated as tool, not person.
- **Machine learning (ML)** - data-driven pattern recognition; highlighted for opaque decision-making and bias transmission.
- **Imago Dei** - foundational normative category used to defend human dignity against reduction to data points or efficiency metrics.
- **Embodiment** - theological thesis (incarnation) used to argue care requires bodily presence, touch, and narrative attunement.
- **Human-in-the-loop / Human-on-the-loop** - operational distinctions for moral responsibility and oversight in automated systems.
- **Algorithmic bias** - discriminatory outcomes embedded in data/models; a moral and ecclesial concern for justice.
- **Accountability & transparency** - governance terms pressed into theological service: creation care of institutions requires openness and responsibility.
- **Pastoral presence** - contrasted with remote, algorithmic interaction; a criterion for evaluating AI in ministry contexts.
- **Transhumanism** - critiqued as a quasi-salvific technicism that overlooks sin, communality, and embodied hope.
- **Stewardship** - frames Christian duties regarding innovation, resource allocation, and tech policy.
- **Epistemic aid** - term for AI outputs as contributory to human judgment, not definitive moral agents.
- **Vulnerability** - theological lens for prioritizing the weak in design and deployment of AI (healthcare, elderly, disabled).
- **Sacramental/relational care** - used to mark dimensions of human life not replicable by automation.
- **Common grace vs. idolatry of technology** - twin theological motifs for affirming benefits while resisting deification of tech.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for theologically informed distinctions (e.g., human-in/on-the-loop) in Christian ethics syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against techno-utopian narratives in church statements and synodal deliberations on healthcare policy.
 - As a **practical model** for hospital chaplaincy and pastoral training, shaping protocols where AI tools assist but do not replace relational care.
