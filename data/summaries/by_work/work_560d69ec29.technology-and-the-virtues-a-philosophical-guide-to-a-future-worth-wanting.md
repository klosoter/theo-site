### TITLE
**Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting** 
Shannon Vallor. Oxford University Press, 2016.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2016 amid rapid rise of AI, pervasive social media, and smartphone-mediated life. Situated within the contemporary revival of virtue ethics and interdisciplinary tech ethics.
 - Audience: philosophers, ethicists, policy-makers, designers, and moral educators; increasingly cited in theological ethics and practical theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Technologies shape moral habits and capacities; therefore ethical response must focus on cultivating durable, practice-based "technomoral virtues" capable of guiding individual and collective action toward a genuinely desirable future.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: contemporary technologies (AI, persuasion algorithms, surveillance, automation, social platforms) cause **moral deskilling**, attenuate attention, and redistribute moral responsibility.
 - Theoretical move: classical virtue ethics (Aristotelian, Confucian, and other traditions) supplies the best resources to address character formation under technological conditions.
 - Normative move: Vallor articulates a set of **technomoral virtues** and practical strategies (education, professional formation, technology design, public policy) for cultivating them.
 - Concluding move: moral practice must be institutionalized across practices (schools, workplaces, designers' cultures) to sustain a "future worth wanting."

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Aristotle, Confucian thought, Buddhist practice; engagement with modern virtue ethicists (Alasdair MacIntyre, Rosalind Hursthouse).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: philosophers of technology and computer scientists; case studies drawn from social media, robotics, AI, and bioethics.
 - Contrasts with utilitarian/consequentialist and deontological approaches dominant in tech policy debates.

- **Doctrines treated (theological relevance)**
 - Not a confessional theology, but strongly relevant to:
 - **Moral anthropology** (what it means to be a virtuous human amid technological mediation).
 - **Stewardship and vocation** (technology as domain for cultivated care and accountability).
 - Formation-related doctrines (virtue, habit, character, pastoral formation) and implications for ecclesial practices that form persons.
 - Indirect implications for sin, grace, and communal responsibility as questions about structural moral corruption and repair.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Vallor issues a practical call for disciplined moral formation-an ethic of embodied habit and institutional cultivation-that reclaims human flourishing in a world where technology increasingly shapes who we become.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats technology first as a moral ecology that forms character, not merely as an instrument to be regulated for outcomes.
 - Emphasizes habit, exemplars, and practices (formation) over rules or cost-benefit calculations.
 - Interdisciplinary synthesis: philosophy, social science, design ethics, and case studies of real technologies.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters techno-optimist narratives that assume moral progress will follow technical progress.
 - Opposes purely regulatory or consequentialist approaches that ignore character and formation.
 - Offers a corrective to some virtue-ethical readings that remain too abstract by supplying concrete practices and institutional levers.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Technomoral virtues" - virtues specifically articulated to meet moral demands of technological life.
 - Emphasis on "moral deskilling" and "moral habituation" as analytic categories for understanding ethical erosion.
 - Focus on "exemplar-based" moral pedagogy for designers and professionals.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in secular tech ethics, human-computer interaction, and ethics-of-AI literatures.
 - Increasing uptake in theological ethics and practical theology as a resource for Christian virtue-centered responses to technology.
 - Critiques from some quarters: underplays structural political-economic causes and global inequality in technological impact.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable framework for integrating virtue theory into applied tech ethics and pastoral formation.
 - Practical handbook for educators, designers, and faith communities seeking formation strategies.
 - Provokes sustained debate about individual vs. structural responsibility in moral responses to technology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technomoral virtue**
 - Virtues reconceived to meet ethical challenges produced by technology; the book names and defends a set adapted from classical lists.

- **Moral deskilling**
 - Loss or erosion of moral capacities (attention, deliberation, patience) due to technology-mediated habits.

- **Moral habituation**
 - Formation of character through repeated practices and institutionalized routines; central to Vallor's pedagogical proposals.

- **Moral ecology**
 - The network of tools, social practices, institutions, and designs that shape moral capacities.

- **Exemplar-based formation**
 - Learning virtue through exemplars and mentoring within professional and communal practices.

- **Practice-sensitive ethics**
 - Ethical analysis grounded in concrete practices of technology design, deployment, and everyday use.

- **Attention / attentional virtue**
 - Attention as a fragile and crucial capacity under threat from persuasive technologies; cultivating attentional discipline is key.

- **Collective responsibility**
 - Shifts focus from isolated individual action to shared institutional and design responsibilities.

- **Design ethics / virtue-sensitive design**
 - Integrating virtue cultivation into the engineering and design of technologies.

- **Moral repair**
 - Institutional and communal processes for restoring degraded moral capacities and relationships.

- **Future worth wanting**
 - A normative horizon that blends human flourishing with technological possibility; not utopian but aspirational and practical.

- **Practical pedagogy**
 - Concrete curricular and institutional recommendations for moral formation in schools, professions, and congregations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "technomoral virtue" and analytic terms (moral deskilling, moral ecology) in both secular and theological ethics. 
- As a **polemic and corrective** against purely consequentialist or regulatory tech ethics, supporting formation-centered and design-sensitive responses. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and programs on ethics of technology, pastoral formation, and vocational training for designers and technologists.
