### TITLE
**Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans** (Anonymous; composite Reformed usage)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated within the confessional Reformed exegetical tradition, drawing on Augustinian soteriology and covenant theology.
 - Reads Paul against OT canon, Second Temple Jewish background, and early-modern debates (Pelagian, Tridentine), while aware of recent discussions (New Perspective, apocalyptic Paul).
 - Pastoral-academic purpose: to anchor preaching, catechesis, and doctrinal synthesis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Romans unfolds the righteousness of God revealed in the gospel: God justifies the ungodly by faith in Christ apart from works of law, gathers Jew and Gentile into one covenant people, and by the Spirit effects new obedience, all to vindicate God's faithfulness to his promises.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - 1:1-17: Thesis of the letter; the gospel as God's power; obedience of faith; righteousness of God revealed.
 - 1:18-3:20: Universal sin and liability under God's wrath; law's true function to expose sin.
 - 3:21-4:25: Justification by faith apart from works; Abraham as exemplar; Christ's propitiatory death; imputation language.
 - 5:1-21: Peace, hope, and federal headship; Adam-Christ typology; covenantal framing of law and grace.
 - 6:1-7:25: Union with Christ in death and resurrection; baptismal identity; liberation from sin and law's condemning power without antinomian license.
 - 8:1-39: Life in the Spirit; adoption, perseverance, and unbreakable love; golden chain as ordo salutis anchored in divine purpose.
 - 9:1-11:36: God's freedom and faithfulness; election, hardening, vessels of mercy; grafting of Gentiles; hope for Israel; doxological climax.
 - 12:1-15:13: Living sacrifice; renewed mind; love fulfilling the law; weak/strong conscience; mission to the nations.
 - 15:14-16:27: Apostolic mission strategy; fellowship and greetings; stability of the gospel.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Canonical OT (Torah, Prophets, Psalms), Jewish wisdom tradition; Greco-Roman diatribe style.
 - Augustine on grace and original sin; Reformation-era readings (Luther, Calvin) on justification; federal theology on covenant heads.
 - Modern interlocutors: Roman Catholic accounts of infused righteousness; Arminian/synergist appeals to foreseen faith; New Perspective emphasis on covenantal nomism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology (revelation, inspiration, intertextuality); Theology Proper (righteousness, mercy, wrath, providence); Christology (last Adam, atonement); Pneumatology (indwelling, adoption); Anthropology (sin, conscience); Soteriology (justification, union, sanctification, election, assurance); Covenant Theology (works/grace/new covenant); Ecclesiology and ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: God's covenant faithfulness in Christ, creating and preserving a Spirit-filled people by grace through faith, for the praise of his glory among the nations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Holds together forensic justification and participatory union with Christ without confusion.
 - Reads Romans covenantally: Adam-to-Christ, law-to-grace, Israel-to-nations, culminating in one renewed family.
 - Strong account of the Spirit in assurance and obedience; the third use of the law under grace.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against legalism and antinomianism: law exposes sin and guides sanctified life, but does not justify.
 - Against reducing justification to boundary markers: insists on imputation and courtroom verdict alongside ecclesial inclusion.
 - Affirms unconditional election over synergist or foreknowledge-only schemes; rejects universalism while upholding mercy's breadth.
 - Nuances law-gospel: distinguishes Mosaic covenant as administration and the abiding moral law.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies righteousness of God as God's saving faithfulness effecting and imputing righteousness in Christ.
 - Federal headship as exegetical key to Romans 5; covenant of works/grace as theological scaffolding.
 - Obedience of faith as faith's responsive fidelity produced by grace, not meritorious cause.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Serves as a standard Reformed lens for catechesis, confessional proof-texting, and preaching.
 - Engages broader Protestant and Catholic debates; provides shared exegetical ground while marking confessional boundaries.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of theological exegesis marrying close text work with dogmatic clarity.
 - Pedagogically maps the whole counsel of God from guilt to grace to gratitude.
 - Stable anchor for ongoing discussions on justification, Israel-church relations, and ethical formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Righteousness of God**: God's covenantal saving action and the status granted in Christ; both theodicy and gift.
