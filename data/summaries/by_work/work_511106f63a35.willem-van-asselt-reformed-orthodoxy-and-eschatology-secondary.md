### TITLE
Willem van Asselt, "Reformed Orthodoxy and Eschatology" - reading Francis Turretin (secondary treatment)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Modern historical-theological study by Willem van Asselt surveying Reformed orthodox treatments of last things; focuses on the learned, scholastic milieu of the Reformed churches (roughly 16th-18th centuries).
 - Principal historical actor in the case study: **Francis Turretin (17th century)**, Geneva/Academia reformata, representative of high Reformed scholasticism reacting to post-Reformation controversies (Arminianism, chiliasm, Cartesianism).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Van Asselt argues that Reformed orthodoxy-as exemplified by Turretin-held an **inaugurated but not exhausted** eschatology: many blessings are already realized in Christ and his sacraments, yet a robust, literal future consummation (bodily resurrection, final judgment, new heavens/earth) is doctrinally indispensable.
 - The essay intervenes in the modern debate between **realized** and **future** eschatologies by showing how scholastic theologians balanced both poles.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical sketch: surveys key Reformed orthodox texts and controversies over millennium, resurrection, and last things.
 - Doctrinal reading of Turretin: reconstructs his modal distinctions (already/not yet), his use of typology and covenant theology, and his safeguards against spiritualizing and chiliasm.
 - Assessment: contends that Turretin's method serves as a principled middle way-protecting literal future hope while allowing sacramental and present participatory realities.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Turretin (Institutes, disputations).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Voetius, Gomarus, certain anti-chiliasts; modern interpreters emphasizing either realized eschatology or futurity.
 - Scriptural engagement: normative appeals to NT eschatological texts (Pauline resurrection passages, Revelation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (already/not yet), resurrection (bodily), final judgment, millennium/chiliasm.
 - Connected loci: Christology (two comings), covenant theology (continuity/fulfillment), sacramentology (signs as foretaste), anthropology (intermediate state).
- **Closing line**
 - Van Asselt reads Turretin as a disciplined Reformed orthodoxy that affirms **inauguration and participation in eschatological realities through Christ and the sacraments while unwaveringly insisting on a future, bodily consummation** as the anchor of Christian hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stress on method: clear distinction between **present participation** (what believers have now) and **future possession** (what awaits); careful terminological precision typical of scholastic disputation.
 - Use of covenantal logic to secure both continuity (type/antitype) and discontinuity (final consummation).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against two modern extremes:
 - **Excessive realized eschatology** that spiritualizes away bodily resurrection and final judgment.
 - **Chiliasm/enthusiastic literalism** that reads millennium speculation into creed-level doctrine.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic integration of sacramental "foretaste" with eschatological consummation-sacraments are not mere signs but real participations pointing forward.
 - Refined use of "consummation" terminology to demarcate degrees of fulfillment.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Van Asselt's reading has shaped recent historiography by rehabilitating Reformed scholastic nuance for contemporary eschatological debates.
 - Turretin's position remains influential in conservative Reformed seminaries as a model of balancing realism and futurity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a historically informed template for pastors and theologians who wish to hold together present assurance and future expectation without capitulating to reductionism or speculative mania.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - the idea that the kingdom has begun in Christ; many gifts are already given.
- **Future eschatology** - the affirmative insistence on an ultimate, bodily consummation (resurrection, renewed creation).
- **Realized eschatology** - tendency to treat eschatological promises as already fully present (critically assessed by Van Asselt).
- **Consummation** - final completion of redemptive history; Turretin emphasizes its objective and bodily nature.
- **Second Coming (Parousia)** - central eschatological event; both imminent expectation and promised guarantee of final judgment.
- **Resurrection (bodily)** - non-negotiable in Turretin: bodily, universal, and integral to soteriology and final justice.
- **Last Judgment** - public, objective adjudication; secures moral seriousness of history and divine justice.
- **Millennium / Chiliasm** - historic speculative doctrine; Turretin and Van Asselt oppose its elevation to necessary orthodoxy.
- **Intermediate state** - conscious, non-final state of departed souls pending resurrection; carefully defined.
- **Typology / Fulfillment** - Old Covenant types prefigure New Covenant fulfillment; key to explaining present participations.
- **Sacramental foretaste** - sacraments confer real, signified participation in eschatological blessings without replacing the future consummation.
- **Covenantal continuity** - continuity of God's redemptive plan across ages; supports both already and not-yet claims.
- **Spiritualizing** - criticized method that reduces bodily promises to moral/spiritual allegory.
- **Literal sense** - defense of a robust literal future sense for key eschatological promises.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed orthodox positions on last things (clarifies terms and distinctions).
 - As a **polemic instrument** against both extreme realized eschatology and speculative chiliasm.
 - As an **exegetical-model resource** showing how typology + literal sense can cohere in sermon and systematic theology.
