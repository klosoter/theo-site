### TITLE
Discussions: Evangelical and Theological - Robert L. Dabney (1882)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century American Old School Presbyterian milieu; Dabney served as a leading Southern Presbyterian pastor, seminary professor, and theologian in postbellum Virginia.
 - Reaction against New School revivalism, Erastian tendencies, and theological liberalism; aimed at conserving classical Reformed doctrine and rigorous ecclesiastical order.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate and systematize conservative Reformed convictions for church government, human origins and sin, and the doctrines of regeneration and calling - arguing that sound polity and robust doctrine mutually sustain covenantal church life and pastoral ministry.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Ecclesiology and polity - defense of Presbyterian judicatory authority, plurality and parity of elders, defined ministerial functions, and strict church discipline as necessary to covenant integrity.
 - Part II: Anthropology - sustained argument for **traducianism** as the best account of soul transmission and the mechanism for the propagation of original sin.
 - Part III: Soteriology - vindication of classic Calvinist positions: total depravity, monergistic **regeneration**, and the nature of **effectual calling** as sovereign and efficacious prior to, or concomitant with, manifested faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Calvin, Turretin, and other Reformed scholastics; polemical engagement with New School Presbyterians, revivalists, Arminians, and creationist proponents concerning the origin of the soul.
 - Frequent pastoral and juridical references to contemporary Presbyterian practice and earlier confessional standards (Westminster standards).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (government, offices, discipline), anthropology (soul origin, heredity of sin), soteriology (regeneration, calling), covenant theology, sacramental implications of polity and discipline.
- **Closing line**
 - A sustained Old School Reformed defense that links rigorous Presbyterian polity and discipline to a thoroughgoing Calvinist anthropology and monergistic soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates pastoral, juridical, and dogmatic argumentation: polity is treated theologically, not merely pragmatically.
 - Stresses the moral and covenantal purpose of discipline as intrinsic to church fidelity, not merely as corrective expedient.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects New School voluntarism and revival excess by asserting institutional authority and doctrinal standards.
 - Opposes Erastian surrender of church discipline to civil power; argues for church courts' autonomy.
 - Argues for **traducianism** against creationist dualism (soul created ex nihilo at conception) to secure transmission of original sin and filial continuity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the juridical vocabulary for ecclesial life (judicatory, jurisdiction, penal remedies) more than some contemporaries.
 - Frames regeneration and calling with forensic clarity: effectual calling as the Spirit's sovereign legal summons producing real inward change.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among Southern and conservative Reformed circles for polity and pastoral theology; used as a touchstone for strict Presbyterian discipline.
 - Reception compromised in broader academia by Dabney's cultural-political stances (notably pro-Confederacy positions), yet his theological arguments remain reference points in conservative Reformed studies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Persistent resource for studying classical Presbyterian polity, the traducianist account of the soul, and the Reformed doctrine of effectual calling and regeneration; valuable for pastors and students seeking a pastoral-theological synthesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbyterian polity**
 - Defense of conciliar government, graded courts, and collective eldership as normative for covenant church health.
- **Parity of elders**
 - Emphasizes equality among ruling elders and ministers in sessional/judicatory responsibilities, while maintaining ministerial distinctives.
- **Church discipline**
 - Discipline as covenantal, remedial, and public; necessary for purity and witness; administered by church courts independent of civil authority.
- **Jurisdictional courts**
 - Session, presbytery, synod - juridical mechanisms Dabney insists must be operative and authoritative.
- **Traducianism**
 - Position that soul and body are propagated together through generation; used to ground transmission of original sin and familial culpability.
- **Creationism (soul)**
 - Dabney critiques the view that souls are individually created by God at conception; the alternative he sees as weakening the doctrine of original sin.
- **Original sin transmission**
 - Psychological and forensic account linking inherited corruption to human procreation, defended via traducianist framework.
- **Regeneration**
 - Presented as a sovereign, monergistic act of the Spirit effecting real spiritual life prior to or concomitant with realizing faith.
- **Effectual calling**
 - The inward, efficacious divine summons that results in regeneration and persevering conversion; not merely general or external proclamation.
- **Monergism**
 - Strongly affirmed: human salvation is initiated and completed by divine agency, especially in regeneration and calling.
- **Covenant theology**
 - Undergirds polity and discipline; church membership and office seen in covenantal categories and obligations.
- **Erastianism**
 - Criticized as an improper subordination of church authority to civil power.
- **Pastoral juridical method**
 - Marriage of pastoral care and juridical enforcement in Dabney's ecclesiology.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for traditional Presbyterian polity and the role of discipline.
- As **polemic** and source material against creationist accounts of the soul and against revivalist voluntarism.
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for teaching regeneration and effectual calling in pastoral theology and Reformed systematic courses.
