### TITLE
**The Son of God and the New Creation - Fred Sanders**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary evangelical-Reformed milieu; part of renewed interest (21st-century) in trinitarian Christology and cosmic eschatology. Engages patristic theology and recent New Testament scholarship to press theological retrieval inside current systematic debates.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The eternal Son is the personal, active agent who grounds both original creation and the inaugurated new creation; Sonship is ontologically primary for understanding redemption, not merely a functional or soteriological title.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Establishes the Son's eternal agency: biblical and patristic texts show the Son as the creator and sustainer. 
 - Shows continuity between creation and new creation: the resurrection and eschatological consummation are recapitulative acts by the same divine agent. 
 - Develops a Christocentric account of new creation: baptism, incorporation, and the church's life are empirical signs of the Son's re-creative work. 
 - Argues against viewing new creation as merely moral renewal or social transformation; it is ontological, effected by the person of the Son.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary sources: Pauline corpus (esp. Colossians, Romans), Johannine literature, Hebrews. 
 - Patristic resources: Irenaeus and Athanasius (recapitulation, incarnation as re-creation). 
 - Modern interlocutors: recent trinitarian theologians and New Testament scholars emphasizing "inaugurated eschatology" (e.g., those in the Wright/Ladd conversations), with corrective moves toward a stronger Christological ontologizing.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Christology (eternal Sonship, incarnational agency) 
 - Trinity (personal relations and shared operations) 
 - Creation and eschatology (new creation as divine act) 
 - Soteriology (recapitulation, participation) 
 - Ecclesiology insofar as the church is the locus of new-creation signs

- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 The Son's eternal personhood is the decisive theological key: Christ does not merely point to the new creation; by his person and work he is the active creator-recreator who brings the cosmos into its eschatological destiny.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on the Son's personal agency across both creation and new creation, avoiding functionalist or purely economic reductions. 
 - Integration of patristic recapitulation language with contemporary exegetical data to argue for ontological continuity.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on views that make new creation primarily moral, political, or social renewal (reductionist moralism); likewise resists accounts that privatize Sonship to incarnation alone. 
 - Corrects some modern "inaugurated eschatology" tendencies that underplay the person of the Son as the metaphysical agent effecting re-creation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes familiar terms (e.g., "new creation," "recapitulation") with emphasis on person-centered ontology rather than merely event-centered chronology. 
 - Tightens the link between eternal Sonship and the concrete, bodily reality of resurrection as the hinge of cosmic renewal.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in contemporary evangelical and Reformed circles for sharpening Christological foundations for eschatology. 
 - Used by teachers and scholars as a corrective to underdeveloped trinitarian emphases in some streams of popular theological reflection.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Useful for courses on Christology, trinitarian theology, and Christian eschatology; provides a compact model for connecting patristic theology and biblical exegesis with systematic concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Son of God (eternal Sonship):** The eternal personal relation within the Trinity; foundational agent of creation and re-creation. 
- **New Creation:** The ontological renewal of cosmos effected by Christ's person and work; not merely moral reform but transformed being. 
- **Creation (divine agency):** Original act of God undertaken by the Son as author and sustainer. 
- **Recapitulation:** Patristic motif (Irenaeus) used to describe Christ's re-doing of creation in his incarnation, life, death, and resurrection. 
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The "already/not yet" framework, re-emphasized so that the "already" is grounded in the Son's ontological action. 
- **Resurrection (pivot):** The decisive historical-eschatological event through which the Son manifests and effects the new creation. 
- **Incarnation:** Personal entry of the Son into creation that is also the means of re-creation; not merely exemplary. 
- **Participation / incorporation:** How creaturely subjects share in the new creation-baptism, union with Christ, ecclesial life. 
- **Divine personhood (Trinitarian operations):** Operations of God are personal and rooted in relations; the Son's act is truly divine and personal. 
- **Ontological continuity:** The metaphysical continuity between creation and consummation enabled by the Son's singular agency. 
- **Covenantal lordship of Christ:** Christ as Lord who fulfills and restores covenantal life for creation. 
- **Cosmic scope:** Emphasis that redemption is universal/creation-wide, not merely individualistic.

- How the work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for the Son's role in creation and new creation. 
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductionist accounts that privatize Sonship or moralize new creation. 
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline and Johannine texts Christocentrically. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching Christology-eschatology integration in systematic theology.
