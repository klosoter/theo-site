### TITLE
Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering - Eleonore Stump

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / Publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century by a Roman Catholic analytic philosopher/theologian working at the intersection of philosophy of religion, moral psychology, and biblical theology.
 - Responds to longstanding theodicy debates in analytic philosophy (e.g., evidential problem of evil) while drawing on classical Christian resources (notably Thomistic anthropology and biblical narrative).
- **Central thesis**
 - Suffering is best addressed theologically by attending to **narrative**-how God, human agents, and communities jointly constitute a salvific story-rather than by attempting only abstract, justificatory proofs that vindicate God against charge of permitting pointless suffering.
 - God's allowance of suffering can be reconciled with divine goodness by showing how suffering participates in goods of moral formation, repentance, relational repair, and eschatological restoration within a providential narrative.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Diagnose: Contemporary philosophical theodicies that aim simply to justify God fail to account for the **moral and narrative intelligibility** of suffering for sufferers and communities.
 - Biblical-theological turn: Read biblical suffering narratives (notably Job and other Scripture episodes) to extract patterns for divine response and human flourishing amid pain.
 - Philosophical synthesis: Use Thomistic account of persons, will, and agency to explain how free agents, culpable wrongdoing, divine reasons, and goods of transformation cohere with God's omnipotence and benevolence.
 - Practical conclusion: Theodical explanation should focus on God's **ongoing involvement** (comfort, redemption, providential ordering) and on the kinds of goods suffering can have when situated inside a redemptive story.
- **Figures and interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages analytic theodicy literature (e.g., evidentialists and skeptical theists) and classic theistic philosophers; dialogues with Augustine and Aquinas as theological resources.
 - Dialogues indirectly with modern soul-making theorists (e.g., Hick) and with critics of purely justificatory theodicies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence and divine action, God's goodness and power, human freedom and responsibility, sin and culpability, repentance and forgiveness, Christology implicitly via God-with-us motif, eschatology as horizon for narrative closure.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The chief theological insight: suffering gains meaning not by abstract vindication of God but by being woven into a divine narrative that secures moral growth, relational restoration, and final healing through God's sustaining and redemptive presence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers **narrative intelligibility** and the resources of Scripture as primary for understanding suffering rather than treating the problem as a purely logical or evidential puzzle.
 - Marries analytic clarity with Thomistic anthropology-treats persons as unified agents whose wills, relationships, and stories matter morally and theologically.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects against purely justificatory theodicies that neglect the sufferer's question "Why me?" as existential and narrative, not merely logical.
 - Distinguishes her position from classical soul-making theories by emphasizing relational goods (repentance, forgiveness) and divine redemptive response, not only character growth.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The phrase of placing suffering "within a providential narrative" as a central explanatory move: focuses on story-constituted goods (repair, narrative identity, reconciliation).
 - Emphasizes **God-with-us** and the reparative responses of God as intrinsic to theodical explanation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in philosophy of religion, pastoral theology, and biblical-theological work on suffering; praised for bridging analytic rigor and biblical sensitivity.
 - Influential among those seeking resources for pastoral care and for accounts that integrate moral psychology with theodicy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a paradigm for integrating exegesis, moral philosophy, and systematic theology on suffering; durable for classroom use and pastoral reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Narrative intelligibility** - Suffering must be intelligible within a story that preserves moral agency and divine purpose.
- **Providential narrative** - God's ordering of events into a salvific story that yields goods not evident from isolated events.
- **Soul-making (qualified)** - Development of moral capacities, but explicitly tied to relational repair and divine response rather than mere testing.
- **Moral formation** - The process by which virtues and reparative dispositions arise through trials and repentance.
- **God-with-us** - Emphasis on divine presence, solidarity, and comfort as theodical resources.
- **Culpability and desert** - Distinguishes suffering that is retributive, chastening, or consequential from suffering that serves redemptive ends.
- **Evidential problem of evil** - The philosophical challenge Stump responds to, reframed via narrative rather than solely evidential calculus.
- **Thomistic anthropology** - Understanding persons as unified agents with will and reason; foundational for moral responsibility in her account.
- **Relational goods** - Repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation as goods produced or enabled by suffering within the story.
- **Eschatological horizon** - Final restoration that secures narrative closure and retroactively informs the meaning of present suffering.
- **Repair** - The moral and relational mending that suffering can occasion when integrated into a redemptive narrative.
- **Narrative identity** - How persons' self-understanding and moral biographies are shaped through suffering and divine interaction.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for framing suffering theologically in terms of narrative and providence.
- As a **pastoral and exegetical model** for reading biblical suffering stories and shaping responses in ministry.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in philosophy of religion courses to move debates from abstract justification toward narrative and moral psychology.
