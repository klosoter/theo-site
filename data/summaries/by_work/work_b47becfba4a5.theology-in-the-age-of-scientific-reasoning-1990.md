### TITLE
Theology in the Age of Scientific Reasoning (1990) - Nancey Murphy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th century interdisciplinary surge linking theology, philosophy of mind, and the cognitive/biological sciences; reaction to both fideistic retreats and crude scientism. Murphy writes from a broadly Protestant, analytic-theological background seeking to render theology intelligible to scientific culture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** theology must be reconfigured so its claims are accountable to the epistemic norms of scientific reasoning without surrendering essential theological commitments. A central anthropological claim: human persons are psychosomatic unities, not Cartesian souls detached from bodies.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - diagnosis: classical dualism persists in much theology and obstructs fruitful dialogue with science; conversely, reductive materialism misreads personal and moral phenomena.
 - methodological proposal: adopt a "scientific theology" that employs empirical findings and the logic of scientific explanation while preserving normative theological categories.
 - anthropological application: defend a nonreductive account of mind and personhood (psychosomatic unity/emergentist or nonreductive physicalist model) that allows for genuine mental causation, moral responsibility, and a theologically meaningful notion of bodily resurrection/continuity.
 - theological consequences: reconstruct doctrines (sin, salvation, eschatology, incarnation) in ways that cohere with human embodiment and the causal closure of the physical world as studied by science.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** critique of Cartesian dualism; engagement with philosophers of mind and science (representative analytic accounts of reductionism, emergentism, and functionalism); dialogue with theological tradition where relevant (biblical anthropology, classical theologians implicitly in need of reinterpretation).
- **Doctrines treated:** primary focus on theological anthropology (human nature, personhood), but implications drawn for Christology (incarnation and human nature), soteriology (sin and moral agency), and eschatology (resurrection and bodily continuity). Also methodological reflections touching on revelation and theology's epistemic status.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** theology must be intelligible within the epistemic horizon opened by scientific reasoning; human persons are embodied psychosomatic unities whose moral and salvific destinies must be interpreted in continuity with their bodily, scientifically describable nature.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - insistence that theological reflection be constrained and enriched by empirical science while remaining distinctively normative and interpretive.
 - robust defense of psychosomatic unity as the default theological-anthropological model.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - rejects Cartesian substance dualism prevalent in older theological accounts of soul and immortality.
 - opposes reductionist materialism that would eliminate real mental properties, arguing for nonreductive explanatory frameworks.
 - refuses both naive scientism and fideism; proposes a mediating posture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - operationalizing "scientific theology" as a methodology rather than a single set of conclusions.
 - framing personhood in terms congenial to both first-person phenomenology and third-person scientific description (bridging perspectives).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - influential among constructive theologians and those working at theology-science interfaces; prompted further work on nonreductive physicalism in theology.
 - met with suspicion from conservative theologians who see scientific constraints as relativizing revelation; praised by interdisciplinary scholars for rigor and realism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - model case for integrating philosophy of mind into theological anthropology.
 - pedagogically valuable for courses on theology and science, philosophy of religion, and contemporary doctrinal revision.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity:** human persons are unified wholes whose mental life is embodied; rejects a separable immaterial soul.
- **Nonreductive physicalism:** mental properties are real and causally efficacious but grounded in physical-organic systems without reducibility to microphysics.
- **Emergentism:** higher-level mental properties emerge from, but are not identical with, lower-level physical processes.
- **Scientific theology:** a methodological stance that subjects theological claims to accountability by scientific reasoning while preserving theological distinctiveness.
- **Methodological naturalism:** use of naturalistic explanatory standards in theology's engagement with empirical data (not philosophical naturalism as metaphysical denial of God).
- **First-person vs. third-person perspectives:** emphasis on integrating subjective phenomenology of persons with objective scientific descriptions.
- **Reductionism (critique):** dismissal of views that collapse mind into brain processes thereby denying genuine mental causation and moral agency.
- **Dualism (rejection):** critique of substance-separatist accounts of soul that conflict with embodied scientific accounts.
- **Embodiment:** central concept for ethics, sin, and eschatology; bodies matter theologically.
- **Personal identity:** retains continuity grounded in embodied life and psychological continuity compatible with neuroscientific findings.
- **Resurrection and bodily continuity:** reframes resurrection talk to affirm embodied continuity rather than an undetectable disembodied soul.
- **Moral agency and responsibility:** defended under nonreductive accounts - persons act as embodied agents with genuine intentionality.
- **Mind-body supervenience:** the thesis that mental states depend on but do not reduce to physical states; used to secure causal and theological space for personhood.
- **Theological anthropology:** reworked as a science-informed locus integrating empirical human studies with normative claims.
- **Salvific continuity:** emphasis on continuity (not mere spiritual discontinuity) between present embodied life and eschatological fulfillment.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for psychosomatic unity and nonreductive approaches to theological anthropology.
- As a **polemic** against both Cartesian dualism and reductive materialism in theological and ethical debates.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and research linking neuroscience, psychology, and doctrine (personhood, resurrection, sin).
