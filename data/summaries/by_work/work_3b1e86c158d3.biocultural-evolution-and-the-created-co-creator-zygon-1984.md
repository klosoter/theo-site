### TITLE
Biocultural Evolution and The Created Co-Creator (Philip Hefner, Zygon 1984)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1980s theology/science dialogue (Zygon journal). Post-Darwinian, post-Teilhard and post-Whitehead conversations; growing interest in integrating evolutionary biology with systematic theology.
 - Audience: theologians wrestling with evolution, philosophers of biology, ethicists concerned with technology and culture.

- **Central thesis**
 - Human nature is best understood as the outcome of **biocultural evolution**; humans are neither mere biological automatons nor purely spiritual substances but **created co-creators** whose cultural creativity is a God-given continuation of divine creatorship.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Cartesian dualism and static models of the imago Dei fail to account for human self-transformation and culture-making.
 - Proposal: Introduce **biocultural evolution** - a model in which biological evolution and cultural transmission are interacting, co-constitutive processes that produce emergent human persons.
 - Theological reframe: Reinterpret **imago Dei** functionally - as the vocation to creativity, responsibility, and partnership with God in sustaining and transforming creation.
 - Ethical implication: Human freedom and cultural power carry theological responsibility; technology and cultural systems are arenas of co-creation with moral stakes.
 - Concluding synthesis: Anthropology, theology of creation, and ethics must be reframed to account for emergent psychosomatic unity and co-creative vocation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages scientific accounts of evolutionary theory and cultural transmission; theological interlocutors include process and evolutionary theologians (e.g., Whiteheadian and Teilhardian currents) and critics of evolutionary anthropology.
 - Draws upon contemporary biology and social science to argue for culture as an evolutionary force.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (ongoing, dynamic)
 - **Anthropology** (imago Dei, psychosomatic unity)
 - **Providence / cooperation** (co-creation and responsibility)
 - Ethical implications touch eschatology implicitly (directionality of human cultural development)

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Theological anthropology must recognize humans as **psychosomatic, emergent beings produced by biocultural evolution whose God-given vocation is to be responsible co-creators within creation**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats culture and biology as integrated evolutionary systems rather than separate domains; **culture is not superadded but formative** of human nature.
 - Emphasizes **psychosomatic unity**: mental and bodily dimensions are inseparable in the emergence and functioning of persons.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects traditional ontological readings of the imago Dei (substance/essence models) in favor of a **relational-functional, vocational** reading.
 - Counters dualist and anti-evolutionary theologies that segregate biological explanation and theological meaning.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Coining/operationalizing **"biocultural evolution"** within theological anthropology.
 - Framing human beings as **"created co-creator"** - a theological category linking divine creatorship and human cultural agency.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in theology-of-science and theological anthropology circles; influential for constructive theologians who integrate evolutionary science.
 - Less persuasive to conservative literalists; however, provided a durable framework for dialogue between biology and theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, theologically robust model for integrating evolutionary biology with doctrine of creation and imago Dei.
 - Useful pedagogically for courses on theology and science, anthropology, and ethics of technology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biocultural evolution**: Interactional model where biological and cultural evolution co-produce human capacities and forms of life.
 - Culture functions as an evolutionary system with selection-like dynamics (transmission, retention, transformation).

- **Created co-creator**: Theological title for humans who, as creatures, share in divine creativity through cultural innovation and stewardship.
 - Implies responsibility and moral accountability for the direction of cultural-technical development.

- **Imago Dei (functional/relational)**: Read as vocation and relational capability to participate in God's creative work rather than static metaphysical substrate.

- **Psychosomatic unity**: Emphasis on the inseparable integration of body and psyche in human persons; rejects Cartesian mind/body dualism.

- **Emergence**: Theological use of emergence to describe novel capacities (self-consciousness, symbolic culture) arising from biocultural processes.

- **Culture as evolutionary system**: Treats technics, language, ritual, and institutions as mechanisms shaping human evolution and possibilities.

- **Co-creation / creative responsibility**: Normative term linking human creativity with ethical stewardship; grounds theology of technology and social ethics.

- **Vocation / stewardship**: Theological frame for human engagement with the world, shaped by evolutionary history and present capacities.

- **Dynamic creation**: Creation understood as ongoing process rather than a completed past event; aligns divine action with evolutionary processes.

- **Human nature (emergent, not fixed)**: Human nature is a historically situated, evolving set of capacities and roles.

- **Teleology (reinterpreted)**: Purposeful directionality is found in vocation and responsibility rather than in predetermined biological ends.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary theological anthropology (imago Dei as vocation and co-creative role).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics and theology of technology-grounding stewardship and responsibility for cultural evolution.
 - As a **polemic resource** against dualistic or static readings of human nature in systematic theology.
 - As an **exegetical background model** when reading biblical texts about human rule and stewardship through the lens of evolutionary formation.
