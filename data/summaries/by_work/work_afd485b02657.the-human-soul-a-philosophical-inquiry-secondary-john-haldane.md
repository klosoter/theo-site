### TITLE
The Human Soul: A Philosophical Inquiry (secondary analysis by John Haldane) - core Thomistic account from Thomas Aquinas on human soul, unity, and the trichotomy vs dichotomy debate

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Medieval Scholasticism (13th c.) as articulated by Thomas Aquinas; revived in contemporary analytic Thomism (John Haldane) to address modern mind-body debates.
 - Theological milieu: synthesis of Aristotelian metaphysics with Christian doctrine (immortality, resurrection, personal identity).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The human soul is the substantial form of the body (hylomorphism), grounding personal unity, rational capacities, and postmortem survival; this metaphysical account undercuts modern trichotomous or Platonic dualistic partitions of personhood.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Metaphysical basis: humans are a single composite of form (soul) and matter (body).
 - Soul is the principle of life and specific form of the human body (gives identity and organizes body as a living whole).
 - Powers analysis: soul comprises vegetative, sensitive, and rational powers; intellect and will constitute the highest powers.
 - Intellect is immaterial in operation (abstracts universal from matter) and therefore has a special status vis-a-vis immortality.
 - Subsistence and immortality: the rational soul can subsist after bodily death because of its immaterial operations, but the person's full flourishing and identity are rooted in the eventual resurrection of the body.
 - Polemical move: argues against both Platonic separability (radical dualism) and materialist reductionism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Aristotle (form/matter, hylomorphism), Augustine (interior life, will), medieval Scholastics, modern analytic philosophers; contemporary interlocutors include proponents of trichotomy in evangelical theology and Cartesian/dualists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropological locus: nature of soul, image of God, immortality.
 - Eschatological implications: resurrection, personal identity over death.
 - Indirectly affects Christology and soteriology (incarnation presumes unity of human nature).
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers theologically on **the soul as the unified substantial form that secures personal unity, moral responsibility, and a theologically coherent hope in resurrection while resisting fragmented (trichotomous) accounts of human nature.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Priority of hylomorphism: personhood is not two or three discrete substances but a single composite whose form is the soul.
 - Careful powers-analytic method: distinguishes levels of life (vegetative, sensitive, rational) to explain gradations within one subject.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Platonic/Cartesian separability by insisting the soul is the form of the body, not an independent occupant.
 - Counters modern trichotomy (body / soul / spirit as three ontological parts) by showing scriptural terms (nephesh, ruach, pneuma) function within a unitary anthropology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deployment of Aristotelian **substantial form** in a theological key: the soul as formal principle rather than merely a "ghost in the machine."
 - Distinction between the intellect's immaterial operations and the soul's role as form yields a nuanced notion of **subsistent intellectual activity**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central in Catholic theology and neo-Thomist revival; influential for Catholic anthropology, apologetics, and moral theology.
 - In Reformed circles: admired for metaphysical clarity but selectively received; many Reformed theologians accept dichotomy (body + immaterial soul) but find Thomistic resources helpful against materialism and crude dualism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust philosophical-theological framework for debates about mind, personhood, immortality, and the theological meaning of bodily resurrection.
 - Serves both as a corrective to modern reductionism and as a resource for biblical exegesis of anthropological language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hylomorphism** - doctrine that substances are composites of matter (hyle) and form (morphe); the soul is the human form.
- **Substantial form** - the organizing principle that makes a body a living human; not an accidental attribute.
- **Prime matter** - underlying potentiality that, combined with form, constitutes a particular human embodiment.
- **Vegetative, sensitive, rational powers** - hierarchical faculties of the soul (nutrition/growth; sensation/appetite; intellect/will).
- **Intellect (agent vs possible intellect)** - Aquinas' account of intellectual operations; immateriality of intellectual abstraction is key to arguments for subsistence and immortality.
- **Subsistence** - the soul's capacity to exist in a non-composite mode (controversial claim used to ground postmortem survival).
- **Trichotomy** - anthropology thesis (body, soul, spirit as three distinct parts) critiqued by Thomistic unity.
- **Dichotomy** - anthropology thesis (body + immaterial soul/spirit as one immaterial principle) often closer to Aquinas but refined by hylomorphism.
- **Form of the body** - shorthand for the soul's role in constituting the living human organism.
- **Personal identity** - Thomistic criterion: continuity of substantial form and eventual resurrection of body ensure identity over time.
- **Resurrection** - theological telos: bodily restoration consummates the soul-body unity.
- **Nephesh / Ruach / Pneuma** - biblical terms for soul/breath/spirit; Aquinas/Haldane treat them as complementary linguistic distinctions within unitary anthropology.
- **Immaterial operation** - the philosophical marker distinguishing intellectual activity from strictly bodily functions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological anthropology (what a human is, metaphysically).
 - As a **polemic tool** against trichotomy and against materialist accounts that deny real spiritual capacities.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting biblical anthropological vocabulary within a unified metaphysical framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics and eschatology-grounding moral responsibility, sanctification, and hope in bodily resurrection.
