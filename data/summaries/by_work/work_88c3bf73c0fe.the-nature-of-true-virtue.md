### TITLE
**The Nature of True Virtue** - Jonathan Edwards 
Mid-18th-century essay/sermon from the New England Puritan / Reformed revival milieu (Great Awakening). Systematic-moral reflection that locates moral worth in the affections ordered toward God and being.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Edwards wrote within the evangelical Calvinist revival in colonial New England, reacting to both revival piety and contemporary British moral philosophy (the moral-sense school). Pastoral and polemical aims: correct superficial or sentimental accounts of virtue and ground practical holiness in doctrinal theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** True virtue is benevolence - a disinterested, righteous love of being (most perfectly God) - and moral worth depends on the inward affections ordered to the supreme Good rather than merely outward conformity or utility.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define virtue as an affection or disposition: primarily *love of being* and delight in the happiness or good of others.
 - Distinguish true virtue from self-love, prudence, and mere natural benevolence; true virtue is *disinterested* and directed by supreme love to God.
 - Show that the highest virtue loves God for his own sake; lesser virtue loves beings for God's sake.
 - Argue that moral worth is measured by the **scope** (extent) and **intensity** (degree) of benevolence and by its object (God as chief end).
 - Link moral affections to choice and action: right affections determine morally praiseworthy behavior; thus inward principle is decisive for moral evaluation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Scriptural exegesis (charity and love motifs).
 - Implicit polemic with Francis Hutcheson-like moral sense / sentimentalism and with utilitarian or prudential accounts of virtue.
 - Reformed predecessors: Puritan pastoral tradition and scholastic categories of will/affection.
- **Doctrines treated:** moral theology, affections/heart, sin and sanctification, divine holiness and goodness, providence implicitly as grounding the moral order, will and free agency.
- **Closing line:** Edwards centers ethics on the heart: true virtue is God-directed benevolence - the ordered affections toward God and being that display conformity to the divine good.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Affections (not mere action) are the primary seat of moral value; degree and extent of benevolence are quantifiable moral criteria.
 - "Disinterested benevolence" articulated positively: love not motivated by self-advantage but by delight in being's good.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects sentimental/moral-sense accounts by denying that mere approval or feeling suffices; opposes egoistic/utilitarian reductions of virtue.
 - Contrasts with externalistic moralists: outward obedience without right affection is morally deficient.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precise moral-psychological taxonomy: benevolence vs. self-love vs. prudence; intensity/extent as evaluative measures.
 - Re-articulation of classical virtue-language within a Reformed theological anthropology of affections.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in New England pietism and subsequent Reformed pastoral theology; frequently cited by later Reformed ethicists and theologians as a paradigmatic heart-centered moral theology.
 - Engaged by philosophers and theologians in debates about moral motivation, virtue ethics, and the nature of Christian charity.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a rigorous bridge between doctrinal theology (God as ultimate good) and moral psychology; valuable for preaching, pastoral formation, and contemporaneous debates on moral motivation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **True virtue** - inward disposition of benevolence rightly ordered toward God and being; the central term.
- **Benevolence** - active love or goodwill toward the good of others and being; the defining property of virtue.
- **Disinterested benevolence** - benevolence not seeking self-advantage; loves for the other's sake or for God.
- **Love of being** - phrase Edwards uses to capture a positive orientation to the existence/well-being of created and divine being.
- **Intensity and extent** - evaluative metrics: how strongly and how widely benevolence reaches.
- **Affections (the heart)** - primary moral locus; inner delight, relish, and inclination that ground moral worth.
- **Self-love / prudence** - contrasted terms: morally lower motives that imitate virtue without its proper object.
- **Moral beauty / conformity to God** - moral good is defined by conformity to the nature and glory of God rather than by mere utility.
- **Will and determination** - Edwards presupposes a compatibilist account: choices follow strongest inclinations; moral change requires reorientation of affections.
- **Sin as perverted affection** - sin is the disordered love (affections turned inward or away from God).
- **Divine sovereignty / providence** - background conviction that God's nature grounds moral order; God is ultimate standard and end.
- **Problem of evil (implicit use)** - Edwards locates moral disorder in creaturely volition, preserving God's moral perfection (used in discussions of Divine Foreknowledge, Providence and the Problem of Evil).
- **Freedom (practical)** - freedom conceived as acting from one's strongest desires; bears on debates in Sin and Free Will.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source and pastoral model for Christian virtue ethics: supplies the classic Edwardsian definition of virtue as benevolence.
- As a polemic and conceptual pivot in theological debates: deployed against moral-sense theories and used to link doctrines of sin, will, and providence (notably in discussions of Divine Foreknowledge/Providence and Sin and Free Will).
