### TITLE
The Joy of Hearing - Thomas Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/Reformed milieu; Schreiner writes from an academic New Testament perspective with pastoral concerns. Fits within late 20th-21st century debates about proclamation, Scripture, and soteriology in Reformed and broader evangelical circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Hearing the preached Word is both the instrument and the occasion of Christian joy; faithful proclamation produces saving faith and consolatory assurance without collapsing objective gospel content into mere subjective feeling.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Opening diagnosis: modern threats to the joy of hearing - pietistic subjectivism, therapeutic religion, and dulled appreciation for propositional gospel.
 - Exegesis of key texts (esp. Pauline passages like Romans 10:14-17, 1 Thessalonians, and Luke/John on hearing): hearing as God-ordained means of grace that produces faith and joy.
 - Theological synthesis: relation of Word and Spirit, logos/rhema dynamics, objective gospel content and its subjective appropriation in faith and assurance.
 - Practical implications: homiletics and worship - how preachers should shape proclamation to foster joy without sentimentalism; pastoral care that connects hearing, understanding, and perseverance.
 - Concluding appeal: recover robust preaching rooted in Scripture that leads congregations to the joy that comes from hearing Christ proclaimed.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Apostolic texts (Paul, Luke, John) as primary authorities; engages classical Reformed figures implicitly (e.g., Calvin on preaching) and contemporary evangelical/preaching scholars (often interlocutors include D. A. Carson, John Stott-type concerns). Also dialogical contrasts with pietism and liberal or therapeutic approaches to preaching.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Revelation** (Word as vehicle), **soteriology** (faith arising from hearing; justification), **assurance**, **ecclesiology** (worship and preaching), **Spirit-Word relationship**, and touches of **sanctification/perseverance**.
- **Closing line:** The heart of Schreiner's argument is that biblical hearing - faithful, content-rich proclamation received in the Spirit - is the ordinary avenue by which sinners are converted and believers are filled with abiding joy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats *hearing* not merely as cognitive assent but as an instrument of grace that issues in *joy* - joy is the normative response to gospel hearing, not optional accompaniment.
 - Stresses the **objective content** of proclamation (Christ crucified, justification) while refusing to reduce the Word to mere information.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects pietistic and experiential reductionism that makes personal feeling the barometer of gospel success.
 - Pushes back on liberal or cultural models that privatize religion by returning to communal, preached Word in worship.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced deployment of **logos/rhema** language: logos as the Scripture and gospel content; rhema as the Spirit-applied word that effects faith and joy in hearing.
 - Frames **joy** as an epistemic and affective outcome of faithful reception - a theological category that mediates assurance and perseverance.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Resonates with Reformed homiletical training and pastoral theology; cited for connecting exegesis with pastoral practice.
 - Useful in evangelical circles concerned to recover the centrality of preaching; less traction among traditions that emphasize sacramental mediations over proclamation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact resource linking New Testament exegesis, Reformed preaching theology, and pastoral praxis; valuable in seminary homiletics, pastoral care courses, and studies on Word-Spirit dynamics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hearing (akouo/akroa):** central mediating action by which the gospel is received; not passive reception but faith-producing encounter.
- **Joy:** normative affective response to right hearing; linked to assurance and perseverance.
- **Kerygma:** the preached proclamation; Schreiner insists on its doctrinal integrity (Christ crucified, justification).
- **Logos vs. Rhema:** logos = Scripture/gospel content; rhema = Spirit-energized utterance that effects faith in hearers.
- **Faith (pistis):** response elicited by hearing; instrumental relation to justification.
- **Justification:** doctrinal end of hearing the gospel; hearing lays the ground for forensic declaration received by faith.
- **Assurance:** fruit of hearing when the objective gospel is rightly appropriated.
- **Word and Spirit relation:** complementary - Word is the means, Spirit is the effective agent who applies it.
- **Proclamation/Preaching:** ecclesial practice that must preserve doctrinal clarity to produce joy.
- **Conversion:** described as mediated through hearing; involves cognitive grasp and Spirit-enabled assent.
- **Sanctification:** ongoing fruit of repeated hearing and joy-filled perseverance.
- **Ecclesial worship:** primary locus for hearing; liturgy and sermon shape reception.
- **Pastoral care:** pastoral application of hearing-addressing doubts, guiding toward assurance via the preached Word.
- **Instrumental causality:** theological claim that hearing is the ordinary instrument God uses to create faith.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for the theological importance of hearing in soteriology and worship.
 - As a **polemic** against subjective pietism and therapeutic preaching styles.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Pauline passages on hearing (esp. Romans 10).
 - As a **homiletical/conceptual pivot** in courses on preaching, worship, and pastoral theology.
