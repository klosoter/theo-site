### TITLE
The Priesthood of Christ in Hebrews (Biblical and Theological Studies) - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton/Biblical Theology milieu; Vos as leading Reformed exegete advancing historically-grounded, confessional reading of Scripture against liberal reductionism.
 - Treats Hebrews as a theological and typological exposition rooting the New Testament priesthood in the Old Testament order (Melchizedek) and covenantal structures.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Hebrews presents Christ as the true, once-for-all, heavenly high priest whose priestly office unites both his active and passive obedience to accomplish final atonement and ongoing intercession for God's people.
 - Problem addressed: how to understand the nature, efficacy, and continuity/discontinuity of Christ's priesthood with Levitical forms.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical tracing of Hebrews' major motifs: Son superior to angels, Son as incarnate priest, Melchizedek typology, earthly sacrifices vs. heavenly reality, once-for-all sacrifice, perpetual intercession.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the superiority of the Son and the need for a priestly role that transcends Levitical limitations (Hebrews 1-4).
 - Demonstrate Christ's priesthood as belonging to the order of Melchizedek - non-hereditary, eternal-likeness, typological fulfillment (Heb 5-7).
 - Show that Christ's sacrifice is singular, efficacious, and final - the heavenly sanctuary and perfect sacrifice replace repeated Levitical offerings (Heb 8-10).
 - Emphasize priestly functions continuing in Christ's intercession and mediatorial reign (Heb 7:25; 9-10).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: the author of Hebrews (and its scriptural corpus).
 - Engages the Levitical priesthood, the Melchizedek figure, and Jewish cultic typology.
 - Polemical context: implicit critique of liberal exegesis that reduces Hebrews to moral exhortation; corrective to any scholastic reduction of priesthood to mere legal fiction.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (person and office of the Son)
 - **Soteriology** (atonement, expiation, propitiation; active and passive obedience)
 - **Covenant theology/typology** (fulfillment of Old Testament types)
 - **Ecclesiology/Mediation** (Christ as mediator and perpetual intercessor)
 - **Liturgical/temporal theology** (heavenly sanctuary as locus of real priestly activity)

- **Closing line**
 - Vos centers Hebrews on a covenantal, typological, and soteriological thesis: Christ's unique priesthood - grounded in the order of Melchizedek and enacted through both active and passive obedience - consummates Israel's cultus in a once-for-all, heavenly sacrifice and enduring intercession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight integration of **active and passive obedience** within the priestly office: priestly life (active obedience/representative righteousness) and sacrificial death (passive obedience/atonement) are not separable functions but two aspects of Christ's one mediatorial work.
 - Strong ontological reading of Hebrews: priesthood is not merely functional or symbolic but a real, efficacious heavenly office.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters theological tendencies that split Christ's righteousness into discrete forensic categories divorced from priestly mediation.
 - Opposes liberal readings that reduce Hebrews to ethical exhortation or mere typology without real ontological fulfillment.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies Melchizedek typology as a **canonical pivot**: a non-hereditary, eternal-likeness priesthood that models Christ's permanence and superiority.
 - Uses the language of "once-for-all" (hapax) and "heavenly sanctuary" to insist on finality and reality of Christ's sacrifice.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Reformed exegetical circles for linking biblical-theological method with classic Reformed doctrine of atonement and obedience.
 - Served as a corrective resource against both liberal critics and mechanistic scholastic reductions in subsequent 20th-century Reformed theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined, exegetical-theological reading of Hebrews that preserves both typological continuity and covenantal discontinuity.
 - Valuable for teaching Christ's unified office as both priest and representative head - integrating obedience and atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Melchizedek**
 - Typological prototype of Christ's non-Levitical, enduring priesthood; signals continuity with OT and superiority over Levitical order.

- **High Priest / Priesthood**
 - Christ's mediatorial office combining sacrifice, intercession, and representative obedience; ontological reality in heaven.

- **Once-for-all (hapax)**
 - Hebrews' term for the singular efficacy of Christ's sacrifice (Heb 7:27; 9:12; 10:10).

- **Heavenly Sanctuary**
 - Real locus of Christ's priestly activity; contrasts with the earthly tabernacle and cultic shadows.

- **Typology**
 - Canonical methodology: OT rites and persons as real types fulfilled in Christ, not mere analogies.

- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's lifelong obedience as representative righteousness, necessary for priestly qualification and covenantal merit.

- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death effecting expiation/propitiation; the sacrificial aspect of priesthood.

- **Atonement / Expiation / Propitiation**
 - Language emphasizing the decisive, reconciliatory, and sacrificial nature of Christ's priestly death.

- **Representative Headship**
 - Christ as covenant head whose obedience (active and passive) secures benefits for the elect.

- **Intercession**
 - Ongoing priestly function of Christ in heaven (e.g., Heb 7:25) guaranteeing application of atonement.

- **Covenant Fulfillment**
 - Priesthood as the realization of covenantal promises and typological anticipations.

- **Perfection / Sanctification (in Hebrews)**
 - Christ's experience of suffering "made perfect" and believers' sanctification through the once-for-all sacrifice.

- **Levitical vs. Melchizedek Order**
 - Contrast showing insufficiency of repeated sacrifices and heredity versus permanence and efficacy of Christ's office.

- **Canonical axiality**
 - Vos's use of Hebrews as a pivot for understanding NT fulfillment of OT covenantal institutions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Hebrews: careful text-driven typological and covenantal method.
- As a **definition source** connecting priesthood with both active and passive obedience in Reformed soteriology.
- As a **polemic tool** against liberal reductions and mechanistic scholastic accounts that separate forensic justification from priestly mediation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching how Christ's singular priestly work unifies atonement, representation, and ongoing intercession.
