### TITLE
**Calvin on Union with Christ** (essay in People and Place, 2008) - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed retrieval: positioned within 21st-century conservative Protestant theology and the "New Calvinism" recuperative project.
 - Engages classic Reformation debates against medieval sacramentalism and modern individualistic accounts of salvation.
 - Published in an edited volume on ecclesial identity (People and Place), bringing historical theology to bear on pastoral and ecclesial concerns.

- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin's doctrine of **union with Christ** is the structuring principle of his soteriology: Christ's person, work, Spirit, sacraments, and the covenant converge in an objective, vital, and instrumental union that secures believers' justification, sanctification, and adoption.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Calvin's texts showing union as both forensic (legal standing) and real (participatory life).
 - Emphasis on the **Holy Spirit** as the instrumental bond who communicates Christ to believers (Spirit And Union With Christ).
 - Analysis of means: Word and sacraments function as divinely ordained instruments by which union is effected and applied (Union With Christ).
 - Distinguishes Calvin's view from:
 - Roman Catholic notion of infused righteousness (impartation without forensic certainty).
 - Antinomian or purely moralized conceptions that reduce union to ethical resemblance.
 - Demonstrates pastoral and ecclesial implications: sacramental life, assurance, corporate identity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries, sermons).
 - Interlocutors: Augustine (received influence), medieval scholastics, Roman Catholic polemicists, and select modern interpreters who minimize the Spirit's instrumental role.
 - Secondary: Reformed dogmaticians and contemporary evangelical critics of classical forensic frameworks.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Union with Christ (central)
 - Holy Spirit (instrument and bond)
 - Justification (forensic imputation in union)
 - Sanctification (participation and progressive renewal)
 - Covenant theology (federal headship, communion of saints)
 - Sacraments (means of grace effecting union)
 - Christology and Trinity (Christ as Mediator; Spirit as communicator of Christ)

- **Closing line**
 - Calvin's theology places **union with Christ, applied by the Spirit through Word and sacraments, at the heart of divine salvation**, uniting forensic justification and organic participation in a coherent Reformation soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats union as simultaneously **objective and vital**: not mere legal fiction nor mere mystical feeling, but a real, instituted participation in Christ's person and benefits.
 - Strong stress on the **Spirit as the active agent** who unites and communicates Christ to believers (explicitly linking Spirit And Union With Christ).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters Roman Catholic emphasis on infused righteousness by reclaiming the forensic ground without detaching it from real participation.
 - Opposes pietistic or existential reductions that privatize union into subjective experience.
 - Pushes back on reductionist readings of Calvin that isolate justification from the sacramental and ecclesial economy.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rearticulates older vocabulary (participatio, communio) in a way that preserves imputation and real participation together.
 - Frames sacraments primarily as **instrumental means of union**, not mere signs or standalone engines of merit.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in recent Reformed renewal and confessional scholarship to re-center union as a key doctrinal pivot.
 - Influential in seminary curricula and in polemics against both liberal assimilation of union language and Roman Catholic sacramentalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, textually grounded model for integrating Christology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, and soteriology.
 - Useful for preaching, pastoral assurance, and sacramental theology rooted in Reformed confessions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central relational reality: believers are mystically and legally joined to Christ as head.
- **Spirit as Bond / Instrument**
 - The Spirit communicates Christ and effects union (Spirit And Union With Christ).
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers grounded in union.
- **Participation (participatio)**
 - Real sharing in Christ's life, death, and resurrection; not opposed to imputation but complementary.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Federal framework: union structured by covenantal headship and promises.
- **Means of Grace (Word and Sacraments)**
 - Instruments by which the Spirit ordinarily effects union (Union With Christ emphasis).
- **Headship of Christ**
 - Christ as federal head whose obedience and righteousness are appropriated by believers.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive outworking of union; moral transformation flows from participation.
- **Assurance**
 - Union provides objective grounds for believers' assurance; not mere subjective feeling.
- **Real Presence (spiritual)**
 - Sacramental presence of Christ mediated by the Spirit, distinct from Roman Catholic metaphysics.
- **Forensic vs. Organic**
 - Calvinian synthesis: legal standing (forensic) and living communion (organic) cohere in union.
- **Communion of Saints**
 - Ecclesial dimension of union: corporate life grounded in shared participation in Christ.
- **Mediation**
 - Christ's person and work as the single basis for union and salvation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, historically grounded concept of union with Christ that unites imputation and participation.
- As a **polemic tool** against Roman Catholic infused-righteousness views and against reductionist pietist or existential re-interpretations.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for applying Pauline texts (e.g., Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians) to sermons, sacraments, and assurance teaching.
