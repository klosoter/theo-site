### TITLE
**Moralizing Technology: Understanding and Designing the Morality of Things - Peter-Paul Verbeek**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Early 21st-century philosophy of technology and science-and-technology studies (postphenomenology/actor-network currents). Responds to rising interest in ethics of design, ubiquitous computing, and biomedical technologies.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 **Technologies are not morally neutral; they actively mediate human-world relations and thereby shape moral actions and values.** Moral assessment must attend to how artifacts instantiate norms and afford or constrain moral possibilities.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Critique of two inadequate accounts: **instrumentalism** (tools as neutral means) and **technological determinism** (technology imposes values by itself). 
 - Development of a **mediational turn**: technologies mediate perception, action, and intention; they co-shape moral subjectivity and situations. 
 - Analytical tools: concepts like **script**, **intentionality of artifacts**, and **mediated moral agency** to trace how artifacts embody norms. 
 - Normative proposal: ethics must include **design responsibility** - designers, engineers, and institutions should intentionally shape technology to realize moral values (connects with value-sensitive design). 
 - Practical cases and examples (surveillance, biomedical devices, traffic control, care technologies) illustrate empirical and normative claims.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Postphenomenology: Don Ihde (mediating relations). 
 - Science and Technology Studies: Bruno Latour (actor-network sensibilities). 
 - Dialogue with technological ethics literature (including Langdon Winner's "artifacts have politics"), and with work on responsibility and design ethics.

- **Doctrines treated (philosophical/ethical loci):** 
 - Moral agency and responsibility (distributed and hybrid). 
 - Normativity and value embodiment in material culture. 
 - Human nature/anthropology as technologically mediated. 
 - Practical ethics of design, care ethics, public ethics.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Technology participates in the moral formation of persons and communities; ethical theory and practice must therefore move from abstract prescriptions to attention to the moral content embedded in artifacts and their design.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Moves beyond "technologies have politics" to a finely grained account of **how** technologies mediate moral perception and action. 
 - Treats design as an ethical practice - not only regulating use after the fact but shaping moral possibilities at the point of creation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Rejects simple neutrality claims (instrumentalism) and crude determinism; offers a middle, relational thesis where agency is **distributed** and co-constituted. 
 - More programmatic and action-guiding than Latour in ethical prescription; more relational and phenomenological than Winner's institutionalist claim.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Consolidates and operationalizes **technological mediation** as a bridge between phenomenology and ethics. 
 - Emphasizes **moralizing technologies** - artifacts that instantiate and propagate moral norms - as a category for ethical scrutiny.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Limited direct uptake in systematic theology; stronger influence in applied ethics, practical theology, and ethics of care where embodiment and material culture matter. 
 - Useful for ecclesial praxis and public theology concerned with technology's role in moral formation and social justice.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides an accessible, empirically informed framework for integrating ethics into design curricula, STS seminars, and theological courses on technology and ethics. 
 - Provokes fruitful conversation for theologians about sacramentality, embodiment, and the mediated nature of moral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technological mediation:** Technologies shape how humans perceive, interpret, and act in the world; mediation is the central analytic move. 
- **Moralizing technology:** Artifacts that instantiate or propagate moral norms through their form, function, or deployment. 
- **Script:** The intended pattern of use and behavior inscribed in an artifact that channels users toward certain actions. 
- **Intentionality of artifacts:** Not literal mental states, but the way artifacts are built to realize ends and thereby direct behavior. 
- **Distributed/hybrid agency:** Moral agency is shared among humans and nonhumans within networks; responsibility likewise is distributed. 
- **Design ethics / value-sensitive design:** Normative program urging designers to embed moral values deliberately in technologies. 
- **Normative mediation:** The process by which technologies do not merely enable but prescribe or suggest moral meanings and choices. 
- **Responsibility framework:** Moves from blaming users only to shared accountability among designers, institutions, and artifacts. 
- **Mediation types (perceptual, hermeneutic, existential):** Different modes by which technologies shape experience and self-understanding. 
- **Moral imagination:** The capacity to envision alternative technological configurations that instantiate different values. 
- **Non-neutrality thesis:** Core claim that artifacts carry normative weight; rejection of value-free technology. 
- **Practical ontology:** Attention to how artifacts constitute the field of possible actions and identities. 
- **Ethics of care intersections:** Application to caregiving technologies that reshape notions of dependency and dignity. 
- **Empirical casuistry:** Use of concrete technological cases to test and refine normative claims.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for "technological mediation" and "moralizing" in STS and ethics courses. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in arguments for embedding values in design (design ethics, value-sensitive design). 
 - As a **polemic** against instrumentalist accounts of technology in both secular and theological ethics.
