### TITLE
A Commentary on the Confession of Faith - Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published in the late 19th century (Princeton environment; Hodge, leading American Presbyterian theologian).
 - Product of post-Reformation Reformed scholasticism meeting American confessionalism; reaction to liberalizing trends and rising biblical criticism.
 - Intended as authoritative exposition and defense of the Westminster Confession within American Presbyterianism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Confession, when read with careful biblical exegesis and systematic reflection, furnishes a coherent, scriptural expression of historic Reformed doctrine suitable for church teaching and polemical defense.
 - Main problem addressed: how to apply and defend the Confession against modern skepticism, heterodox readings, and theological revisionism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: Article-by-article exegesis of the Confession with cross-reference to Scripture, earlier Reformed divines, and systematic categories.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the Confession as subordinate standard to Scripture and as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
 - Interpret key doctrines (God, Scripture, sin, Christ, salvation, sacraments, church, last things) in a way that harmonizes biblical texts with Calvinist systematic principles.
 - Provide doctrinal definitions, pastoral applications, and polemical refutations of opposing views (Arminianism, Socinianism, Unitarianism, modern denial of inerrancy).
 - Emphasis on coherence between historical confession and contemporary theological challenges.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Westminster divines and classical Reformers (Calvin, Cranmer, etc.)
 - Contemporary opponents: Arminians, Unitarians, theological liberals, higher critics.
 - Internal sources: Scripture as primary; Reformed confessional corpus and earlier catechetical materials.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, sufficiency, authority)
 - Doctrine of God (attributes; creation; providence)
 - Trinity and Christology (person and work of Christ)
 - Covenant theology (federal headship, covenant of works/Grace)
 - Predestination and election, sin and total depravity, atonement, effectual calling, perseverance
 - Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), church polity, civil magistrate, last things

- **Closing line**
 - Hodge seeks to seal the Westminster Confession as a scripturally grounded, systematically coherent, and pastorally useful expression of historic Reformed orthodoxy against both internal laxity and external critique.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous harmonization of exegetical detail with confessional formulas; insists on both textual fidelity and systematic clarity.
 - Strong insistence on the Confession's normative role: useful for doctrinal precision without supplanting Scripture.
 - Balanced deployment of philosophy: philosophical realism used to defend theological propositions without speculative metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters latitudinarian readings that dilute Calvinism; corrects hyper-Calvinistic or speculative departures by appeal to Scripture and restrained systematics.
 - Polemic against Unitarian/Socinian denial of Trinitarian doctrine and against liberalism's skepticism about inerrancy and doctrines like original sin.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not radical innovations, but clarifies and systematizes confessional language for American context (e.g., explicit links between covenantal categories and pastoral practice).
 - Sharp articulation of the interface between biblical revelation and rational argument-defending dogma with disciplined reason.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in 19th and early 20th-century American Presbyterianism and seminary education (Princeton legacy).
 - Standard reference for confessional exegesis; shaped ordination standards and denominational identity.
 - Continues to be cited in conservative Reformed circles as a definitive conservative reading of the Westminster Confession.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of confessional exegesis that is polemical, pastoral, and systematic.
 - Enduring pedagogical resource for teaching doctrines in a confessional frame and for defending historic Reformed positions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Confession of Faith (Westminster)** - Treated as a faithful, subordinate summary of biblical doctrine; authoritative for instruction and discipline.
- **Scripture: authority & sufficiency** - Hodge defends inerrancy and the Bible as final rule for faith and practice.
- **God: absolute attributes** - Emphasis on attributes like aseity, immutability, simplicity; discussed as intrinsic perfections of God apart from creaturely relations.
 - Relates to "Absolute And Relative Attributes": Hodge distinguishes attributes intrinsic to God's being (absolute) from those that describe God's relation to creation or redemption (relative).
- **Relative attributes** - Attributes considered in relation to creatures (e.g., Creator, Governor, Redeemer); used to explain how God reveals himself relationally without compromising essence.
- **Covenant theology** - Federal (federal headship) schema undergirds structure of salvation history (covenant of works and covenant of grace).
- **Predestination / Election** - Defended as scriptural and coherent with divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
- **Atonement** - Particular/definite atonement articulated within classical Reformed bounds; Christ's work effective for the elect.
- **Original sin / total depravity** - Strongly affirmed as necessary for understanding need of grace.
- **Effectual calling / perseverance** - Taught in line with classical Calvinism; grace is effectual and persevering.
- **Sacraments: signs and seals** - Instrumental sign-value; not mere symbols but means of grace in covenant context.
- **Church & polity** - Presbyterian polity defended; church seen as organic, covenantal body.
- **Reason & revelation** - Reason is servant of revelation; philosophical clarity pursued but subordinated to biblical data.
- **Inspiration / inerrancy** - Scriptural truthfulness and authority repeatedly affirmed.
- **Polemic function** - The work functions to repel modern denials and to clarify confessional positions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional formulations in teaching and ordination standards.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal, Unitarian, or Arminian reinterpretations.
 - As an **exegetical-model** showing how biblical texts ground confessional clauses and systematic theology.
