### TITLE
The Christian Doctrine of Faith and History (Glaubenslehre und Geschichte) - Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology (Ritschlian school); reaction to speculative metaphysics (Hegelianism) and pietistic subjectivism (Schleiermacher).
 - Method: historical-critical theology combined with ethical/value-judgment (Bewertung) epistemology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christian doctrine must be reconstructed as a historically-grounded, ethical-religious judgment: faith is primarily a moral trust in God expressed in repentance and community life; history is the locus of God's revelation, not metaphysical speculation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology distinguishes between cognitive facts and religious value: historical events (Christ, kingdom of God) provide the content; religious faith is the ethical response that confers religious meaning.
 - Revelation: not an abstract metaphysical illumination but God's historical activity making Himself normative for moral life.
 - Christology: Jesus is the decisive historical revelation whose significance is grasped by a faith-judgment; doctrine must describe the religious value of Christ for the community.
 - Dogmatics: normative statements arise from communal religious valuation rather than from speculative metaphysics or alleged self-authenticating propositions.
 - Methodological moves:
 - Insist on critical historiography to establish factual bases.
 - Employ moral-philosophical criteria to determine religious relevance.
 - Keep theology centered on the kingdom of God as ethical norm.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Responds to Kantian limits on knowledge, Schleiermacher's feeling-centered religion, Hegelian metaphysics, and confessional orthodoxy.
 - Anticipates critiques from Barthian neo-orthodoxy (rejection of Ritschl's reductionism) and influences later liberal theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (historical action), Christology (historical significance and ethical saving value), soteriology (reconciliation as moral/personal redemption), ecclesiology (community as locus of faith), Scripture (witness to saving events; normative insofar as it promotes faith), limited treatment of Trinity reframed relationally.

- **Site usage (topics cited)**
 - Faith And Repentance: treats faith as moral trust that issues in repentance and ethical transformation.
 - Self Attestation And Authority Of Scripture: denies intrinsic self-attestation of Scripture; authority derived from its efficacy for Christian faith and community.

- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl centers theology on the historically attested ethical revelation of God in Christ: doctrine is a communal moral judgment about salvation-history, not metaphysical assertion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as ethical/value-judgment (Bewertung) rather than speculative metaphysics or pure subjectivity.
 - Priority of the kingdom of God and the moral transformation of persons and community.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Schleiermacher: shifts from individual feeling to communal ethical response.
 - Against orthodox scholasticism: rejects metaphysical categories and intrinsic divine-human propositions.
 - Sets stage for Barth's corrective by reducing speculative theology and emphasizing history; Barth then reverses Ritschl's naturalism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Religious value-judgment" as a distinct epistemic category.
 - Recasting "revelation" as historical-normative action rather than propositional disclosure.
 - Authority of Scripture treated functionally (witness) rather than ontologically (self-attesting Word).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence on liberal Protestant theology and on theological method debates in late 19th/early 20th centuries.
 - Provoked sharp reaction from neo-orthodox and confessional movements; deemed by critics to dilute doctrinal content but praised for methodological rigor.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the relation of history and faith; provides a cautionary model about reducing doctrinal claims to ethical utility.
 - Useful for courses on theological method, modern theology, and the history of doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (Glaube)**: ethical trust/loyalty to God realized in communal life; not mere assent to propositions.
- **Repentance (Buße)**: moral turning that flows from authentic faith; central to soteriology and practical transformation.
- **Religious value-judgment (Bewertung)**: the epistemic act by which historical facts are assigned religious significance.
- **Revelation**: God's historical self-act-normative in moral effect rather than metaphysical disclosure.
- **History (Heilsgeschichte)**: the proper locus of revelation; theological claims must be historically grounded.
- **Christology**: description of Jesus as the historical center of God's saving action; focus on significance rather than speculative personhood metaphysics.
- **Authority of Scripture**: functional authority as reliable witness to saving events; authority stems from communal appropriation and effectiveness for faith.
 - Contrast: rejects Scripture's autonomous self-attestation; emphasizes testimony and historical reliability.
- **Community / Church**: the bearer and judge of religious meaning; theology arises from ecclesial evaluation.
- **Kingdom of God**: ethical-normative center; yardstick for theological judgment and Christian life.
- **Soteriology**: reconciliation understood in ethical-personal and communal terms rather than juridical metaphysics.
- **Methodology**: critical-historical plus ethical-philosophical valuation; empiricism coupled with moral normativity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for faith-as-ethical-trust and repentance as moral conversion in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** exemplar in debates over Scripture's authority and the limits of historical-critical method.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on theological method: illustrating the shift from metaphysical dogmatics to history-centered, value-oriented theology.
