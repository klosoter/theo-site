### TITLE
**"The Trinity in the New Testament,"** Richard B. Gaffin Jr., entry in The New Dictionary of Biblical Theology. Concise, exegetically anchored treatment that locates trinitarian doctrine in the revelatory logic of Scripture with particular attention to New Testament witness.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contribution to an early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed reference work addressing biblical theology for pastors and scholars.
 - Gaffin writes from a conservative Reformed, confessional perspective, trained in biblical theology and systematic theology; his method privileges canonical and Pauline/Johannine exegesis over later metaphysical speculation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The NT reveals the triune nature of God: distinct persons (Father, Son, Spirit) who are nonetheless the one God. The proper doctrine of the Trinity must be rooted in the revelatory data of OT promise and NT fulfillment rather than extrabiblical metaphysics.
 - Key problem addressed: how to form a doctrine of the Trinity that is faithful to biblical revelation while avoiding both modalism and reductionist/social or purely economic accounts.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of OT anticipations (promise-language, Spirit activity) that prepare the way for NT disclosure of God's multiplicity within unity.
 - Close attention to NT loci:
 - **Johannine material** (Prologue, mutual relations, "sentness") as central to understanding personhood and unity.
 - **Pauline data** (benedictions, Christological hymns, Spirit-as-agent texts) showing doctrinal development and doxological usage (e.g., 2 Cor 13:14).
 - **Synoptic/Early Church data** (baptismal formula, baptism narratives) as practice-based evidence of triadic faith.
 - Assertive move: the NT presents an economical revelation that discloses ontological truth - the economic Trinity is trustworthy testimony to who God is.
 - Implications for soteriology and ecclesiology: Trinity grounds redemption, the Spirit's work, and the church's sacramental/doxological life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: canonical NT authors (John, Paul, Synoptics, Acts), early creedal formulas; modern trinitarian proposals (modalism, social trinitarian models) are critiqued by appeal to Scripture.
 - Conversation with Reformed and evangelical scholars emphasizing christocentric reading of Scripture.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity (economic and ontological relation), Christology (incarnation, exaltation), Pneumatology (person and work of the Spirit), Covenant theology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology.

- **Closing line**
 - The NT's christocentric revelation is the decisive warrant for trinitarian doctrine: the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct persons revealed in redemptive history who together constitute the one God of covenant and salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on biblical, redemptive-historical grounding: Scripture's revelatory economy is the primary warrant for trinitarian doctrine.
 - Christ-centered hermeneutic: the Son's incarnation, death, resurrection, and exaltation are the pivot for reading Father and Spirit relations.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Cautions against both modalism (denying real personal distinctions) and social trinitarianism (over-privileging relationality at cost of unity/ontological unity).
 - Opposes speculative metaphysics that detach the Trinity from redemptive history.

- **Conceptual/terminological notes**
 - Treats the "economic Trinity" as revelation that legitimately and reliably informs the "ontological Trinity" without reducing doctrine to mere function or role language.
 - Uses Pauline benedictions and Johannine relational language to argue for personal distinctions without ontological subordinationism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, exegetically grounded introduction to NT trinitarian data.
 - Cited in courses and works that seek a biblical-theological, rather than speculative-philosophical, account of the Trinity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to derive doctrinal conclusions from canonical data; durable as a teaching/introductory piece linking biblical exegesis to systematic trinitarian claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**: The manner in which God is revealed in redemptive history (Father sending Son, Spirit applying redemption); primary locus for Gaffin's argument.
- **Ontological Trinity**: The eternal being of God; Gaffin holds that economic revelation legitimately informs our affirmation of ontological truth.
- **Johannine Prologue (Logos)**: Central NT text for showing both distinction and unity (Word as divine, sent yet with the Father).
- **Pauline Benedictions**: Texts like 2 Cor 13:14 used to demonstrate early triadic faith and doxological grounding for doctrine.
- **Baptismal Formula**: Matt 28:19 and baptism narratives as practice-based evidence of triune confession.
- **Perichoresis (relational indwelling)**: Employed cautiously - invoked to capture mutuality of persons without speculative metaphysics.
- **Personhood of the Spirit**: Affirmed through NT agency (witness, resurrection, sanctification) and interpersonal relations with Father and Son.
- **Christocentric Revelation**: The motif that the Son's life, death, and exaltation disclose the triune God.
- **Covenant Theology**: Framework linking trinitarian relations to covenant actions and promises.
- **Sentness (apostolic language)**: Emphasizes relational ordering in revelation (Father sends Son; Father and Son send Spirit).
- **Doxology as theological locus**: Early church prayers and benedictions as theological testimony to triune faith.
- **Anti-modalism emphasis**: Rejection of oneness-that-manifests-as-three models that deny real distinctions.
- **Economic-to-ontological warrant**: Affirmation that redemptive revelation gives legitimate access to doctrine of being.
- **Exegetical primacy**: Methodological principle: derive doctrinal claims from text before systematizing.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the biblical basis of Trinitarian doctrine in preaching and education.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how Pauline and Johannine texts are marshaled for trinitarian claims.
- As a **polemic tool** against modalism and reductionist social trinitarianism by appealing to redemptive-historical data.
