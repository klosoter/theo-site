### TITLE
Adam: The First and the Last - Simon Turpin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical theological milieu (21st century). Written for an audience versed in covenant theology, biblical exegesis, and systematic reflection on Adam-Christ typology.
 - Responds to both historical confessional formulations (Westminster tradition, Reformation readings of Romans and 1 Corinthians) and recent exegetical challenges (questions about federal headship, new approaches to Adam in biblical studies).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Adam functions as the representative first head of humanity whose fall is the ground for understanding sin, death, and the need for a representative Redeemer; Christ is the recapitulating, eschatological "last Adam" who reverses Adam's effects and restores creation.
 - The book seeks to clarify how Adam's role and sin are to be understood theologically and canonical-exegetically so that doctrines of original sin, imputation, covenant, and union with Christ cohere.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical prolegomena: readings of key texts (Genesis 1-3; Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) establishing Adam's representative function.
 - Historical-theological survey: traces patristic, medieval, Reformation, and confessional treatments of Adam, emphasizing continuity and key divergences.
 - Systematic construction: articulates implications for covenant theology (covenant of works vs. covenant of grace), anthropology (imago Dei, corporate personality), and Christology (Christ as recapitulation and new head).
 - Pastoral and soteriological application: how Adam-Christ typology shapes preaching, assurance, and the logic of justification and sanctification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages patristic figures (notably Irenaeus on recapitulation), Augustine, major Reformers (Calvin, the Westminster divines) and contemporary Reformed theologians.
 - Dialogues with modern biblical scholarship that question classical readings of federal headship or emphasize individualistic readings of Genesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (imago Dei, corporate humanity)
 - Original sin and its transmission
 - Federal headship and representation
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works; covenant of grace)
 - Christology (Christ as last Adam; recapitulation)
 - Soteriology (imputation, union with Christ, penal substitutional aspects implicit)

- **Closing line**
 - Turpin insists the theological logic of Scripture is anchored in the Adam-Christ axis: Adam's representative fall explains corporate human plight; Christ's representative obedience secures corporate and personal restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of canonical exegesis and covenantal-systematic theology to defend a robust doctrine of federal headship.
 - Emphasizes corporate/representative anthropology over individualistic models while still accounting for individual responsibility.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that minimize Adam's representative status or that treat Genesis as purely etiological/mythic with no covenantal-institutional import.
 - Offers a corrective to overly forensic-only accounts of salvation by integrating recapitulation and corporate renewal in Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the Adam-Christ relation with a sustained use of "first and last" as a canonical frame - not merely typological but constitutive for covenantal history.
 - Nuances the covenant of works so it is neither a brittle legalism nor an abstract construct but a relationally framed probation with representative significance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but growing influence in conservative Reformed circles as a succinct resource on Adam-Christ typology.
 - Serves as a bridge text for pastors and students seeking accessible theological synthesis without dense academic apparatus.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for courses on federal theology, soteriology, and biblical theology; useful for pastors addressing questions of sin, imputation, and union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **First Adam / Last Adam** - Adam as original representative head; Christ as final representative who undoes Adam's effects.
- **Federal headship** - The theological category describing how one person represents many; central to Turpin's account.
- **Covenant of works** - The pre-fall covenant/probation that structures Adam's representative responsibility.
- **Covenant of grace** - The post-fall divine arrangement fulfilled in Christ, interpreted as the corrective to Adam's breach.
- **Imputation** - Transfer of guilt/credit: Adam's sin to humanity, Christ's righteousness to believers.
- **Recapitulation** - Irenaean concept re-employed: Christ sums up and renews what Adam disordered.
- **Corporate humanity / corporate personality** - Emphasizes collective identity and representation in Scripture.
- **Imago Dei** - Explores how Adam's fall affected the image and how Christ restores it.
- **Original sin / transmission** - Treatment of how Adam's sin affects subsequent humanity (federal and ontological dimensions).
- **Union with Christ** - The relational bond by which believers partake in Christ's status as last Adam.
- **Typology** - Methodological stance: Adam as type fulfilled in Christ, with canonical consistency.
- **Penal/forensic language** - Present but integrated into a broader recapitulation and covenantal framework.
- **Representative obedience** - Concept that Christ's righteous act is effective for many as Adam's sin was.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise definitional source on **federal headship** and Adam-Christ typology in systematic and biblical theology courses.
 - As an exegetical-model example for reading Genesis-Romans-1 Corinthians in canonical continuity.
 - As a polemic against de-emphasizing corporate/representative readings of Adam in contemporary biblical studies.
