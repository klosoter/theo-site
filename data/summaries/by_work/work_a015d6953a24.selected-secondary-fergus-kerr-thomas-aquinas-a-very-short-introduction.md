### TITLE
Fergus Kerr, Thomas Aquinas: A Very Short Introduction (overview and interpretive notes)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary secondary synthesis (OUP Very Short Introductions series; early 21st century). Kerr writes as a Catholic scholar versed in modern Thomism, aiming to make Aquinas intelligible to modern readers while situating him in medieval scholasticism.
 - Milieu: 13th-century Latin Christendom; cross-currents from Augustine, Aristotle, Islamic and Jewish commentators; foundations for later neo‑Thomism and Vatican II appropriation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Kerr presents Aquinas as the exemplar of a theological synthesis: a thinker who integrates faith and reason, metaphysics and pastoral theology, and who treats salvation both as divine action in history and as a structured order of graced causality.
 - Problem addressed: how to hold the *historia salutis* (God's saving acts in history) together with an ordered theological account of how grace is given and effects salvation (*ordo salutis*).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Short biographical and institutional framing (Dominican formation; Paris; influence of Aristotle).
 - Method: faith seeking understanding; use of philosophical categories (being, causality, analogy) to explicate revealed truth.
 - Doctrinal anatomy:
 - God: ipsum esse subsistens; analogy of being; Trinity via relations of origin.
 - Creation and providence: teleology and final causality; primary and secondary causality.
 - Grace and salvation: distinction between order of knowledge (ordo cognoscendi) and order of being/causality (ordo essendi); sacraments as instrumental causes in historical economy.
 - Christology & redemption: Christ as principal cause of grace, incarnation as the decisive *historia salutis* event.
 - Ethics and teleology: human beatitude as final end; virtues and moral formation.
 - Closing move: Aquinas offers a theology that is at once anchored in the historical acts of salvation and systematic about the causal order by which those acts effect sanctification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Aristotle (structure of causality, motion), Augustine (memory, time, grace), Pseudo‑Dionysius (negative theology), medieval commentators (Averroes, Avicenna), Church Fathers and scholastic peers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, God (being, Trinity), creation, providence, sin, grace (prevenient, actual, habitual), Christology, sacraments, justification (infused righteousness), teleology/eschatology, moral theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Kerr reads Aquinas as a realist theologian who refuses a sharp split between the narrative of God's saving deeds and the ordered causal account of how those deeds bring about sanctification: Aquinas holds both the *historia salutis* and an *ordo salutis* grounded in metaphysical causality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on the metaphysical basis: God as *ipsum esse subsistens* grounds theological claims rather than purely scriptural-linguistic models.
 - Integration of sacramental theology into causal order: sacraments are real instrumental causes, not merely signs.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects overly pietistic or purely narrativist readings by insisting on causal/ontological dimensions of grace.
 - Contrasts with Augustinian-Platonizing emphases by reintroducing Aristotelian categories (substance, act/potency).
 - Differs sharply from Reformation accounts (e.g., forensic justification, sola fide): Aquinas gives priority to infused grace and habitually sanctified righteousness.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear use of ordo cognoscendi vs ordo essendi to mediate theological explanation and historical narration.
 - Operationalization of primary/secondary causality to protect divine sovereignty while accounting for creaturely agency.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Catholic theology, neo‑Thomist revival, and Vatican II theological resources.
 - A resource in ecumenical dialogue - admired for rigor but contested on justification, sacraments, and merit.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogical clarity of method; durable vocabulary for debates on grace, causality, and the relation of history to theological order.
 - A go‑to model when one needs a systematic account that does not marginalize scriptural narrative.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ipsu m esse subsistens** - God as pure act of being; metaphysical foundation for theology.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - predication about God is neither univocal nor merely equivocal; central to theological language.
- **Ordo cognoscendi / ordo essendi** - distinction between the order of understanding (how we come to know) and the order of being/causality (how things actually stand); key to reconciling historia vs ordo.
- **Historia salutis** - the narrative of divine saving acts (incarnation, passion, resurrection); foundational for Aquinas but interpreted through causal categories.
- **Ordo salutis** - theological ordering of how grace operates (prevenient, actual, habitual grace; sacraments; final perseverance); treated as causal/teleological sequence rather than merely abstract taxonomy.
- **Primary and secondary causality** - God as first cause who acts through secondary causes (creatures, sacraments), preserving divine sovereignty and creaturely agency.
- **Habitual (sanctifying) vs actual grace** - infusion of righteousness (habit) vs momentary divine help (actual graces); central to Aquinas' account of justification and sanctification.
- **Sacraments as instrumental causes** - sacraments effect what they signify because they are real causes instituted by Christ (*ex opere operato* orientation with Thomistic nuance).
- **Infused justification / merit** - righteousness as inwardly given and increased by cooperation; differs from forensic imputation.
- **Final causality / beatitude** - human telos is participation in divine beatitude; ethics teleologically ordered.
- **Analogy vs cataphatic/apophatic theology** - balance of positive predicates and negative theology (influenced by Dionysius).
- **Concurrence** - explanation of how divine causality co‑operates with human free action.
- **Teleological anthropology** - human acts oriented toward end; virtues as habituation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Thomistic method (faith+reason; ordo cognoscendi/essendi).
 - As a **polemic reference** in debates over justification and sacraments against Reformation readings.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading salvation doctrine that preserves both the historical narrative and systematic causal order (bridging *historia salutis* and *ordo salutis*).
