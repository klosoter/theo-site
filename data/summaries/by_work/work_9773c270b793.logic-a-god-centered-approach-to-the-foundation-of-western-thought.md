### TITLE
**Logic: A God-Centered Approach to the Foundation of Western Thought** - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed scholarly milieu; interaction with analytic philosophy of logic, history of Western thought, and Reformed systematic theology.
 - Aimed at theologians and philosophically-informed pastors/students who wish to relocate logic within a robustly Christian metaphysical and epistemological framework.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Logic is ultimately grounded in the character and triune structure of God.** Logical laws are not autonomous abstractions nor mere human conventions; they reflect the rationality of the Creator and the relational being of the Trinity, and operate reliably in creation because God sustains and orders it.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of historical accounts of logic (Greek, medieval, modern) to show competing foundations (ontology, mind, convention).
 - Critique of secular or autonomous foundations for logic: either reduction to brute facts, human minds, or arbitrary divine fiat.
 - Positive proposal: a theocentric account with several coordinated moves:
 - **Ontological grounding:** logical relations correspond to feature of creaturely reality because God created and sustains creatures coherently.
 - **Normative grounding:** logical laws bind because they issue from God's rational nature-God is not arbitrary but consistent in will and intellect.
 - **Trinitarian accent:** the relationality within the Trinity supplies a model for relational logical categories (relations of persons, relations of truth, coherence).
 - **Epistemic access:** knowledge of logic is possible because God made us rational and grants common/preparatory grace and special revelation; human logic functions even before conversion because of common grace.
 - Application to specific doctrinal issues: divine decrees (election/reprobation) and freedom, analogia entis vs. analogia fidei, communicatio idiomatum and Christology as models for resolving certain logical puzzles about identity and predication.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical: Aristotle, Boethius; Medieval: Augustine, Aquinas; Modern: Descartes, Kant, Hegel; Contemporary analytic logicians (Frege, Russell), Reformed thinkers (Van Til among others).
 - Poythress engages Van Til specifically on language for God and critiques one-sided formulations, while affirming his presuppositional impulse.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper (God's nature, Trinitarian relations), Bibliology (revelation as corrective to autonomous reason), Christology (communicatio idiomatum, hypostatic union as paradigm for predication), Soteriology (common/preparatory grace), Doctrine of Sin (limits of fallen reason), Election/reprobation (logical coherence with divine decrees).

- **Closing line**
 - The work aims to reorient logic so that the discipline coheres with and derives authority from the triune Creator who makes, sustains, and discloses rationality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly triadic argument: the Trinity is not merely theological ornament but a conceptual anchor for understanding relations, predication, and personhood in logic.
 - Integration of historical scholarship on logic with systematic theological categories rather than treating them as parallel tracks.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects purely Platonic or Aristotelian autonomy of forms as metaphysical ground; opposes purely conventional or humanist accounts of logic.
 - Nuanced critique of Van Til: affirms presuppositionalism but presses for clearer trinitarian interpersonal language and avoids reduction to "one-person" verbalism.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - "God-centered logic" as a working technical term - not mere apologetic slogan but a program linking ontology, normativity, and epistemology to God's being.
 - Use of Christological categories (e.g., communicatio idiomatum) analogically to clarify how different logical predicates may legitimately apply in complex theological contexts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for offering a robust alternative to secular foundations; used in seminary seminars on doctrine-and-philosophy.
 - Stimulated discussion among philosophers of religion about grounding normative truths; respected for careful historical-synthetic treatment though debated by analytic philosophers on specifics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact program for teaching how theology reframes foundational philosophical disciplines; useful as a model for integrating doctrine and analytic inquiry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered logic**
 - Logic grounded in God's nature and relations rather than autonomous abstract entities or mere human conventions.

- **Trinitarian relationality**
 - The intra-Trinitarian relations used as paradigmatic for relational categories in logic (persons, relations, mutual knowledge).

- **Common grace / preparatory grace**
 - Explanation for why non-Christians can do valid logic and why secular science and formal reasoning function reliably.

- **Analogia entis vs. analogia fidei**
 - Critical treatment: warns against unguarded appeals to similarity of being (analogia entis) and favors a faith-shaped analogical approach that relies on revelation.

- **Divine decrees (election & reprobation)**
 - Treated for logical coherence: Poythress argues divine sovereignty and human responsibility can be framed without logical contradiction within a God-centered logic.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Employed analogically: helps model how different predicate-standards can apply legitimately to a single subject (e.g., divine and human attributes in Christ).

- **Hypostatic union**
 - Used as conceptual resource to discuss identity and predication problems in logic and theology.

- **Epistemology / knowledge of God**
 - Logic and epistemology interlock: knowledge of logical truths is possible because God has made humans rational and providentially sustains intelligibility.

- **Sin and free will**
 - Addresses effects of sin on rational faculties and how grace restores epistemic function; explains limits of fallen reason.

- **Van Til / one-person language**
 - Engages Van Til on presuppositional method and language about God; endorses the presuppositional thrust while advocating clearer trinitarian linguistic practice.

- **Normative grounding**
 - Logical oughts derive from God's rational nature; not arbitrary but inherent in divine consistency.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed account of logical foundations tied to theology proper.
- As a **polemic** against secular/Platonic or purely conventional foundations of logic and against naïve analogia entis.
- As an **exegetical-model/resource** for applying Christological doctrines (communicatio idiomatum, hypostatic union) to philosophical problems about predication and identity.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking systematic theology, apologetics, and philosophy of religion.
