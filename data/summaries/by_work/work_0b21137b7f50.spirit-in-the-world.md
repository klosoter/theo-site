### TITLE
**Spirit in the World** (Geist in Welt), Karl Rahner, 1939

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Pre-war German Catholic theology; early Rahner; emergence of transcendental Thomism via J. Marechal.
 - A philosophical-theological reading of Thomas Aquinas on knowledge (esp. De veritate q. 1) in conversation with Kant and Heidegger, against static neo-scholastic manualism.
- **Central thesis**
 - The human **finite spirit**, intrinsically **in the world**, knows finite beings because it is always already oriented toward **Being as such** as its unbounded **horizon**. This transcendental orientation grounds realist knowledge and intimates God as **absolute mystery** without objectifying God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - From sensation to intellect: rehabilitates Aquinas on phantasm, abstraction, and the agent intellect; affirms embodiment and mediation.
 - Intentionality and being: every act of knowing intends being; judgments implicitly refer to the **unconditioned**.
 - Transcendental preapprehension (**Vorgriff**): the intellect dynamically reaches beyond any finite object toward unlimited being; this is not a concept of God but the a priori horizon enabling knowledge.
 - Horizon and mystery: God is not contained among objects but is the ever-present, never-thematic ground of all knowing; realism is secured without naive empiricism or idealism.
 - Anthropological and theological upshot: the human is constituted by a restless openness to the whole of being; this openness renders revelation intelligible as God's self-communication and frames grace as elevating, not bypassing, nature.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle; Joseph Marechal; critical dialogue with Kant (conditions of possibility) and Heidegger (being/horizon); corrective to neo-scholasticism; backdrop to debates with Barth on analogy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology & creation:** embodiment, intellect, desire to know, creaturely finitude.
 - **Theology proper:** God as absolute mystery and horizon; analogical being.
 - **Bibliology:** transcendental conditions for revelation's reception; the subject as hearer.
 - **Sin:** refusal or closure against transcendence; distortion of intentionality.
 - **Pneumatology:** anticipates account of the Spirit's elevating presence to the human spirit.
 - **Soteriology:** fulfillment of the transcendental dynamism in the beatific vision (later elaborated).
- **Closing line**
 - The work's center: the human spirit's world-embedded, transcendental openness to the **absolute mystery of God**, grounding knowledge while calling nature to be elevated by grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Worldliness of spirit:** no disembodied intellect; mediation through sense and history.
 - **Horizon language:** God as ever-present, non-objectifiable ground of knowing.
 - **Dynamic anthropology:** the intellect's unrestricted desire for being.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **neo-scholastic extrinsicism**: grace perfects an already God-open nature.
 - Against **naive empiricism**: knowledge is possible only via transcendental orientation, not mere sense-data.
 - Against **idealism/skepticism**: maintains realist intentionality toward being.
 - Nuanced alternative to **Barth's Nein** to the analogia entis: affirms an openness to God without positive natural concepts of God-as-object.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Vorgriff** (preapprehension of being); **categorical vs transcendental** knowledge; **unconditioned** as implicit referent of judgment; God as **absolute mystery**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Rahner's corpus (Hearers of the Word; supernatural existential); major catalyst in Catholic theology pre- and post-Vatican II.
 - In Reformed theology: valued for a robust doctrine of creation and human knowing; critiqued for anthropocentric method or perceived blurring of nature/grace; often a dialogue partner on natural knowledge and analogy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a stable bridge between Thomistic realism and modern critical philosophy.
 - Provides a vocabulary to speak of God's transcendence without fideism or rationalism.
 - Supplies anthropological and epistemic grounding for doctrines of revelation, sin, and grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Finite spirit (Geist):** the embodied human subject whose knowing is intentional and world-mediated.
- **Vorgriff (preapprehension):** the intellect's anticipatory, non-thematic reach toward unlimited being that conditions every finite act of knowing.
- **Horizon of being:** the unrestricted backdrop within which objects appear; God is the ultimate horizon.
- **Unconditioned (das Unbedingte):** what judgment implicitly seeks as the ground of truth; intimates God without objectifying God.
- **Categorical vs transcendental knowledge:**
 - Categorical: knowledge of determinate objects.
 - Transcendental: implicit awareness of being itself that makes categorical acts possible.
- **Intentionality:** the directedness of intellect to being; safeguards realism.
- **Phantasm and abstraction:** Aquinas's account of sense-based mediation and the agent intellect's role in forming intelligible species.
- **Ens in communi:** being-in-general as known by the intellect; not a genus, but the scope of metaphysics.
- **Absolute mystery:** God as ever-nearer and never-comprehended; known only as horizon, not as an object among objects.
- **Potentia obedientialis:** creaturely capacity to be elevated by grace; here presupposed by nature's openness.
- **Unrestricted desire to know:** the intellect's innate dynamism toward totality; signals orientation to God.
- **Transcendental Thomism:** Rahner's synthesis of Aquinas with transcendental method via Marechal.
- **Worldliness of spirit:** insistence that knowing occurs within historical, material mediation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Anthropology/Creation: defines the human as transcendently open, embodied knower.
 - Theology proper: frames talk of God as horizon and mystery; calibrates natural knowledge.
 - Bibliology: articulates the subject's a priori openness to revelation and Word.
 - Sin and Soteriology: supplies categories for sin as refusal of transcendence and grace as fulfillment of the dynamism toward God.
