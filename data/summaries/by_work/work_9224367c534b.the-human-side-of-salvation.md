### TITLE
The Human Side of Salvation - B. B. Warfield 
Late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton Reformed theology; lecture/essay concerned with human responsibility, sin, and the role of human acts within divine salvation.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Product of Princeton theology during Warfield's mature years; addresses controversies over free will, conversion, and the psychological analysis of volition current in modern philosophy and pastoral controversies with Arminian and semi-Pelagian positions.
 - Engages both patristic/Reformation authorities and contemporary philosophical psychology to defend Reformed soteriology against modernizing impulses.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to account for the "human side" of salvation (faith, repentance, obedience) without compromising divine sovereignty and monergistic regeneration; to vindicate human responsibility amid radical corruption and divine initiative.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: human nature is radically affected by sin such that natural powers cannot effect saving change.
 - Analysis of freedom/will: distinguishes types of freedom (ability to do otherwise in the sense relevant to moral responsibility vs. causal independence) and argues for a compatibilist understanding-will acts according to inclinations but remains morally responsible.
 - Grace and regeneration: asserts regeneration is a sovereign divine act (monergism) that changes desires and makes human faith and repentance genuine human acts, not mere automatism.
 - Synthesis: human acts in salvation are truly human and voluntary though produced by divine efficacious grace; this protects both God's sole efficacy and responsible human agency.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine and Calvin (as positive authorities), Arminius and semi-Pelagians (as negative foils), contemporaries in psychology/ethics (analytic accounts of will), and Princeton colleagues.
 - Scripture and Reformed confessions as theological foundations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin and total depravity, human will/freedom, regeneration, grace (efficacious/irresistible), faith, repentance, justification and sanctification (practical implications).
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the theological center of gravity in a robust Reformed synthesis: salvation is wholly of God in its origin and causation while remaining genuinely human in experienced response because sovereign grace transforms the will.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful psychological analysis of volition that affirms real human agency while denying autonomous moral power to effect conversion apart from divine grace.
 - Clear distinction between "power to originate" and "power to perform" in moral acts, used to defend responsibility without endorsing natural ability for saving change.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against semi-Pelagian and Arminian appeals to an inherent human ability to cooperate in initial conversion.
 - Corrects popular caricatures that monergism renders human acts non-genuine by insisting on the authenticity of will after regeneration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced deployment of compatibilist language applied to regeneration: human choice is real though its motive springs from grace-renewed desire.
 - Clarifies distinction between antecedent/prevenient grace (as insufficient apart from effectuality) and efficacious effecting grace.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed circles as a model defense of monergistic regeneration that takes seriously human experience and moral culpability.
 - Influenced later conservative Reformed systematicians and pastoral theology; used in debates with Wesleyan and Arminian theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact bridge between philosophical accounts of the will and classical Reformed soteriology; valuable for teaching on conversion, pastoral practice, and debates over freedom and grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total depravity** - human nature corrupted so that natural faculties cannot produce saving faith.
- **Monergism** - regeneration as an act performed solely by God; human will is not the ultimate causal source.
- **Compatibilist freedom** - human freedom understood as acting according to desire/character while still morally responsible.
- **Efficacious/irresistible grace** - grace that actually brings about the will's renewal and produces faith, contrasted with merely prevenient or non-effectual grace.
- **Prevenient/antecedent grace** - grace preceding personal response; Warfield distinguishes it from effectual grace that accomplishes regeneration.
- **Regeneration** - sovereign work of God that renews desires and enables true human faith and repentance.
- **Faith (as human act)** - presented as a genuine voluntary response produced in a renewed heart, not a spurious or coerced movement.
- **Repentance** - ethically and volitionally real consequence of regeneration; not merely intellectual assent.
- **Responsibility** - maintained by distinguishing categories of freedom and causation; sinners remain culpable despite inability.
- **Moral ability vs. natural ability** - moral ability is the disposition/heart orientation required to choose God; natural ability is superficial capacity which sin renders ineffectual.
- **Volitional psychology** - Warfield's use of psychological categories to show how desires, motives, and causation interplay in conversion.
- **Synergism (rejected for initiation)** - cooperative models are critiqued; Warfield accepts a form of cooperation only subsequent to initial divine act in sanctification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed accounts of regeneration, freedom, and efficacious grace.
- As a **polemic** against semi-Pelagian and Arminian positions in historical and contemporary debates.
- As an **exegetical-model resource** linking biblical texts on conversion with psychological/theological analysis of the will.
