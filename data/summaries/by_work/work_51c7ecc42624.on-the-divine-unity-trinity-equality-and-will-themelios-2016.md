### TITLE
On the Divine Unity: Trinity, Equality, and Will (Themelios, 2016) - Fred Sanders

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in Themelios (2016) amid renewed debate over **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** and its ecclesial implications (notably in complementarian discussions).
 - Situated within contemporary analytic and patristic-informed Trinitarian scholarship that seeks to keep classical orthodoxy central while engaging modern social-Trinitarian and anti-subordination concerns.

- **Central thesis**
 - Sanders argues that the divine persons share a single, undivided **divine will**, and that affirming any eternal subordination of will undermines the traditional doctrine of divine unity and risks covert subordinationism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies meanings: distinguishes **will** (the faculty/act) from **relations of origin** and from **economic roles**.
 - Historical-theological survey: shows classical sources (Cappadocians, Augustine, later scholastic formulations) ground a unitary divine will and that bona fide distinctions among persons do not entail distinct wills.
 - Logical-theological move: if persons have different wills, the divine will is not one, threatening divine simplicity and the unity necessary for operations, decrees, and revelation.
 - Pastoral and polemical application: critiques contemporary proponents of EFS (e.g., Ware, Grudem) for framing subordination in terms that conflate **role** with **ontological will**, and warns against deriving ecclesial authority models from a compromised doctrine of God.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: proponents of EFS (notably voices in evangelical complementarianism).
 - Primary sources: patristic (Cappadocians, Augustine), medieval scholastic categories of will and operation, modern analytic Trinitarianism.
 - Secondary conversation with social-Trinitarian emphases (perichoresis, mutual indwelling) to stress relationality without will-diversity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (immanent vs. economic), **divine will**, **divine simplicity**, **relations of origin**, and implications for **Christology** and ecclesial authority.

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers the claim that the unity of God includes a **single, shared divine will**, and that preserving this unity is decisive for guarding orthodoxy against subtle forms of subordinationism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses **unity of will** as the decisive criterion for rejecting eternal subordination of persons; does not merely rehearse ontological equality but situates will centrally.
 - Marries patristic-historical attention with analytic precision about intentionality and agency.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects EFS proponents who decouple relational ordering from any claim about a single will, arguing that such decoupling either collapses into equivocation or covertly accepts multiple divine wills.
 - Contrasts with social-Trinitarian models that risk hypostasizing relations into separable volitional centers.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tightens the language around **will vs. willing** (faculty/act) and draws clearer lines between **economic roles** and **immanent properties**, reducing semantic slippage in debate.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles as a precise corrective to EFS-based formulations; used by both academic and pastoral theologians to argue that complementarian commitments must not depend on ontological subordination.
 - Influential in prompting further analytic-patristic work on divine will and unity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, teachable corrective that keeps classical metaphysical commitments visible in contemporary controversies; useful for seminary courses on the Trinity and for pastors navigating doctrinal-political flashpoints.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - The claim that Son and Spirit are eternally subordinate in role; Sanders critiques versions that imply distinct wills.
- **Unity of will** - The central term: one will shared by Father, Son, Spirit; necessary for divine unity.
- **Ontological equality** - Equality of being among persons; Sanders ties this to shared will to prevent equivocation.
- **Will (faculty) vs. willing (act)** - Distinction used to prevent conflating multiple acts with multiple faculties/persons.
- **Relations of origin** - Father begets, Son is begotten, Spirit proceeds; held distinct from any claim of distinct wills.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity** - Sanders insists economic roles do not imply immanent will-difference.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling** - Cited as relational vocabulary consistent with unity of will, not as permission for will-plurality.
- **Divine simplicity** - Invoked as a boundary marker: multiplicity of wills threatens simplicity.
- **Subordinationism** - Heretical tendency Sanders warns EFS can approach if poorly framed.
- **Order of origin** - Temporal/logical ordering of relations distinguished from volitional ordering.
- **Inseparable operations** - The doctrine that divine actions are not divided between persons; supports shared will claim.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** resource against EFS in theological and ecclesial debates (complementarian/egalitarian contexts).
- As a **definition source** and clarifier for courses on Trinity and divine will: succinctly articulates why one will is the orthodox standard.
- As an **exegetical-conceptual model** for reading texts about Father-Son interplay without positing eternal will-distinctions.
