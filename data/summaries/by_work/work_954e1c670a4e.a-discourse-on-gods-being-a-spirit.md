### TITLE
A Discourse on God's Being a Spirit - Stephen Charnock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 17th-century English Puritanism; delivered as part of Charnock's sermons/lectures later collected in The Existence and Attributes of God. Milieu: post-Reformation Reformed scholasticism shaped by pastoral concerns and rigorous metaphysical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God is immaterial and spiritual in essence; this truth structures correct worship, guards divine transcendence, and grounds key divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical anchor: John 4:24 ("God is spirit") - Charnock unpacks lexical, contextual, and theological import.
 - Negative theology: establish what God is not (not corporeal, not composite, not subject to passions) to protect divine holiness and otherness.
 - Positive consequences: from spirituality of being derive aseity (self-existence), simplicity (non-composition), immutability (unchangeableness), and impassibility (freedom from passions).
 - Practical application: implications for worship (spiritual and truthful), prayer, and Christian devotion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture foremost; frequent engagement with Reformed authorities (Calvin and Puritan exemplars), patristic and scholastic language used critically (Augustine, Aquinas) - often rejecting literalism of some medieval formulations and resisting Socinian/materialistic readings; rhetorical opposition to anthropomorphism and popular religiosity.
- **Doctrines treated:** divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility); revelation and worship (spirituality of worship); Trinity is presupposed though the emphasis is on divine essence rather than intra-Trinitarian distinctions; Christology minimally touched as necessary for accommodation.
- **Closing line:** God's spirituality is the principial datum that secures his purity, self-existence, non-compositional being, steadfastness, and freedom from passions, and it obliges worshippers to a spiritual, truth-grounded devotion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strongly integrates doctrinal metaphysics with pastoral application: the ontological claim "God is spirit" is immediately translated into how Christians must worship and conceive God.
 - Persistent use of negative (apophatic) method to preserve divine transcendence while still affirming communicable aspects of God.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against anthropomorphic tendencies in popular devotion and crude literalism in biblical description of God.
 - Counters materialistic or deistic tendencies that reduce God to mechanistic forces by insisting on personal spirituality and causal agency.
 - Clarifies scholastic categories (simplicity, immutability) without collapsing them into abstracted philosophy divorced from biblical doctrine.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the functional consequences of spirituality: not merely metaphysical immateriality, but a grounding for aseity, impassibility, and the propriety of spiritual worship.
 - Makes clearer links between simplicity (no parts) and impassibility (not subject to passions) than many contemporaries did.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and Puritan theological education; prized for clarity, pastoral tone, and argumentative rigor.
 - Frequently cited in later Reformed systematic theologies and devotional literature as a compact defense of divine spirituality and its practical consequences.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact model of how metaphysical doctrine and pastoral worshipal instruction can be integrated.
 - Valuable for teaching negative theology, doctrinal coherence among attributes, and for polemic against anthropomorphism and theological reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit:** central term - immaterial, non-corporeal essence; personal in agency and presence; not a bodily substance.
- **Immateriality:** denial of physical parts or extension; grounds omnipresence as non-spatial presence.
- **Simplicity:** God is non-composite; no parts, faculties, or internal metaphysical divisions; used to defend unity and prevent passive change.
- **Aseity:** self-existence and self-sufficiency; flows from spirituality - God's being is not dependent on matter or cause.
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo essential change; spiritual being secures permanence of will, knowledge, and essence.
- **Impassibility:** God is not subject to passions or emotional perturbations as caused by external contingencies; anthropopathic language is accommodated but not literal.
- **Omnipresence (spiritual presence):** presence not confined to spatial location; tied to immaterial nature of God.
- **Anthropomorphism / Anthropopathism:** human language about God's body or passions explained as accommodation; Charnock warns against literalizing such language.
- **Negative theology (apophaticism):** method for describing God by negations to protect transcendence and simplicity.
- **Worship "in spirit and truth":** doctrinal application - spiritual nature of God prescribes inward, sincere, gospel-shaped worship.
- **Personhood vs. Substance:** preserves divine personhood (relational, volitional) while denying corporeal substance.
- **Accommodation:** the principle that Scripture speaks in human terms without implying anthropic truth about God's essence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definitional source for the doctrine that God is immaterial/spiritual and the immediate implications for aseity and simplicity.
- As polemic against anthropomorphism, materialism, and emotivist portrayals of God (useful in apologetics).
- As an exegetical model for interpreting John 4:24 and related texts that require harmonizing accommodation with divine transcendence.
- As a conceptual pivot linking metaphysical attributes (simplicity, immutability, impassibility) to pastoral practice (worship, devotion).
