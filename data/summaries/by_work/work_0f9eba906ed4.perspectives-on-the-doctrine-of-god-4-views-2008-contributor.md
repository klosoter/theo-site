### TITLE
Perspectives on the Doctrine of God: 4 Views (2008, contributor)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/academic milieu (early 21st c.); edited volume presenting four systematic options for understanding God's nature and activity.
 - Designed for comparative theology: each view defended, then replied to, with emphasis on a mix of biblical exegesis and philosophical theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The central problem: how to articulate a coherent doctrine of God that does justice simultaneously to biblical revelation (OT and NT), classical attributes (aseity, omniscience, immutability), the Trinity (immanent/economic distinction), and pastoral concerns (relation to creation, prayer, providence).
 - Implicitly tests which philosophical presuppositions (classical theism, openness, Molinism, social Trinitarian emphases) best fit the biblical data.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Four competing positions are presented in parallel; each defends a conception of divine attributes and the Trinity, followed by critical responses from other contributors.
 - Major argumentative moves across views:
 - Biblical-theological exegesis of OT and NT texts bearing on God's knowledge, will, and interpersonal life (see "Biblical Basis OT and NT Revelation of the Trinity").
 - Philosophical analysis of attributes (immutability, simplicity, omniscience) and how they cohere.
 - Response to contemporary proposals (notably open theism) regarding divine foreknowledge and providence (see "Open Theism and Divine Condescension").
 - Critiques of theological language and methodological presuppositions (e.g., one-person language critiques related to Van Tilian concerns - see "Van Tils One Person Language and Its Critique").

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Broad engagement with classical sources (Augustine, Athanasius, Aquinas), Reformed scholastics (Owen, Edwards), and contemporary voices (proponents of open theism, Molinism, social Trinitarianism).
 - Frequent cross-reference to hermeneutical debates about OT Christophanies and NT Trinitarian passages.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic vs. immanent), divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, impassibility), omniscience/foreknowledge (open theism vs classical), providence and human freedom, revelation (OT/NT witness), and divine condescension.

- **Closing line**
 - The volume's theological center of gravity: doctrine of God must be judged by a triad of biblical fidelity, philosophical coherence, and pastoral adequacy; no single methodology is assumed by all contributors, so comparative exchange sharpens both exegetical claims and metaphysical presuppositions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Designed explicitly as a multi-view dialogue: side-by-side presentation allows readers to weigh exegetical moves and metaphysical costs of competing claims.
 - Strong insistence across contributors that biblical narrative (both OT theophanies and NT Trinitarian formulations) constrains metaphysical options.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges pure classical theism to account for biblical depictions of divine temporality and responsiveness (a major critique coming from openness-oriented contributions).
 - Presses open theism to answer charges that it diminishes divine transcendence and the doctrine of condescension - contributors probe whether divine condescension can be preserved without classical immutability.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Renewed attention to methodological terms: "one-person language" critique (Van Tilian-style concerns about human linguistic limits in speaking of God) is used to question how adjectives and relational predicates are applied to the triune God.
 - Nuanced parsing of "foreknowledge" into philosophical subcategories (simple foreknowledge, middle knowledge, open-theist denial).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Used widely in graduate and seminary settings as a pedagogical tool for comparative studies on divine attributes and Trinity debates.
 - Provoked further essays and responses in journals addressing open theism, Trinitarian theology, and methodological hermeneutics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Endures as a compact diagnostic tool: clarifies trade-offs between biblical exegesis and metaphysical commitments and furnishes students a roadmap for constructive proposal-making.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical theism** - God as immutable, impassible, timeless/transcendent; benchmark for several contributors.
- **Open theism** - view that God's knowledge of the future is dynamic and partly contingent on creaturely decisions; treated as a principal interlocutor.
- **Divine condescension** - God's self-limiting disclosure to relate to creatures; debated in relation to immutability and openness.
- **Divine simplicity** - the claim that God is without metaphysical composition; tested against biblical plurality in God's life (Trinity).
- **Immutability** - traditional attribute; contested in its biblical and pastoral implications.
- **Omniscience (foreknowledge)** - parsed into classical foreknowledge, Molinist middle knowledge, and open-theist accounts.
 - Middle knowledge (Molinism) appears as an alternative to both classical determinism and open spontaneity.
- **One-person language (Van Tils critique)** - caution about projecting human singular-person predicates onto the triune God; used to critique careless monadic talk of God.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity** - distinction between God's activity in history and God's inner life; central hermeneutical axis in argumentative moves.
- **Perichoresis / social Trinitarian language** - relational descriptions of the Trinity used to defend God's interpersonal life without collapsing persons.
- **Providence** - discussions emphasize either meticulous governance or relational guidance compatible with creaturely freedom.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence discussed as constraint on relational accounts of dependence.
- **Revelation OT & NT** - exegetical locus for arguments about the Trinity and attributes (see cited topic: Biblical Basis OT and NT Revelation of the Trinity).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary positions on divine attributes and foreknowledge.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates over open theism and classicalism (testing charges about condescension, transcendence).
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating OT theophanies and NT Trinitarian passages into systematic proposals.
