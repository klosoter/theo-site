### TITLE
**Westminster and the Scriptures** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century Reformed scholarship interacting with the Westminster Confession and Puritan/Westminster divines.
 - Responds to modern challenges to scriptural authority (historical-critical method, ecclesial magisterium claims, and some forms of idealist/subjectivist theology).
- **Central thesis**
 - Westminster theology affirms the **self-attestation and divine authority of Scripture**: Scripture is the Word of God objectively because God is its author, and it is subjectively authenticated to believers by the Spirit without becoming a new revelation parallel to Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural authority in Westminster is rooted primarily in **divine authorship**: Scripture is authoritative because God spoke in and through it.
 - The Confession acknowledges the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** - necessary for appropriation and assurance - but this testimony does not create new propositional content nor make Scripture dependent on a private revelation.
 - Gaffin emphasizes a balanced account:
 - **Objective basis**: God as author gives Scripture its normativity and finality for faith and life.
 - **Subjective appropriation**: The Spirit's witness enables believers to recognize and trust Scripture; this is distinct from canonical endorsement by human institutions.
 - He defends that Westminster avoids two pitfalls:
 - Reducing authority to mere ecclesiastical fiat (Roman model).
 - Privatizing authority in subjective religious experience (radical subjectivism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: the Westminster Confession and divines, classical Reformed theologians (Calvin, Puritans), and 19th/20th-century defenders of biblical authority (e.g., Warfield-scale formulations).
 - Implied contrasts with Roman Catholic magisterial claims and with theological positions that overemphasize subjective illumination or minimize inspiration.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, Scripture (authority, sufficiency, perspicuity), the Holy Spirit (internal testimony/illumination), epistemology of faith.
- **Closing line**
 - Westminster theology presents Scripture as God's authoritative self‑revelation: objectively normative by divine authorship and subjectively grasped by the Spirit's witness, without admitting extra-biblical revelations or collapsing authority into ecclesiastical or purely experiential grounds.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear articulation of the **coordinated duality**: Scripture's authority is both objectively grounded and subjectively sealed - each necessary but not conflated.
 - Forceful rejection of any theory that makes the Church or private religious experience the final arbiter of scriptural truth.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that portray Westminster as naïvely literalist or as abandoning the necessity of the Spirit; Gaffin stresses theological nuance in the Confession's language on the Spirit's role.
 - Contrasts with Roman Catholic magisterial claims (authority resides in Church/Tradition) and with theological liberalism that relativizes Scripture to historical-critical findings or private experience.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasis on *self-attestation* not as a mystical infallibility claim but as a theological claim: Scripture's authority arises from its being the divine word and is confirmed by the Spirit within the covenantal context of God's people.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable for contemporary Reformed apologetics and ecclesial fidelity to the Confession; influential among scholars defending classical Protestant doctrines of Scripture and those refining the doctrine of illumination.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise corrective to distortions on both extremes (ecclesiasticism and subjectivism) and a pedagogical model for teaching the doctrine of Scripture in confessional contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation**
 - Scripture attests to its own authority because it is God's speech; not merely self-referential but grounded in divine authorship.
- **Internal testimony (of the Holy Spirit)**
 - The Spirit confirms the truth of Scripture to believers, enabling assurance and appropriation without adding new revelation.
- **Objective authority**
 - Normative status of Scripture derived from God as author; the final rule for faith and life.
- **Subjective appropriation**
 - The believer's reception and assurance of Scripture's authority via the Spirit's witness.
- **Divine authorship**
 - Central premise: God is the ultimate author of Scripture, making it normative and infallible.
- **Illumination (not new revelation)**
 - Distinction: illumination makes Scripture effective in the heart; it does not produce propositional additions to Scripture.
- **Magisterial contrast**
 - Westminster rejection of ecclesial magisterium as the primary authority over Scripture.
- **Sufficiency and perspicuity**
 - Scripture contains all necessary truth for salvation and is generally understandable to the faithful, with Spirit-led clarity.
- **Normativity**
 - Scripture's role as rule and guide for doctrine, life, and worship.
- **Assurance**
 - Spirit's witness produces confidence that Scripture is God's Word for faith and practice.
- **Canon and reception**
 - Canonical status is recognized, not created, by the Church; reception depends on the Spirit's confirming work.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed doctrine of Scripture (clarifying self‑attestation and Spirit‑witness).
 - As **polemic** against ecclesiastical and subjectivist distortions of authority.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching covenantally grounded epistemology: Scripture is objective divine speech rightly appropriated by Spirit-wrought faith.
