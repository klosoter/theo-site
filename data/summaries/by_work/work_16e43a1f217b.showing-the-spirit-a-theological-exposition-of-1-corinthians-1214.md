### TITLE
Showing the Spirit: A Theological Exposition of 1 Corinthians 12-14 - D. A. Carson (published 1987). 
Concise exegetical-theological treatment situated amid the 1980s charismatic/evangelical debates.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century charismatic renewal and rising debates in evangelicalism about continuity of sign gifts. Carson writes as a conservative evangelical/Reformed scholar addressing both charismatic excesses and simplistic cessationism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament (esp. 1 Cor 12-14) requires that Spirit-gifts be governed by apostolic norm, intelligibility, and corporate edification; tongues and prophecy have distinct functions and must be exercised in order - gifts served sign/authenticating purposes in the apostolic era and are to build up the church, not exalt individual experience.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Careful exegetical reading of 1 Cor 12-14 emphasizing linguistic, rhetorical, and situational features.
 - Key moves:
 - Distinguishes tongues (ecstatic prayer-languages) from prophecy (public speech to the church).
 - Demonstrates apostolic concern for intelligibility, order, and edification in worship.
 - Shows how Paul ranks gifts (prophecy over tongues) on grounds of corporate building and clarity.
 - Argues that certain gifts functioned as signs validating apostolic ministry and revelation.
 - Applies theological criteria (canon, apostolicity, Spirit-led order) to contemporary claims about gifts.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the contemporary charismatic movement and its proponents implicitly and explicitly; dialogues with both cessationist and continuationist positions within evangelical scholarship; uses patristic, historical, and Pauline scholarship to locate Paul's intent.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (role and manner of the Spirit in gifts), **ecclesiology** (worship, order, edification), **revelation** and **apostolic authority**, and indirectly **canon** (apostolic norm as regulative standard).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Spirit-given gifts must be discerned and regulated by apostolic instruction so that public worship remains intelligible and Christ-centered; gifts that were primarily apostolic signs should not be allowed to eclipse the church's ordered edification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Exegetical precision with pastoral application**
 - Carson combines rigorous grammatical-historical exegesis with clear pastoral prescriptions for worship and church order.
- **Balanced critique**
 - Critiques charismatic excess (unregulated ecstasy, private tongues paraded as public proof) without caricaturing genuine pneumatism; likewise resists simplistic categorical cessationism.
- **Apostolic-norm focus**
 - Unique insistence that the apostolic word functions as the primary criterion for assessing contemporary charismatic claims - gifts tested by apostolic standards, not merely subjective experience.
- **Terminological clarity**
 - Sharp functional distinction between tongues and prophecy, and between 'signs' and 'edification'.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely regarded in Reformed and broader evangelical circles as a sober corrective to uncritical charismatic practices; used by pastors and scholars as a go-to critical resource when assessing gift claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable model for integrating exegesis, theology, and pastoral care; enduring as a cautionary but not dismissive resource for churches wrestling with spiritual gifts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tongues (glossolalia)**
 - Understood primarily as ecstatic/private prayer-language; usable publicly only when interpreted.
- **Prophecy (prophēteia)**
 - Public, intelligible proclamation intended for edification, exhortation, consolation; superior in corporate worship.
- **Edification**
 - Central criterion for legitimate use of gifts - the building up of the body.
- **Order**
 - Paul's concern for regulated, intelligible worship; gifts to be exercised in sequence and under control.
- **Sign gifts**
 - Gifts that authenticate apostles and revelation (e.g., miracles, signs); historically connected with the apostolic age.
- **Apostolic norm / apostolicity**
 - The apostolic instruction and witness as test and boundary for contemporary claims about gifts.
- **Continuationism vs Cessationism**
 - Carson positions conservatively: acknowledges ongoing Spirit work but treats some gifts as primarily apostolic signs, leading to a cautious (qualified) cessationist posture for certain revelatory/sign gifts.
- **Charismatic excess**
 - Term for unregulated practices that prioritize ecstatic experience over corporate edification and apostolic norm.
- **Discernment / testing**
 - Frequent Pauline demand - gifts must be weighed against apostolic teaching and communal benefit.
- **Intelligibility**
 - Requirement that public speech in worship be comprehensible to promote corporate edification.
- **Corporate vs private use**
 - Distinction between private devotional gifts (e.g., private tongues) and public gifts (prophecy) with differing norms.
- **Spirituality**
 - Not merely ecstatic experience but conformity to Christ-like, ordered, and edifying life in the church.
- **Canonical implication**
 - Implied claim that canonical/apostolic revelation circumscribes normative practices of Spirit-gift expression.

How this work is used:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts on gifts with theological and pastoral care. 
- As a **polemic/resource** in debates between continuationists and cessationists - often cited as a moderate, nuanced critique of charismatic excess. 
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing tongues, prophecy, sign gifts, and for advocating apostolic norm in worship practice.
