### TITLE
Faith, Freedom and the Spirit: The Economic Trinity in Barth, Torrance and Contemporary Theology - Paul D. Molnar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed/Protestant theological conversation (late 20th-early 21st c.).
 - Dialogues with twentieth-century giants Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance; interaction with recent Trinitarian renewal and renewed interest in the economic-immanent relation.
 - Responds to perceived deficiencies in modern theology regarding the Spirit, freedom, and the ontological status of economic revelation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The economic Trinity (God as revealed in history, especially in Christ and the Spirit) is decisive for theology's account of faith and human freedom; the economic and immanent Trinities must be held together so that divine freedom, human freedom, and salvific agency are intelligible.
 - Seeks to safeguard both the personal relationality of the Trinity and the ontological reality of God's inner life as disclosed in God's redemptive acts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: identifies a split in recent theology between an overly immanent-focused Trinitarianism (speculative ontology) and an overly economic/functional account that risks reducing God to activity.
 - Recuperative move: drawing on Barth's Christocentrism and Torrance's ontological realism, argues that the Spirit functions as the mediating agent who actualizes the identity between God's being and God's acts.
 - Constructive move: develops an account of freedom and faith grounded in Trinitarian persons - freedom as participation in the divine life effected by the Spirit; faith as Spirit-mediated appropriation of the Christ-event.
 - Methodological posture: historically sensitive, dialogical reading of Barth and Torrance with constructive deployment for contemporary issues in pneumatology, soteriology and theological method.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Karl Barth, T. F. Torrance.
 - Secondary engagement: classical Trinitarian theologians (Augustine, the Cappadocians), contemporary Trinitarian renewal figures.
 - Scriptural exegesis is marshaled in support of theological claims, especially Christological and pneumatological passages.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic vs. immanent), Pneumatology, Christology, Soteriology (faith and freedom), Revelation, Theological method (ontology vs. event), Ecclesiology and ethics implied by Trinitarian freedom.

- **Closing line**
 - Molnar's theological center of gravity: the Spirit actualizes and secures the identity of economic revelation with divine being, making faith and genuine human freedom possible within a Trinitarian ontology grounded in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A sustained defense of the **economic-immanent continuity**: the economy is not merely functional but revelatory of the God who is.
 - Elevates the **Spirit** as the decisive agent who personalizes divine action and enables human freedom and faith, not merely as an adjunct power.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies in some Barthian readings that overly bracket the immanent Trinity or treat the Spirit as derivative; conversely, pushes back on speculative ontologizing (abstract "Godness") that severs God's being from God's redemptive acts.
 - Aligns with Torrance's insistence on theological realism while refining Torrance's formulations to keep the pneumatological role central.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of "freedom" - not libertarian autonomy but freedom as participation in Trinitarian life through the Spirit.
 - Reorients "faith" as a Spirit-wrought relational participation rather than merely assent or existential response.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among scholars interested in Trinitarian retrieval in Reformed and ecumenical contexts.
 - Serves as a corrective resource for theologians seeking a robust pneumatology integrated with Barthian and Torrancean frameworks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how Trinitarian doctrine grounds Christian conceptions of agency, ethics, and ecclesial life.
 - Useful in teaching to show constructive appropriation of Barth and Torrance for contemporary pneumatological concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed in history (Father sending Son in Spirit); the primary locus for theological knowledge of God.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God as God is in God's inner life; Molnar argues for identity with the economic through the Spirit's mediation.
- **Spirit / Pneumatology**
 - The agent who actualizes divine presence, produces faith, and enables freedom; central to Molnar's synthesis.
- **Faith**
 - Spirit-wrought participation in the Christ-event; relational and ontologically grounded rather than merely cognitive.
- **Freedom**
 - Freedom as participation in divine life (liberated, relational freedom), not autonomous self-determination.
- **Christocentrism**
 - Barthian emphasis retained: Christ as the decisive revelation of God, but now integrally linked to Spirit's ongoing work.
- **Theological realism**
 - Torrance-influenced insistence that theology refers to real divine relations and events, not only symbolic structures.
- **Economic-ontological continuity**
 - Key analytic claim: economic revelation discloses and is constitutive of divine being.
- **Kenosis / Self-giving**
 - Used to explain divine freedom and salvific ordering of persons in the Trinity and toward humanity.
- **Perichoresis / Relationality**
 - Mutual indwelling is deployed to account for the personal life of God as revealed in redemptive acts.
- **Revelation as event**
 - Emphasizes historical acts (Christ's life, death, resurrection) as the locus of God's self-disclosure.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for arguing that the economic Trinity must be treated ontologically (useful in systematic and dogmatic formulations).
- As a **polemic** against both abstract ontologizing and functional reductionism - equips critiques of modern individualism and impersonal metaphysics.
- As an **exegetical-pneumatological model** for preaching and sacramental theology: grounding faith and freedom in Spirit-mediated participation in Christ.
