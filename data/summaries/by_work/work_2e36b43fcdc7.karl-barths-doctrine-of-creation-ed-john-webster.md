### TITLE
Karl Barth, Doctrine of Creation (ed. John Webster) - research notes

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century reception of Karl Barth (material assembled and edited by John Webster for Anglophone readership). Barth writes against 19th-century liberalism and neo-scholastic natural theology; locates his account within the post-WWI theological reorientation that gave rise to dialectical/neo-orthodox theology.
 - Moves Barth's earlier dogmatics (Church Dogmatics) into focused treatment of creation as theologically presupposed and grounded in revelation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Creation is not an autonomous metaphysical given but the dependent, gracious, covenantal work of the Triune God mediated in the Word and realized definitively in Jesus Christ. The Imago Dei is grounded in this relation rather than in innate human capacities.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Creation must be understood through revelation: God's Word discloses both Creator and creature.
 - God's freedom and sovereignty are primary: creatio ex nihilo signifies absolute dependence and contingency.
 - Human creatureliness: humanity bears the image of God only insofar as it stands in responsive relation to God's Word and covenant - the true image is found in Christ.
 - Sin and the fall do not annihilate creatureliness but pervert the relation; redemption restores the true order of creation.
 - Practical corollary: any natural-theological claim that reads God off creation apart from revelation is illegitimate.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture centrally (Gen, Pauline anthropology), Augustine and Reformers (esp. Calvin) as precedents, and opposes modern liberal theologians (e.g., Schleiermacher-style anthropology) and proponents of autonomous natural theology. The Brunner-Barth controversy is the immediate polemical background.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity, Divine freedom, Creatio ex nihilo, Imago Dei, Providence, Sin and the Fall, Christology (as the locus of the true human), Election and reconciliation (linking creation and redemption).

- **Closing line**
 - Barth's doctrine of creation grounds the being and destiny of the world and humanity exclusively in the Triune God's Word and covenantal action, making Christ the decisive criterion for what it means to be truly created in God's image.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Radical Christocentrism: creation is intelligible only in and through the Word become flesh; the real "image of God" is the humanity of Christ.
 - Theocentric notion of creaturehood: creatureliness is active dependence, not a diminished form of divine being.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal and rationalist tendencies that posit an autonomous natural theology or a capacity-based Imago Dei.
 - Challenges scholastic/formalistic accounts that treat the image as intrinsic metaphysical attributes rather than relational vocation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Moves language from static "attributes" to relational/function-centered talk (humanity as creaturely relation to God's Word).
 - Emphasizes God's freedom to create (and not-create) as the theological hinge for understanding contingency and providence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to neo-orthodox and later Reformed theology; heavily influential in 20th-century systematic theology and on theologians rethinking anthropology and creation ethics.
 - Provoked sustained debate with Emil Brunner and shaped subsequent discourse on natural theology, imago Dei, and ecological theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust corrective to anthropocentrism and secular metaphysics; a durable model for integrating creation, revelation, and redemption in doctrine and practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation (creatio)** - God's free, covenantal act; absolute dependence of the world on God.
- **Creatio ex nihilo** - underscores contingency, denies creaturely autonomy.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - relational/vocational status: humans bear God's image only in responsive relation to God's Word; fully realized in Christ.
 - Contrast: not primarily a set of capacities or metaphysical likeness.
- **Word of God** - the medium through which creation is disclosed and constituted; includes proclamation and the incarnate Word.
- **Christocentrism** - interpretive principle: Christ is the measure and reality of creation's true form.
- **Divine freedom / sovereignty** - God's unconditioned freedom is decisive for creation, election, and providence.
- **Revelation** - epistemic ground: knowledge of creation must come from God's self-disclosure, not from autonomous reason.
- **Providence** - God's ongoing relation to creatures grounded in the creative Word and covenant.
- **Election / Covenant** - links creation and redemption: election shows the ordering purpose of creation toward reconciliation.
- **Sin / Fall** - misrelation within creaturely dependence; disrupts the image and ordering, remedied in Christ.
- **Creatureliness** - theological term for dependence and boundedness; normative category for ethics and theology.
- **Natural theology (critique)** - treated polemically; Barth denies unaided natural reason's capacity to ground knowledge of God or a normative account of the Imago Dei.
- **Revelational hermeneutic** - method: exegetical reading of Genesis and anthropological texts through Christ as normative.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source for a relational, Christ-centered Imago Dei (anthropology/ethics).
 - Polemic against autonomous natural theology and anthropocentric readings (apologetics/systematics).
 - Exegetical model for reading Genesis and Pauline anthropology through revelation and Christ (biblical theology).
