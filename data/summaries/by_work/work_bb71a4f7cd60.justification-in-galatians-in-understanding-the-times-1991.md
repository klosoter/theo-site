### TITLE
Justification in Galatians (Understanding the Times, 1991) - Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1990s post-New Perspective on Paul (NPP) debate; reaction within conservative Reformed and evangelical scholarship to readings of Paul advanced by E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, and emerging work of N.T. Wright.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Moo argues that Galatians portrays **justification as forensic (declarative) imputation of Christ's righteousness**, not primarily a covenantal declaration of membership or a sociological boundary marker. The doctrinal dispute centers on whether Paul's language of justification addresses legal status before God (traditional Reformation reading) or community identity under covenantal nomism (NPP reading).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Close exegesis of key Galatian loci (esp. Gal. 2:15-21; 3:6-14; 5:4) to show forensic vocabulary and courtroom metaphors.
 - Lexical and syntactic analysis of δικαιοω, δικαιοσυνη, "works of law", and related terms to support imputational semantics.
 - Theological linkage of justification to Christ's objective work (death, resurrection) and divine initiative (grace), not merely to group inclusion markers.
 - Polemical reconstruction of Paul's argument against Judaizers: works nullify the gospel because they reintroduce a legal ground for acquittal rather than affirm union with Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright (as representative of NPP trends), classic Reformers (Luther, Calvin) and contemporary conservative exegetes.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (forensic imputation), imputation vs. impartation, covenant and law, Christology (union with Christ), atonement (objective efficacy of Christ's death), grace vs. works, sanctification distinguished from justification.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Galatians defends a **declarative, imputational justification grounded in Christ's atoning work**, preserving the forensic heart of Pauline soteriology against readings that reduce justification to covenantal membership or social status.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reasserts the primacy of **forensic language** in Pauline soteriology with meticulous exegesis of Galatians.
 - Stresses the theological necessity of **imputation** for preserving the objective nature of salvation (Christ's righteousness accounted to believers).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct critique of NPP tendency to naturalize "works of the law" as ethnic boundary markers; argues it obscures Paul's juridical indictment of human attempts to secure acquittal.
 - Counters readings that collapse justification into covenant membership by showing Paul's courtroom idiom and concern for legal standing before God.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tightening of the contrast between **forensic imputation** and **covenantal participation** - not denying union with Christ, but arguing that imputation remains the primary Pauline motif in Galatians.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars as a clear, exegetically grounded rebuttal to NPP interpretations.
 - Became a go-to succinct statement for seminarians and pastors defending traditional doctrine of justification; NPP proponents continued to press counter-exegesis, so the debate remained active.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of combining careful lexical work with theological contouring; useful for showing how exegetical choices bear doctrinal weight.
 - Pedagogically helpful in distinguishing justification from sanctification and in clarifying imputational language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Verdict of acquittal before God; for Moo in Galatians primarily forensic and declarative.
- **Forensic (declarative) justification:** God's legal declaration that a sinner is righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness imputed to them.
- **Imputation:** The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; central explanatory mechanism in Moo's reading.
 - Contrast: **Impartation** (moral transformation) - important but distinct from forensic imputation.
- **Righteousness of God (δικαιοσυνη θεου):** Understood as the righteousness credited to believers via Christ, not merely God's covenantal fidelity.
- **Works of the law:** Moo resists reducing this to only ethnic boundary markers; interprets broadly as human attempts to secure justification by works.
- **Covenant nomism:** Term from NPP (Sanders) denoting maintenance of covenant through obedience; Moo critiques its application to Paul's forensic rhetoric.
- **Union with Christ:** Supports imputation theologically (union explains how Christ's righteousness can be reckoned to believers) but does not replace forensic description.
- **Grace vs. law:** Central polar contrast in Galatians; law as condition reintroducing legal ground, grace as gratuitous basis for acquittal.
- **Curse/curse of the law (Gal. 3):** Used by Moo to show legal consequences and need for Christ's substitutionary bearing of curse.
- **Sola fide (faith alone):** Reaffirmed as the instrumental means by which believers receive the declarative righteousness of God.
- **Sanctification:** Distinguished from justification; important to show moral change follows but is not identical to the forensic decree.
- **NPP critiques:** Moo engages NPP figures to defend traditional semantics and to warn against conflating sociological and juridical categories.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "forensic imputation" in Pauline studies and systematic treatments of justification.
- As a **polemic** and exegetical counter-model against NPP interpretations of Paul on justification and "works of the law."
- As an **exegetical model** in classrooms for combining lexical, syntactic, and theological argumentation when reading Galatians.
