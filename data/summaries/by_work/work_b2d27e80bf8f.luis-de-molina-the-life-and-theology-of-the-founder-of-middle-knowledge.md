### TITLE
**Luis de Molina: The Life and Theology of the Founder of Middle Knowledge** 
Kirk R. MacGregor

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 16th / early 17th century Iberian Counter-Reformation context; Molina as a Jesuit theologian reacting to scholastic disputes over grace and free will.
 - Major locus: the De Auxiliis controversy between Jesuits (Molina) and Dominican Thomists (Banez et al.), and subsequent papal scrutiny.
 - MacGregor situates Molina within Jesuit intellectual formation and wider early modern metaphysical and epistemological debates.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Molina seeks a coherent theological account that reconciles **divine omniscience and providence** with **genuine human freedom**-the classical problem of foreknowledge and free will.
 - MacGregor argues Molina's life and works must be read as an integrated project linking moral psychology, epistemology, and soteriology.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Biographical introduction showing formative influences (Jesuit training, Aristotelianism, engagement with contemporaries).
 - Exposition of Molina's principal treatise (Concordia liberi arbitrii) emphasizing:
 - Distinction of three logical orders of divine knowledge.
 - The rise of **scientia media** (middle knowledge) as the pivot.
 - Account of grace (sufficient vs efficacious, congruous grace) and how God actualizes a possible world without violating libertarian freedom.
 - Polemical section tracing Dominican objections (physical premotion, divine causation) and Molina's responses.
 - Assessment of legacy: theological, philosophical, and later reception.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Luis de Molina (works), Jesuit scholastic milieu.
 - Interlocutors: Dominican Thomists (Banez), Suarez and late scholastics, papal commissions.
 - Philosophical background: Aristotelian categories, medieval modal logic, emerging early modern notions of possible worlds.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine knowledge (natural, middle, free), providence, predestination and reprobation, grace (sufficient/efficacious/congruent), free will (libertarian), concurrence and divine causation, divine foreknowledge.

- **Closing line**
 - MacGregor presents Molina as a systematic attempt to preserve both **absolute divine sovereignty in providential ordering** and **robust human freedom** by relocating divine knowledge into a threefold epistemic structure centered on the inventively theological concept of middle knowledge.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats **scientia media** as a theological-epistemic move that reframes providence: God's choice is informed by counterfactuals of free creatures, not by coercive causation of will.
 - Marries careful philosophical analysis of modality with pastoral and soteriological concerns about grace.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Dominican **physical premotion** (God's intrinsic causal ordering of will) by defending libertarian contingency of creaturely choices.
 - Modifies classic Thomistic priority of divine causation by introducing a decision-providential order where God actualizes worlds in light of what free agents would do.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** as theological data.
 - Clear partitioning of divine knowledge into **naturalis, media,** and **libera** (natural, middle, free).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Historically controversial within Catholicism; sustained Jesuit school of Molinism; major target of Dominican critique and papal commissions.
 - Significant later impact: informed Arminian and many modern Protestant defenses of libertarian freedom; revitalized in analytic philosophy of religion (20th-21st c).
 - Contemporary influence as a middle way in discussions of providence, God's knowledge, and human freedom.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Offers a paradigmatic case of interdisciplinary theology: theology, metaphysics, and epistemology.
 - Valuable for teaching the persistence of classical problems (foreknowledge vs freedom) and for demonstrating methodological interplay between historical biography and doctrinal analysis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)**: God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any possible circumstance; central to Molina's solution.
- **Scientia naturalis (natural knowledge)**: God's knowledge of all possibilities independent of divine decree.
- **Scientia libera (free knowledge)**: God's knowledge of the actual world as willed-foreknowledge of what will occur.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom**: Propositions about what free agents would do under hypothetical circumstances; treated as true and knowable by God.
- **Libertarian free will**: Molina's anthropological presupposition: choices are undetermined and genuinely alternative.
- **Sufficient vs efficacious grace**: Distinction between grace that makes salvation possible and grace that ensures actual salvation without violating freedom.
- **Physical premotion**: Dominican thesis that God moves the will in a way that secures action-Molina opposes this.
- **Concurrence**: Doctrine about divine cooperation with created agency; Molina affirms concurrence without determinate causation of will.
- **Predestination and reprobation**: Molina's reading locates these within God's choice of a possible world informed by middle knowledge.
- **Possible worlds modal framework**: Implicit analytic tool: God selects an actual world from among possible worlds on the basis of middle knowledge.
- **Providence**: God's ordering of history via world-selection rather than intrapersonal coercion.
- **Concordia liberi arbitrii**: Molina's principal work; MacGregor analyzes its structure and argumentative moves.
- **Papal commission / De Auxiliis**: Historical context for controversy and censure risk.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **historical-theological monograph** for the development of Jesuit scholasticism and the De Auxiliis controversy.
 - As a **doctrinal/exegetical resource** for understanding how Molinism treats predestination, grace, and foreknowledge, and for comparative polemics with Thomism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates: source for definitions of middle knowledge and model for reconciling foreknowledge with libertarian freedom.
