### TITLE
The Historical Adam (selected articles and lectures) - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical analytic-theology and apologetics (late 20th-21st century). Works appear as journal articles, debate presentations, conference lectures (evangelical venues), and online essays. Situated amid debates between conservative evangelical literalists, literary/ancient Near Eastern readings of Genesis, and theistic-evolution proponents.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture (notably Paul) presupposes a single historical Adam whose fall is the ground for corporate human sin and death; denying a historical Adam undermines core doctrines (original sin, imputation, Adam-Christ typology).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical claim: Pauline texts (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) operate on the premise of a historical, seminal Adam whose act has real juridical/ontological consequences for humanity.
 - Theological claim: Doctrine of original sin requires a real ancestor/first head to whom sin and its consequences are imputed-federal headship is grounded in history, not merely typology.
 - Philosophical/theological defense: Arguments from metaphysics of personhood, divine action, and modality: God could and did create a historical first human pair and effect consequences for all humans (divine providence/causation can ground genealogical and imputation claims even amid scientific findings).
 - Engagement with science: Interaction with population genetics and paleoanthropology; Craig contests strong claims that genetics decisively rules out a historical couple and emphasizes limits of scientific inference about origins when theological commitments differ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary exegete), contemporary scholars such as John Walton and Denis Alexander (as interlocutors), evolutionary biologists/geneticists (pop-gen literature), historical theologians (Augustine, classical Reformed sources) indirectly through doctrinal categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and authority of Scripture; anthropology (Imago Dei); original sin and its transmission; Christology via Adam-Christ typology; providence/divine action; soteriology insofar as Adam's headship relates to need for and nature of Christ's atonement.
- **Closing line:** The work argues that a historical Adam is the necessary hinge between biblical witness and orthodox doctrine: without a real first man as federal head, Pauline doctrines of sin, death, and Christ's representative work lose their historical and theological grounding.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Combines rigorous analytic-philosophical argumentation with conservative exegetical commitments; uses modal arguments about divine action to preserve monogenism despite scientific challenges.
 - Stresses the primacy of apostolic exegesis (Paul) for shaping doctrine over modern scientific reconstruction when conflict arises.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on non-historical or purely typological readings of Adam (e.g., some literary/functional readings of Genesis) and against theological positions that detach original sin from a historical first pair.
 - Distinguishes from some theistic-evolutionists who locate Adam as a representative but not biological ancestor; Craig argues representation requires historical personhood.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-articulation of federal headship in analytic terms (imputation as a real metaphysical/juridical relation grounded in historical agency).
 - Emphasis on the logical/epistemic priority of the biblical narrative for doctrinal formations about human origins.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read and cited in conservative evangelical and apologetic circles; influential in debates over monogenism vs polygenism and the theological necessity of Adam.
 - Criticized by many biblical scholars, ancient Near Eastern specialists, and scientists who find the genetic and archaeological arguments for a historical sole progenitor untenable or who defend non-literal Genesis readings.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Valuable for its clear articulation of why the historical Adam matters doctrinally and for its model of integrating analytic philosophy with theological concern; serves as a robust polemical resource for those defending traditional doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historical Adam:** The thesis that Adam was a real, historical human whose actions have concrete consequences for all humanity.
- **Monogenism:** Doctrine that all humans descend from one original pair; defended as theologically required for original sin.
- **Federal headship:** Adam as representative/head of humanity whose guilt and consequences are imputed to his progeny.
- **Original sin:** The doctrine that human nature is corrupted and under condemnation through Adam's fall; requires historical grounding in Craig's account.
- **Imputation:** The juridical/metaphysical accounting of Adam's sin to human descendants and Christ's righteousness to believers.
- **Pauline typology (Adam-Christ):** The theological pattern Paul uses (Adam as type of Christ) treated as dependent on historical Adam for full doctrinal force.
- **Theological anthropology:** Treatment of Imago Dei, personhood, and the ontological status of human beings in relation to Adam's historicity.
- **Special creation:** The claim that God directly created the first humans (compatibly argued with divine action to secure monogenism).
- **Population genetics:** Scientific field Craig engages with; he argues methodological limits prevent decisive disproof of a historical couple.
 - Contrast: strong scientific claims of long-term large ancestral population (opposed or qualified by Craig).
- **Theistic evolution (critique):** Craig critiques versions that deny a historical Adam or locate Adam only as a representative without biological descent.
- **Hermeneutics (historical-grammatical):** Craig's preferred interpretive method privileging exegetical reading of Genesis and Paul.
- **Divine action/Providence:** Used to argue that God could intervene historically to produce a genealogical Adam consistent with theological needs.
- **Representative vs seminal headship:** Clarifies varieties of headship; Craig insists on historical personhood for representation to function theologically.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for conservative articulations of monogenism and federal imputation.
- As a **polemic** against non-historical readings of Genesis and many forms of theistic evolution.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline anthropology and Adam-Christ typology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking biblical theology of sin and atonement with philosophical defenses of divine historical action.
