### TITLE
"Providence" - Herman Bavinck, Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (entry). 
Author: **Herman Bavinck** (Dutch Reformed theologian, late 19th/early 20th c.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written by Bavinck within the early 20th-century Reformed theological milieu; contribution to James Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (period marked by response to deism, naturalism, and rising historical-critical methods).
 - Bavinck writing from the perspective of orthodox Reformed dogmatics seeking to articulate a biblical and systematic account of divine governance.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Providence is the comprehensive, sovereign, and wise governance of God over creation that secures divine ends while accounting for creaturely responsibility and the reality of evil.
 - Primary problem addressed: how to reconcile God's foreknowledge and governance with the existence of evil and human freedom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and dimensions:
 - Distinguishes **preservation** (sustaining creatures in being) and **government** (directing events toward ends).
 - Differentiates **general** vs. **special** providence and the roles of **primary** (God) and **secondary causes** (creatures).
 - Mechanism of governance:
 - Affirms **concurrence**: God cooperates with created causes so that their actions are truly theirs yet contingently dependent on God.
 - Allows for **permission**: God may permit evil acts without being their moral author.
 - Theodicy and foreknowledge:
 - Maintains that God's foreknowledge does not implicate God as the author of sin; evil is real and culpable in creatures though ordered within God's wise plan.
 - Emphasizes redemptive-historical resolution: providence culminates in Christ's work which reorients the problem of evil toward divine purposes.
 - Practical and pastoral implications:
 - Providence undergirds prayer, hope, and moral responsibility; rejects fatalism and indifferent deism.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Reformation and post-Reformation tradition: Calvin, Augustine, Reformed scholastics.
 - Polemical targets: deists, mechanistic naturalists, and positions that minimize divine sovereignty or responsibility.
 - Uses Scripture, dogmatic formulations, and historical theology as primary authorities.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - God (sovereignty, omniscience), creation, providence (preservation, concurrence, government), predestination, freedom and responsibility, sin and theodicy, Christocentric redemption.

- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers providence as the God-ordained, wise ordering of all things toward covenantal ends - fully sovereign yet morally righteous, preserving creaturely agency and grounding hope in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balanced upholding of meticulous divine governance without collapsing into fatalism; careful account of **concurrence** that preserves genuine creaturely causation.
 - Strong Christocentric framing: providence is not merely cosmic management but is fulfilled and interpreted in redemption.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Deistic accounts that limit God to first causes or general laws.
 - Simplistic determinisms that deny genuine human responsibility.
 - Molinist-style middle-knowledge solutions (implicit preference for classical Reformed treatment of foreknowledge and sovereignty).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies common Reformed technicalities (preservation vs. government; permissive will vs. decretive will) in accessible, systematic language for an encyclopedic audience.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a concise, authoritative Reformed statement on providence used widely in Reformed circles and in subsequent dogmatic works.
 - Influenced 20th-century Reformed treatments of theodicy and pastoral theology; often cited in discussions of concurrence and permission.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact synthesis for teaching, combining rigorous systematics with pastoral sensibility; valuable as a bridge between historical Reformed thought and contemporary theodicy problems.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Providence** - God's ongoing action of sustaining and directing creation toward his purposes.
- **Preservation** - Divine activity that keeps creatures in existence moment by moment.
- **Government** - Direction of events toward ordained ends; includes ordering of history.
- **Concurrence** - Doctrine that God cooperates with secondary causes so their actions are real yet contingent on God.
- **Secondary causes** - Creatures as genuine causal agents under God's overarching agency.
- **Permission / permissive will** - God's allowing of evil acts without being their moral author; distinct from God's decretive will.
- **Foreknowledge** - God's eternal knowledge of future contingent events; does not compel moral culpability.
- **Predestination / decretive will** - God's eternal ordination of certain ends and means, integrated with providential governance.
- **Sovereignty** - God's absolute authority and right to rule creation.
- **Theodicy / problem of evil** - The attempt to reconcile providence and the reality of evil; Bavinck highlights redemptive resolution in Christ.
- **General vs. special providence** - General: sustaining laws and order; special: particular direction of events and persons.
- **Compatibility / freedom** - Human freedom affirmed as morally responsible though compatible with divine sovereignty (Reformed compatibilist tenor).
- **Redemptive-historical focus** - Providence interpreted through Christ's work and covenantal purposes.
- **Anti-deism / anti-mechanism** - Works as polemic against views that deny providential involvement.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a definitional source: concise, systematic definitions for dogmatic and pastoral courses.
 - As polemic and model: used against deism/naturalism and as a template for Reformed theodicy and pastoral consolation.
 - As exegetical and conceptual pivot: supplies terms (concurrence, permission) for biblical exegesis and for integrating providence with soteriology.
