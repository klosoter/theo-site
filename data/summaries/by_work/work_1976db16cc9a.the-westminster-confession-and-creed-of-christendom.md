### TITLE
The Westminster Confession and Creed of Christendom - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton theological milieu; Warfield writes as a conservative Reformed apologist for historic confessionalism in an era of modernist challenge and rising denominational disputes over sacraments and eschatology.
 - Aimed at situating the Westminster Confession within the broader history of creeds and defending its doctrinal coherence and continuing authority for Reformed churches.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Confession accurately and faithfully summarizes biblical doctrine and the historic Christian creeds; it functions as a trustworthy doctrinal norm for the church without displacing Scripture.
 - Doctrinal problems addressed include sacramental efficacy (esp. baptism), the nature of the covenant, and eschatological affirmations about the Last Judgment and eternal states.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological exposition: traces the Confession's formation, sources, and relation to earlier creeds.
 - Doctrinal defense: systematic defense of key loci-God, Christ, covenant, sacraments, church, final judgment-showing scriptural basis and pastoral utility.
 - Polemic engagement: critiques antithetical views (e.g., sectarian baptismal theories, denialist eschatologies) and reasserts confessional formulations as corrective.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - The Westminster divines and Puritan theology; patristic and medieval creeds; Roman Catholic and Anglican opponents; Baptists and Arminians on soteriology and sacraments.
 - Uses Scripture, classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, Knox), and contemporary critics of confessionalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority (Scripture and subordinate role of confessions).
 - Covenant theology (continuity of covenant of grace; infant incorporation).
 - Trinity and Christology (orthodox formulations).
 - Sacraments (nature, sign and seal; baptism and the Lord's Supper).
 - Ecclesiology and polity (church marks and discipline).
 - Eschatology (Last Judgment; final and eternal states).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Warfield mounts a learned, pastoral defense of the Westminster Confession as the faithful doctrinal expression of Scripture that disciplines both error and careless modern reinterpretation while preserving the church's covenantal and sacramental life.

 - Key topical references: Warfield explicitly treats the Confession's teaching on the Last Judgment and eternal states (see discussion of "Of the Last Judgment") and on baptismal doctrine and practice (see discussion of "Of Baptism") (Warfield, discussion of "Of the Last Judgment"; Warfield, discussion of "Of Baptism").

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Stronger stress on the Confession as a pastoral and ecclesial instrument (not simply an abstruse systematic exercise).
 - Careful conciliatory language: upholds confessional authority while insisting on Scripture's sole infallibility.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects sectarian anti-confessional impulses (e.g., Baptist exclusivism about mode and timing of baptism) by stressing covenantal logic behind infant baptism and sacramental signs.
 - Opposes modernizing readings of eschatology that relativize the reality of eternal punishment; reaffirms classical teaching on conscious eternal states.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines language about sacramental "sign and seal" to guard against both mechanical sacramentalism and merely symbolic readings.
 - Emphasizes confessions as "creedal testimony" - normative within the church but strictly subordinate to Scripture.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in conservative Reformed circles; used in seminary instruction for confessional theology.
 - Influenced 20th-century defenses of confessional subscription and sacramental theology against both liberal theology and revivalist anti-intellectualism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of historically grounded, pastorally sensitive confessional theology; useful for teaching covenantal sacramentology and orthodox eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Confession (Westminster)** - doctrinal standard: explanatory, not equal to Scripture.
- **Scriptural supremacy** - Scripture is sole infallible rule; confession is subordinate.
- **Covenant of grace** - organizing principle for soteriology and sacramental inclusion (grounds for infant baptism).
- **Sign and seal** - the Reformed formula for sacraments; sign denotes sacramental representation; seal denotes assurance given to the recipient.
 - Contrast: Warfield resists both purely symbolic and magical readings of sacraments.
- **Infant baptism** - covenantal inclusion of children; efficacy understood in covenantal-not-automatic terms (seal of promise, requires faith and nurture).
- **Believers' baptism** - critiqued where used to deny covenantal continuity; Warfield defends confessional allowance for paedobaptism and non-reliance on immersion.
- **Mode of baptism (sprinkling vs immersion)** - Reformed practice allows affusion/sprinkling as valid; mode secondary to sign/seal meaning.
- **Justification by faith** - Reformed center reaffirmed against legalism and antinomian readings.
- **Predestination** - affirmed within covenantal context; re-articulated to guard pastoral assurance.
- **Final Judgment** - authoritative, personal, and final vindication/condemnation of persons; eternal states affirmed (conscious reward/punishment) (Warfield, discussion of "Of the Last Judgment").
- **Eternal states** - heaven and hell are real, everlasting states - not annihilationist or purely metaphorical.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - efficacy is spiritual and covenantal, not automatic; tied to promise and faith.
- **Subscription** - confessional subscription as ministerial integrity; subscription = binding assent with theological restraint.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental and covenant theology (esp. baptism).
 - As a **polemic resource** against sectarian baptismal claims and liberal/modernist denials of traditional eschatology.
 - As a **pedagogical/exegetical model** for reading confessions with historical sensitivity and pastoral application.
