### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Trinity: God's Being Is in Becoming - Eberhard Jüngel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post‑war German Lutheran systematic theology (late 20th century); dialogue partner to Karl Barth and the neo‑orthodox emphasis on revelation, reacting against both metaphysical onto‑theology and existentialist reductions. Jüngel writes within a Barthian-critical but constructively original frame, with sustained engagement of patristic (Cappadocian) trinitarianism and contemporary continental philosophy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God's ontological character cannot be understood as static substance; rather **God's being is constituted by self‑giving and personal relations (becoming)** revealed conclusively in the economic Trinity (Christ and Spirit). The key methodological move is to derive ontology from revelation rather than to presuppose a metaphysical analogia entis.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Critique of classical metaphysical talk about God (theologoumena that prescind from revelation), especially the **analogia entis** which claims a transferrable analogy between creaturely being and divine being.
 - Affirmation of **analogia fidei**: theological predication must be governed by God's self‑disclosure in Scripture and in the person of Christ; revelation furnishes the criterion and content of talk about God.
 - Reinterpretation of divine "being" (ousia) as a dynamic, relational reality: persons (hypostases) and their perichoretic relations are constitutive of divine being.
 - Use of Christology and pneumatology as decisive: the economic Trinity (Father‑Son‑Spirit in the history of salvation) is not merely external but revelatory and constitutive of God's inner being.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth (revelation primacy), Thomas Aquinas and Thomistic uses of analogia entis (as foil), Cappadocian Fathers (Gregory of Nyssa, Basil) for relational trinitarian categories, contemporary continental philosophers for ontology (background critique of Heideggerian/metaphysical tendencies).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (primary), revelation, Christology, pneumatology, the nature of theological language (analogy), ontology (God's being), and implications for doctrine of God (attributes, freedom, love).
- **Closing line:** Theological knowledge of God must begin with Christ‑revealed personal relation: God is not a static being to be grasped by analogy of creaturely being, but a dynamic personal life whose being is constituted and known in the economy of revelation - "being is in becoming."

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Bold claim that **ontological statements about God are derivative from the event of revelation**; ontology follows soteriology/christology.
 - Formulation that **God's being is essentially relational and temporalized in self‑giving**, captured in the aphorism "being is in becoming."
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Thomistic/Scholastic reliance on **analogia entis**; Jüngel argues this risks idolatry of human metaphysics and abstracts God from revelation.
 - Affirms and amplifies Barth's priority of revelation while supplementing with a more explicit trinitarian relational ontology (less negative metaphysics than some readings of Barth).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframing of classical terms (ousia, hypostasis) in a way that stresses relationality and event; returns to Cappadocians but refracts them through modern concerns about metaphysics and language.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential in late 20th‑century Lutheran and ecumenical trinitarian renewal; used as a bridge in dialogues between Barthian and some Thomistic thinkers, and in constructive theology that prizes revelation‑grounded ontology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating revelation, trinitarian doctrine, and systematic ontology; helpful for teaching how doctrine of God shapes theology across loci while avoiding static metaphysical traps.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Being is in becoming** - Core motto: divine being is enacted in self‑relation and revelation, not static substance.
- **Analogia fidei** - Theological analogy governed by faith and revelation; predication of God must be rooted in the Gospel and Christ's self‑disclosure.
- **Analogia entis** - The Thomistic claim of an analogy between creaturely being and divine being; Jüngel critiques this as methodologically illicit for theology.
 - Contrast: **analogia entis** presupposes a metaphysical bridge; **analogia fidei** presupposes revelation as normative.
- **Economic Trinity** - The self‑manifestation of God in history (Father in relation to Son and Spirit); for Jüngel, decisive for ontology.
- **Immanent Trinity / Relational ontology** - Reworked so that immanent relations are not speculative abstractions but grounded in revelation; perichoresis becomes ontologically constitutive.
- **Hypostasis (personhood)** - Emphasized as primary mode of divine being; persons and relations, not abstract substance, carry ontological weight.
- **Revelation as event** - Revelation is not propositional mere content but the decisive historical‑existential event that makes true speech about God possible.
- **Christocentrism** - Christological concreteness is the criterion for speaking of God; Jesus is the hermeneutical key for God's being.
- **Trinitarian relationality** - God's life is intrinsically relational (love, self‑communication), shaping doctrine of attributes (freedom, love).
- **Ontology from revelation** - Methodological axiom: do systematic ontology only in the light of God's self‑disclosure.
- **Perichoresis** - Reinvigorated as expressive of dynamic mutual indwelling that constitutes divine being.
- **Theological language (analogy)** - Stress on disciplined theological speech: analogical, not univocal, and bound to faith's confession.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a revelation‑grounded trinitarian ontology in systematic theology courses.
 - As a **polemic** against scholastic analogia entis in patristic, medieval, and modern dialogues.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading New Testament trinitarian texts Christocentrically.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in constructive theology linking doctrine of God with ethics, Christology, and ecclesiology.
