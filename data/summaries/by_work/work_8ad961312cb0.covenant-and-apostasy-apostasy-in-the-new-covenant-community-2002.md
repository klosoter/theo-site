### TITLE
Covenant and Apostasy: Apostasy in the New Covenant Community (2002) - Steve Schlissel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 2002 amid the early-21st-century debates over the Federal Vision and related monocovenantal proposals within Reformed and Presbyterian circles.
 - Responds to a renewed emphasis on covenantal continuity, corporate identity, and sacramental efficacy promoted by Federal Vision advocates and allied writers.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Schlissel argues that certain monocovenantal/Federal Vision formulations obscure the reality and theological meaning of apostasy in the New Covenant community, producing pastoral and doctrinal confusions about membership, assurance, and perseverance.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of the contested theological landscape: definitions of covenant, covenant membership, visible versus invisible church.
 - Exposition of how monocovenantal theses reframe covenant continuity and sacramental signs in ways that affect soteriology.
 - Critical analysis: shows logical and exegetical consequences for doctrines of justification, sanctification, and the perseverance of the saints.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiological implications: discipline, assurance, and preaching when covenant membership is emphasized over personal faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors are proponents of the Federal Vision and monocovenantal interpretations within contemporary Reformed debates.
 - Scriptural exegesis (New Testament covenantal passages), classical Reformed confessions and theologians (appeals to confessional standards), and pastoral-theological considerations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (structure and administrations)
 - Ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, membership)
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, perseverance)
 - Sacraments (baptismal identity, sacramental efficacy)
 - Assurance and apostasy
- **Closing line**
 - Schlissel situates the theological center of gravity on a cautionary defense of traditional Reformed distinctions: covenantal membership must not be allowed to collapse into a corporate cover that erases authentic apostasy, assurance, and the personal nature of saving faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp focus on the pastoral and doctrinal risks that follow from overstressing corporate covenant identity at the expense of personal faith and perseverance.
 - Emphasizes apostasy as a biblically real category that must be coherently accounted for within any viable covenant theology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges Federal Vision/monocovenantalists for downplaying the distinction between the visible and invisible church and for treating sacramental union as determinative of salvific status.
 - Reasserts classical Reformed concerns about assurance, imputation, and forensic justification that may be blurred by some monocovenantal language.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and redefines contested operative terms (e.g., how "covenant membership" must be delineated from salvific union to protect doctrines of apostasy and perseverance).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Functioned primarily as a corrective/polemical resource within Reformed circles disputing the Federal Vision; frequently cited in denominational debates over discipline and covenantal theology.
 - Used by conservative Reformed pastors and committees as a reference point when articulating responses to monocovenantal proposals.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Valuable for courses on contemporary covenant theology controversies; useful for seminarians and pastors studying pastoral implications of covenant ecclesiology and the theology of apostasy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monocovenantalism**
 - The thesis that there is one covenant of grace across redemptive history with differing administrations; Schlissel critiques its practical effects on apostasy and membership.
- **Federal Vision**
 - A loose cluster of proposals emphasizing corporate covenant identity and sacramental efficacy; primary target of Schlissel's critique.
- **Covenant membership**
 - Distinct from salvific union; Schlissel insists membership can exist visibly without guaranteeing final salvation.
- **Apostasy**
 - Treated as a real, biblically attested falling away that must be intelligible within any covenantal framework.
- **Visible vs. invisible church**
 - Reasserted distinction used to guard against conflating membership and guaranteed election.
- **Perseverance of the saints**
 - Emphasized as an important corollary doctrine that interacts with how apostasy is defined and pastoralized.
- **Assurance**
 - Schlissel highlights how misplaced covenantal assurances (based on corporate signs alone) can distort true assurance of faith.
- **Sacramental efficacy**
 - Critiqued where presented as intrinsically salvific or as conferring standing that precludes apostasy.
- **Baptismal identity**
 - Discussed as a marker of covenant membership, not an automatic guarantee of final salvation.
- **Covenantal continuity**
 - Used to describe Federal Vision claims; Schlissel probes limits and hazards of overstating continuity without appropriate soteriological safeguards.
- **Forensic justification / imputation**
 - Reclaimed as necessary theological categories that guard against reducing justification to mere covenantal status.
- **Ecclesial discipline**
 - Presented as a primary pastoral tool to address visible apostasy within the covenant community.
- **Pastoral implications**
 - Emphasizes preaching, catechesis, and discipline as necessary responses to preserve clarity about apostasy and assurance.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and denominational resource opposing Federal Vision/monocovenantal drift.
- As an **exegetical-model** aid for reading New Testament passages on apostasy, covenant, and community responsibility.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions about balancing corporate covenant identity and personal soteriology in Reformed theology.
