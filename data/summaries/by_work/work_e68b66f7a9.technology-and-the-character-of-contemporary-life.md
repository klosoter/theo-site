### TITLE
**Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life** - Albert Borgmann (1984)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published 1984 amid renewed philosophical interest in technology (post-Heideggerian and post-Industrial critiques). Engages late 20th-century concerns about consumer society, rising household technologies, and the erosion of communal practices. Intersects with virtue-ethics revival, phenomenology, and environmental critique.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Modern technology, under a prevailing "device paradigm," transforms human life by displacing meaningful, communal, and moral practices with commodified ease; this erosion reshapes moral character and spiritual imaginaries and thus poses a theological problem of formation, sacramentality, and attention.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnoses how technological systems organize availability and consumption so that goods become commodities delivered as "devices" rather than embedded in practices. 
 - Introduces the **device paradigm** to explain the structural features of modern technology: concealment of processes, emphasis on commodity, and displacement of engagement. 
 - Proposes **focal things and practices** as the ethical and formative countermeasure-practices that center life, require skill, attention, and community (e.g., hearth, communal meals, craft). 
 - Argues that recovering focal practices fosters attentiveness, moral imagination, and resistance to the flattening of experience. 
 - Concludes with implications for social institutions, civic life, and religious practice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Heavy engagement with Heidegger (enframing), phenomenology of experience, and American pragmatism. 
 - Dialogues implicitly with Jacques Ellul and Martin Heidegger on technological enframing, and with virtue-ethics thinkers (e.g., MacIntyre) on practices and character. 
 - Draws on concrete ethnographic and cultural examples rather than systematic theology.

- **Doctrines treated (theologically relevant):** 
 - **Anthropology:** human formation and attention under technological regimes. 
 - **Ethics/virtue:** formation of character through practices. 
 - **Sacramentality and liturgy (implicit):** focal practices as quasi-sacramental sites of presence and gift. 
 - **Ecclesiology and moral formation:** implications for community life and worship. 
 - **Creation theology (implicit):** the relation to material things and stewardship.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 Borgmann diagnoses technology as a shaping force of moral imagination and proposes the recovery of **focal things and practices** as the ecclesial and ethical pivot for restoring human attention, communal formation, and sacramental depth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - The **device paradigm**: a structural account of technological commodification that focuses on patterns of availability, concealment, and disengagement rather than merely tools or systems. 
 - **Focal things and practices** as positively normative: not rejection of technology wholesale but cultivation of practices that orient attention and character.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - More programmatic and cultural than Heidegger's ontological critique; less deterministic than Ellul's totalizing "technique" thesis. 
 - Unlike simple Luddism, Borgmann allows for technological benefits but insists on deliberate cultivation of focal practices to preserve moral and spiritual goods. 
 - Complements MacIntyre's emphasis on practices and virtues by attending to material and technological conditions that enable or disable practices.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - "Device paradigm" and the pairing "focal things and practices" are Borgmann's signature contributions-useful heuristics for diagnosing technological effects on moral formation. 
 - Distinguishes between "commodity" and "thing" to recover depth in material culture.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely taken up in Christian ethics, liturgical theology, and ecological theology as a resource for thinking about formation, sacramentality, and technology. 
 - Influenced pastoral reflections on worship, hospitality, and domestic practices; used to critique consumerist religiosity and propose formative alternatives. 
 - Employed ecumenically rather than confined to a single tradition; resonates with conservative and progressive concerns about technology's moral effects.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a durable analytic vocabulary for discussing technology's moral and spiritual effects. 
 - Pedagogically valuable for linking concrete practices to character formation; fosters interdisciplinary dialogue (philosophy, theology, ethics, liturgy).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Device paradigm:** Structural pattern by which goods are provided as commodities through devices that conceal processes and disengage users from skill and community. Central analytic tool.
- **Focal things:** Material objects or events that gather attention, require skill, and foster communal presence (hearth, meal, instrument). Counterpoints to commodities.
- **Focal practices:** Skilled, communal activities centered on focal things that form character and sustain meaning (cooking, artisanal craft, worship). The proposed remedy for technological impoverishment.
- **Commodity vs. Thing:** Commodity = readily available, packaged, separated from context; Thing = unified object engaged through practice and attention.
- **Center / Decentered life:** The presence or loss of orienting practices and institutions that give life coherence and narrative.
- **Enframing (in dialogue with Heidegger):** The technological tendency to order the world as resource; Borgmann reframes this in sociocultural, practice-based terms.
- **Attention / Presence:** Ethical and spiritual capacities eroded by device paradigms; recoverable via focal practices.
- **Moral imagination:** Formed by practices and objects; technology reshapes it by narrowing possibilities of meaning.
- **Material engagement:** Concrete involvement with objects and processes as formative of virtues.
- **Displacement:** How devices relocate labor, skill, and interaction away from users and communities.
- **Integrity of practices:** Criterion for resilience against commodification; practices that preserve continuity, narrative, and skill.
- **Moderation (practical motif):** Advocates temperate, selective technology use, not total rejection.
- **Sacramental resonance (theological use):** Focal practices read as sacramental loci-mediating presence, gift, and communal formation.
- **Civic and ecological implications:** Practices shape public life and stewardship; technology can both enable and undermine sustainable habits.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological ethics for diagnosing technological formation and arguing for virtue-centered practices. 
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing commodified technological life from sacramental or liturgical modes of presence. 
- As a **polemic** against uncritical technophilia and a resource for ecclesial proposals (worship formation, hospitality, domestic liturgy).
