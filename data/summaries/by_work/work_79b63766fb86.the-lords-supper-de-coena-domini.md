### TITLE
The Lord's Supper (De Coena Domini) - Martin Chemnitz

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Lutheran orthodoxy; written amid post-Luther controversies (Philippists vs. Gnesio-Lutherans) and growing confessional formation following the Augsburg Confession.
 - Reaction to both Roman Catholic Council of Trent formulations and Reformed (Zwinglian/Calvinist) Eucharistic positions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defend the **real presence** of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's Supper grounded in Christology (personal union) and the communicatio idiomatum, while rejecting transubstantiation and memorialist or purely spiritual accounts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis (esp. John 6; 1 Cor 11) establishes Christ's promise of true feeding.
 - Patristic and medieval witnesses marshaled to show historical continuity with a "real presence" tradition.
 - Systematic Christology: the **personal union** and **communicatio idiomatum** explain how the human nature of Christ can be truly present in the sacrament without loss of natural properties.
 - Doctrinal delimitation: distinguishes Lutheran **sacramental union** from Roman transubstantiation and from Reformed spiritual presence or symbolism.
 - Pastoral and confessional consequences: the Sacrament as means of grace, worthily received; warnings against speculative metaphysics that undermine comfort and assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Luther and Melanchthon (intra-Lutheran tensions), Calvin and Zwingli (Reformed), Roman Catholic scholastics and Trent, patristic authors.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eucharist, Christology (personal union; communicatio idiomatum), sacramental theology (signs and things signified), soteriology (means of grace), biblical authority/exegesis.
- **Closing line**
 - Chemnitz centers Eucharistic truth on the incarnate Christ: the Supper truly communicates Christ by virtue of the personal union, defended with biblical exegesis, patristic testimony, and precise Christological categories.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sharp linking of Eucharistic presence to the **communicatio idiomatum**: attributes of the divine person are ascribed to the human nature in a way that secures presence without physical transmutation.
 - Insistence on a **sacramental union**: bread and wine remain, yet Christ's true body and blood are truly and personally present and received.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Roman **transubstantiation** (no change of substance) while also rejecting Reformed/ Zwinglian denials of real bodily presence.
 - Corrects tendencies toward vague "spiritualism" by rooting presence in **Christological ontology** rather than merely in the Spirit's action.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies a middle vocabulary: **personal ubiquity** or "relative ubiquity" (presence by virtue of the person) without attributing natural omnipresence to Christ's human nature.
 - Uses scholastic precision to reformulate patristic and Luther's expressions for confessional clarity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for later **Lutheran orthodoxy** and the Formula of Concord; standard reference in Lutheran dogmatics and polemics against Reformed and Roman positions.
 - Read less sympathetically by Reformed theologians; remains a touchstone in ecumenical Eucharistic dialogues.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of how Christology supplies sacramental doctrine; exemplary for students learning to connect exegesis, patristics, and systematic theology in confessional argumentation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - central explanatory device: properties of the divine person communicated to the human nature, enabling Eucharistic presence.
 - Used to argue the human nature can be truly present where the person is present, without losing its human properties.
- **Sacramental union** - the Lutheran formula for how body and blood are present "in, with, and under" bread and wine; distinct from transubstantiation.
- **Real presence** - affirmation that Christ's body and blood are truly present and received in the supper; not merely symbolic or purely spiritual.
- **Transubstantiation (rejected)** - Roman claim of substance change; Chemnitz rejects this metaphysical solution as unnecessary and ungrounded in Scripture.
- **Personal union** - Christological anchor: the divine and human natures united in one person; the basis for communicatio idiomatum.
- **Relative / personal ubiquity** - the idea that Christ's human nature is present by virtue of its personal union with the divine person, not by natural omnipresence.
- **Manducatio Christi (eating of Christ)** - real reception of Christ by faith in the Eucharist; distinguishes worthy/unworthy reception discussions.
- **Sign and thing signified** - clarifies that bread/wine remain signs while also becoming the means by which the thing signified (Christ) is communicated.
- **Exegesis of John 6 and 1 Corinthians 11** - methodological locus where Scripture is read Christologically and sacramentally.
- **Patristic witness** - used to show continuity and to refute novelty on both Roman and Reformed sides.
- **Polemical tone** - careful scholastic method combined with confessional polemic.

How the work is used across loci:
- As an authoritative **definition source** for Lutheran Eucharistic doctrine and the use of communicatio idiomatum.
- As a **polemic** demonstrating how Christological categories limit both Roman metaphysics and Reformed spiritualizing tendencies.
- As an **exegetical-model**: shows how to read sacramental texts Christologically and historically.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in dogmatic theology: links Christology and sacramentology in confessional systems.
