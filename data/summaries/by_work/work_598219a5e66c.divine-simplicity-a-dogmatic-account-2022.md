### TITLE
**Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account** - Scott R. Swain (2022)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed dogmatics; part of a renewed interest in classical theism within conservative Protestant theology.
 - Moves between historical-theological retrieval (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics) and contemporary analytic debate about metaphysics of God.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Divine simplicity (DS)** is a central, scripturally warranted dogma: God is metaphysically simple (no metaphysical composition), and this simplicity is essential to orthodox doctrine.
 - Problem addressed: how to defend DS against modern objections (metaphysical incoherence, threats to Trinitarian distinct persons, dangers for divine attributes) while retaining biblical fidelity and systematic coherence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary exegetical and creedal case: biblical texts and early ecumenical/Reformed formulations support an uncompounded God.
 - Exegetical to dogmatic move: show how DS coheres with **aseity, immutability, impassibility** and secures the intelligibility of God's absolute attributes.
 - Philosophical-theological defense:
 - Distinguishes **absolute** from **relative** attributes and explains identity of absolute attributes with divine essence.
 - Argues that real, not accidental, relationality in the Trinity can cohere with DS via careful doctrine of relations without composition.
 - Responds to analytic objections (e.g., charge that DS makes God unknowable, undermines divine agency, or collapses Trinitarian distinctions).
 - Concludes with implications for other loci: revelation, providence, Christology, and worship.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical and Reformed figures: Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas (for historical debate), Calvin and Reformed scholastics (for confessional framing).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: analytic philosophers/theologians and critics of DS (various open theists, process theologians, and non-simplist analytic theists).
 - Uses recent scholarship bridging analytic metaphysics and historical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (absolute and relative), Trinity (immanent and economic), aseity, immutability, impassibility, revelation and the apologetic role of DS, implications for providence and Christology.

- **Closing line**
 - Swain presents DS as a non-negotiable theological center: it secures the unity, transcendence, and normative attributes of God while remaining compatible with orthodox Trinitarian distinctiveness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Enforces a dogmatic-first posture: DS is treated as a confessional/metaphysical doctrine grounded in Scripture and creed rather than merely a speculative option.
 - Clear taxonomy of **absolute vs. relative attributes** to defuse common confusions about composition.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on modern analytic anti-simplicity moves that privatize attributes or treat them as distinct instantiated properties.
 - Revises some medieval formulations by insisting on Reformed, covenantal constraints that keep DS theologically pastoral and doctrinally functional.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Careful operationalization of "identity" language for attributes: not merely conceptual identity but dogmatic identity of absolute attributes with divine essence as a theological claim.
 - Reframes "relations" within Trinitarian theology so they do not imply metaphysical composition.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Rapid uptake among conservative Reformed scholars and seminarians as a leading contemporary defense of DS.
 - Stimulates renewed discussion in analytic theology circles; provokes critical responses from non-simplists and some analytic philosophers concerned with metaphysical coherence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, serviceable dogmatic resource for teaching DS in systematic theology curricula.
 - Models a method integrating exegetical, historical, and philosophical argumentation for doctrinal defense.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity (DS)**
 - God has no metaphysical composition; God's attributes are not parts or properties distinct from God's essence.

- **Absolute Attributes**
 - Attributes that are expressions of the divine essence itself (e.g., omnipotence, omniscience).
 - Swain: these are identical with God's essence, not "added" properties.

- **Relative Attributes**
 - Attributes that describe God's relations (e.g., Fatherhood, covenant Lord).
 - Distinguished from absolute attributes to avoid conflating relationality with composition.

- **Essence-Existence Identity**
 - The thesis that in God essence and existence are identical; used to ground aseity and simplicity.

- **Aseity**
 - Divine self-existence and independence; corollary of DS and essence-existence identity.

- **Immutability**
 - God's unchangeableness; argued to follow from simplicity because change would imply composition or potentiality.

- **Impassibility**
 - God does not suffer as creatures do; linked to DS and immutability while allowing for genuine relational action in history.

- **Real Relations (in the Trinity)**
 - Genuine intra-Trinitarian relations that do not create metaphysical composition; Swain articulates a model preserving both real relationality and DS.

- **Absolute vs. Relative Attributes (contrast)**
 - Clarifies theological tasks: defending omniform attributes as essential while explaining modal and relational predicates scripturally.

- **Classical Theism**
 - The theological-metaphysical framework Swain defends; contrasts with process, open, and other non-classical theisms.

- **Dogmatic Retrieval**
 - Method: prioritize confessional and biblical witness in metaphysical claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for DS in Reformed systematic theology courses and syllabi.
- As a **polemic** against open theism, process theology, and analytic non-simplist accounts of attributes.
- As an **exegetical-model** linking biblical texts and creedal formulations to contemporary metaphysical claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** from which aseity, immutability, and impassibility are derived and applied across doctrine.
