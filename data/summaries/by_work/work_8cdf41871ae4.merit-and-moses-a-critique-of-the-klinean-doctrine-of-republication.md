### TITLE
**Merit and Moses: A Critique of the Klinean Doctrine of Republication** - Jared Oliphint

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed theological debate (late 20th-early 21st century) surrounding Meredith G. Kline's redemptive-historical revision of covenant theology.
 - Part of intra-Reformed disputes over the nature of the Mosaic covenant, law/gospel distinction, and the role of "works" in covenantal administration.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Oliphint contends that the Klinean doctrine of "republication" illegitimately reads a covenant-of-works framework back into the Mosaic covenant, thereby misconceiving merit, law, and the relation of the Old Covenant to the covenant of grace.
 - The central problem: Klinean republication collapses important Reformed distinctions (grace vs. law; merit vs. reward; federal imputation vs. judicial sanction), yielding theological and exegetical errors with pastoral consequences.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: lays out Kline's thesis-Moses "re-publishes" the covenant of works to Israel so that law is presented as a works-demand with covenantal blessings and curses like Edenic probation.
 - Exegetical critique: challenges Kline's scriptural warrants (e.g., Deuteronomy passages, covenantal curses/benedictions) and argues these texts fit better within an administration of the covenant of grace or within civic/judicial covenant forms, not a reinstatement of the works principle.
 - Systematic correction: insists on preserving classical Reformed categories - covenant of works properly belongs to Adamic pre-fall probation and the Mosaic covenant is not a restored federal works-relationship for salvation.
 - Conceptual clarification: distinguishes properly between "merit" (condign, congruous), judicial reward, covenantal sanction, and imputation; shows Kline conflates these.
 - Pastoral and doctrinal consequences: argues republication risks confusing justification by faith, encouraging a works-oriented reading of Scripture, and misrepresenting Christ's unique merit.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Meredith G. Kline and the "Klinean" or neo-Vosian school.
 - Engages classical Reformed sources (Westminster divines, 17th-century federal theology), critics of Kline (various Reformed scholars), and biblical texts used by Kline (Pentateuch, especially Deuteronomy).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace, administrations)
 - Law and Gospel distinction
 - Merit and imputation (Christ's merit vs. human works)
 - Justification and sanctification
 - Redemptive-historical hermeneutics and typology

- **Closing line**
 - Oliphint aims to defend classical federal distinctions and to show that Klinean republication undermines both the Reformed doctrine of justification and a faithful reading of Israel's law.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sharp insistence on precise conceptual vocabulary: "merit" is not to be lightly redefined; judicial government and covenant administration are distinct categories.
 - Reasserts the historical-Reformed understanding that the Mosaic covenant is an administration of the covenant of grace (with civil/ceremonial features), not a renewed salvific covenant-of-works.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct corrective to Meredith Kline: preserves a stricter separation between Adamic/work-based covenant and Israel's covenantal life.
 - Contrasts with neo-Vosian tendencies to read Israel's law as a national-scale probation akin to Edenic covenant.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Careful triage of "merit" language: distinguishes condign merit (properly ascribed only to Christ), congruous reward, and judicial sanction in national covenant contexts.
 - Emphasizes administrative categories (constitutional/civic law vs. covenantal salvation-law) to avoid category mistakes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Used by critics of Kline as a concise, systematic rebuttal; cited in discussions of covenant theology to shore up classical Reformed positions.
 - Seen as clarifying for pastors and teachers concerned about law/gospel confusion introduced by republication rhetoric.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a precise corrective for students learning federal theology; a compact resource emphasizing proper theological categories and pastoral prudence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Republication**
 - Klinean claim that Mosaic law "re-publishes" the covenant of works to Israel; Oliphint rejects this as a misreading and category error.

- **Covenant of Works**
 - Adamic probation with meritorious promise; Oliphint insists this is not reintroduced to Israel by Moses.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Covenant centered on Christ's meritorious work; Oliphint defends its continuity and administration in Moses without recourse to republication.

- **Merit**
 - Distinguished carefully:
 - - **Condign merit**: proper, deserved merit fitting only to Christ.
 - - **Congruous reward / civic recompense**: not equivalent to covenantal merit.

- **Imputation**
 - Forensic attribution of Christ's righteousness; Oliphint stresses imputation remains central and is threatened by works-centered republication.

- **Law / Gospel distinction**
 - Reaffirmed as the crucial hermeneutical and pastoral lens; Kline's account, per Oliphint, risks collapsing the distinction.

- **Mosaic covenant**
 - Debated as either an administration of grace with civil elements (Oliphint) or a republished works-covenant (Kline).

- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic**
 - Both sides appeal to it; Oliphint uses it to defend continuity without importing a works-structure back into Israel.

- **Federal theology**
 - Classical Reformed framework for Oliphint's correction; insists on historical and conceptual boundaries.

- **Judicial vs. Covenant sanctions**
 - Clarifies that national punishments/bonuses can be civic without being covenantal merit-rewards.

- **Neo-Vosian / Klinean school**
 - Identifies the interlocutory movement being critiqued.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed accounts of covenantal categories (covenant of works vs. grace).
- As a **polemic** in scholarly debates against Klinean republication and neo-Vosian readings of the Mosaic law.
- As an **exegetical-model** aid to differentiate civic-constitutional features of Israel from salvific covenant promises.
