### TITLE
What Still Keeps Us Apart? - Michael S. Horton (chapter in Justification: What's at Stake in the Current Debates)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** early-21st-century Reformed engagement with ecumenical and Pauline debates about justification. Written amid reactions to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP), the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (JDDJ), and renewed Protestant-Catholic conversations about soteriology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Horton insists that important, non-negotiable differences remain over the doctrine of justification - chiefly the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness, the nature of grace, and the legal standing of the believer - and that these differences bear decisively on gospel proclamation, assurance, and ecclesial identity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary debates have muddied justification by focusing on covenantal participation, works-criteria, or ecclesial accommodation.
 - Exegetical and theological defense: a Reformed reading of Paul affirms justification as a forensic declaration grounded in Christ's active and passive obedience, received by faith alone.
 - Polemical corrective: arguments against NPP and Roman Catholic formulations that collapse justification into sanctification or redefine merits and infused righteousness.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: proper assurance, preaching, and correction of legalism or antinomian distortions depend on preserving forensic justification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages broadly with proponents of the New Perspective (e.g., N. T. Wright by implication), Roman Catholic articulations (and the JDDJ), classical Reformers (esp. Calvin), and contemporary Reformed apologists. Uses Pauline texts and systematic categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** justification (central), atonement (penal/substitutionary emphasis), imputation (double imputation), union with Christ, sanctification (distinguished from justification), covenant theology, grace vs. merit, ecclesiology insofar as assurance and preaching depend on doctrine.
- **Closing line:** Horton reasserts that true gospel clarity requires maintaining a forensic, imputed righteousness ground for justification - a keystone for Protestant identity, assurance, and faithful proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that justification is primarily forensic/legal (a standing declared), not merely participatory or transformative.
 - Emphasizes the inseparability of imputation and union with Christ: imputation is the forensic expression of our union with his obedient life and atoning death.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contra NPP: resists reduction of righteousness language to covenantal membership or moral transformation without legal declaration.
 - Contra Roman Catholic positions and perceived ecumenical compromises (e.g., JDDJ readings): warns that infusion-language and merit-theory dilute sola fide and the objective nature of Christ's work.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes debates in pastoral and ecclesial stakes (assurance, preaching), not only in abstract doctrinal terms, pressing that theological categories have concrete church consequences.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed circles as a clear and vigorous restatement of classical Reformed forensic soteriology.
 - Used in ecumenical discussions as a brisk summary of Reformed objections to NPP and Catholic rapprochements.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise, accessible statement of the Reformed case for imputation and forensic justification; valuable for seminarians, pastors, and scholars navigating contemporary soteriological debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** the divine declaration that a sinner is righteous on account of Christ - understood primarily as forensic (legal standing), not intrinsic moral perfection.
- **Forensic (legal) declaration:** emphasis on God's courtroom act of declaring righteousness rather than gradual moral alteration.
- **Imputation / double imputation:**
 - **Sin imputed to Christ:** our sin accounted to him in his atoning work.
 - **Righteousness imputed to believers:** Christ's obedience and merit accounted to believers by faith.
- **Union with Christ:** ontological union that grounds imputation and reception of Christ's benefits; not reducible to mere participation language.
- **Penal substitution:** atonement model defended as explaining how God can justly declare sinners righteous - Christ bears the penalty of sin.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP):** the set of proposals Horton criticizes for reinterpreting Pauline righteousness language as covenantal/participationist rather than forensic.
- **Infusion vs. imputation:** contrast between Catholic language of infused righteousness (inner change meriting salvation) and Reformed insistence on imputational righteousness received by faith.
- **Merit (condemned/qualified):** Horton's critique of any soteriology that allows human works to be construed as meriting status before God.
- **Sanctification:** progressive moral renewal; distinguished from justification and not to be conflated with the declarative status of justification.
- **Assurance:** pastoral correlate of forensic justification; Horton stresses that assurance rests on declared righteousness, not subjective sanctification.
- **Joint Declaration (JDDJ):** ecumenical text referenced as part of the contemporary context; treated critically insofar as Horton fears doctrinal blurring.
- **Righteousness of God (dikaiosyne):** theological locus; Horton upholds legal righteousness as the core Pauline meaning in justification debates.
- **Covenantal nomism (as critiqued):** Horton challenges readings that reduce justification to covenant-membership markers rather than judicial acquittal.
- **Objective justification:** doctrine that Christ's work objectively accomplished believers' justification independent of subjective experience.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for the Reformed forensic-imputation position in teaching and syllabi.
- As a **polemic** and concise rebuttal when interacting with NPP and certain ecumenical formulations.
- As an **exegetical-model** exemplar emphasizing Pauline forensic language and pastoral consequences.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates tying justification to assurance, preaching, and ecclesial identity.
