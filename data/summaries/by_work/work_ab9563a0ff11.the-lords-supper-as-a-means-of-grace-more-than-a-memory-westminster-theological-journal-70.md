### TITLE
**The Lord's Supper as a Means of Grace: More than a Memory** - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal 70 (2008/2009).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th/early 21st-century Reformed theological discussion at Westminster Theological Seminary. Responds to a resurgence of memorialist readings of the Supper and to ecumenical conversations about sacramental presence and efficacy. Poythress writes from confessional Reformed commitments with attention to biblical exegesis and analytic clarity.
- **Central thesis:** The Lord's Supper is not merely a memorial but functions as a genuine *means of grace*-a covenantal sign and seal that, by the Spirit, communicates Christ's benefits to believers without resorting to Romanist corporeal presence or to purely symbolic memorialism.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarifies what is meant by "means of grace" and distinguishes objective from subjective dimensions of sacramental efficacy.
 - Exegetical appeal to Luke 22, 1 Corinthians 10-11, and Johannine feeding motifs to show sacramental language conveys more than remembrance.
 - Historical-considerations: contrasts Zwinglian memorialism with Calvinian "spiritual presence" and the Reformed confessional language of sign and seal.
 - Theological synthesis: sacraments as instrumental causes wielded by Christ through the Spirit to strengthen union with Christ and faith.
 - Pastoral implications: liturgy, faith, and preaching are joined-the Supper functions alongside preaching and prayer as ordinary means of grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Zwingli (memorialism), Calvin (spiritual presence), Reformed confessions (Westminster), Pauline corpus, patristic practice invoked implicitly; also engages contemporary sacramental conversations in Reformed circles.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sacramentology; covenant and covenant signs; Christology (presence and benefits of Christ); pneumatology (Spirit as agent of sacramental efficacy); ecclesiology and liturgy; faith and justification insofar as they relate to reception of sacramental grace.
- **Closing line:** Theologically, the article reclaims the Lord's Supper as an objectively promised, Spirit-wrought instrument that truly nourishes believers in union with Christ-thereby being significantly more than mere memory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stress on **instrumental causality**: sacraments as genuine instruments by which Christ (through the Spirit) conveys benefits, without physical transformation of elements.
 - Careful balancing of **objective promise** and **faith-reception**-sacramental efficacy is real but requires faith to be bestowed fruitfully.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects extreme Zwinglian memorialism that reduces the Supper to symbolic recollection.
 - Retains rejection of Roman transubstantiation and overly physical readings while affirming real spiritual presence (a Reformed middle path).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced deployment of philosophical language (cause, instrument, sign/seal) to clarify sacramental mechanics without metaphysical excess.
 - Emphasis on the Supper's relation to other means (preaching, prayer) as a networked economy of grace rather than isolated ritual.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries and pastoral training for sharpening sacramental doctrine and liturgical practice.
 - Cited in debates with memorialists and in ecumenical discussions as a clear, confessional articulation of Reformed sacramentality.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact exegetical-theological framework for teaching the Lord's Supper as ethically and spiritually formative, pastorally efficacious, and theologically coherent within covenantal Reformed theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Means of grace:** Instruments ordained by Christ to convey grace; not magic, but divinely promised channels of benefit.
- **Memorialism:** The view that the Supper is merely remembrance; Poythress critiques as insufficient.
- **Real (spiritual) presence:** Christ present by the Spirit in a non-corporeal, effectual manner; contrasts with transubstantiation and pure symbolism.
- **Sign and seal:** Traditional Reformed categories-sacraments both signify and seal the promises of God.
- **Instrumental causality:** Philosophical-theological term for how sacraments function causally (as instruments) without becoming efficient causes in themselves.
- **Objective vs. subjective efficacy:** Distinction between the sacrament's promised effect (objective) and the believer's reception by faith (subjective).
- **Union with Christ:** Central soteriological category-supper strengthens and manifests this union.
- **Holy Spirit (sacramental agent):** The dispenser of sacramental benefit; makes presence and application effective.
- **Covenant theology:** Framework that grounds sacraments as covenantal signs and signs of promise to the covenant community.
- **Faith as receiver:** Sacramental benefit requires faith; the supper nurtures that faith, forming a reciprocal relation.
- **Preaching and sacraments nexus:** The idea that preaching and sacraments function together as complementary ordinary means of grace.
- **Efficacy without physical change:** Affirms grace is truly conveyed though bread/wine remain materially unchanged.
- **Pastoral sacramental practice:** Liturgical implications-frequency, preparation, and catechesis tied to sacramental theology.
- **Scriptural warrant (1 Cor. 10-11, Luke 22, John 6):** Key exegetical loci Poythress uses to support sacramental efficacy.
- **Anti-memorial polemic:** Concise refutation of reductionist memorialist claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramentology-clear language on sign/seal and instrumental causality.
- As a **polemic** against memorialism and minimalist sacramental practice in Reformed contexts.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline eucharistic texts in service of pastoral theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking sacramental theology to preaching, covenant practice, and pneumatology.
