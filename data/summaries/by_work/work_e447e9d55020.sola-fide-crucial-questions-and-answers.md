### TITLE
**Sola Fide: Crucial Questions and Answers - Joshua D. Chatraw**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within contemporary Reformed Protestant discourse addressing late 20th-21st century controversies over justification.
 - Moves at the intersection of pastoral catechesis and academic engagement with the New Perspective on Paul and intra‑Reformed debates (e.g., Federal Vision).
- **Central thesis**
 - Defends the classical Protestant claim that sinners are declared righteous before God **by faith alone** on the basis of the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness, distinct from sanctification and human works.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Q&A format organizing key controversies into accessible items; major moves include:
 - Clarifying what "faith" means (fiduciary trust, not mere intellectual assent).
 - Distinguishing justification (legal declaration) from sanctification (ethical transformation).
 - Defending **imputed/alien righteousness** of Christ against views that locate righteousness within believers intrinsically.
 - Responding to modern critiques (New Perspective, Federal Vision, Roman Catholic soteriology) by reasserting forensic categories and biblical exegesis of Paul.
 - Addressing pastoral consequences: assurance, repentance, good works as fruit, not ground, of justification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with Reformers (Luther, Calvin) and Reformation confessions; contrasts with Council of Trent/Roman Catholic positions.
 - Engages contemporary interlocutors: proponents of the New Perspective on Paul and Federal Vision advocates, and broader evangelical critics.
 - Uses Pauline corpus (Romans, Galatians) as primary exegetical locus; appeals to historic Protestant theology and pastoral literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, imputation, faith, sanctification, assurance, union with Christ, merit, works, covenant (grace vs. works), authority of Scripture.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: justification is a forensic, Christ‑based declaration received by faith alone, which secures assurance and orders sanctification without making works the ground of acceptance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral orientation: treats doctrinal precision as directly relevant to Christian assurance and life.
 - Repeated insistence on **forensic categories** (declaration, imputation) as non‑negotiable for a robust doctrine of salvation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies to conflate justification and sanctification (notably in Federal Vision circles).
 - Contrasts with New Perspective redefinitions by reasserting Pauline forensic language and the Reformation schema.
 - Opposes Roman Catholic formulations that situate initial righteousness in infused merits rather than imputed Christ‑righteousness.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies linguistic confusions about "faith" by emphasizing fiduciary instrumentality and union with Christ as the basis for imputation.
 - Reframes assurance as derivative from declarative justification rather than from subjective moral progress.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted broadly in Reformed and confessional evangelical teaching contexts as a concise Q&A resource.
 - Used in catechesis, pastoral counseling, and denominational training to counter contemporary revisionist views.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, defensible articulation of classic sola fide, valuable for both academic refutation of alternatives and practical pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola fide** - Justification by faith alone; the central Protestant claim defended throughout.
- **Justification** - A legal/forensic declaration of righteousness effected by God for the sinner in Christ.
- **Imputation (double imputation)** - Christ's righteousness counted to believers; believers' sin counted to Christ in his penal substitution.
- **Alien (forensic) righteousness** - Righteousness belonging to Christ and attributed to believers; contrasted with intrinsic/infused righteousness.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive moral and spiritual transformation; distinct from justification and consequent upon it.
- **Faith (fiduciary trust)** - Trusting reliance on Christ as instrument of receiving justification, not merely intellectual assent.
- **Assurance** - Believer's confidence of salvation grounded primarily in the declarative act of God in justification.
- **Merit / Works** - Human deeds as evidence and fruit of justification, not the ground or cause of acceptance.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological basis for imputation and the believer's standing before God.
- **Forensic / Declarative language** - Legal vocabulary used to describe salvation events; emphasized against covenantal redefinitions that omit forensic elements.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace** - Framework for understanding law, gospel, and covenantal promises in relation to justification.
- **New Perspective / Federal Vision (as interlocutors)** - Contemporary movements critiqued for altering justification categories; addressed and countered.
- **Scripture (Pauline exegesis)** - Romans and Galatians as primary texts for establishing doctrine.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: clear, concise statements suitable for catechetical summaries of sola fide.
 - As a **polemic tool**: accessible refutation of New Perspective and Federal Vision claims and defense against Roman Catholic positions.
 - As a **pastoral / exegetical model**: models how to read Pauline texts in support of forensic justification while attending to pastoral concerns about assurance and sanctification.
