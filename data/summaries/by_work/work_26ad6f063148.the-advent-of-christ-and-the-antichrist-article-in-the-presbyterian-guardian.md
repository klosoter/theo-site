### TITLE
The Advent of Christ and the Antichrist - John Murray (article, The Presbyterian Guardian)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century Reformed milieu; article appears in The Presbyterian Guardian (a conservative Presbyterian periodical). Written against a background of rising dispensational and sensational treatments of eschatology and of ongoing intra-Protestant debate on the identity and timing of Antichrist.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Murray insists that proper exegesis of New Testament texts (notably 2 Thessalonians and Johannine material) locates the Antichrist motif within the wider, already-but-not-yet reality of Christ's advent. The Antichrist (or "man of lawlessness") is grasped as a concrete manifestation of lawlessness within history that will be finally judged at Christ's coming, not as fodder for speculative chronology or sensational identifications.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - exegetical baseline: careful reading of 2 Thess. 2 and Johannine letters to determine what the apostolic writers mean by "Antichrist" and "man of lawlessness."
 - theological synthesis: situates these texts within Reformed eschatological categories (present reign of Christ; future consummation).
 - polemic: rejects sensationalist/futurist identifications and simplistic one-to-one labelling of specific institutions or individuals (while not denying concrete historical embodiments of the principle).
 - pastoral and doctrinal consequence: the church must resist lawlessness and rest in the certainty of Christ's final triumph.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Pauline and Johannine writings primarily; interlocutional critiques aimed at dispensationalists and sensational popularizers of end-time speculation; implicit conversation with traditional Protestant identifications of the papacy as "antichrist" albeit treated with exegetical caution.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (priority of Christ's advent and reign), eschatology (parousia, day of the Lord, consummation), ecclesiology (church under present witness and trial), revelation/exegesis (normative method for interpreting prophetic/eschatological passages), sin and lawlessness.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** The true theological emphasis is Christ's decisive advent and judgment; the Antichrist is understood as a historical manifestation of lawlessness that Scripture locates and limits - a reality to be judged, not a puzzle to be sensationalized.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - stresses exegetical restraint: avoid speculative chronologies and identify the Antichrist primarily by scriptural criteria (lawlessness, deception, exaltation against God).
 - frames Antichrist within the present-reign/future-consummation tension: a present danger already restrained and to be finally removed at Christ's parousia.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - corrective to dispensational futurism that presses for elaborate timetables and sensational identifications.
 - more restrained than older Protestant polemics that rashly equated specific offices (e.g., papacy) with the Antichrist without exegetical nuance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - emphasis on the functional/ontological character of "lawlessness" as the defining marker rather than genealogical or purely institutional labels.
 - treatment of Antichrist as a category that can be both personal (a "man") and corporate/functional (the spirit or office of lawlessness).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - valued in Reformed and conservative Presbyterian circles for tempering sensationalism and reinforcing careful textual study.
 - used by scholars and pastors as a concise corrective to popular eschatological excesses.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - an exemplar of combining careful exegesis with sober theological reflection and pastoral sensitivity; useful in courses on Pauline eschatology and Reformed responses to modern apocalypticism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Antichrist:** the New Testament category for opponents of Christ; Murray treats it as identifiable by function (denial/deception) and destined for judgment.
- **Man of Lawlessness / Man of Sin:** Pauline designation (2 Thess. 2); read as a concrete historical manifestation of lawlessness that precedes the parousia.
- **Lawlessness (anomia):** the central theological marker - active rebellion against God's order; the substance of Antichrist's activity.
- **Parousia (Advent of Christ):** decisive interpretive horizon; Christ's coming both restrains and adjudicates the Antichrist.
- **Restrainer (katechon):** the present power that holds back the full outbreak of lawlessness until God's appointed time; treated cautiously and exegetically.
- **Johannine "anti-christs":** plural and proximal opposers who embody the anti-Christian spirit in the church; important for understanding continuity between present opposition and future climax.
- **Present-reign / future-consummation tension:** hermeneutical frame for interpreting eschatological statements - Christ reigns now, consummation awaits.
- **Exegesis vs. speculation:** methodological contrast stressed throughout - priority given to careful textual work over imaginative chronologies.
- **Pseudoprophecy / deception:** markers of Antichrist activity; used to warn the church about spiritual seduction.
- **Ecclesiastical embodiments:** Murray allows for real institutional/personal embodiments of the principle of Antichrist but resists reducing the concept to a single historically fixed label.
- **Pastoral admonition:** practical use - resist lawlessness, maintain hope in Christ's coming.
- **Soteriological implication:** Christ's advent secures believers from ultimate defeat by lawlessness.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - as a definitional source and exegetical model for interpreting 2 Thessalonians and Johannine anti-christs.
 - as a polemic and corrective against sensational dispensational readings of Antichrist.
 - as a conceptual pivot in Reformed teaching that emphasizes restraint, continuity, and Christocentric eschatology.
