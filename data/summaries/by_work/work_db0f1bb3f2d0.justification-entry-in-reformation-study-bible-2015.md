### TITLE
Justification - Guy Prentiss Waters (Reformation Study Bible, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Concise study-note entry in the 2015 Reformation Study Bible, which targets an evangelical Reformed readership committed to the Protestant confessions. 
 - Published amid renewed scholarly debate sparked by the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) and contemporary challenges to classical forensic formulations.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Justification is a forensic, declarative act of God whereby He counts guilty sinners righteous on the basis of Christ's work, received through faith alone. The entry defends classical Reformation categories against revisionist readings that collapse justification into covenantal membership or ethical transformation.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Quick exegetical grounding in Pauline passages (esp. Romans and Galatians) that employ justificatory language. 
 - Defines justification as a legal declaration distinct from sanctification (the progressive renewal of the believer). 
 - Asserts **imputation** (Christ's righteousness credited to believers) as the mechanism by which justification is accomplished; faith is the means that receives this status. 
 - Affirms penal substitution/atonement as the objective basis and union with Christ as the relational ground for imputation. 
 - Offers concise critique of NPP positions that reinterpret "justify" as "vindicate" or primarily covenantal membership markers.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit appeals to Reformers (Luther, Calvin) and confessional tradition as the hermeneutical-historical backdrop. 
 - Contemporary interlocutors mostly represented by the **New Perspective on Paul** (e.g., N.T. Wright, E.P. Sanders, James Dunn) and modern critics who deny forensic imputation.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, faith) 
 - Christology (atonement, penal substitution) 
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace as framework for imputation and union) 
 - Doctrine of God (justicial declaratory action) - implicitly Trinitarian in the economic ordering of redemption.

- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 - Justification is God's forensic declaration that a sinner is righteous **by virtue of Christ's righteousness imputed**, and this remains the faithful Reformation answer to both biblical data and contemporary revisionism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong, compact defense of **forensic imputation** as both the grammatical and theological reading of Pauline justification language. 
 - Connects imputation tightly with **union with Christ** (not merely a legal fiction but grounded in real relational union).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Contrasts with the NPP tendency to read justification as a socio-religious declaration of covenant membership or communal status rather than a legal acquittal before God. 
 - Reasserts the classical distinction between justification (status) and sanctification (process) against conflationist tendencies.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - No revolutionary neologisms; rather, the entry reclaims and polishes traditional Reformation terminology for a contemporary audience, emphasizing clarity and pastoral application in study notes.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical pastoral and academic circles as a concise, accessible rebuttal of NPP claims. 
 - Functions as a go-to quick reference in sermon preparation, catechesis, and introductory soteriology for conservative readers.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - High pedagogical utility: succinct summary, clear polemical posture, and careful linking of exegesis to doctrinal formulations make it a durable teaching aid.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** God's declarative act by which sinners are counted righteous; legal/forensic category. 
- **Forensic:** Legal language emphasizing declaration, acquittal, and alien righteousness credited to the believer. 
- **Imputation:** Christ's active and passive obedience/righteousness is credited to believers; central mechanism of justification. 
 - Often paired with **double imputation**: our sin imputed to Christ; His righteousness imputed to us. 
- **Union with Christ:** The relational ground enabling imputation and participation in Christ's benefits. 
- **Faith (instrumental/receiving):** The means by which justification is received; not meritorious but instrumental. 
- **Sola fide:** Justification by faith alone; faith is the hand that receives imputed righteousness. 
- **Sanctification:** Progressive moral and spiritual renewal; logically distinct from justification though related; evidences justification. 
- **Penal substitution:** The atoning model presented as the objective basis for God's just declaration. 
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP):** Contemporary interpretive movement critiqued for recasting justification as covenant membership or covenantal reorientation rather than forensic acquittal. 
- **Works:** Distinguished between works as meritorious basis (denied) and works as evidence/fruit of true justification (affirmed). 
- **Covenant of grace:** The theological framework linking Christ's obedience to believers and grounding imputation. 
- **Alien righteousness vs. infused righteousness:** Emphasis on alien/imputed (Reformation) as opposed to infused/transformational (Roman Catholic or some revisionist proposals).

- How this entry is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for pastoral and introductory soteriology courses. 
 - As a **polemic** concise rebuttal to NPP and anti-imputation arguments. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans and Galatians through a Reformation, covenantal lens.
