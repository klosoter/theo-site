### TITLE
**Economic Shalom: A Reformed Primer on Faith, Work, and Human Flourishing (John Bolt, 2013)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in a contemporary Reformed/neo-Calvinist milieu concerned to recover a theological anthropology for public life.
 - Responds to late-20th/early-21st-century faith-and-work movements and to secular economic frameworks by supplying explicitly doctrinal categories.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The economic order must be read and reformed under the rubric of Christian *shalom*: economic life is a locus of vocation, stewardly responsibility, and common grace rather than a neutral technocratic domain or merely a site of personal prosperity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: modern economic theories (both market absolutism and statist collectivism) fail because they separate economic order from creational and covenantal norms.
 - Constructive: propose theological principles (creation mandate, vocation, stewardship, justice, subsidiarity) as normative guides for economic activity.
 - Practical application: sketch implications for institutions (markets, property, labor, welfare, civil policy) emphasizing human flourishing and neighbor-love.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical Reformed sources (Calvin) and late-19th/early-20th neo-Calvinist voices (notably Kuyper and Bavinck) inform the framework; engages contemporary faith-and-work literature and social-ethical debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence; vocation and the cultural mandate; common grace (including preparatory grace); covenantal responsibility; sin and structural disorder; eschatological telos (shalom); social ethics (justice, solidarity, subsidiarity).
- **Closing line**
 - Bolt situates economic life squarely within a Reformed theology of creation, grace, and covenant: economic structures are theological loci where God's creational goodness and common grace should be translated into practices that foster human flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats economic systems as theological phenomena rather than simply policy problems; centers *shalom* as both descriptive telos and normative criterion.
 - Integrates *common grace* and specifically *preparatory grace* into an account that legitimates non‑saving goods and institutions as means for flourishing and gospel witness.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters market absolutism by insisting markets require moral and covenantal limits; counters statist/socialist totalization by insisting on vocation, property, and subsidiarity as theological checks on centralization.
 - Distinguishes his approach from pietistic privatization of faith by subjecting economic life to ecclesial and creational norms.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims "economic shalom" as a theological category linking micro (vocation, labor) and macro (institutions, policies) levels.
 - Operationalizes *preparatory grace* in economic terms: non‑saving gifts and cultural goods that prepare the soil for gospel fruitfulness and practical cooperation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in Reformed seminaries and churches seeking an explicitly theological approach to economics and vocation.
 - Cited in curricula linking Reformed social ethics with practical theology; influential among neo-Calvinist and confessional Reformed audiences, less engaged in secular economics circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, theologically coherent primer connecting doctrine to policy and practice; durable resource for pastors, teachers, and students addressing faith and work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic shalom**
 - The telos for economic life: ordered flourishing of persons and communities within creation.
- **Common grace**
 - God's non-saving providence that sustains cultural goods, social order, and the capacity for cooperation among believers and nonbelievers.
- **Preparatory grace**
 - A subset/function of common grace: graces that prepare individuals and institutions to receive or witness to the gospel; here used to account for skills, institutions, and cultural goods that enable economic flourishing.
- **Vocation (calling)**
 - Work as God‑given participation in creational stewardship; not merely employment or income.
- **Creation mandate / cultural mandate**
 - Normative basis for economic activity: stewardship of creation, productive care, and the cultivation of culture.
- **Covenant responsibility**
 - Social and economic obligations shaped by covenantal relations (family, church, civil polity).
- **Stewardship**
 - Economic ethic emphasizing provision, care, and accountable use of resources.
- **Subsidiarity**
 - Principle limiting central authority; local agents and intermediary institutions bear primary responsibility for economic life.
- **Solidarity and neighbor-love**
 - Ethical orientation requiring care for the vulnerable and institutional supports for human dignity.
- **Distributive justice**
 - Concern for fair access and allocation of goods consistent with covenantal and creational norms.
- **Property and markets**
 - Recognized as legitimate structures under providence and common grace, yet morally ordered and limited by justice and neighbor-love.
- **Flourishing (human flourishing)**
 - The evaluative measure for economic policy and practice: holistic well‑being in physical, social, moral, and spiritual dimensions.
- **Sin and structural disorder**
 - Acknowledges sin's distortion of economic relations and the need for remedial institutions and practices.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for theological integration of economics (what economic life means theologically).
- As a **polemic** against both secular economic reductionism and privatized pietism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in faith-and-work curricula, introducing common/preparatory grace to economic ethics.
- As a **teaching resource** for linking doctrine (creation, covenant, grace) to practical policy and pastoral care.
