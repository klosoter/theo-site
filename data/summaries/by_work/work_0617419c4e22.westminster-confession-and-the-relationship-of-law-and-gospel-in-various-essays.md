### TITLE
Westminster Confession and the Relationship of Law and Gospel (essays) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship, centered at Westminster Theological Seminary.
 - Engagement with classical Reformed/confessional standards (Westminster Confession of Faith, 1646) and contemporary debates about common grace, covenant theology, and Pauline exegesis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Confession embodies a coherent covenantal account of the relation of law and gospel: the law continues to have normative, moral force but cannot justify; the gospel alone secures justification and proper interpretation of the law.
 - Related polemical focus: clarifying **Common Grace vs. Preparatory Grace** and guarding monergistic soteriology against schemata that make human response a preparatory cause of salvation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical-anatomy of WCF and its use of Scripture (esp. Pauline material) to show:
 - Distinction of law and gospel without antithesis that suspends the moral law.
 - Affirmation of the law's abiding normative function for believers (third use), while repudiating any salvific efficacy.
 - Historical-theological maneuver:
 - Situate WCF within Reformed covenant theology; show continuity with Calvin and the Westminster divines.
 - Analyze and reject formulations of "preparatory grace" that erode sola gratia and effectual calling.
 - Systematic consequence:
 - Preserve justification by faith alone; maintain sanctification under law's normative rule; affirm common grace but delimit its salvific scope.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary sources: Westminster Confession and Scriptures (especially Paul).
 - Historical interlocutors: Calvin and the Reformed confessional tradition.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of Kuyperian-style common/preparatory grace and those proposing dichotomous law-gospel schemas (antinomians and legalists alike).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works/grace), law and gospel distinction, uses of the law, common grace, preparatory grace (critique), justification, sanctification, and soteriology (monergism vs synergism).
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's theological center of gravity: a confessional, covenantal reading that secures sola gratia and Pauline soteriology by upholding the moral law's normative role without conceding any preparatory or justificatory power to human response.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that the Westminster Confession sustains a **both/and**: continuity in covenantal law while rightly distinguishing law's juridical incapacity to justify.
 - Careful delimitation between legitimate **common grace** (general benevolent ordering) and illegitimate **preparatory grace** (as if non-saving influences prepare the will for conversion).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against Kuyperian emphases that slide into a soft synergism by positing preparatory grace as a causal contributor to conversion.
 - Correction of antinomian tendencies that would nullify the law's ongoing normative and sanctifying role.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precision in use of "preparatory grace" as a category to be critically examined rather than accepted; reframes discussion in covenantal and Pauline terms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed scholars and pastors concerned to defend confessional fidelity and monergistic soteriology.
 - Used as a corrective in seminaries and synodal discussions where Kuyperian common/preparatory grace frameworks are debated.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, confessional template for reading WCF on law/gospel, valuable for teaching the uses of the law and for polemics defending justification by faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith**
 - Primary confessional touchstone; Gaffin reads it as normative for law/gospel dynamics.
- **Law**
 - Moral rule reflecting God's will; retains normative authority; not a means of justification.
- **Gospel**
 - Proclamation of Christ's redeeming work; sole warrant for justification by faith.
- **Uses of the Law**
 - Classic triple-use framework emphasized: civil restraint, condemnation leading to Christ, and guiding believers (third use) for sanctification.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace**
 - Covenantal structure underpinning the WCF reading: law in the covenantal economy differs in function but remains authoritative.
- **Common Grace**
 - General benevolence and restraint of sin in creation; legitimate theological category but limited to non-salvific effects.
- **Preparatory Grace**
 - Contested term; Gaffin critiques its use as implying a preparatory causal efficacy in conversion incompatible with monergism.
- **Justification**
 - Declarative, forensic act by God received by faith alone; law has no justifying effect.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive work under law's normative rule, enabled by Spirit but not produced by the law.
- **Monergism**
 - Emphasized soteriological principle: God alone effects salvation; key to rejecting preparatory grace.
- **Pauline Exegesis**
 - Gaffin's exegetical model: Paul governs proper law/gospel distinctions; Scripture interprets the Confession.
- **Antithesis**
 - Used to describe both proper distinction and dangers of dichotomy; Gaffin avoids polarizing law vs gospel.
- **Normative Continuity**
 - Idea that moral law's normative status persists across covenants.
- **Declarative/Didactic Distinction**
 - Law's condemning declarative role vs its didactic guiding role post-conversion.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for clarifying common vs preparatory grace in Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against doctrinal formulations that compromise sola gratia and the monergistic character of effectual calling.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts in service of confessional law/gospel relations and for teaching the third use of the law.
