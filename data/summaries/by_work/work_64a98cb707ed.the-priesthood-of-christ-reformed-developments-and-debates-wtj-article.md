### TITLE
**The Priesthood of Christ: Reformed Developments and Debates** (Westminster Theological Journal article) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed/evangelical theological milieu, published in a confessional Reformed venue (Westminster Theological Journal). Written against post-war theological revisionisms (liberal, neo-orthodox) and in conversation with Roman Catholic and ecumenical claims about sacerdotal continuity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To recover, clarify, and defend the classical Reformed account of Christ's priesthood - especially as it functions within the munus triplex (prophet, priest, king) - against misunderstandings that either dilute Christ's unique once-for-all priestly sacrifice or reify an ongoing sacerdotal repetition in the sacraments.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical exposition grounded in Hebrews: Christ as the eternal High Priest whose sacrifice is once-for-all and who ministers in the heavenly sanctuary.
 - Historical and dogmatic tracing: how Reformation theologians and the Westminster tradition articulated the priestly office in relation to prophecy and kingship.
 - Polemical engagement: critiques of Roman Catholic sacramental theology that treats Eucharist as repetition of atoning sacrifice, and of modern proposals that downplay an objective, forensic, and mediatorial priesthood.
 - Theological synthesis: locating Christ's priesthood within covenantal and Christological frameworks - priestly mediation flows from Christ's incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension; it is both representative and efficacious.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary scriptural base (Hebrews); canonical Reformation figures (especially Calvin and the Westminster divines); contemporary interlocutors include Roman Catholic sacramental theologians and modern theologians skeptical of traditional sacerdotal categories (broadly neo-orthodox and liberal voices).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, atonement (sacrifice, intercession), mediation, covenant theology (Christ as covenant head), ecclesiology (sacraments and ministry), sacramental theology, and canon/exegesis of Hebrews.
- **Closing line:** The article centers on a Reformed doctrinal retrieval: Christ's priesthood is uniquely mediatorial and once-for-all, intelligible only within covenantal Christology and the munus triplex, and essential to correct understandings of atonement, sacraments, and ministry.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm insistence on the unity of Christ's person as the grounding for his priestly efficacy - priestly action issues from the incarnate Son now ministering in heaven.
 - Stress on the forensic and covenantal aspects of priesthood: priestly mediation secures covenant blessings through a definitive atoning act, not continual ritual repetition.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrective to Roman Catholic sacrificial Eucharistic models that posit a substantive recurring sacrifice in the Mass.
 - Critique of theological tendencies (both liberal and some ecumenical proposals) that either allegorize Hebrews or reduce priesthood to purely exemplary or ethical functions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced use of munus triplex to show functional differentiation without collapsing offices; priesthood is not merely one role among equals but intimately tied to Christ's once-accomplished work and present intercession.
 - Clarifies categories like "once-for-all" (hapax) and "heavenly sanctuary" in service of Reformed soteriology and sacramental practice.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used within conservative Reformed circles as a clear, compact defense of classical views on Christ's priesthood and a corrective in sacramental debates.
 - Influential in seminary instruction on Hebrews, Christology, and Reformed doctrine of ministry.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, historically-informed exegetical-theological model for situating Christ's priesthood within covenant theology and for countering both sacerdotal overreach and reductionist readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus triplex:** The threefold office (prophet, priest, king); used to locate the priesthood functionally within Christ's unified person while preserving distinct roles.
- **High Priest:** Title applied to Christ mainly via Hebrews - mediator of a heavenly, effective, once-for-all sacrifice.
- **Once-for-all (hapax):** The non-repeatable, decisive character of Christ's atoning sacrifice; central to rejecting repetitionist sacramental claims.
- **Heavenly Sanctuary:** The locus of Christ's present priestly ministry; contrasts with earthly temple cult and undergirds the efficacy of resurrection/ascension.
- **Mediation/Meditor:** Christ's role as intermediary between God and sinners, operative in atonement and ongoing intercession.
- **Intercession:** Continuous priestly activity of Christ in heaven; results from and relies on the once-for-all sacrifice.
- **Representational/Representative Priesthood:** Emphasis that Christ acts as covenant head representing elect humanity in a real, juridical way.
- **Sacrificial Atonement:** The substantive work effected by Christ's priestly sacrifice - forensic, redemptive, and vicariou s - distinguished from ritual repetition.
- **Sacraments (Reformed critique):** Baptism and Lord's Supper are means of grace that seal and apply Christ's once-given benefits, not repeated sacrifices.
- **Covenant Head:** The theological grounding for priestly representation; Christ secures covenantal blessings for those in union with him.
- **Hebrews:** Primary exegetical source; used to argue for heavenly ministry, typology fulfillment, and priestly uniqueness.
- **Priesthood vs. Priesthood of Believers:** Distinguishes Christ's unique mediatorial priesthood from the believers' priestly calling (worship, witness), rejecting clericalizing of congregational ministry.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed teaching on Christ's priesthood and the relation of sacrifice to sacraments.
- As a **polemic** against Roman Catholic eucharistic sacrifice and against liberal/neo-orthodox diminutions of priestly mediation.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Hebrews within covenantal Christology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on Christology, soteriology, and Reformed doctrine of ministry.
