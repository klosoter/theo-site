### TITLE
Typology and the Canonical Shape of the Hebrew Bible - Stephen G. Dempster (in Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect, 2002)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early-21st-century discussion within evangelical biblical theology and canonical criticism; interacts with the surge of interest in canonical form and intertextual reading influenced by Brevard Childs, G. K. Beale, and others.
 - Addresses how the final form and ordering of the Hebrew Bible function as a matrix for theological reading, especially typological/Christological interpretation.

- **Central thesis**
 - Legitimate typology arises from the *canonical shape* of the Hebrew Bible: the arrangement, repetition, and canonical contexts of figures and events generate theological correspondences that find fulfillment in Christ.
 - Typology is not arbitrary allegory nor only retrospective New Testament reading; it is inaugurated by the canonical configuration of the Old Testament and validated by New Testament witness.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes how canonical arrangement creates sustained patterns and theological contrasts across Torah, Prophets, and Writings that invite typological reading.
 - Offers criteria for discerning authentic types:
 - canonical intentionality (patterns created or reinforced by final form),
 - structural parallelism (correspondence in persons/events/roles),
 - theological purposiveness (role in redemptive-historical progression),
 - corroboration by New Testament fulfillment or appropriation.
 - Explores case implications (e.g., major figures like Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David) as canonical nodes that foreshadow and are consummated in the Christ-event without collapsing historical particularity.
 - Argues for a hermeneutic that honors both the OT's own theological claims and the NT's interpretive authority.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages canonical critics (Childs), typology scholars (von Rad, Goppelt), and recent evangelical canonical interpreters (Beale, others).
 - Dialogues with traditions that favor allegory or proof-text typology, and with historical-critical reticence toward Christological readings of the OT.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (final-form canonical authority),
 - Christology (Christ as telos and fulfillment),
 - Covenant and redemptive history (continuity and typological development),
 - Hermeneutics (criteria for typological reading and canonical theology).

- **Closing line**
 - Dempster's work centers typology within the canon: patterns forged by the Hebrew Bible's shape point forward in a theologically constrained, redemptive-historical way to Christ as the fulfillment and interpretive key.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the *shape* and ordering of the canonical corpus as formative of typology, not merely as incidental background.
 - Stresses methodological rigor: typology must be demonstrable in the canonical text and theologically coherent with New Testament fulfillment.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against loose, proof-texting typology and against purely allegorical readings that ignore historical and canonical constraints.
 - Counters reductionist historical-critical readings that deny the OT's theological forward orientation by showing how the canon itself encodes typological patterns.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Elevates the phrase **canonical shape** as the operative locus for typological claims.
 - Clarifies typology as a function of *canonical intentionality* and *redemptive-historical correspondence* rather than mere symbolic resemblance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and Reformed biblical-theological circles as a model for disciplined, canon-aware typology.
 - Influenced subsequent work in canonical intertextuality and Christ-centred OT interpretation, especially in seminary curricula and sermon practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a teaching-ready framework that balances fidelity to the OT's final form with the NT's Christological reading, useful for exegetes, biblical theologians, and preachers seeking principled typology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology**
 - Theological correspondence between earlier persons/events (types) and later antitype(s), culminating in Christ.
- **Canonical shape**
 - The order, arrangement, and final-form features of the Hebrew Bible that produce sustained patterns for theological reading.
- **Final form**
 - The edited, canonical text as the primary locus for theological interpretation and pattern recognition.
- **Fulfillment**
 - The New Testament realization or consummation of OT patterns in Christ; a criterion for authentic typology.
- **Canonical intentionality**
 - The concept that the final form of scripture intentionally frames patterns and connections; not random or purely reader-imposed.
- **Typological correspondence**
 - Structural, functional, and theological parallels required to warrant calling an OT element a type.
- **Redemptive-historical progression**
 - The forward-moving covenantal story across scripture that the canon shapes and that typology maps onto Christ.
- **Intertextuality**
 - The web of textual echoes and thematic resonances within the canon that ground typological claims.
- **Figure / antitype**
 - The typological pair: the OT person/event (figure/type) and the fulfillment in Christ (antitype).
- **Christ as telos**
 - Christ understood as the goal or culmination of the canonical trajectory.
- **Hermeneutical criteria**
 - Standards Dempster proposes for discerning valid typology (canonical presence, structural fit, theological logic, NT attestation).
- **Anti-prooftexting**
 - Dempster's corrective stance against isolated OT texts used out of canonical context to support arbitrary typologies.
- **Canonical theology**
 - The approach that reads doctrine and redemptive history through the ordering and theological shape of the canon.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for canonical typology and criteria for legitimate types.
 - As a **polemic** against allegorical/proof-text typology and reductive historical criticism.
 - As an **exegetical model** in biblical-theological courses and sermon preparation for Christocentric OT reading.
