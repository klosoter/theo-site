### TITLE
Romans 5:12-21 and Imputation (Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Located in Reformed evangelical scholarship addressing Pauline soteriology; engages late 20th-century exegetical debates (notably treatments of Romans and critiques from "New Perspectives" on Paul).
 - Written from a confessional-Reformed standpoint with technical attention to Greek and to systematic implications for doctrine of original sin and justification.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Romans 5:12-21, properly read in its rhetorical and syntactical structure, supports **federal/forensic imputation**: Adam's trespass is imputed to humanity by representative headship; Christ's righteous act is likewise imputed to believers.
 - This passage must be read to preserve both **participation/solidarity** (real, organic connection) and **forensic reckoning** (legal accounting), rejecting reductive readings that render imputation merely metaphorical, biological, or purely existential.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Careful exegesis of Paul's parallelism: the paired figures ("one trespass" / "one act of righteousness"; death in Adam / life in Christ) function as theological proof-texts for imputation.
 - Distinguishes types of causality and modes of union:
 - Adam as covenantal/federal head effecting a representative imputation of sin and death to his descendants.
 - Christ as covenantal head effecting imputation of righteousness and life to those united with him.
 - Argues that grammatical and logical features of the Greek text favor a forensic reading while allowing for ontological consequences (corruption, mortality).
 - Reconciles historical Reformed confessions with Pauline exegesis rather than treating doctrine as extra-biblical imposition.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics (Warfield, Hodge), and contemporary critics such as proponents of "New Perspectives" (Sanders, Dunn, Wright).
 - Uses patristic, medieval, and modern theological resources alongside close grammatical-syntactical exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin, imputation, covenant headship (federalism), justification (forensic and participatory aspects), Christology insofar as Christ's representative obedience is central, the nature of divine reckoning (logizomai).

- **Closing line**
 - Romans 5:12-21, when read as Paul intended, grounds a biblically faithful doctrine of imputation that unites covenantal representation with forensic reckoning and secures both the universality of condemnation in Adam and the particularity of justification in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on a **bifocal account**: imputation is neither merely juridical fiction nor merely existential participation - it is covenantal representation with real forensic consequence.
 - Methodologically blends careful Greek exegesis with systematic and confessional commitments.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Romans 5 to individual moral influence or to naturalistic transmission of sin (biological heredity without representative reference).
 - Pushes back against "New Perspective" tendencies to downplay forensic language and traditional doctrines of original sin and imputation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions between **representative headship**, **solidarity**, and **reckoning** without severing them; stresses rhetorical parallelism as doctrinally decisive.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles for bringing exegetical rigor to a foundational doctrinal locus.
 - Cited as a model for combining grammatical analysis with covenantal theology; used in subsequent debates over representation and imputation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a compact exegetical defense of classical imputation, pedagogically suited to courses on Romans, soteriology, and covenant theology; helps bridge exegetical study and systematic formulation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation (logizomai / κατὰ λόγον)**: forensic accounting; God reckons Adam's trespass to humanity and Christ's righteousness to believers.
- **Federal / representative headship**: Adam and Christ function as covenant heads whose acts are imputed to those they represent.
- **Solidarity / participation (in Adam / in Christ)**: real relational union with a head - ontological consequences (mortality, corruption) flow from union but are expressed legally by imputation.
- **Forensic vs. ontological**: Poythress insists on both; forensic language (reckoning) expresses legal status grounded in representative union that has ontological effects.
- **One trespass / one act of righteousness**: Paul's parallelism - structural proof-texts for universal condemnation and universal availability of grace.
- **Original sin**: universal corruption and liability to death originating in Adam's act and conveyed by federal representation.
- **Justification**: legal declaration rooted in Christ's representative obedience and imputed righteousness; contrasted with mere moral change.
- **Condemnation and death (ἐφ' ᾧ τὸ θάνατον / death in Adam)**: death as both consequence and forensic sentence.
- **Typology / Adam-Christ typology**: Adam as type of Christ; typological parallelism undergirds theological transfer (sin/righteousness).
- **Reckoning (λογίζομαι)**: technical Pauline verb for accounting - central to the argument for imputation.
- **Covenant theology**: Poythress reads Romans 5 through covenantal categories (covenant of works, covenant of grace) without over-systematizing.
- **Representative causality**: causal category describing how one person's act determines the legal status of others by covenantal agency.
- **New Perspective engagement**: used to rebut readings that minimize forensic language or representative imputation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5:12-21 that foregrounds rhetorical parallelism and grammatical cues.
 - As a **polemic resource** against non-forensic or non-representative accounts of original sin (Pelagianism, some New Perspective proposals).
 - As a **definition source / conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of imputation, justification, and covenant headship in Reformed theology.
