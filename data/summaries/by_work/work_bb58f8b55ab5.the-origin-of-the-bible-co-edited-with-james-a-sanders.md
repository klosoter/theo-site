### TITLE
The Origin of the Bible (co-edited with James A. Sanders) - Lee Martin McDonald

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Product of late 20th-century and turn-of-the-century biblical scholarship; situated in the historical-critical and emerging *canonical* and *reception-history* (Wirkungsgeschichte) milieus.
 - Co-edited by McDonald and James A. Sanders, bringing together historical, textual, and theological perspectives attentive to Jewish and Christian trajectories.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The canonical scriptures of Judaism and Christianity are best understood as historically formed, socially mediated bodies of texts whose authority emerges from complex processes of selection, use, and reception rather than from a single decisive act.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Multi-author volume that traces strands of canon formation across Jewish and Christian contexts:
 - Jewish antecedents: formation of the Hebrew Bible, role of the Septuagint, and intra-Jewish diversity.
 - Christian developments: apostolic traditions, early liturgical use, patristic lists (e.g., Muratorian Fragment, Athanasius), and regional variance.
 - Criteria and mechanisms: apostolicity, orthodoxy, liturgical utility, and communal reception as operative criteria.
 - Theological implications: how notions of revelation, inspiration, and ecclesial authority inform canonicity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic witnesses (Origen, Athanasius, Eusebius), canonical lists (Muratorian, Festal Letter), Septuagint and Tanakh dynamics, Jerome, and modern scholars in canon studies (including Sanders, McDonald, Metzger).
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation, inspiration, ecclesial authority, tradition, scriptural interpretation, and the normative status of texts.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - Canon emerges as an ecclesially mediated, historically situated norm: authoritative because communities received, read, and used certain texts as constitutive for faith and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on *process* over moment: canonicity as gradual reception rather than instantaneous decree.
 - Balanced attention to Jewish roots (Septuagint/Tanakh dynamics) alongside Christian reception, avoiding confessional isolationism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against simplistic models that posit a single authoritative council or royal decree; critiques purely theological accounts that ignore sociological and liturgical factors.
 - Challenges approaches that treat canon as solely a closed, static inventory by highlighting regional variation and chronological development.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Popularizes use of *reception* and *use* as primary explanatory categories for canonicity; treats *canon* as both a textual list and a living function within communities.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely cited in academic canon studies and used in seminary curricula; embraced for its rigorous historical method though sometimes critiqued by confessionalists for perceived relativization of authority.
 - Influenced ecumenical conversations by foregrounding how different traditions arrived at their scriptural corpora.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a synthetic entry point into interdisciplinary canon studies; valuable for courses on biblical theology, historical theology, and reception history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon:** corpus of authoritative texts; treated as historically formed and communally ratified.
- **Canonicity vs. Biblicality:** distinction between what was used as Scripture in practice (biblicality) and the formal status of being canonized.
- **Reception (Wirkungsgeschichte):** emphasis on interpretive and liturgical use as determinant of authority.
- **Apostolicity:** criterion linking texts to apostolic origin or tradition; evaluated historically and theologically.
- **Orthodoxy:** conformity to received teaching as a gauge for inclusion.
- **Liturgical use:** practical reading and worship function as a major factor in canonical acceptance.
- **Septuagint:** role as a Jewish scriptural translation that became formative for early Christian Old Testament shape.
- **Muratorian Fragment / Patristic lists:** primary documentary witnesses for early Christian canons and regional variation.
- **Inspiration:** theological claim about divine origin or guidance of Scripture; examined in light of historical formation.
- **Authority:** ecclesial recognition and normative force that develops through reception.
- **Tradition:** communal memory and transmission practices that sustain canonicity.
- **Formation / Process:** shorthand for multi-stage development (composition, collection, circulation, reception, ratification).
- **Community / Ecclesiology:** the local and catholic church as locus where canon is realized.
- **Textual critical interplay:** relationship between text-criticism and canonical recognition (e.g., Septuagint vs. Masoretic readings).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary, historically grounded understandings of "canon" and "canonicity."
- As a **methodological exemplar** for reception-history and communal-use approaches in biblical theology and church history.
- As a **polemical resource** in debates over scriptural authority-often mobilized to argue that ecclesial reception, not private interpretation, grounds canonical status.
