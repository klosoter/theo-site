### TITLE
The Lord's Supper as the Sign and Meal of the New Covenant (2020) - Guy Prentiss Waters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed scholarship (post-2000s). Engages classic Reformation and Westminster sacramental theology while responding to late 20th-21st century debates about presence, memorialism, and ecclesial practice.
 - Written for pastors, seminary students, and confessional Reformed churches navigating sacrament practice, membership, and discipline.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Lord's Supper is properly understood as both the covenantal **sign (seal)** and a real **meal** of the New Covenant: a sacramental feeding by Christ mediated through the Spirit that both signifies and effects communion with Christ within the visible, covenantal church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: interprets Last Supper texts (e.g., Luke, Paul) within the Old-New Covenant frame (Jeremiah 31; covenant ratification rites).
 - Theological synthesis: integrates covenant theology, Christology, and pneumatology to define the supper as a unique covenant meal.
 - Sacramental mechanics: argues for a spiritual, objective presence of Christ (not bodily local presence) effected by Spirit-enabled communion and union with Christ.
 - Ecclesial ramifications: insists on corporate, covenantal administration - elders, disciplined admission, and table-fencing - derived from the supper's covenant function.
 - Pastoral application: catechesis, worthy reception, and discipline as means to preserve covenant integrity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues broadly with Reformation figures (Calvin, Bucer), Westminster Standards, and Reformed covenantal tradition.
 - Engages contemporary voices on Eucharistic theology - both those tending to memorialism and those advancing stronger notions of presence - though chiefly situated within confessional Presbyterian/Reformed conversation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (central), sacraments, Christology (presence and atonement), pneumatology (Spirit's role in sacramental communion), ecclesiology (visible church, offices, discipline), soteriology (federal headship, union with Christ), and sacramental assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - Waters situates the Lord's Supper squarely as the New Covenant's visible rite: both sign/seal and Spirit-enabled meal that binds covenant members to Christ and presupposes ordered, disciplined, covenantal church life under eldership.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the supper as simultaneously *sign* and *meal* - resisting bifurcations that reduce it either to mere symbol or to an exclusively ontological presence.
 - Clear linkage of sacramental theology to **church polity**: correct administration and access to the table are intrinsic to sacramental integrity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects memorialist reductions that evacuate objective efficacy and pastoral seriousness from the Supper.
 - Distinguishes Reformed spiritual presence from Roman Catholic bodily presence and from Lutheran sacramental union in a way that underscores Spirit-mediated communion without physical transformation.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reframes common language about "feeding on Christ" to emphasize objective covenantal rites effected by the Spirit through ordained means, avoiding purely subjective language of inward experience.
 - Employs covenantal signs/seals vocabulary to reconfirm the supper's juridical and communal dimensions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Favorably received in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian contexts as a robust defense of confessional sacramentology.
 - Used in debates over admission to the Lord's Table, paedocommunion controversies, and practices of discipline and table-fencing.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, doctrinally coherent model linking sacrament theology with practical ecclesiology; valuable for pastors, examiners, and teachers addressing sacramental order and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Covenant**
 - The eschatological covenant inaugurated by Christ; supper as its ratifying meal and sign/seal.

- **Sign and Meal**
 - Dual character: the elements are a sign/seal (public covenant mark) and a real meal (communion with Christ).

- **Seal (sacramental seal)**
 - Covenantal confirmation of promises; grounds for assurance when rightly received.

- **Spiritual Presence**
 - Christ is truly present to believers in the supper by the Spirit - objective communion without corporal presence.

- **Spiritual Feeding / Union with Christ**
 - The supper effects alimental union: believers are fed by Christ spiritually through the Spirit-enabled means.

- **Fencing the Table / Worthy Reception**
 - Pastoral practices of examination and discipline to preserve covenant purity and the supper's efficacy.

- **Visible Church / Covenant Membership**
 - The supper presupposes a visible, covenant community with ordered membership; administration linked to offices.

- **Offices / Eldership**
 - Elders (and ordained officers) bear responsibility for admission, oversight, and administration of the supper.

- **Discipline**
 - Communion and church discipline are correlative: the table serves as both blessing and boundary, requiring corrective measures when covenant fidelity fails.

- **Federal Headship**
 - Union through the representative work of Christ as covenant head; supper applies federal benefits to members.

- **Anamnesis / Commemoration**
 - Memory language retained but embedded within covenant ratification rather than mere recollection.

- **Seal vs. Symbol**
 - Clarifies that a sacrament as seal has juridical efficacy (assurance, confirmation) beyond being merely symbolic.

- **Pneumatological Instrumentality**
 - The Spirit is the instrumental agent who makes the supper effectual for communion.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed sacramental theology linking covenant and sacrament.
- As a **polemic** against both memorialism and excessive corporeal-presence models, especially in Presbyterian debates.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** for interpreting Last Supper texts within covenantal frames and for deriving practical polity implications (offices, discipline, admission).
