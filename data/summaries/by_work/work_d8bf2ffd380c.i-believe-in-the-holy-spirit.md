### TITLE
**I Believe in the Holy Spirit - Michael Green** 
Evangelical-Anglican pneumatological treatment written in the late 20th century amid the charismatic renewal and renewed evangelical interest in the Spirit.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in the period of widespread charismatic renewal within Anglican and wider evangelical churches; aimed at pastors, evangelists, and lay leaders seeking a biblically grounded pneumatology that supports mission.
 - Positioned between academic systematic theology and pastoral handbooks - accessible, pastoral, engaged with both tradition and contemporary experience.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is a present, personal, and active agent in the life of Christ, the church, and mission; Western theology has marginalized the Spirit, producing pastoral and missional impoverishment that must be corrected by recovering biblical pneumatology and normative Spirit-empowerment.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of biblical data: Old Testament anticipations, New Testament fulness (esp. John, Acts, Paul).
 - Historical-theological overview: patristic and medieval emphases, Reformation adjustments, modern neglect.
 - Theological synthesis: personhood and deity of the Spirit within the Trinity; functions (regeneration, sanctification, guidance, empowerment).
 - Practical theology: Spirit and evangelism, gifts and fruit, pastoral formation, worship, sacraments, and mission.
 - Pastoral application: norms for discernment of gifts, warnings against excess and neglect, proposal for normalizing Spirit-baptism and continual filling.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary reliance on Scripture; dialogues with patristic sources and Reformation insights.
 - Engages contemporary theologians and movements - implicitly and explicitly responding to both charismatic leaders and critics (e.g., cessationist positions) and to modern systematicians who downplay the Spirit.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (Spirit as third Person), revelation and Scripture (Spirit's role in inspiration and interpretation), Christology (Spirit's relation to the Son), ecclesiology (Spirit as life of the church), soteriology and sanctification, charismatic gifts vs. fruit, sacramental theology (Spirit in baptism and Eucharist), mission and eschatology (already/not-yet presence).

- **Closing line**
 - Aims to re-center the life and mission of the church around the incarnate activity of the Spirit: personal, empowering, and indispensable for faithful witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong evangelical insistence on the Spirit as agent of mission and conversion; practical guidance for receiving and testing charismatic experience without abandoning doctrinal safeguards.
 - Balances experiential renewal with orthodox Trinitarian confession.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects the historic evangelical tendency to subordinate the Spirit to Scripture only in propositional ways, arguing that Scripture itself portrays the Spirit as active and normative for Christian life.
 - Challenges both cessationist reductionism and uncritical charismatic excess; calls for disciplined, biblically rooted openness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes a pastoral pneumatology that treats "baptism in the Spirit" and "filling" as distinct but complementary phenomena tied to mission and sanctification rather than mere emotional experience.
 - Emphasizes a functional taxonomy: Spirit for witness (evangelism), Spirit for formation (sanctification/fruit), Spirit for ministry (gifts).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Anglican and evangelical circles; influential in helping conservative evangelicals engage charismatic renewal without abandoning doctrinal commitments.
 - Criticized by some Reformed cessationists for perceived openness to contemporary charismatic claims; praised by charismatics for pastoral balance and biblical grounding.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, pastoral bridge between systematic pneumatology and congregational practice; valuable for pastors, missionaries, and students wanting a readable yet theologically responsible introduction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit** - personal, divine, third Person of Trinity; central agent in salvation and mission.
- **Pneumatology** - theological study of the Spirit; Green models how pneumatology interfaces with evangelism and pastoral ministry.
- **Baptism in the Spirit** - distinguished from regeneration; often presented as empowerment for witness and service.
- **Filling of the Spirit** - recurring state or moment of empowerment and sanctification; normative for Christian life.
- **Gifts of the Spirit** - charismatic ministries (prophecy, tongues, healing, etc.) discussed with criteria for discernment and order.
- **Fruit of the Spirit** - moral and spiritual character as normative evidence of Spirit-work; balanced against gift-emphasis.
- **Indwelling vs. empowering** - theologically separates the Spirit's ongoing indwelling (positional) from episodic empowerment for ministry and mission.
- **Spirit and Scripture** - Spirit as author and interpreter of Scripture; permits experiential confirmation but not replacement of biblical authority.
- **Spirit and Church** - Spirit as constitutive life of the church, enabling sacraments, ministry, and community formation.
- **Spirit and Mission** - missionary primacy: conversion and church growth are Spirit-driven, not merely programmatic.
- **Cessationism vs. Continuationism** - Green argues for a continuationist posture that permits ongoing gifts while urging sober testing.
- **Discernment** - practical criteria for evaluating claimed charismatic phenomena.
- **Sanctification** - Spirit as agent of progressive holiness; integration of gift-life with moral formation.
- **Worship and Sacraments** - Spirit-active in baptism and Eucharist; worship as locus of Spirit renewal.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an evangelical definition source for pastoral and mission-focused pneumatology.
 - As a polemical resource against cessationism and against uncritical charismatic excess.
 - As an exegetical-practical model for reading Acts/Paul on gifts and Spirit-empowerment in the context of church life.
