### TITLE
**The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation** - Andrew Fuller (1785)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 18th-century English Particular Baptist context (Evangelical Revival). Published amid controversy over the *free offer* of the gospel and the permissibility of missionary activity.
 - Reaction to contemporary *hyper-Calvinism* within Particular Baptist circles that discouraged general offers of the gospel and missionary zeal.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel is *rightly and morally offered to all sinners*; Christians and ministers are duty-bound to call all to repent and believe. This is compatible with Reformed doctrines such as particular redemption and sovereign election.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis of divine commands addressed to sinners establishes a universal *duty to believe*.
 - Distinguishes between *moral inability* (no excuse for refusal) and *natural inability*; sinners are morally obligated and have moral ability to comply with gospel commands.
 - Affirms that *good works* in the covenant of grace are fruits and evidences of faith, not meritorious causes of acceptance before God.
 - Reconciles particular redemption with the *free offer* by arguing that Christ's atonement is sufficient in warranting the universal invitation even if efficacious only for the elect.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Targets Particular Baptist *hyper-Calvinists* (the school influenced by John Gill and others who denied universal offers or duty to call all to repent).
 - Draws heavily on Scripture, classical Reformed logic, and pastoral reasoning rather than scholastic novelties.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification by faith, particular redemption), covenant theology (covenant of grace), preaching and the gospel call, sanctification (good works), human responsibility and moral ability, duties of ministers.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Fuller insists that Christ's redeeming work both secures the covenant blessings and morally obliges ministers to offer the gospel to all: good works are the fruit and reward of covenant grace, not the ground of acceptance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, systematic defense of the *free and universal offer* of the gospel from within a Calvinistic framework - i.e., duty to believe coexists with particular redemption.
 - Careful account of *duty and ability*: sinners are blameworthy for unbelief because they have a moral ability to repent and believe.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects hyper-Calvinist restraint by reinstating pastoral duty and missionary obligation.
 - Opposes any view that treats good works as merit-bearers for covenant standing (antagonizes Catholic/Arminian or semi-Pelagian tendencies).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tightened use of "duty-faith" language and moral-ability nuance as pastoral-theological tools to motivate evangelism without compromising doctrines of grace.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Pivotal in reviving missionary impetus among English Particular Baptists; influenced the founding climate for the Baptist Missionary Society and supported William Carey's missionism.
 - Long-term influence in evangelical theology as a model reconciling particular atonement with universal gospel proclamation.
- **Enduring value**
 - A template for pastoral Calvinists who seek to defend both divine sovereignty and universal evangelistic obligation; valuable for courses on missions, pastoral theology, and soteriological ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free offer of the gospel** - The public proclamation and invitation of Christ's salvation to all sinners; central thesis defended.
- **Duty to believe / duty of sinners** - Moral obligation of every sinner to repent and believe the gospel.
- **Moral ability (duty-ability)** - The notion that sinners, though depraved, have the moral capacity to comply with gospel commands and are blameworthy if they refuse.
- **Particular redemption (limited atonement)** - Fuller affirms this classic Particular Baptist/Reformed doctrine but separates it from the permissibility of universal offers.
- **Efficacious vs sufficient grace** - Implied distinction: atonement is sufficient in merit for all in warranting the offer; efficacious in application to the elect.
- **Good works in the covenant of grace** - Described as necessary fruits, evidences, and rewards of union with Christ, not as meriting acceptance.
 - Clarifies relation: works follow from, and are sustained by, covenant status; they do not produce it.
- **Imputed righteousness** - Justification rests on Christ's righteousness imputed to believers, not on inherent merit from works.
- **Hyper-Calvinism** - The antagonist position Fuller critiques; characterized by refusal to offer the gospel universally and denial of duty-faith.
- **Antinomianism** - Fuller rejects this, maintaining that grace does not abolish moral obligation; good works remain required.
- **Preaching the law and gospel** - Fuller models pastoral balance: law to awaken, gospel to invite.
- **Covenant of grace** - Framework for understanding salvation, obligations, and rewards; central to Fuller's exegesis.
- **Merit (theological sense)** - Treated negatively as a ground for acceptance; positive as a category for rewards given by God to the faithful.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the doctrine of the free offer and duty-faith within Reformed evangelicalism.
- As **polemic** against hyper-Calvinism and antinomian tendencies.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching and missions that preserves sovereignty while urging universal proclamation.
