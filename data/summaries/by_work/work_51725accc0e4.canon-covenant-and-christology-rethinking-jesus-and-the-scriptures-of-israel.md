### TITLE
Canon, Covenant and Christology: Rethinking Jesus and the Scriptures of Israel - Matthew Barrett

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed conversation (early 21st century) on hermeneutics, biblical theology, and Christology.
 - Responds to tensions between historical-critical study of Israel's scriptures and ecclesial/canonical readings shaped by Christ.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Scriptures of Israel (the Old Testament) are properly read as inherently Christological within a covenantal-canonical framework: Jesus himself reads and interprets Israel's Scriptures as fulfillment of covenant promises, and that practice should govern Christian reading.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses modern bifurcation: the OT as ancient Israelite text vs. the OT as Christian Scripture.
 - Reclaims covenant theology as the connecting grammar: covenant promises and typological structures provide the canonical shape that points to Christ.
 - Shows Jesus' own use of the Scriptures as normative for Christian interpretation - his readings disclose the canon's Christological center.
 - Develops methodological principles for reading the OT that preserve historical integrity while recognizing canonical fulfillment in Christ.
 - Applies these principles to key passages and motifs (promise, law, temple, kingship, suffering-servant patterns).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages canonical theologians (e.g., Brevard Childs), biblical-theological voices (e.g., G. K. Beale, Christopher Wright), and Reformed covenantal tradition.
 - Converses with historical-critical scholars and recent revisionists who separate Israel's intentions from Christian appropriation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as divine self-disclosure), canon (shape and authority), covenant (promise/fulfillment structure), Christology (identity and role of Jesus), typology and fulfillment, hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the canon of Israel, read covenantally and in light of Jesus' own interpretive practice, discloses Christ as the living telos of Israel's Scriptures and so must govern Christian doctrine and reading.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight integration of classic Reformed covenant theology with a canonical hermeneutic that privileges Jesus' own readings of Scripture.
 - Moves beyond either purely historical-critical or merely devotional Christ-centering by offering a rule-governed, ecclesial reading rooted in covenantal promise.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects approaches that treat the OT as a neutral, non-Christological ancient text or that impose anachronistic NT categories without respecting Israelite context.
 - Differentiates from Brevard Childs: affirms canonical-shape importance but insists on Christ's interpretive practice (not only canonical final form) as normative.
 - Contrasts with minimalizing views of typology that reduce it to allegory; insists on covenantal-historical continuity (typology as real, promise-fulfillment).
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reclaims the phrase "Scriptures of Israel" to emphasize original covenant context while insisting on their Christian canonical destiny.
 - Treats "fulfillment" as covenantal realization, not simple replacement or spiritualization.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Positive uptake in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries for courses on hermeneutics, biblical theology, and Christology.
 - Stimulates debate with historical-critical scholars and moderates between radical canonical and strict historical reconstructions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for preaching, doctrine, and exegesis that maintains historical respect for Israel while affirming Christ as Scripture's theological center.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scriptures of Israel**
 - Emphasizes the Old Testament's identity as Israel's canonical corpus and its covenantal context.
- **Canon**
 - The final shape and authority of Scripture that constrains legitimate interpretation.
- **Covenant**
 - The organizing theological grammar (promises, land, seed, kingship) that structures Israel's story and points forward to Christ.
- **Christology**
 - Reading Jesus as the fulfillment and hermeneutical key to the covenantal promises in the Scriptures of Israel.
- **Fulfillment**
 - Covenantal realization of promises in Christ; continuity without reductionism or wholesale replacement.
- **Typology**
 - Real, historico-theological correspondences (persons, institutions, events) that anticipate Christ within redemptive-historical progression.
- **Canonical hermeneutic**
 - Interpretive method that reads texts in their canonical relations and final form, informed by Christ's own use of Scripture.
- **Jesus' use of Scripture**
 - Normative paradigm: how Jesus quotes, reinterprets, and fulfills Israel's texts shapes Christian reading.
- **Historical integrity**
 - Respect for the original Sitz im Leben of Israelite texts while recognizing their canonical-covenantal trajectory.
- **Two-testament continuity**
 - Theological claim of organic continuity between Israel's Scriptures and the apostolic witness without conflating distinct authorship or literary horizons.
- **Promise-fulfillment structure**
 - Analytical frame for tracing covenantal expectations to their realization in Christ.
- **Hermeneutical rule**
 - Principle that the interpretive practice of Christ and the apostles governs contemporary reading.
- **Typological realism**
 - The doctrine that types instantiate genuine prophetic-covenantal relations, not mere rhetorical similarity.
- **Ecclesial reading**
 - The Church's corporate, canonical appropriation of Israel's Scriptures as Scripture for Christendom.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for a covenantal-canonical hermeneutic in systematic and biblical theology.
 - As a polemical resource against readings that isolate the OT from Christological fulfillment or that denigrate typology.
 - As an exegetical model and sermonic guide for tracing promise-fulfillment patterns and for reading Jesus' own hermeneutics as normative.
