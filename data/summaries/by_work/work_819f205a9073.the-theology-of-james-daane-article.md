### TITLE
**Cornelius Van Til - "The Theology of James Daane" (article)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed theological conversation in North America; Van Til writes as a systematician and apologetician conversant with confessional Reformed scholarship and contemporary covenant theology debates.
 - Conversation takes place against renewed interest in confessional covenant formulations, sacramental theology, and the relationship of forensic and ontological accounts of redemption.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Van Til reads Daane as a careful, confessional covenant theologian who centers **union with Christ** as the structural key to soteriology, sacramental practice, and sanctification; Van Til both affirms Daane's emphases and presses for sharper integration of epistemology, Christology, and antithesis.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical and confessional grounding
 - Daane roots his system in the Reformed confessions and in a covenantal reading of Scripture; Van Til highlights this confessional fidelity.
 - Covenant as organizing principle
 - Daane treats the **Covenant of Grace** as the matrix for sacraments, regeneration, and progressive sanctification.
 - Union with Christ and soteriology
 - Union is primary: justification, sanctification (both definitive and progressive), and sacramental efficacy are explicated from union.
 - Sacraments and means of grace
 - Daane emphasizes sacraments as covenantal means-signs and seals-through which the Spirit applies Christ.
 - Eschatology and consummation
 - The New Heavens and New Earth are treated as the consummation of covenantal promises; kingdom language is tied to Christ's messianic consciousness.
 - Methodological critique (Van Til)
 - Van Til presses Daane on the presuppositional/epistemic dimension: how theological knowledge is grounded, the antithesis between God's and man's thinking, and the implications for law‑gospel distinctions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed confessions (Westminster, Belgic/Heidelberg formulations), patristic and Reformation covenantal tradition.
 - Contemporary Reformed figures: Daane as primary subject; Van Til frames his critique using broader Reformed thinkers and his own presuppositional method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant theology, Trinity (as context for application), Christology (messianic consciousness, twofold office), soteriology (union, justification, regeneration, sanctification), sacraments (means of grace), eschatology (new creation), pneumatology (application of redemption).

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til presents Daane as a rigorously confessional covenant theologian who places **union with Christ** at the heart of doctrine, while insisting that Daane's schema needs sharper epistemic and Christological articulation to safeguard the antithesis and the divine ordering of revelation and faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, integrated emphasis on **definitive and progressive sanctification**: a juridical, covenantal positing that is then worked out existentially by the Spirit.
 - Treatment of sacraments explicitly as **means of grace** within a federal covenantal framework, not mere signs.
 - Attention to **Christ's messianic consciousness** and the concrete historical‑ontological reality of the kingdom in Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Van Til both praises Daane's confessional fidelity and contrasts his method with presuppositional concerns: he urges clearer grounding of theological claims in the divine revelation and a more explicit doctrine of the antithesis against naturalistic or experiential reductions.
 - Pushback against overly forensic accounts that risk severing sacramental/ontological union aspects from justification.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinctive pairing and sustained use of the phrase **definitive and progressive sanctification** as a theological hinge.
 - Nuanced language about sacramental functioning (sign, seal, and Spirit's instrumental activity) within covenantal federalism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among confessional Reformed teachers for integrating sacramental theology with covenantal soteriology.
 - Read by those interested in bridging exegetical issues (union with Christ) with systematic concerns (sanctification, sacraments).
 - Subject of critique by presuppositionalists and some federalists who ask for clearer epistemic foundations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined, confessional account linking union, covenant, and sacramental practice.
 - Provokes fruitful methodological reflection: how do confession, exegesis, and epistemology cohere in Reformed theology?

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ**
 - Primary organizing category for soteriology; Daane grounds justification, regeneration, and sanctification in this union; Van Til affirms but demands stronger Christological/epistemic undergirding.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The structural matrix for redemptive history, sacraments, and salvation‑history promises.
- **Law‑Gospel Distinction**
 - Treated as necessary for pastoral and doctrinal clarity; Van Til probes how Daane applies it within covenantal praxis.
- **Definitive and Progressive Sanctification**
 - Definitive: juridical/positional reality in Christ; Progressive: experiential/ethical outworking by the Spirit.
- **Sacraments as Means of Grace**
 - Sacraments function instrumentally by the Spirit within the covenant; not merely symbolic but neither automatic.
- **Regeneration and Indwelling**
 - Spirit's application of redemption; discussed in relation to covenantal promises and sacramental life.
- **Christ's Messianic Consciousness and Kingdom**
 - Emphasis on Christ's awareness of mission and the inaugurated aspect of the kingdom tied to his person and work.
- **New Heavens and New Earth**
 - Eschatological consummation of covenant promises and restoration of creation.
- **Confessional Formulations of Covenant**
 - Use of historic confessions as interpretive and normative frames for systematics.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Adam/Christ as covenant heads shaping corporate identity and imputation language.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition/source** for integrating covenantal soteriology with sacramental theology.
 - As a **polemic** resource in debates over epistemology and the law‑gospel balance within Reformed theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for defenders of union with Christ and those seeking to link union language to sanctification and sacramental praxis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary courses on covenant theology, illustrating tensions between confessional fidelity and methodological clarity.
