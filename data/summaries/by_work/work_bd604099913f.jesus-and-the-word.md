### TITLE
Jesus and the Word - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century German New Testament scholarship; Bultmann writes from the vantage of form criticism, historical-critical method, and existentialist hermeneutics (in dialogue with Heidegger). Reaction to both liberal historical Jesus research and metaphysical Logos traditions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Johannine and classical Logos language must be read as proclamational, not as metaphysical description of a preexistent divine being. The "Word" is primarily God's self-communication in the kerygma; Christology must be rooted in existential encounter rather than metaphysical speculation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critique of metaphysical Logos interpretations (Hellenistic/Philo-derived readings) that posit a preexistent ontological Logos as first principle.
 - Historical-critical analysis of Johannine usage: the Gospel's Logos-speech is theological appropriation of apostolic proclamation about Jesus.
 - Proposal of a hermeneutic: **demythologization** - distinguish mythic cosmological language from the existential content of faith; interpret mythic elements as symbolic of existential decision.
 - Re-centering of Christian truth in the kerygma: the "Word" is an event (word-event) that demands existential response; resurrection is the decisive kerygmatic claim.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Philo and Stoic Logos concepts, Johannine Gospel and Pauline kerygma, contemporary scholars like Harnack and earlier patristic readings; engagement with Heidegger's existential categories for hermeneutics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (preexistence, incarnation), revelation (Word as self-communication), eschatology (kingdom and imminent eschaton), ecclesiology (church as community of proclamation), hermeneutics (myth vs. proclamation).
- **Closing line:** Bultmann relocates the "Word" from metaphysical ontology to proclaimed, existential encounter - theology becomes interpretation of the kerygma as the decisive Word-event that summons faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Priority of kerygma: theology must begin with the proclaimed event, not speculative metaphysics.
 - Demythologization as theological method: remove premodern cosmology to disclose existential demand.
 - "Word" reframed as event rather than static metaphysical entity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects Harnackian liberal reductionism that collapses kerygma into mere ethical teaching, yet also opposes metaphysical Logos traditions that make the Word an ontological hypostasis.
 - Differs from Barth by stressing existential appropriation and historical-critical exegesis over Barth's dogmatic priority of the divine Word as sovereign revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Word-event" (logos as proclamational event) and methodological use of demythologization.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential in 20th-century mainline and academic theology; a flashpoint for critiques from conservative, confessional, and neo-orthodox quarters.
 - Reformed scholars debated its implications for sacramental and confessional claims; some pastoral and polity implications were hotly contested (see uses in ecclesiology and office/discipline debates).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes critical rethinking of Christology, proclamation, and how Scripture communicates truth; a durable model for integrating form criticism with theological hermeneutics even where its conclusions are disputed.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Logos (Word):** For Bultmann, primarily the proclamational Word - God's self-communication in kerygma rather than a preexistent metaphysical hypostasis.
- **Demythologization:** Method to reinterpret mythic cosmology as symbolic/existential meaning, not literal scientific claim.
- **Kerygma:** Apostolic proclamation as the center of Christian message; the medium in which the Word is encountered.
- **Word-event (Wort-Ereignis):** The Word understood as an event that calls for a decision and existential response.
- **Existential Interpretation:** Reading texts to disclose existential choice and human authenticity in response to God's call.
- **Preexistence (of Christ):** Problematic in Bultmann's reading when taken metaphysically; Johannine preexistence language becomes theological expression of the kerygma.
- **Resurrection:** Treated as the kerygmatic affirmation that creates the community and confronts hearers with decision; historical-critical and proclamational dimensions distinguished.
- **Eschatological Kingdom:** Interpreted as imminent eschatological reality proclaimed by Jesus - not a present political institution.
- **Messianic consciousness:** Bultmann sees Jesus' self-understanding chiefly as prophetic-apocalyptic rather than metaphysical self-consciousness of divine preexistence.
- **Church (ekklesia):** Community formed by the proclaimed Word; its identity grounded in kerygma rather than institutional metaphysics.
- **Form Criticism:** Method employed to distinguish historical strata and forms of the tradition underlying Gospel language.
- **Myth vs. Faith:** Mythic elements are reinterpreted to preserve faith's existential call without naïve cosmology.
- **Proclamation (Predigt):** The locus where Word-event occurs and ecclesial life is constituted.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As an **exegetical model** for Johannine and Pauline Christology, especially in studies of "Christ's Messianic Consciousness and Kingdom" (reframes kingdom-language as eschatological proclamation).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and debates over "Church and Kingdom," influencing arguments that the church's authority rests in kerygma rather than metaphysical claims about institutional office.
 - As a **polemic/resource** in discussions of "Church Government, Presbyterian Polity, Offices, Discipline": cited by interlocutors who argue that offices and discipline must be justified by proclamational function and existential formation rather than ontological clerical status.
