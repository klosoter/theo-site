### TITLE
The Person of Jesus (1937) - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the interwar era amid the American fundamentalist-modernist controversy and continuing European critical theology. Machen writes as a Princeton/Reformed conservative defending historic Christian doctrine against liberal reductionism.
- **Central thesis**
 - The essential truth about Christianity hinges on the historical, personal reality of Jesus Christ: fully God and fully man in one divine Person. Denials of this truth reduce Christianity to mere ethics, myth, or religion of experience.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern theology often demythologizes Jesus into an exemplar, moral teacher, or religious genius.
 - Exposition: close appeal to Scripture and the church's doctrinal heritage to show the New Testament witness to Christ's unique personhood.
 - Doctrinal vindication: affirmation of the Incarnation as a real **hypostatic union** - one Person, two natures - and recovery of the Chalcedonian formulation as the correct safeguard.
 - Practical consequence: only the historic Christian confession of Christ secures forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and the objective reality of redemption.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages modernists/liberals (American and German), higher criticism, and Ritschlian reductions of Christ.
 - Draws on New Testament testimony, patristic writers, Chalcedonian Definition, and Reformation theology; tacit allyship with conservative scholars (e.g., B. B. Warfield).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: Christology (Person and natures), Incarnation, Atonement, Virgin Birth, Miracles.
 - Secondary: Revelation, Trinity (as implicated), authority of Scripture, historic orthodoxy.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Authentic Christianity rests on the historic, personal union of divine and human in Jesus Christ; to deny that is to undermine the gospel itself.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes the **person** over abstract metaphysical categories: the central concern is that Jesus is a real, historical Person who is God incarnate.
 - Combines apologetic insistence on historicity with doctrinal precision-neither purely historical-critical nor purely abstract dogmatics.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal/proto-liberal tendencies that reduce Christ to an ethical teacher, religious ideal, or myth. Rejects subjectivizing Jesus into feeling or culture.
 - Reaffirms the church's creedal language (especially Chalcedon) against modern reinterpretation that dissolves the twofold nature.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - While upholding Chalcedon, Machen stresses the sufficiency of the classical language for guarding the gospel rather than inventing new technicalities.
 - Uses "person" (hypostasis) as the decisive term to secure continuity with patristic and Reformation orthodoxy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; used as a clear, accessible defense of orthodox Christology in seminaries and polemical writings.
 - Less traction in liberal-critical and some mainline academic circles, where methodological premises differ.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, robust statement of orthodox Christology: pedagogically useful, polemically sharp, and faithful to classical formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Person (Hypostasis)** - Machen's focal term: one concrete subject who is both God and man; resists fragmentation of the identity of Christ.
- **Hypostatic Union** - Central doctrine affirmed: the real, personal union of divine and human natures in the one person of Jesus.
 - Site usage: used as a primary reference point for discussions under the topic "Hypostatic Union" - Machen supplies a pastoral-apologetic explanation linking biblical testimony to the classical formula.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine** - Accepted and appealed to as the orthodox safeguard: "one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, acknowledged in two natures, unconfusedly, unchangedly, indivisibly, inseparably."
 - Site usage: invoked as authoritative under the topic "Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine" - Machen treats Chalcedon as the correct hermeneutical-linguistic distillation of Scripture's witness.
- **Incarnation** - Real enfleshment: God becoming man without loss or confusion of divinity.
- **Atonement / Substitution** - Treats atonement as grounded in the personal reality of Christ; substitutionary elements presuppose a true human/divine mediator.
- **Virgin Birth & Miracles** - Emphasized as integral to the historical claim for Christ's uniqueness; not optional trimmings.
- **Historic Faith** - The corpus of creedal and biblical affirmations that Machen says must be preserved intact.
- **Modernism / Liberal Reductionism** - Negative foil: theological movements that reinterpret Christ into categories of ethics, myth, or religious feeling.
- **Scriptural Witness** - For Machen, primary source confirming personhood and the twofold nature; creeds are interpretive summaries of that witness.
- **Orthodoxy (Patristic-Reformation continuity)** - Machen reads patristic and Reformation statements as sustaining the same essential confession.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for pastoral and evangelical summaries of the hypostatic union and Chalcedonian commitment.
- As a **polemic** against liberal and modernist Christologies that deny the historic-personal identity of Jesus.
- As an **exegetical model** linking New Testament testimony to creedal formulations rather than reconstructing Christ solely by historical-critical methods.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching to re-center doctrine around the personhood of Christ rather than abstract doctrinal fragments.
