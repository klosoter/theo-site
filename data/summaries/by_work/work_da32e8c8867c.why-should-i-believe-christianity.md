### TITLE
Why Should I Believe Christianity? - James N. Anderson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical apologetic aimed at lay and seeking audiences; written in the milieu of 21st-century skepticism and the post-New Atheism conversation.
 - Pastoral orientation: intended for churches, small groups, and individual readers looking for a clear, readable defense of Christian faith.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity is a rationally warranted, existentially viable faith: there are sufficient historical, moral, and experiential grounds to justify belief in the Christian claims, especially the person and work of Jesus Christ.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prefatory epistemology: distinguishes warranted belief from mere fideism and from purely rationalistic proof; argues for a cumulative-case approach.
 - Natural theology and moral arguments: brief appeal to the order, contingency, and moral conscience as pointers to a theistic foundation.
 - Historical case for Jesus: focuses on the reliability of the New Testament, the plausibility of miracles, and the centrality of the resurrection as the decisive historical event.
 - Experiential and transformational evidence: points to moral change, personal testimony, and community continuity as corroborating signs.
 - Practical consequences and plausibility structure: shows Christianity's explanatory power for suffering, meaning, and human destiny.
 - Pastoral application: invitations to investigate, trust, and enter Christian community.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary skeptics generally (the problem of unbelief, popular atheism) and converses with classic apologetic resources (C.S. Lewis-style moral argument, evidentialist historians).
 - Uses New Testament material, historical-critical considerations at an accessible level, and popular-level philosophical arguments.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority and reliability)
 - Christology (identity and resurrection of Jesus)
 - Atonement and salvation (practical implications)
 - Providence, the problem of evil, and human sin
 - Faith versus reason, and the role of witness and community

- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity**
 - Christianity is presented as a historically rooted, intellectually defensible faith whose truth is confirmed by historical evidence, moral transformation, and its power to answer ultimate human questions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes a *cumulative apologetic* aimed at the doubting seeker rather than technical academic debate; balances evidential claims with pastoral sensitivity.
 - Treats the resurrection as the keystone that integrates historical and existential evidence.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects pure fideism (faith without reasons) and also pushes back against sterile rationalism that demands God be proven like a scientific hypothesis.
 - Contrasts with purely philosophical apologetics by giving weight to historical and testimonial grounds.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "belief" as intellectually responsible yet life-engaging: warranted belief that shapes moral life and community belonging.
 - Uses practical plausibility (how well Christianity explains lived human experience) alongside historical probability.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but steady adoption in evangelical circles, especially as a resource for outreach and introductory apologetics.
 - Not widely cited in academic theology but often used in church education and lay apologetics lists.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Useful pedagogically for beginners in apologetics; models how to combine historical arguments with pastoral application.
 - Serves as a practical exemplar of a balanced, non-academic cumulative-case apologetic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cumulative case** - building belief from multiple modest arguments rather than a single decisive proof.
- **Warranted belief** - belief that is rationally justified and appropriate given the evidence and context.
- **Historical reliability** - claims about the trustworthiness of the New Testament and early testimony to Jesus.
- **Resurrection** - treated as the central historical claim whose confirmation grounds Christian truth.
- **Miracles** - addressed as historically investigable events, not merely supernatural assertions.
- **Faith and reason** - balanced: reason prepares and supports, faith completes and personalizes.
- **Moral argument** - conscience and moral order as pointers to God and as a critique of naturalism.
- **Transformational evidence** - personal and communal change as corroborative, not decisive, evidence.
- **Problem of evil** - acknowledged and addressed as a pastoral and philosophical challenge to belief.
- **Revelation** - Scripture as witness to God's self-disclosure, defended at an accessible level.
- **Testimony** - the role of witness (apostolic and contemporary) in transmitting and confirming belief.
- **Plausibility structure** - how Christianity coheres with human experience and explanatory needs.
- **Atonement & salvation** - practical implications emphasized for moral and existential change.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **introductory source** in evangelism and small-group curricula: accessible framing of reasons for belief.
 - As a **pedagogical model** for teaching a balanced cumulative-case apologetic that combines history, philosophy, and testimony.
 - As a **pastoral/evangelistic polemic** against popular skepticism and New Atheist rhetoric, suitable for lay audiences.
