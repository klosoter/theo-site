### TITLE
No One Like Him: The Doctrine of God (2001) - John S. Feinberg

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Published in 2001 amid late-20th-century evangelical engagement with analytic philosophy of religion and renewed debates over divine sovereignty (Reformed revival), Open Theism, and Molinism. Feinsberg writes from an evangelical/Reformed academic milieu (Trinity Evangelical Divinity School).
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** A systematic defense and exposition of classical theism that affirms both God's absolute uniqueness and sovereignty and the biblical reality of creaturely freedom and moral responsibility. The central aim is to show "there is no one like God" by articulating coherent, biblical, and philosophically robust doctrines of the divine attributes and God's relation to creation.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Begins with God as the transcendent, personal creator (aseity, simplicity) and proceeds through divine attributes (incommunicable and communicable).
 - Treats God's knowledge, power, will, eternity, and presence, integrating biblical exegesis with analytic philosophical tools.
 - Addresses contested topics: divine foreknowledge, providence, theodicy, and human freedom - arguing for sovereignty without diminishing genuine creaturely agency and responsibility.
 - Concludes with pastoral and apologetic applications: worship, prayer, trust, and theological ethics grounded in God's character.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical sources (Scripture, Augustine, Aquinas), Reformed theologians (Calvin, Puritans), contemporary philosophers and theologians - Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, proponents of Molinism, and critics like advocates of Open Theism (e.g., Clark Pinnock, Greg Boyd). Also interacts with analytic literature on omniscience, simplicity, and divine timelessness.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, divine attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity (overview and implications for attributes), providence, creation, eternity, omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, sovereignty, human sin and freedom, the problem of evil, and pastoral implications.
- **Closing line:** A careful, evangelical defense of classical theism that insists on God's unrivaled, coherent grandeur while preserving human responsibility and pastoral trust in divine governance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on classical attribute-talk (simplicity, immutability) but rendered pastorally and apologetically - not merely technical metaphysics.
 - Strives to harmonize robust divine sovereignty with meaningful creaturely freedom and moral responsibility.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Critical of Open Theism for undermining divine omniscience/sovereignty and of some Molinist accounts for sacrificing aspects of divine providential control.
 - Pushes back on reductionist modern portrayals of God as merely a supreme moral exemplar or deistic watchmaker.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses analytic categories to refine traditional terms (e.g., clarifying modes of divine knowledge, nuances in "will" vs "decree") rather than reinventing theological vocabulary.
 - Careful distinction between metaphysical doctrines (simplicity) and pastoral language (anthropomorphic accommodations).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical classrooms and as a reference in Reformed circles for doctrine of God.
 - Praised for clarity and apologetic utility; critiqued by some for conservative presuppositions and limited engagement with non-Western or radical critical perspectives.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Excellent bridge between classical theological formulations and analytic-philosophical rigor; useful for teaching attributes, providence, and sin/free-will tensions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine aseity:** God as self-existent and independent; ultimate ground of being.
- **Divine simplicity:** God is not composite; attributes are identical to God's essence (Feinberg defends classical account while noting philosophical pressures against naïve formulations).
- **Immutability & impassibility:** God does not undergo metaphysical change or passively suffer; Feinberg explains these in ways that allow relational responsiveness without mutation.
- **Omniscience:** God possesses exhaustive knowledge of actualities and counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (Feinberg rejects Open Theism's denial of exhaustive knowledge).
- **Providence & sovereignty:** God ordains, permits, and governs all things to accomplish divine purposes; sovereignty is compatible with creaturely agency.
- **Divine foreknowledge & human freedom:** Argument that foreknowledge and decree do not negate genuine moral responsibility; Feinberg balances biblical exegesis with philosophical analysis to defend compatibility.
- **Problem of evil / theodicy:** Emphasizes human sin as morally causative without making God the author of sin; appeals to greater-good and sovereignty-responsibility frameworks.
- **Eternity (atemporal vs everlasting):** Affirms God's eternal nature, discusses tensions between atemporal and temporal models; leans toward classical atemporal understanding while engaging modern objections.
- **Anthropomorphism & analogy:** Uses analogical language to speak of God truly while acknowledging creaturely limitations.
- **Communicable vs incommunicable attributes:** Distinguishes what humans may share analogically (e.g., goodness) vs what belongs uniquely to God (aseity).
- **Holiness & divine wrath:** Presents holiness as normative ground for divine justice and redemptive purposes.
- **Omnipotence & the paradoxes:** Defends a robust but coherent account of omnipotence that excludes logical contradictions.
- **Moral responsibility & sin:** Sin is real, voluntary, and causally efficacious; human choices are morally accountable within God's providence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical theistic doctrines and evangelical formulations of God's attributes.
- As a **polemic** resource against Open Theism and some forms of Molinism while articulating a Reformed-compatible account of sovereignty and freedom.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Scripture about God's attributes and providence; also a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking philosophical theism with pastoral theology.
