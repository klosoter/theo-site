### TITLE
The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine - A. A. Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 19th-century American Presbyterianism (Princeton). Hodge, son of Charles Hodge, writes as a confessional theologian within the post-Weston/Princeton milieu reacting to revival excesses, rising liberalism and higher criticism. The book functions as a concise, practical exposition of the Westminster Confession and Larger/Shorter Catechisms for pastors, elders and students.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To set forth and defend a coherent, Scripture-grounded system of Reformed doctrine as expressed in the Westminster standards, showing its sufficiency for church teaching and pastoral guidance in the face of contemporary theological challenges.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Systematic exposition following the sequence of the Westminster Confession (Scripture, God, decrees, creation, providence, fall, covenant, Christ, salvation, church, sacraments, civil magistrate, eschatology).
 - Each article: statement of the confession, scriptural proof, doctrinal analysis, polemical remarks versus opposing views, pastoral implications.
 - Emphasis on the objective, covenantal structure of redemption and on the confessional bonds of church authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary sources: Scripture and the Westminster Confession and Catechisms.
 - Tradition: Augustine, Calvin, the Westminster divines, Turretin, and contemporary Princeton theology (e.g., Charles Hodge).
 - Interlocutors: Arminianism, revivalist anti-intellectualism, rationalist/higher-critical trends, Unitarianism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, authority), the Trinity, decrees and predestination, creation and providence, original sin, covenant theology (works and grace), Christology (two natures, atonement), justification (imputation), adoption, sanctification, means of grace, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), church government (presbyterian polity), civil magistrate, eschatology (resurrection, judgment).
- **Closing line:** A. A. Hodge offers a compact, pastorally-minded defense of classical Reformed, confessional orthodoxy, presenting the Westminster system as the faithful exposition of biblical Christianity and the antidote to contemporary error.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the confessional standard as a functional theological rule: Scripture interpreted within the confessional framework.
 - Covenantal reading of all redemptive history; consistent federalism structures doctrinal exposition.
 - Balances scholastic precision with pastoral brevity - a handbook rather than exhaustive treatise.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects revivalist sentimentalism by insisting on doctrinal instruction and sacramental means.
 - Counters liberal and rationalist tendencies by reaffirming verbal inspiration, inerrancy, and the supernatural character of revelation.
 - Engages Arminian objections to particular election and imputation with exegetical and theological arguments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not so much novel terminology as clarified application: a tightened, accessible presentation of Westminster categories for American Presbyterian usage.
 - Recasts classic categories (election, covenant, sacramental signs) in pedagogical, parish-ready language.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Presbyterian seminaries and churches as a compact confessional manual; shaped late 19th- and early 20th-century American Reformed identity.
 - Frequently cited in subscription controversies and in defenses of confessional orthodoxy against modernism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a reliable, concise guide to Westminster theology; excellent for pastors, elders and students needing a confessional summation with pastoral applications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith:** The guiding normative document for Hodge; text he explicates and defends.
- **Scripture (inspiration and authority):** Affirmed as verbally inspired, infallible and the sole rule of faith and practice.
- **Covenant (federal theology):**
 - Covenant of works and covenant of grace structuring the order of redemption.
 - Emphasizes federal headship and covenant signs/seals.
- **Predestination/Election:** Particular, unconditional election affirmed as biblical and pastorally consoling.

- **Justification (imputation):** Forensic declaration by God through imputation of Christ's righteousness, received by faith alone.
