### TITLE
The Covenant of Works - Francis Turretin (treated in secondary literature by J. V. Fesko)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687) writing at the Academy of Geneva amid polemics with Roman Catholics, Socinians, Arminians, and internal Reformed disputes (e.g., Amyraldism, Voetian controversies). Fesko's secondary treatment recovers and interprets Turretin's classical articulation for contemporary covenant theology debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Defend the reality, form, and juridical function of a distinct prelapsarian *covenant of works* between God and Adam: obedience under promise of life (and disobedience under threat of death) with Adam as federal head whose failure makes Christ's mediatorial work necessary.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define the covenantal category: a bilateral, legal promise grounded in the divine law and explicit precept (Genesis 2:16-17).
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of Genesis and subsequent canonical affirmations (Rom 5; 1 Cor 15) to establish federal headship and imputation.
 - Juridical analysis: characterize the stipulation (perfect obedience), the sanction (life vs. death), and the reward as justly due for conditionally meritorious obedience.
 - Polemic move: rebut rival readings that reduce the arrangement to mere command, probation without promise, or that deny Adam's capacity to merit reward.
 - Theological consequence: show how Adam's failure necessitates the covenant of grace and Christ's obedience/satisfaction.
- **Figures / sources engaged:** Scripture (Genesis, Paul), Augustine and Calvin as authoritative precedents; contemporary interlocutors include Arminians, Socinians, Roman Catholic scholastics, and intra-Reformed opponents (Amyraldians, rationalists). Fesko interacts with Turretin's Latin loci and modern covenantal debates.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (works vs. grace), original sin, federal headship and imputation, law and reward, merit (condign vs. congruous), Christology (necessity of the Mediator), soteriology, divine justice and promise.
- **Closing line:** Turretin locates the covenant of works as a juridical, promise-bearing pact that both explains Adam's culpability and frames the necessity and shape of redemption-making the covenantal distinction foundational for orthodox Reformed soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Precise juridical language: Turretin insists on contract-like stipulations, conditional reward, and legally just grounds for merit.
 - Strong defense of *condign* merit in a covenantal context: Adam could, by obedience under promise, deserve life as a fitting and just reward.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against views that treat Genesis 2 merely as moral command or as a probation without a promise; opposes Socinian denial of penalty and Arminian reinterpretations of merit.
 - Rejects overly mystical or covenantless accounts that collapse law into mere relational testing.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced partitioning of merit categories within covenantal legalism rather than indebtedness-only schemes.
 - Systematic linking of prelapsarian covenant form with postlapsarian redemptive order.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in later Reformed orthodoxy and conservative covenant theology; frequently cited by confessionalists and later scholasticizers.
 - Modern reception mixed: valued by conservative Reformed scholars (e.g., Fesko) for clarity; contested by some modern theologians who reinterpret covenantal categories or deny condign merit.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models a rigorous, exegetically rooted account of the covenant of works useful for polemics, pastoral instruction on sin and grace, and for precise soteriological formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** The pre-Fall covenant in which Adam was promised life for perfect obedience; juridical and conditional.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The divine covenant enacted after the Fall to secure salvation by Christ's obedience and satisfaction.
- **Federal Headship (Representational Headship):** Adam stands for all his descendants; his covenantal act has corporate consequences (Sin and death imputed).
- **Imputation:** The forensic transfer of guilt/condemnation (Adam's sin to us) and of righteousness (Christ's obedience to believers).
- **Condign Merit:** Merit that is due in justice because of a promise; Turretin uses this to affirm that Adam's obedient life would have been justly rewarded.
- **Congruous Merit:** A lesser, fitting merit (used contrastively); Turretin distinguishes it from condign merit to rebut critics.
- **Prelapsarian State:** The original condition of Adam before sin with its covenantal privileges and obligations.
- **Law as Covenant:** The identification of the divine command in Genesis as a covenantal stipulation rather than merely moral law.
- **Sanction (Reward and Penalty):** Life as promised reward; death as just penalty for breached condition-central to the covenant's coercive-legal character.
- **Probation:** The limited testing or trial character of Adam's state; discussed especially in "What If Adam Had Not Sinned" hypotheticals.
- **Hypothetical perseverance / counterfactuals (What If Adam Had Not Sinned):** Turretin's treatment of the theological consequences had Adam obeyed-used to clarify merit, progeny, and the contingency of redemptive necessity.
- **Satisfaction vs. Reparation:** Distinction in penal language-Turretin emphasizes Christ's satisfying honor and justice rendered, connecting back to the covenantal breach.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed covenant theology (clear taxonomy of covenants).
- As **polemic material** against Arminianism, Socinianism, and reductionist readings of Genesis.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 2-3 juridically and for grounding federal headship in Pauline theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting covenantal structure to Christology and the doctrine of merit/imputation.
