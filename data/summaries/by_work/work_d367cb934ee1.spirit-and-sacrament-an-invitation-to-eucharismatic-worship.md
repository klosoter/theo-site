### TITLE
**Spirit and Sacrament: An Invitation to Eucharismatic Worship - Andrew Wilson**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary theological/liturgical conversation at the intersection of **liturgical renewal**, **charismatic renewal**, and ecumenical sacramental theology.
 - A corrective voice aimed at anglophone Protestantism (Anglican, Reformed, charismatic streams) seeking to recover sacramental depth without losing pneumatological vitality.

- **Central thesis**
 - Worship must be reframed as **eucharismatic**: a synthesis in which the Holy Spirit actively mediates Christ's presence in the sacrament so that Eucharist and charismatic life mutually inform and complete one another.
 - The sacraments are not static tokens but Spirit-energized encounters that form the body of Christ in an eschatological, communal way.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern worship has bifurcated - formal sacramental liturgy often lacks Spirit-led vitality; charismatic praxis often lacks sacramental shape and theological depth.
 - Theological groundwork: pneumatology as the key to sacramental presence; Spirit as the agent who makes Christ present and forms communal participation.
 - Historical retrieval: readings of patristic, Reformation, and Anglican sacramental thought to reclaim an embodied, incarnational sacramentality.
 - Practical liturgy: proposals and examples for eucharistic rites shaped by charismatic sensitivity (explicitly integrating prayer for the Spirit, use of spiritual gifts within ordered liturgy, pastoral guidance).
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: formation of congregations, catechesis for participatory sacramental worship, ecumenical potential.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classic sacramental traditions (patristic writers, medieval/Anglican sacramentalists, Reformation debates) and contemporary pneumatologists/pentecostal theologians as interlocutors.
 - Dialogues implicitly with critics of charismatic practice and with those who see sacraments as merely symbolic or purely institutional.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central), **Eucharistic theology** (presence, memorial, participation), **Christology** (presence of risen Christ), **Ecclesiology** (church as sacramental body), **Sacramental theology** (nature and effect of sacraments), **Worship theology**, and **Eschatology** (banquet, foretaste).

- **Closing line**
 - Wilson locates the core of worship in a Spirit-enabled encounter with the risen Christ at table: true Eucharist is both sacrament and charismatic gift, forming the church into eschatological communion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Coining and developing **"eucharismatic"** as a corrective synthesis: not a hybrid novelty but a reorientation that takes both sacrament and Spirit seriously.
 - Emphasizes the Spirit as the **ontological mediator** of sacramental presence rather than treating presence solely in Christological or metaphysical terms.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects sacramental models that are overly institutional, static, or theological without pneumatological life.
 - Contrasts charismatic models that prioritize spontaneity but neglect liturgical form, theological depth, and communal boundaries.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **eucharismatic** vocabulary to reframe familiar debates (presence, participation, gift, formation).
 - Recasts "real presence" language to foreground **Spirit-enabled relational presence** rather than metaphysical explanations alone.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Read in liturgical renewal circles and among pastors seeking integrative worship models.
 - Has traction with those interested in ecumenical dialogue between sacramental churches and charismatic movements; modest influence in seminaries emphasizing worship formation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a usable theological framework for churches wanting sacramental depth and charismatic vitality together.
 - Valuable for worship planners, pastors, and theologians concerned with embodied, communal formation through the Eucharist.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eucharist / Holy Communion**
 - Central sacramental locus; read through a pneumatological lens as Spirit-mediated encounter with Christ.

- **Sacrament / Sacramental realism**
 - Sacraments are real, efficacious signs that effect what they signify when the Spirit acts.

- **Pneumatology / Spirit**
 - Primary hermeneutical key: Spirit is the agent who actualizes sacramental presence and gifts.

- **Eucharismatic**
 - Neologism for the integrated posture: sacramental worship animated by the Spirit; a programmatic goal.

- **Real Presence**
 - Reinterpreted: presence is relational and Spirit-enabled rather than reducible to a single metaphysical account.

- **Charismata / spiritual gifts**
 - Legitimate within ordered liturgy; gifts are formative for the body when held within sacramental practice.

- **Participation (koinonia)**
 - Participation in Christ and each other is the beatific and formative effect of eucharistic worship.

- **Liturgy / ordered worship**
 - Retained as necessary structure that can host Spirit-led spontaneity; discipline enables genuine charismatic movement.

- **Ecclesial body / church**
 - Church is the sacramental community formed and sustained by Spirit-shaped eucharistic practice.

- **Eschatological banquet**
 - Eucharist as foretaste and formation toward the final consummation; shapes ethical and communal life.

- **Incarnation / Christology**
 - Sacramental practice is rooted in Incarnation: the risen, embodied Christ present by the Spirit.

- **Formation / catechesis**
 - Emphasizes catechesis for congregations to receive eucharismatic worship rightly.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for integrating pneumatology and sacramentality (useful in systematic theology and liturgics).
- As a **pastoral/ liturgical model** and guide for worship renewal in congregations seeking charismatic and sacramental synthesis.
- As a **polemic resource** against exclusively symbolic or exclusively spontaneous accounts of Eucharist, offering a middle, ecumenically attractive alternative.
