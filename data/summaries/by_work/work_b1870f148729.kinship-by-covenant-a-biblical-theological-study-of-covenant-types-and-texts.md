### TITLE
**Kinship by Covenant: A Biblical Theological Study of Covenant Types and Texts - Scott Hahn**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Catholic biblical-theological renewal; written from a Catholic, pastoral-exegetical perspective that seeks ecumenical dialogue with Protestant covenantal scholarship and with ancient Near Eastern treaty studies. 
 - Part of a broader movement to read Scripture as unified salvation-history (typology, covenant continuity) while attending to biblical social and ritual contexts.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The biblical covenants are primarily ways of forging *kinship* between God and human parties, not merely legal contracts. Covenants function to create a household, adopt members, and institute familial obligations that culminate in Christ and the Church.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Surveys covenant texts and types across the canon (Adamic/Creation, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic/Sinai, Davidic, and the New Covenant). 
 - Argues that covenant-making in Scripture is ritualized (oath, sacrifice, meal, exchange of persons) and establishes social status (sonship, lordship, household membership). 
 - Shows continuity: Old Testament covenants anticipate and are fulfilled in Christ's inauguration of the New Covenant, which actualizes kinship through sacramental means (esp. baptism, Eucharist). 
 - Emphasizes exegetical readings anchored in ANE treaty forms, Hebrew covenant language, and New Testament reinterpretation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engagement with ANE treaty scholarship, classical covenant theorists (von Rad, G. E. Mendenhall-style lines), contemporary biblical theologians and sacramental theologians. 
 - Dialogue with Protestant covenant theology and with scholars treating Sinai as suzerainty treaty form and Genesis covenant motifs.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation (how covenant reveals God's saving purposes), covenant theology, ecclesiology (church as family/household), sacramentology (baptism/Eucharist as covenantal rites), Christology (Christ as mediator and kinship head), soteriology (adoption, status change).

- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** 
 - Scripture's covenants are divine acts of kin-making: God binds sinners into a family through oath and ritual, and Christ consummates that family in the New Covenant enacted sacramentally in the Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Recasts covenant language primarily in *kinship* and household terms rather than in modern legal-contractual categories. 
 - Stresses ritual enactments (meal, oath, sacrifice) as constitutive of covenantal kin-formation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects contractarian readings that overlegalize covenant; pushes back on readings that neglect the social-anthropological realities behind biblical covenant texts. 
 - Moves beyond purely typological or allegorical readings by tying typology to institutional rites and social status change.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Promotes the phrase "kinship by covenant" as a hermeneutical key-treating adoption/sonship and household language as primary categories for reading covenantal passages.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely received in Catholic pastoral and academic circles as a useful bridge between biblical exegesis and sacramental/pastoral theology. 
 - Noted by many Protestants for its fresh emphasis on kinship; some Reformed readers accept the kinship insight while debating Hahn's sacramental and ecclesiological conclusions.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a clear, teachable model for linking Old and New Testament covenants, especially valuable in preaching, catechesis, and ecumenical discussions about covenant and sacrament.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith/diaspora):** binding relationship initiated by divine oath and sign; here primarily a kin-forming act rather than a bilateral contract. 
- **Kinship:** social category of family ties; the goal or effect of biblical covenants-God makes people relatives (children, bride, household members). 
- **Suzerainty/Grant/Parity types:** typological distinctions used to classify biblical covenants by form and function (e.g., Sinai as suzerainty; Abrahamic as grant). 
- **Oath and oath-taking:** performative speech-act that effects covenantal bond; central to divine-human covenanting. 
- **Rituals of covenant (sacrifice, meal, sign):** visible acts that instantiate kinship-meals symbolize shared family life; signs (circumcision, baptism) mark membership. 
- **Adoption/sonship:** legal/status categories describing the effect of covenant-members become children of God with rights and inheritance. 
- **Household/house:** socio-theological category for the covenant community (Israel/Church as God's household). 
- **Typology and fulfillment:** method showing how earlier covenants and rites anticipate Christ and are realized in the New Covenant. 
- **New Covenant:** culmination of covenant history in Christ; effectual kinship fully realized and sacramentally mediated. 
- **Sacrament(s):** rites (esp. baptism, Eucharist) that enact entrance into and sustenance of covenantal kinship. 
- **Fidelity/faithfulness (hesed):** covenantal loyalty as the moral and relational response required of covenant members. 
- **Temple/kingdom motifs:** institutional expressions of covenant community and rule under God as head. 
- **Exchange of persons:** anthropological motif where covenant ties imply mutual representation and solidarity between parties.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a concise **definition source** for "covenant as kinship" in biblical-theological courses. 
 - As a **polemic** corrective to contract-oriented covenant readings in systematic theology. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for sermons and catechesis linking OT covenant rites to NT sacraments and ecclesiology.
