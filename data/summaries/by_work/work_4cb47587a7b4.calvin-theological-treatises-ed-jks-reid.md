### TITLE
**Calvin: Theological Treatises** (ed. J. K. S. Reid; Library of Christian Classics 22)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation (c. 1534-1550s); Geneva as reforming center.
 - Written amid polemics with Rome, Anabaptists, and Lutheran sacramentalists; ecumenical rapprochement with Zurich.
 - Reid presents authoritative English translations with introductions situating each text in its historical-theological debates.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate and defend a reforming catholicity: Scripture-governed doctrine centered on Christ, wrought by the Spirit in the church, against errors in worship, sacrament, authority, and hope.

- **Core argument or structure** (by major treatise clusters)
 - **Church and reform**: Reply to Sadoleto; The Necessity of Reforming the Church.
 - True church known by Word rightly preached, sacraments rightly administered, discipline exercised.
 - Justification by faith alone and pure worship as non-negotiables.
 - **Sacraments and Christology**: Short Treatise on the Holy Supper; Consensus Tigurinus; Catechism of Geneva.
 - Real, spiritual participation in Christ by the Spirit; ascended body of Christ in heaven; rejection of carnal presence and bare memorialism.
 - Union with Christ grounds justification and sanctification.
 - **Eschatology and anthropology**: Psychopannychia.
 - Refutation of soul-sleep; intermediate state of believers with Christ; primacy of the resurrection hope.
 - **Apologetic and pastoral**: Confessions, catechesis, and polemical tracts (e.g., on relics) form people in Scripture's economy and piety.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture as supreme norm; patristic witnesses (Augustine, Chrysostom) adduced.
 - Interlocutors: Cardinal Sadoleto; medieval scholastics; Anabaptists; Roman curial theology; Lutheran opponents of spiritual presence; Zurich allies (Bullinger) in the Consensus.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theology Proper**: Trinity, providence, predestination (assumed more than systematized here), God's simplicity and accommodation.
 - **Christology**: Two natures, ascension, communicatio idiomatum, extra Calvinisticum implied in eucharistic reasoning.
 - **Pneumatology**: Bond of union; internal testimony; efficacy of Word and sacrament.
 - **Soteriology**: Justification by faith; repentance; union with Christ; double grace; assurance.
 - **Doctrine of Sin**: Original sin; corruption of will; need for regeneration.
 - **Eschatology**: Intermediate state; resurrection; judgment; piety of hope.
 - **Ecclesiology**: Marks of the church; discipline; ministry; catechesis; confessional unity.

- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity is **Christ, by the Spirit, through the Word**, forming a church that worships God rightly and hopes in the resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Word and Spirit** conjointly effect faith; neither bare letter nor enthusiasm.
 - **Union with Christ** as soteriological key: justification and sanctification as a duplex gratia.
 - **Spiritual real presence**: true communion with the ascended Christ by the Spirit.
 - **Pastoral polemics**: doctrine crafted to heal worship and conscience, not merely to win disputes.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Rome: rejects sacerdotal mediation, meritorious works, cult of relics, and transubstantiation; insists on Scriptural norm and evangelical worship.
 - Against Anabaptists: affirms infant baptism in covenantal frame; denies soul sleep; defends civil order's legitimacy.
 - Against crass sacramentalism or memorialism: refuses both localizing Christ's body on altars and reducing the Supper to recollection.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Marks of the church**; **internal testimony of the Spirit**; **accommodation** in revelation; the later-named **extra Calvinisticum** undergirds ascension Christology in eucharistic debate.
 - Clear articulation of **intermediate state** against psychopannychia.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Normative for Reformed confessions and catechesis; shapes Zurich-Geneva consensus; resources Westminster tradition and later ecumenical dialogues on the Supper.
 - The Sadoleto exchange became a model of evangelical apologetics; Psychopannychia influenced Protestant eschatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Concise, teachable formulations; ecclesially oriented doctrine; exemplary integration of exegesis, dogma, and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word and Spirit**: inseparable operations; the Spirit authenticates and applies Scripture.
- **Union with Christ**: mystical yet real participation; ground of justification and renewal.
- **Double grace (duplex gratia)**: justification and sanctification given together in Christ.
- **Marks of the church**: pure preaching, right sacraments, and discipline identify the true church.
 - Contrasts with institutional continuity claims apart from gospel purity.
- **Spiritual presence**: real communion with Christ's body and blood by the Spirit, not local or carnal presence.
- **Ascension locality**: Christ's human nature located at the right hand; safeguards Eucharistic theology.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**: properties of each nature predicated of the one person without confusion.
- **Extra Calvinisticum**: the Logos not circumscribed by the flesh; implicit in Calvin's eucharistic Christology.
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit**: Spirit grants certainty of Scripture's truth and of adoption.
- **Accommodation**: God speaks in ways suited to human capacity in revelation.
- **Psychopannychia**: refutation of soul sleep; souls of the faithful are with Christ awaiting resurrection.
- **Providence and predestination**: God's wise, fatherly governance; election unto salvation.
- **Original sin**: inherited corruption and guilt, necessitating grace.
- **Catechesis**: pedagogical distillation of doctrine for church formation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed accounts of church, sacraments, union with Christ, and assurance.
 - As a **polemical and ecumenical benchmark** in Roman, Anabaptist, and Lutheran dialogues.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** tying doctrine to worship and conscience.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for Christology-ecclesiology-sacrament integration in systematic theology.
