### TITLE
Ethics for a Brave New World (Paul D. Feinberg & John S. Feinberg, 1993; rev. ed. 2010)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical-Reformed milieu responding to rapid advances in biotechnology, reproductive technologies, euthanasia debates, and secular bioethics.
 - Published as a comprehensive evangelical corrective to prevailing secular and liberal Protestant ethical frameworks.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian ethics must be grounded in a biblical theological anthropology that integrates **divine sovereignty**, **human depravity**, and **moral responsibility**, yielding concrete normative guidance for contemporary moral issues (esp. bioethics).
 - Ethical judgments depend on a coherent account of **sin and human freedom**: persons are morally responsible despite their fallen condition and under God's providence.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Part I: Foundations - biblical authority, natural law motifs, theological anthropology (Imago Dei, fall, sin), and method (integration of Scripture, theology, philosophy).
 - Part II: Moral philosophy - analysis of freedom, responsibility, utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics; defense of a theologically informed moral epistemology.
 - Part III: Applied ethics - bioethical case studies (abortion, euthanasia, genetic intervention), sexual ethics, social justice, and public policy, deploying foundational commitments to adjudicate controversies.
 - Major moves:
 - Diagnose popular secular frameworks (autonomy, utilitarian calculus) as inadequate.
 - Offer a biblically rooted alternative that preserves both moral absolutes and pastoral nuance.
 - Apply principles consistently to contemporary cases with theological and philosophical rigor.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages secular bioethicists and utilitarians (representative critiques rather than named-systematic dialogues), Kantian and natural-law voices, Roman Catholic bioethics, and evangelical interlocutors.
 - Draws heavily on Scripture, classical Reformed theological categories, and analytic moral philosophy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theology**: revelation, providence, human sinfulness, Imago Dei.
 - **Anthropology**: freedom, moral responsibility, depravity.
 - **Ethics**: moral epistemology, norms (law, conscience), applied issues in bioethics and sexual ethics.
 - Less emphasis on systematic Christology or Trinitarian dogmatics except as they inform human dignity and redemption.

- **Closing line**
 - A sustained attempt to root applied moral judgments in a Reformed biblical anthropology: human freedom and responsibility are real but must be interpreted through the lens of sin, divine sovereignty, and the normative claims of Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Integrates rigorous analytic philosophical treatment of freedom with explicit Reformed theological commitments - not merely pastoral exhortation but philosophical-theological argument.
 - Stresses the corrupting effects of sin on moral perception and agency, making ethical reasoning precarious apart from Scripture and grace.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects moral frameworks that prioritize autonomous individual choice (liberal autonomy) or purely consequentialist calculations; critiques both laissez-faire bioethics and simplistic natural-lawism for failing to account simultaneously for sin and grace.
 - Offers a corrective to evangelical naïveté that treats freedom as unencumbered by sin or divine providence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rather than novel neologisms, the Feinbergs provide disciplined rearticulations: a compatibilist-friendly account of freedom tied to character and desire under providence; a careful parsing of moral agency impaired by sin.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative evangelical seminaries and church contexts as a textbook in Christian ethics and bioethics.
 - Respected for clarity and breadth; critiqued by some for insufficient engagement with Roman Catholic natural-law detail or with libertarian conceptions of freedom.

- **Enduring value**
 - A durable resource for integrating Reformed theology and applied ethics; valuable for pastors, seminary students, and ethicists who require a principled evangelical framework for modern bioethical dilemmas.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - human dignity and moral worth grounding pro-life and personhood claims.
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's providential rule; frames human responsibility without collapsing agency.
- **Human depravity / sin** - pervasive corruption that distorts moral perception and freedom.
- **Moral responsibility** - accountability tied to character and voluntary disposition, maintained despite fallenness.
- **Compatibilism (theological)** - broadly defined account of freedom that coexists with divine determinative providence.
 - Contrasted with **libertarian free will** (rejected or refined where it underwrites autonomy-based ethics).
- **Autonomy (liberal)** - critiqued as an inadequate ethical foundation when divorced from covenantal obligations and sin-aware anthropology.
- **Sanctity of life / personhood** - used as normative anchors in abortion, euthanasia, and genetic-engineering debates.
- **Natural law motifs** - employed selectively; Scripture remains primary norm but natural moral knowledge is acknowledged.
- **Bioethical case methodology** - application of theological principles to concrete cases (abortion, euthanasia, genetic manipulation).
- **Moral epistemology** - how Scripture, conscience, reason, and tradition interact in ethical knowing.
- **Double-effect reasoning** - treated as one tool among others in complex moral deliberation (prudential, not sacrosanct).
- **Virtue and character** - emphasis on formation and moral psychology, not only rule-following.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - clear explication of evangelical positions on personhood, sin, and freedom.
- **Polemic** - a resource against secular utilitarian and autonomy-based bioethics.
- **Exegetical/philosophical model** - model for integrating biblical exegesis with analytic philosophy in applied ethics.
