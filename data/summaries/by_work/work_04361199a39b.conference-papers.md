### TITLE
**Conference Papers - Charles Hodge** 
(focus here: essays on **Faith and Repentance**; Princeton, Old School Presbyterian milieu)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid‑19th century Princeton Theological Seminary; Hodge as leading Old School Presbyterian theologian reacting to revivalist "new measures," Arminian emphases, and rising theological liberalism. Pastoral and confessional concerns shape short, conference‑style essays.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To define and defend the Reformed relation of **faith and repentance** in conversion: faith is the instrument of justification and repentance is a necessary, non‑meritorious fruit or evidence of saving faith; the two are distinct yet inseparable in true conversion.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Precise definitions: faith as intellectual assent + trust in Christ (fiducia), repentance as a change of mind/heart (metanoia) involving sorrow for sin and turning from it.
 - Doctrinal ordering: justification by faith alone; repentance not contributory to justification but required as evidence of regeneration and union with Christ.
 - Polemic moves: critiques of revivalist/Arminian accounts that (a) place repentance as prior meritorious condition for pardon, or (b) treat repentance/faith as mere moral exercises producible by the unaided will.
 - Pastoral implication: preaching must call to faith in Christ and to genuine repentance while maintaining forensic categories and assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (exegesis of Pauline and Gospel texts), Calvin and Reformed confessions, contemporary revivalists (implicitly Finney and "new measures"), Arminian theology, older scholastic formulations (Turretin).
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (justification, sanctification), conversion (regeneration, repentance, faith), assurance, human inability and will, works and evidence.
- **Closing line:** Hodge centers conversion on **faith as the sole instrument of justification** while affirming **repentance as an indispensable, grace‑wrought evidence and fruit** of that justifying faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigid forensic ordering: keeps imputation and justification strictly by faith, guarding against any notion of repentance as co‑meritorious.
 - Psychological precision: distinguishes between intellectual assent and trusting appropriation in the moment of faith.
 - Repentance as moral reorientation: defined not merely as remorse but as a decisive turning from sin enabled by grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Against revivalist/modernizing accounts (Finneyite tendencies): rejects the notion that repentance can be produced by moral suasion without prior regeneration.
 - Against antinomian distortions: insists on repentance and sanctification as necessary evidences and duties for the believer.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphatic pairing of classical Reformation categories with pastoral diagnostics - treating repentance as both duty and evidence without elevating it to a cause of justification.
 - Clarifies "faith" as fiduciary and instrumental rather than mere intellectual assent.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Princeton and subsequent conservative Reformed circles as a concise pastoral‑theological primer on conversion.
 - Used historically to resist revivalist methods and later liberal theological reinterpretations of conversion.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact model for teaching Reformed conversion: doctrinal clarity, pastoral sensitivity, and anti‑Pelagian/anti‑antinomian balance.
 - Valuable in courses on soteriology, pastoral theology, and the history of American Presbyterianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (fiducia):** trust in Christ as the instrument of justification; more than assent-personal reliance.
- **Repentance (metanoia):** godly sorrow and a turning from sin; an effect and evidence of regeneration, not a meritorious cause.
- **Justification:** forensic declaration by God effected through imputation and received by faith alone.
 - Relation to repentance: justified by faith; repentance validates the reality of the justifying faith.
- **Regeneration:** sovereign work of the Spirit that enables true faith and repentance; precedes or accompanies genuine conversion.
- **Assurance:** consequence of the proper order; grounded in Christ's work and evidentially supported by repentance/holiness.
- **Works / Sanctification:** consequents of justification; necessary as evidence but not grounds of acceptance.
- **Moral inability / human will:** affirmation of native inability to produce saving faith or true repentance apart from grace.
- **Revivalism / "new measures":** criticized methodology that divorces inward regeneration from outward moral change or that manufactures repentance by technique.
- **Forensic/Legal language:** frequent use to protect substitutionary atonement and imputation.
- **Evidence vs. Cause distinction:** persistent analytic move-repentance evidences faith but does not contribute meritorially.
- **Pastoral catechesis:** the essays function as short catechetical guides for ministers on addressing conversion.
- **Biblical exegesis:** Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians) and Gospel calls to repentance are central warrants.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed soteriology (faith as instrument; repentance as evidence). 
- As a **polemic** against revivalist and Arminian accounts that invert the order or make repentance meritorious. 
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for preaching conversion that preserves forensic theology while calling for real moral change.
