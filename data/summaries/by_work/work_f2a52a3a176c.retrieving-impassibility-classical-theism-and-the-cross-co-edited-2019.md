### TITLE
Retrieving Impassibility: Classical Theism and the Cross (co-edited, 2019). Editor: Scott Swain. A collected theological retrieval defending classical theism (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) in light of Christology and the atonement.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 2010s resurgence of interest in classical theism within Reformed and analytic theology; reaction to pervasive claims that God must be passible to be genuinely relational (influences from process theology, J. Moltmann, open theism).
 - Positioned within contemporary debates about divine attributes and the theology of the cross in evangelical and confessional scholarship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Classical attributes (especially **impassibility**) can and should be retained; they do not preclude God's genuine relational suffering in the economy of redemption. The cross does not force abandonment of divine simplicity, aseity, or immutability.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify terms: distinguish **passibility** (metaphysical susceptibility to change) from biblical talk of divine emotions and relational responsiveness.
 - Exegetical work: read Christological and prophetic texts (esp. cross language) through categories of economic vs. immanent Trinity and the communicatio idiomatum.
 - Philosophical-theological defense: show how **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** coherently ground God's unchangeable being while allowing genuine, non-metaphysical relational, affective life in the Son.
 - Polemics: address Moltmannian theopaschitism, process theology, and open theism claims that divine passibility is necessary for love or risk.
 - Practical / pastoral moves: defend a robust doctrine of God that is both transcendent and tender, suitable for worship and pastoral consolation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Aquinas, Reformed scholastics and confessional formularies.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of divine suffering (e.g., Moltmann), process theologians, open theists, and analytic critics of divine simplicity.
 - Scripture as primary locus for theological retrieval.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity (economic/immanent distinction), Christology (incarnation, atonement, communication of properties), providence, revelation.
- **Closing line**
 - The volume argues that retrieving **impassibility** secures both divine transcendence and authentic Trinitarian love: God is not passively altered by creatures, yet in the Son God truly suffers redemptively for sinners.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A retrieval posture: not merely defensive but constructive - reclaiming classical categories for contemporary pastoral and apologetic needs.
 - Emphasizes precise terminological distinctions (affective language vs. ontological alteration) to avoid caricatures of impassibility as "cold deism."
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects the claim that divine love requires metaphysical susceptibility; instead argues love can be genuinely responsive without ontological change.
 - Counters theopaschite and process narratives by showing incoherence with aseity and simplicity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful deployment of the economic/immanent Trinity distinction to explain how God "suffers" in Christ without implying change in divine essence.
 - Clarifies "affective impassibility" (capacity for genuine emotion that does not imply actual change in divine being).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Picked up in Reformed and confessional academic circles as a go-to corrective against popular trends toward divine passibility.
 - Provoked substantive pushback from proponents of divine suffering and process thought; stimulated further analytic work on divine simplicity and Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact resource for defending classical theism in systematic, pastoral, and apologetic contexts; useful for seminarians and faculty teaching doctrine of God and Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity** - God is not composition of distinct metaphysical parts; attributes are identical to God's simple essence.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence and independence; not ontologically dependent on creation.
- **Immutability** - God's being does not undergo metaphysical change; distinguishes between modal/relational changes and essential change.
- **Impassibility** - God is not passibly altered by external agents; distinguishes between being affected and experiencing genuine, non-transformative love.
- **Passibility** - The state of being susceptible to change or suffering; what classical theism denies of God's essence.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity** - The distinction used to explain how the Son suffers economically (in redemption) without implying change in the immanent Trinity.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - Christological principle explaining the attribution of human sufferings to the one person of Christ without altering the divine nature.
- **Theopaschitism / Divine Suffering** - The claim that God suffers in a metaphysical sense; the volume critiques and reinterprets this claim.
- **Relationality (Divine)** - Genuine responsiveness and covenantal engagement that do not entail metaphysical change.
- **Kenosis** - Theological motif (self-emptying) examined to show compatibility with divine impassibility when properly framed.
- **Divine Emotion** - Affirmed as real but non-transformative; distinguished from passions that imply weakness or alteration.
- **Metaphysical Change** - Change in essence; what classical theism denies of God.
- **Christological Implications** - How the cross is read so as to preserve both the reality of suffering in the Son and the impassibility of the divine nature.
- **Affective Impassibility** - Terminology used to capture God's capacity for genuine compassion without ontological passibility.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and concise statement for conservative Reformed treatments of impassibility and related attributes.
- As a **polemic** against Moltmannian theopaschitism, process theology, and open theism.
- As an **exegetical-model** resource for reading divine emotion/passages (Psalms, Passion narratives) within a classical-theist hermeneutic.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic and pastoral theology curricula for integrating Christology and doctrine of God.
