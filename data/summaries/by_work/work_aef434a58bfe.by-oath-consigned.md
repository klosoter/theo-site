### TITLE
**By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism** 
Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 1960s Reformed biblical-theological renaissance (Vosian), in dialogue with ANE treaty studies and debates over sacramental efficacy and infant baptism within confessional Presbyterianism.
- **Central thesis:** The covenant signs of circumcision and baptism are **oath-sanctions** that conscript recipients into the covenant order under both **blessing and curse**, typifying an **ordeal** resolved only in Christ. Sacraments are judicial, not merely expressive; they bind and they threaten.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Covenant and oath:** Biblical covenants mirror ANE suzerain-vassal treaties with self-maledictory oaths (Gen 15; Jer 34). The sign is the visible sanction of the oath.
 - **Circumcision as malediction-sign:** Cutting off signals death-judgment (Gen 17; Ex 4:24-26), placing the bearer under covenant sanctions; it seals both promise and curse.
 - **Baptism as ordeal by water:** Water functions as judicial ordeal (Noahic flood, Red Sea, Jordan; 1 Pet 3; 1 Cor 10). Baptism signifies passage through judgment unto vindication or destruction.
 - **Christological fulfillment:** Jesus accepts the ordeal in baptism (Matt 3; Luke 12:50), culminating in the cross as the **circumcision of Christ** (Col 2:11-12). Union with Christ determines whether the ordeal yields life or death (Rom 6).
 - **Ecclesial implications:** The visible church is an oath-bound community containing elect and reprobate. The sign objectively binds; subjective blessing is by faith alone. Apostasy is judicial, not merely sociological (Heb 6; 10).
 - **Paedobaptism grounded:** As with Abrahamic administration, households are consigned by covenant oath; the sign grants visible membership under sanctions, not presumptive regeneration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Calvin and Westminster Standards; Geerhardus Vos; ANE treaty scholarship; dialogues with Baptists on subjects-only baptism and with Barthian witness-only sacramentalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and canon read redemptive-historically; Covenant theology; Christology of the cross as ordeal; Soteriology of union with Christ; Eschatology as intrusion in sacrament; Ecclesiology of visible/invisible church; Sacramentology of sign and seal.
- **Center of gravity:** Sacramental signs are **judicial oath-ordeals** whose verdict is borne by Christ and shared by faith, yielding either life or curse.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - **Dual-sanction objectivity:** Signs seal both promise and threat, not promise only.
 - **Ordeal motif:** Baptism and circumcision interpreted through flood/exodus and cutting-off typologies.
 - **Christocentric oath-bearing:** Jesus as covenant surety undergoes the malediction that sacraments signify.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against **sacramentalism:** No automatic conveyance of grace; efficacy is by the Spirit through faith.
 - Against **memorialism/witness-only:** Signs are not mere attestations; they are covenantal sanctions.
 - Against **credobaptist restriction:** The sign belongs to the covenant community as an oath-consignment, hence infants of believers are included.
- **Conceptual innovations:**
 - **By-oath-consigned** as a controlling category for sacramental incorporation.
 - **Self-maledictory oath** driving the meaning of cutting and water.
 - **Circumcision-of-Christ** read as the cross, clarifying Col 2 on baptism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Shaped modern Reformed defenses of paedobaptism; formative for Westminster Seminary CA circles.
 - Deployed in debates on covenant objectivity vis-a-vis Federal Vision, often to affirm sanctions without compromising sola fide.
 - Influenced biblical-theological treatments of sacraments that integrate ANE treaty forms.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a coherent, exegetically rich account of sacramental signs.
 - Clarifies visible church dynamics, apostasy warnings, and discipline within covenant theology.
 - Provides a Christologically anchored, eschatologically sensitive sacramentology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Oath-sanction:** The divine pledge that establishes covenant and threatens malediction upon violation.
- **Self-maledictory oath:** The party calls down the curse upon himself if unfaithful (Gen 15; Jer 34).
- **Consignment:** The sacrament places recipients under covenant lordship and its judicial sanctions.
- **Ordeal by water:** Baptismal water as judicial crisis (flood, sea, Jordan) that either destroys or delivers.
- **Cutting of the covenant:** Ritual of severing, grounding circumcision as death-sign.
- **Dual sanction (blessing/curse):** The sign seals both promise to believers and curse to unbelief.
- **Circumcision of Christ:** The cross as the ultimate cutting; baptism unites to that death and rising (Col 2; Rom 6).
- **Visible/invisible church:** External community under oath versus the elect known to God.
- **Sign and seal:** Visible rite that signifies and ratifies covenant sanctions and promises.
- **Sacramental objectivity:** Real covenantal placement occurs irrespective of subjective state; efficacy is by faith.
- **Federal headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives governing ordeal outcomes.
- **Apostasy as judicial outcome:** Falling away manifests the curse-sentence within the covenant sphere (Heb 6; 10).
- **Typological intrusion:** Eschatological judgment intrudes into history via sacrament and church discipline.
- **Household principle:** Covenant administration includes children of believers by oath-consignment.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for covenant theology, redefining sacramental signs via oath and ordeal.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Gen 15; 17; 1 Pet 3; Col 2; Rom 6 in Christology and soteriology.
 - As a **doctrinal resource** in ecclesiology for visible membership, discipline, and apostasy.
 - As a **polemic** supporting paedobaptism while guarding against sacramentalism.
