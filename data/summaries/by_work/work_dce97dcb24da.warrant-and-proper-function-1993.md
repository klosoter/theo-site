### TITLE
Warrant and Proper Function (1993) - Alvin Plantinga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century analytic epistemology and the resurgence of Reformed Epistemology; part of Plantinga's broader 1990s "warrant" project addressing what converts true belief into knowledge. Responds directly to prevailing reliabilist and evidentialist accounts of warrant.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Warrant is the quality that, when added to true belief, yields knowledge. Plantinga argues that warrant consists in belief-producing cognitive faculties functioning properly according to a design plan aimed at truth, operating in an appropriate environment, and not defeated - an account that grounds epistemic warrant in **proper function** rather than solely in internal justification or simple reliability.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):**
 - Define **warrant** as distinct from justification and mere true belief.
 - Argue standard reliabilist formulations fail to capture cases where malfunctioning mechanisms produce true belief and where properly functioning mechanisms yield warranted belief.
 - Introduce four central conditions for warrant:
 - Cognitive faculties functioning properly,
 - According to a design plan aimed at truth,
 - In an appropriate epistemic environment,
 - With a high tendency to produce true beliefs (i.e., reliability relative to the design plan) and absence of defeating factors.
 - Show how this account can accommodate religious belief (e.g., sensus divinitatis) as properly basic if produced by properly functioning faculties.
 - Consider implications for naturalism: evolutionary origins may undermine the claim that faculties are aimed at truth (setting up later arguments against naturalism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary targets include reliabilist epistemologists (notably Alvin Goldman), evidentialists (Conee & Feldman), and other internalists; Plantinga also draws on Reidian common-sense themes, the sensus divinitatis tradition, and analytic philosophy of mind and biology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Epistemology of religious belief, revelation broadly construed (sensus divinitatis), divine design as explanatory resource for epistemic faculties; not a treatise in systematic theology but deeply relevant to epistemology of knowledge of God.
- **Closing line:** The theological center: belief in God can be epistemically warranted when arising from cognitive faculties that are **properly functioning according to a truth-directed design plan**-a framework that reorients the justification debate toward function, design, and defeaters.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Moves from reliability as purely statistical to a **teleological** account: faculties must have a **design plan** aiming at truth.
 - Marries biological/functional vocabulary (proper function, environment) with traditional epistemic concerns.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Rejects simplistic reliabilism that ties warrant only to reliability metrics; stresses that true beliefs from malfunction can lack warrant, and reliable processes can still fail if not properly aimed.
 - Challenges evidentialist demands for internalist evidence to ground religious belief.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Systematizes **proper function** as an epistemic criterion.
 - Clarifies **warrant** as the specifically epistemic ingredient turning true belief into knowledge.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Major influence in Reformed Epistemology and analytic philosophy of religion; widely used to defend the rationality of religious belief as potentially warranted without evidentialist proof.
 - Sparked sustained debate on naturalism, evolution, and theistic explanations of design plans; provoked critical responses concerning circularity, specification of design plans, and empirical plausibility.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable externalist framework for discussing religious epistemology.
 - Serves as a conceptual pivot for linking theology (sensus divinitatis, design) to contemporary epistemology and for teaching debates between internalists, reliabilists, and Reformed Epistemologists.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Warrant:** The property that, when added to true belief, produces knowledge (distinct from justification).
- **Proper function:** Cognitive faculties performing as they were designed to perform.
- **Design plan:** The specification or programme according to which faculties operate; must be aimed at truth to confer warrant.
 - Implies a teleological orientation; can be theistic or (problematically) evolutionary.
- **Epistemic environment:** The relevant context in which faculties operate properly (normal conditions for successful function).
- **Reliability (relative to design):** High tendency of the design plan to produce true beliefs in appropriate environments.
- **Defeaters:** Factors (e.g., malfunction, deception, contrary background knowledge) that remove or diminish warrant.
- **Sensus divinitatis:** (Contextual use) a putative cognitive faculty for recognizing God; candidate source of warranted belief if properly functioning.
- **Externalism vs internalism:** Plantinga advances an externalist, function-based account of warrant that contrasts with internalist evidential demands.
- **Naturalism problem:** Question whether evolutionary origins can furnish a design plan aimed at truth - a basis for Plantinga's later critique of naturalism.
- **Malfunction cases:** Central counterexamples used to show that truth alone or mere reliability is insufficient for warrant.
- **Primary warrant:** (Implicit) the proper-functional warrant that makes certain basic beliefs rational without inferential evidence.
- **Warranted Christian belief (foreshadowed):** Application of the theory to Christian epistemology; groundwork for Plantinga's later full defense.
- **Epistemic defeat and grounding:** Emphasizes that warrant depends on grounding in proper function, not merely on subjective evidence.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source:** Standard modern definition of "warrant" and a primary statement of the proper-function account in seminars and textbooks.
- **Polemic tool:** Used to defend non-evidentialist, Reformed-Epistemology claims against evidentialist critiques.
- **Conceptual pivot:** Serves as the bridge between analytic epistemology and theological claims about the sensus divinitatis and divine design.
