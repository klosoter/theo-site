### TITLE
Schleiermacher on Law and Gospel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 19th century (Romantic/post-Enlightenment Protestantism). Schleiermacher writes in reaction to Enlightenment naturalism and orthodox confessionalism, dialoguing with Kantian philosophy, Wolffian rationalism, and emergent historical-critical exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reframe the law/gospel polarity within a psychology-centered theology: the law embodies the moral demand within human conscience, while the gospel is the restoration of true **religious feeling** (the "feeling of absolute dependence") made possible in and through Christ as the supreme exemplar and mediator of God-consciousness.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Religion is primarily an inward, affective consciousness (God-consciousness), not a set of forensic propositions.
 - The **law** functions as the ethical demand that exposes estrangement and awakens dependence; it is primarily moral and formative rather than simply juridical.
 - The **gospel** addresses the brokenness of religious feeling by re-establishing immediate relation to God through Christ, who manifests and perfects God-consciousness.
 - Scriptural revelation reports the history of religious feeling and the incarnation as the decisive event restoring communion; ecclesial forms and sacraments mediate this restoration socially.
 - Historical particularities (e.g., Mosaic legislation) must be understood as conditioned, positive embodiments of ethical-covenantal life, not as timeless juridical transactions identical to a hypothetical "Covenant of Works."
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Kantian moral philosophy, Johann Georg Hamann and Romantic thinkers, Lutheran and Reformed orthodoxy, emerging historical-critical biblical scholarship; implicit polemic with traditional covenant theology which reads Mosaic law as juridically continuous with a "Covenant of Works."
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (as moral and historical relation), law, gospel, sin (alienation/estrangement), atonement (restorative/representative), Christology (Christ as perfect God-consciousness), ecclesiology, ethics, authority of Scripture.
- **Closing line:** Schleiermacher moves the law/gospel debate from forensic categories to the restoration of religious feeling: law diagnoses the rupture of dependence, gospel reconstitutes personal and communal God-consciousness in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Religion defined as **feeling of absolute dependence**; theological categories reframed psychologically and existentially.
 - Law treated as primarily ethical, formative, and conscience-oriented rather than chiefly forensic.
 - Christology centered on exemplary and realized God-consciousness, not only forensic substitution.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects or downplays the classic Reformed forensic vocabulary of the Covenant of Works/Grace as judicial contracts identical in substance across covenants.
 - Critiques both rationalist reduction of religion to ethics and orthodoxism that reduces religion to propositional assent and juridical metaphors.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Transposition of covenant and atonement language into categories of consciousness, dependence, and moral restoration.
 - Treatment of Mosaic law as historical/positive moral order rather than the simple restatement of a prelapsarian juridical pact.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Major formative influence on liberal Protestantism, modern historical theology, and theological aesthetics.
 - Criticized by conservative Reformed theologians (who defend forensic covenant schemas) for undermining objective juridical readings of sin and atonement.
 - Adopted or adapted by subsequent theologians who seek a synthesis of moral psychology and constructive theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes re-examination of the law/gospel polarity beyond legal metaphors; useful for pastors and theologians exploring ethics, pastoral care, and hermeneutics.
 - Serves as a foil and corrective in debates over the **Mosaic covenant** and the doctrinal status of the **Covenant of Works** as to substance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religion as the feeling of absolute dependence** - foundational definition; grounds Schleiermacher's account of law and gospel.
- **Law** - the ethical demand experienced in conscience; a formative, diagnostic function rather than primarily forensic.
- **Gospel (Evangelium)** - restoration and communicative proclamation of renewed God-consciousness effected in Christ.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - regarded as a historical, positive legal-ethical order tailored to Israel; not simply a juridical reiteration of a prelapsarian Covenant of Works.
 - Emphasis on particularity and pedagogical function.
- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)** - Schleiermacher resists reading Mosaic law as identical in substance to an Adamic, juridical covenant; he sees covenant forms as conditioned by religious consciousness and historical context.
- **Sin** - alienation/estrangement from God-consciousness more than legal guilt; conscience registers this fracture.
- **Atonement** - restorative and representative reconciliation that heals religious dependence; Christ's ministry exemplifies perfected God-consciousness.
- **Christ as perfect God-consciousness** - paradigmatic human-divine unity; the locus of gospel-mediated restoration.
- **Revelation** - primarily historical manifestation of religious feeling culminating in the incarnation; Scripture interprets and witnesses to this.
- **Scripture** - authoritative as record and witness to religious experience, not merely as propositional deposit.
- **Conscience** - the immediate site where law is experienced and gospel is received.
- **Positive law vs. natural order** - distinction used to explain Mosaic legislation as contingent and pedagogical.
- **Church and sacraments** - social and symbolic mediations of restored dependence and communal God-consciousness.
- **Human freedom and moral development** - emphasized within the covenantal relation as growth in dependence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for modern, psychological accounts of law and gospel (religion = feeling).
- As a **polemic** against forensic readings of covenant theology, especially the claim that Mosaic law is substantively a Covenant of Works.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Mosaic legislation as historically conditioned positive law rather than an abstract juridical covenant.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching on atonement, Christology, and pastoral theology that centers restoration of religious consciousness.
