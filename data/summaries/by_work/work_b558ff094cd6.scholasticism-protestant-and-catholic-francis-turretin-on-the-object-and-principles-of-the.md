### TITLE
Scholasticism Protestant and Catholic: Francis Turretin on the Object and Principles of Theology. Richard A. Muller, Church History (1976).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th-century Reformed scholasticism in Geneva/Swiss-Italian milieu; Turretin (1623-1687) writing in response to both Catholic scholastic traditions and internal Protestant controversies (Arminianism, Cartesianism). Muller (1976) places Turretin within this contested methodological moment and revises caricatures of Protestant scholasticism.
- **Central thesis**
 - Turretin reconfigures scholastic categories so that **theology remains a disciplined scientia anchored primordially in Scripture**, not an autonomous speculative philosophy; his account is neither slavish mimicry of medieval scholasticism nor a simple capitulation to rationalist method.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Muller reconstructs Turretin's treatment under two heads: **the object of theology** (quid theologice consideratur) and **the principles/grounds of theology** (principia).
 - Object: theology's proper object is God as He is revealed-both God in Himself and God in redemptive acts-so theological science treats divine truth disclosed in Scripture, not merely natural speculation.
 - Principles: Turretin distinguishes a hierarchy: Scripture as first principle; the rule of faith (confessions, catholic consensus) as confirmatory; human reason as a subordinate instrument for articulation and defense.
 - Method: systematic loci-theologici retained but reoriented to safeguard sola scriptura and to delimit the scope of philosophical categories.
 - Muller argues Turretin selectively adopts scholastic form (definitions, distinctions, syllogistic method) while reshaping content to protect Reformed commitments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Turretin converses with medieval scholastics (Aquinas as background), contemporary Catholic scholasticism (Jesuit casuistry/Bellarminian polemics), and Protestant contemporaries (Voetius, Cheynell), and contends indirectly with Cartesian and Arminian tendencies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority (Scripture vs. tradition), theological method (principles and object), epistemology of faith (role of reason), loci method, and applied topics insofar as method governs their treatment (e.g., Christology, soteriology).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Turretin presents theology as a disciplined, Scripture-rooted scientia that uses scholastic method as a servant, preserving confessional fidelity while engaging philosophical tools with strict subordination to revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stress on *Scripture as first principle* with a technical, hierarchical ordering of principles rather than a flat appeal to authority.
 - Articulation of the object of theology as both *God in Himself* and *God as Redeemer*, centering redemptive revelation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Not a simple reiteration of medieval scholasticism: Turretin rejects autonomous natural theology and any methodological parity between reason and revelation.
 - Counterpose to Roman Catholic scholasticism: insists on sola scriptura and confessional norms over ecclesiastical magisterial parity; modifies scholastic form to serve Reformed ends.
 - Pushback against rationalist/Cartesian encroachments by restraining speculative metaphysics within revealed boundaries.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise vocationalization of "principia" as ordered authorities (primary/secondary) rather than vague appeals to tradition; technical use of locus-method as exegetical-theological, not merely philosophical taxonomy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Muller's reassessment reframed modern historiography: Protestant scholasticism seen as constructive, methodologically self-aware. Turretin's method influenced later Reformed orthodoxy and modern confessional theology that seeks a disciplined, scriptural method.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for integrating rigorous systematics and hermeneutical fidelity; useful corrective to extremes of pietism, rationalism, and caricatured anti-scholasticism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Object of theology** - what theology studies: God as revealed (immanent and economic), especially in Scripture and redemptive acts.
- **Principia (principles)** - ordered authorities grounding theology: Scripture (primary), rule of faith/consensus (secondary), reason (instrumental).
- **Scientia theologiae** - theology conceived as systematic knowledge; qualified by subordination to revelation.
- **Loci theologici / loci method** - topical, systematic organization of theological knowledge; retained but reoriented to exegetical priorities.
- **Sola Scriptura (as methodological principle)** - Scripture as normative rule and first principle in epistemic hierarchy.
- **Subordination of reason** - reason is an organon, not an independent arbiter of theological truth.
- **Revelation vs. natural theology** - firm limit on speculative natural theology; revelation supplies the decisive object and content.
- **Confessional normativity** - creeds and confessions function as secondary principles, guides for interpretation and catholicity.
- **Analytic-synthetic use of scholastic method** - adoption of scholastic categories for clarity and disputation, but synthetized with Reformed commitments.
- **Polemic posture** - method serves apologetic and polemical ends (against Catholic scholastics, Arminians, and rationalists).
- **Epistemic hierarchy** - explicit ordering of authorities and methods in theology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for principia and object of theology in Reformed methodological studies.
- As a **polemic model** showing how confessional theologians can appropriate scholastic method without capitulating to non-Reformed authorities.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in historiography: to re-evaluate Protestant scholasticism as disciplined, Scripturally anchored theological science.
