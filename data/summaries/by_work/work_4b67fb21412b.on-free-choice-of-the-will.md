### TITLE
On Free Choice of the Will (De libero arbitrio) - Augustine of Hippo (late 4th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in the late 4th century (circa 388-395). Written amid controversies with **Manichaeans**, within North African Latin Christianity, and prior to Augustine's full elaboration of grace and original sin.
 - Dialogical-philosophical method drawing on Christian Scripture, Stoic/Platonic categories, and anti-Manichaean polemic.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The existence of moral evil is compatible with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God because evil is not a created substance but a privation of the good, and moral evil originates in free choice (liberum arbitrium) of rational creatures.
 - Defends human responsibility against dualistic theodicies that posit co-eternal evil principles.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose the challenge: Manichaean dualism claims evil as an ontological principle - this impugns divine goodness.
 - Rebuttal: evil lacks positive being; it is a corruption or privation of good (privatio boni).
 - Locate moral evil in the will: voluntary turning-away from subordinate goods to lesser goods (disordered choice).
 - Free will is necessary for moral responsibility; without it praise and blame collapse.
 - Divine foreknowledge and providence:
 - God's foreknowledge does not coerce will; foreknowledge is not the efficient cause of sin.
 - God permits evil to preserve creaturely freedom, while providence orders even permitted evils toward a greater good.
 - Practical and pastoral conclusions: exhortation to repentance and right ordering of will toward God.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Principal opponent: Manichaean thought (often engaged through the figure of Faustus indirectly).
 - Philosophical resources: Platonic/Neoplatonic metaphysics (privation theory), Stoic moral psychology contrasts.
 - Scriptural appeals to show God's justice and human culpability.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and the goodness of creation, problem of evil (theodicy), human freedom and moral responsibility, divine foreknowledge and providence.
 - Less explicit on later Augustinian doctrines (fullsized original sin/predestination developed in later works).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Augustine mounts a moral-theological defense: evil arises from creaturely misuse of freedom; God remains wholly good and providential, permitting but not causing moral evil so that genuine moral agency (and thus moral accountability) is preserved.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic use of **privation theory**: evil is not a substance but a lack or corruption of good.
 - Strong insistence that **moral responsibility rests on the will**, not on metaphysical forces or fate.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct refutation of Manichaean ontological dualism; contrasts Pelagian tendencies later by emphasizing the seriousness of moral disorder (though fuller anti-Pelagian arguments come later).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise moral-psychological analysis of willing: the will chooses due to disordered preference among goods; introduces subtle distinctions later exploited in debates about necessity, contingency, and divine knowledge.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence on Western theodicy, medieval scholastic treatments of evil, and patristic-late-antique thought.
 - Frequently invoked in Reformed and Catholic traditions as foundational for discussions of sin, freedom, and divine justice; later contested in Molinist/Thomist debates over God's knowledge and creaturely contingency.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable conceptual pivot (privation + will-centered theodicy) for teaching how divine goodness and creaturely freedom can be reconciled without dualism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liberum arbitrium (free choice/liberty of the will)** - moral faculty that makes praise/blame possible; central explanans for moral evil.
- **Privatio boni (privation of the good)** - theological-metaphysical claim that evil is non-being, not a created positive.
- **Theodicy** - attempted vindication of divine goodness and justice in view of evil; Augustine's model stresses freedom and privation.
- **Divine foreknowledge (omniscience)** - God knows future free choices without causing them; foreknowledge and causation are carefully distinguished.
- **Providence (providentia dei)** - God's ordering of all things; permits evil but ultimately directs events toward greater goods.
- **Causality versus knowledge** - key distinction: God's knowledge of a future choice is not the efficient cause of that choice.
- **Contingency / possibility** - Augustine treats possibilities as real objects of divine knowledge, a locus later mined by Molinists although without Augustine's explicit "scientia media."
- **Manichaeism** - target opponent; Augustine dismantles its dualism and its explanation for evil.
- **Moral responsibility (culpa / merita)** - responsibility arises from voluntary turning of the will; basis for divine justice.
- **Permissive will** - God permits sin for the sake of preserving genuine freedom and ordering greater goods.
- **Natural good vs. moral good** - moral evil is a disordered will, not a defect in created nature per se.
- **Felix culpa (implicit)** - idea that God can bring greater goods from permitted evils is prefigured here.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the privation theory of evil and the moral-locational account of sin.
- As a **polemic template** against dualistic and deterministic explanations of evil (Manichaean and some Stoic lines).
- As an **exegetical-model** and philosophical resource for reconciling divine foreknowledge/providence with human responsibility.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in later debates (e.g., Molinism vs. Thomism) about counterfactuals, middle knowledge, and the status of creaturely possibilities.
