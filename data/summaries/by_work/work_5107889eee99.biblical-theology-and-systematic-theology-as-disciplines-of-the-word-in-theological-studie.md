### TITLE
**Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology as Disciplines of the Word** (in Theological Studies and the Church, 1976) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-1970s Reformed theology in North America: renewed interest in redemptive-historical biblical theology (Vosian lineage), debates over the role of historical criticism, and a call to reassert confessional systematic theology in seminaries and the church.
 - Frame writes from a Reformed, confessional perspective shaped by presuppositional concerns and an emphasis on Scripture's authority.

- **Central thesis**
 - Both biblical theology and systematic theology are legitimate, complementary *disciplines of the Word*; each serves the church by treating Scripture from different but harmonious angles - historical unfolding (biblical theology) and doctrinal ordering and application (systematic theology).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: a "discipline of the Word" is a theological task whose subject and norm are Scripture.
 - Distinction:
 - **Biblical theology**: describes the historical, progressive revelation of God within Scripture (diachronic focus); aims to trace development of themes, covenant, and redemptive history.
 - **Systematic theology**: synthesizes biblical data into coherent doctrinal loci (synchronic focus); formulates normative teaching for the church and shows logical/ethical implications.
 - Complementarity:
 - Biblical theology supplies the data and historical trajectory; systematic theology organizes, clarifies, and applies doctrine.
 - Neither discipline is autonomous from Scripture; abuses arise when one claims methodological or epistemic priority over the other.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Critiques approaches that isolate biblical theology as mere history without doctrinal binding.
 - Warns against systematic theology that abstracts from Scripture's redemptive-historical shape or treats tradition as co-normative.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit engagement with Vosian redemptive-historical tradition and with mid-20th-century advocates of systematic, confessional theology.
 - Dialogues indirectly with historical-critical and some neo-orthodox tendencies which relativize systematic construct or historical narrative.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (normativity and unity)
 - Covenant and redemptive history (central to biblical-theological description)
 - Christology (fulfillment motif across both disciplines)
 - Trinity, soteriology, ecclesiology - as loci shaped by both historical unfolding and systematic ordering
 - Hermeneutics (methodological bases for both disciplines)

- **Closing line**
 - Biblical and systematic theology are distinct but inseparable ministerial disciplines of the Word: one narrates Scripture's unfolding, the other brings that unfolding to coherent, normative expression for the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The phrase **"disciplines of the Word"** reframes theological tasks as disciplines whose subject and standard are Scripture, not autonomous methodological principles.
 - Strong insistence on the *mutual dependence* of description (biblical theology) and construction (systematic theology).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Pushes back against schools that turn biblical theology into purely historical scholarly endeavor divorced from doctrinal authority.
 - Counters systematic theologians who abstract doctrinal systems from the narrative flow of Scripture, thereby risking ahistorical formulations.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes *diachronic* (developmental) vs *synchronic* (systematic) tasks without making one subordinate to the other.
 - Treats both as normative disciplines rather than one being preparatory and the other primary.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed seminary pedagogy for clarifying curricular roles of biblical and systematic theology.
 - Cited by confessional theologians who seek to preserve doctrinal integrity while honoring redemptive-historical exegesis.
 - Helped consolidate a model used by conservative evangelical institutions to integrate Bible departments and systematic theology faculties.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced methodological posture that aids hermeneutical fidelity to Scripture while preserving doctrinal clarity and church application.
 - Useful corrective to current tendencies that either historicize away doctrine or systematize away narrative.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Discipline(s) of the Word** - theological tasks whose subject and norm are Scripture; establishes authority basis for both biblical and systematic work.
- **Biblical theology** - diachronic study of Scripture that traces redemptive history, development of themes, and covenantal progress.
 - Emphasizes narrative, promise-fulfillment, and canonical context.
- **Systematic theology** - synchronic synthesis of biblical data into doctrinal loci; formulates normative teaching and shows interconnections.
- **Redemptive-historical** - descriptive frame stressing God's unfolding saving acts across Scripture; key to biblical-theological method.
- **Normativity** - the principle that Scripture is the ultimate rule for both description and doctrine.
- **Diachronic vs Synchronic** - contrast between historical development (diachronic) and structural synthesis/treatment at a point (synchronic).
- **Progressive revelation** - the concept that God's self-disclosure unfolds over time and must be accounted for by theology.
- **Canonical approach** - reading Scripture as a unified canon that grounds both biblical and systematic tasks.
- **Hermeneutic of continuity** - interpretive posture emphasizing continuity and fulfillment rather than rupture between testamental stages.
- **Presuppositional posture** - implicit in Frame: theological method that begins with Scripture as the controlling presupposition.
- **Covenant theology** - a recurrent framework within the essay for organizing redemptive history and doctrinal loci.
- **Exegetical vs constructive tasks** - short-hand for the distinct labors of biblical theology (exegetical, descriptive) and systematic theology (constructive, normative).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for seminary curricula distinguishing biblical theology courses and systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against historical-critical or reductionist approaches that strip doctrine from canonical narrative.
- As an **exegetical model** advocating reading Scripture as progressive revelation that must inform doctrinal synthesis.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed pedagogy to maintain both fidelity to the Bible's story and clarity of confessional doctrine.
