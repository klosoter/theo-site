### TITLE
**Biblical Theology and the Problems of Monotheism** - Richard Bauckham (essay in The Jewish World Around the New Testament)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contribution to a collection addressing Jewish backgrounds of early Christianity; engages late 20th-early 21st-century debates about continuity between Jewish monotheism and Christian high Christology.
 - Positioned against scholars who treat early Christian worship of Jesus as a break into Gentile polytheistic thinking.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament's ascription of divine identity and worship to Jesus does not violate Israelite monotheism because the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Jewish thought already contain conceptual resources (Word, Wisdom, divine agent, representation) that allow plurality of divine agency/manifestation within a single divine identity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Old Testament and Second Temple texts showing plurality of divine agency (Word/Logos, Wisdom, angelic figures, theophanies) that nevertheless preserve exclusive monotheism.
 - Demonstration that New Testament usages (e.g., "Lord"/kurios, Son of Man, John's Logos) exploit these Jewish categories to speak of Jesus as uniquely bearing God's presence and identity.
 - Rebuttal of the claim that Christian belief about Jesus necessarily reflects Greco-Roman polytheistic or Hellenistic confusion about gods; instead, Christianity reinterprets Jewish monotheistic grammar to include Jesus.
 - Implication: Trinitarian theology can legitimately claim biblical roots in both Testaments without importing foreign metaphysics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary scholars skeptical of Judaic compatibility with Christian Christology (representatively: scholarly streams attributed to John M. G. Barclay, James D. G. Dunn, E. P. Sanders debates).
 - Relies on primary texts: Psalms, Isaiah, Daniel, Genesis theophanies, Wisdom literature, Philo, 1 Enoch, and key New Testament passages (John 1; Pauline and Johannine Christological texts).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, divine identity, divine agency, Christology (incarnation, divinity of Jesus), implicit groundwork for Trinitarian reflection.

- **Closing line**
 - Biblical monotheism is resiliently exclusive yet conceptually capacious: it supplies a theological grammar whereby one God can be present and active in distinct personal ways - a necessary premise for reading the New Testament's high Christology without alleging apostasy from Jewish monotheism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the *grammatical* and *canonical* continuity between OT Jewish monotheism and NT worship of Jesus rather than imposing post-Nicene metaphysics.
 - Prioritizes scriptural exegesis of divine agency figures (Word, Wisdom, angel of the LORD) as theological antecedents to Christian claims about Jesus.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters portrayals that frame early Christianity as polytheistic reversion; argues instead for an internal Jewish development.
 - Challenges readings that treat all divine predicates applied to Jesus as Hellenistic importations.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "plurality" language as plurality of *agency* or *manifestation* within strict monotheism - a conceptual pivot helpful for biblical Trinitarian theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in biblical-theological circles and conservative/evangelical scholarship seeking to defend historic Christian claims to biblical rootedness.
 - Employed by theologians who argue that orthodox Trinitarian formulations have precanonical warrant in the Bible's own ways of speaking about God's actions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact exegetical program for teaching the continuity of Jewish monotheism with Christian high Christology; remains a go-to corrective to simplistic polemics on monotheism and deification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monotheism**
 - Exclusive worship of one God; Bauckham insists this remains intact even where plurality-language appears.
- **Divine agency**
 - God acts through distinct agents or manifestations (Word, Wisdom, Spirit, angel) without implying multiple gods.
- **Word / Logos**
 - Jewish concept of God's self-expression and agent; used to connect John 1 and Wisdom traditions to Jesus' identity.
- **Wisdom**
 - Personified attribute of God (Proverbs, Wisdom of Solomon) functioning as God's agent - parallel to Logos and a foil for Christological deployment.
- **Angel of the LORD**
 - Theophanic figure in the OT that sometimes speaks as Yahweh; a model for understanding divine representation without polytheism.
- **YHWH-identification**
 - Application of Yahweh-language or functions (e.g., creation, salvation) to another figure; Bauckham argues this is present and normative in biblical texts when referring to Jesus.
- **Kurios / Lord**
 - New Testament title used for Jesus that echoes Septuagint practice of replacing YHWH with kurios; supports continuity of worship-language.
- **Son of Man**
 - Danielic and apocalyptic figure whose exaltation provides scriptural substrate for ascribing cosmic authority to Jesus.
- **High Christology**
 - Early Christian claims of Jesus' pre-existence and divine identity; argued to arise from Jewish theological resources, not pagan polytheism.
- **Theophany**
 - Visible manifestation of God; OT theophanies establish precedent for God's mediated presence.
- **Divinization / Participation**
 - Language of sharing in divine life or representation; Bauckham treats this cautiously as scriptural theological idiom, not Hellenistic metaphysics.
- **Representative ontology**
 - The idea that an agent can stand for God's presence and identity - key to reading NT Christology in Jewish terms.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for explaining how biblical monotheism can accommodate plurality of divine action.
 - As a **polemic** against claims that early Christian worship of Jesus betrays Jewish monotheism.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking specific OT and Second Temple texts to New Testament Christological language.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theological discussions seeking biblical warrant for Trinitarian formulations.
