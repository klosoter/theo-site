### TITLE
On Grace and Free Will (De gratia et libero arbitrio) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Composed in the mid-420s CE amid the Pelagian controversy in Roman Africa. Augustine writes as bishop of Hippo, addressing Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum and defending the necessity of divine grace against claims of unaided human ability. Part of Augustine's later anti-Pelagian corpus that shaped Latin Western doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to reconcile human free will and moral responsibility with the absolute necessity and priority of divine grace for any good act or salvation; whether human beings can initiate or merit salvation apart from grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Analysis of human will and moral responsibility: affirmative of real choice but diagnostically impaired by sin.
 - Anthropological diagnosis: original sin renders the will unable to perform truly good deeds without divine help (Augustine uses the formula of inability to do otherwise in moral purity).
 - Grace as ontologically and causally prior: God's prevenient, operative grace is necessary to heal and enable the will; grace does not destroy freedom but transforms it.
 - Treatment of merit and reward: good works have value only insofar as they are rooted in grace; any "merit" presupposes prior divine generosity.
 - Pastoral and exegetical appeal to Scripture (especially Paul) to show grace as God's initiative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum are primary opponents; Augustine draws on Paul (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians), earlier Latin Church Fathers, and his own prior work on will and sin (e.g., De libero arbitrio).
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropological sin/concupiscence, grace (prevenient and efficacious), free will/liberum arbitrium, merit and reward, divine justice, predestination (incipient reflections), Scripture and soteriology.
- **Closing line:** Augustine argues that **grace is both necessary and causally decisive** for any genuine good or meritorious deed, and that free will is real but only rightly operative when healed and elevated by that grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on the **priority of prevenient and operative grace** while preserving moral responsibility.
 - The paradoxical claim that grace increases and perfects liberty rather than abolishing it.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct refutation of Pelagian optimism about unaided human righteousness and merit; Augustine insists that humans cannot will true righteousness without God's prior help.
 - Contrasts with earlier Latin emphases that risked attributing greater natural moral ability to unassisted will.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Developing vocabulary distinguishing human inability after the Fall (an incapacity to will rightly) from the restored capacity that grace brings.
 - Seeds of later scholastic distinctions about types of grace (e.g., efficacious vs. sufficient) and types of merit.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Canonical source for Western doctrines of original sin, prevenient/effective grace, and the limits of human free will; heavily cited by Reformation theologians (Luther, Calvin) and by scholastics.
 - Provoked sustained debate: praised for rigor and pastoral realism, criticized by semi-Pelagians and later by Arminians and some modern interpreters on determinism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of integrating biblical exegesis, pastoral concern, and philosophical analysis of will.
 - Provides a concise, forceful articulation of why grace must be the ground of all good works and ultimate merit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gratia (Grace):** God's unmerited aid enabling any genuine goodness; both prevenient and operative in Augustine.
 - **Prevenient grace:** grace that precedes any human act and awakens the will.
 - **Operative/effective grace:** grace that actually secures the will's turning toward God.
- **Liberum arbitrium (Free will):** genuine capacity to choose; impaired but not annihilated by sin.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale):** inherited corruption that incapacitates the will for true righteousness without grace.
- **Bondage of the will / inability (non posse non peccare):** Augustine's phraseology describing fallen inability to avoid sin without grace.
- **Merit (meritum):** value of works; Augustine insists merit presupposes grace - good works are meritorious only insofar as grace grounds them.
 - Distinguish implicit from later scholastic formulations (condign/congruent), which systematize Augustine's intuitions.
- **Cooperating grace:** grace that enables yet involves the will's cooperation; cooperation never begins the initiative.
- **Divine causality / predestination:** God's sovereign ordering of salvation rooted in mercy and foreknowledge; Augustine moves toward stronger notions of predestination in anti-Pelagian polemic.
- **Justification (proto-language):** understood as God's merciful accounting grounded in grace, not human merit.
- **Covenant of grace (implicit use):** relationship framework where works are responses sustained by grace, not prior sources of divine favor.
- **Scriptural exegesis (Pauline focus):** Romans and Galatians used to ground claims that grace is first and decisive.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for doctrines of prevenient/effective grace and the incapacity of fallen humanity.
 - As a **polemic model** against any anthropology that attributes salvific power to unaided human will (Pelagianism).
 - As an **exegetical template** for reading Pauline soteriology where grace is the divine initiative and foundation for good works and reward.
