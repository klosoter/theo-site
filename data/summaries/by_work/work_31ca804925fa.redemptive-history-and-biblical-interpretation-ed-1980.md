### TITLE
**Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation** (ed. Richard B. Gaffin Jr., 1980) 
Collection of Geerhardus Vos's shorter writings, edited and introduced by Richard B. Gaffin Jr.; seminal Reformed treatment of redemptive-historical hermeneutics.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1980 amid renewed interest in biblical theology within conservative Reformed circles; part of a broader retrieval of Geerhardus Vos as foundational for 20th-century Reformed biblical theology.
 - Theological milieu: reaction to both liberal historical-critical reductionism and non-historical (e.g., existential or purely dogmatic) readings of Scripture; served as a corrective within confessional Protestantism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture must be read as a record of God's historical, redemptive acts culminating in Christ; biblical theology is the study of this historical-progressive revelation and is the necessary hermeneutical discipline for faithful biblical interpretation.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Affirm the foundational role of historical events (acts of God) as carriers of revelation rather than merely propositions or timeless axioms.
 - Trace the organic, diachronic development of revelation: promise → covenantal administration → fulfillment in Christ.
 - Emphasize typology (real patterns in redemptive history) where earlier redemptive events point forward to the Christ-event without nullifying their historical particularity.
 - Insist that New Testament interpretation of the Old is governed by fulfillment in Christ, not by arbitrary allegory or by stripping the OT of its own historical meaning.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Geerhardus Vos (voices collected); editor/introducer: Richard B. Gaffin Jr.
 - Implicit interlocutors: liberal historical criticism, Schleiermacherian/subjective approaches, and some streams of neo-orthodoxy; conversant with Reformed systematicians and later interpreters such as Meredith Kline.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (historical and progressive), covenant theology, typology, Christology (centrality of Christ as fulfillment), biblical authority, and the relation of Old and New Testaments.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Bible is the unified record of God's redeeming acts whose meaning is realized in Christ; faithful interpretation must follow the historical, promise-to-fulfillment economy of revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that revelation is essentially redemptive-historical rather than primarily propositional or abstract.
 - A disciplined, non-allegorical typology that preserves the historicity of earlier events while asserting their Christological significance.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal critical tendencies that minimize God's acts in history; opposes purely dogmatic readings that impose systematic categories without following biblical history.
 - Distinct from Barthian dialectical hermeneutics by insisting on the continuity and organic unfolding of revelation across covenants.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates and systematizes Vosian vocabulary for redemptive-historical reading: promise-fulfillment schema, organic development, historical typology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in reviving Vosian biblical theology among confessional Reformed scholars and pastors.
 - Influenced subsequent covenant theologians and interpreters (notably those in the "Klinean" conversation), becoming a frequent touchstone in debates about covenant structure and the Old Testament's relation to Christ.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as the canonical statement for a historically grounded, Christ-centered hermeneutic useful for preaching, biblical theology, and critiquing non-redemptive readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-history (heilsgeschichte)**: Interpretation that takes God's saving acts in history as the primary locus of revelation.
- **Promise-Fulfillment**: The dynamic pattern by which earlier promises in Scripture receive their goal and sense in Christ.
- **Typology (biblical)**: Real, historically grounded foreshadowing in OT persons/events that find their true meaning in Christ; not arbitrary allegory.
- **Covenant (organic development)**: Covenantal administrations are stages in one redemptive economy, each with continuity and development toward Christ.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic**: The New Testament's interpretive authority for reading the Old, seeing all Scripture's telos in Christ.
- **Historical-grammatical + redemptive-historical blend**: Reads grammatical-historical exegesis within the larger frame of redemptive history.
- **Authority of events vs. mere propositions**: Revelation as enacted (events) that ground propositional teaching, rather than propositions detached from history.
- **Analogy of faith (recast)**: Coherence of Scripture across testamental stages interpreted through the promise-fulfillment matrix.
- **Klinean Covenant Theology (relation)**: Vos/Gaffin supply the hermeneutical foundation often appealed to by Meredith Kline and others for their covenantal analyses and for debates about covenant forms and law.
- **Intrusion ethics (relation)**: Employed in modern debates about how the coming of Christ (and NT fulfillment) ethically "intrudes" on OT life and law; Gaffin's/Vos's typological account is cited to govern how one recognizes legitimate fulfillment-intrusion versus anachronistic appropriation.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what counts as redemptive-historical exegesis and for the promise-fulfillment paradigm.
 - As an **exegetical model and polemical tool** against both liberal critical and non-historical dogmatic readings; frequently invoked in covenant-theology debates (e.g., Klinean discussions) and in discussions of Christ in OT and NT.
