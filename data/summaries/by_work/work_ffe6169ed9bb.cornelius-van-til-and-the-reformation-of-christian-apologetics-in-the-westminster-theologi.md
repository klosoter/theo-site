### TITLE
Cornelius Van Til and the Reformation of Christian Apologetics - K. Scott Oliphint: "Van Til's One-Person Language and Its Critique" (Westminster Theological Journal, various articles)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed apologetics; post‑Warfield/Gordon Clark debates; Van Til developing a presuppositional method centered in Westminster theology.
 - Oliphint writes as a second‑generation Van Tilian, clarifying and defending Van Til against both internal Reformed critics and external charges (e.g., modalism, privatization of Trinitarian persons).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Van Til's use of **"one‑person language"** is best understood as an epistemological/linguistic move to safeguard divine unity and the Reformed doctrine of God, not as an ontological denial of the three persons. Oliphint defends and refines this claim while responding to critiques that such language collapses personal distinctions in the Trinity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - (1) Exposition: defines Van Til's one‑person language - the practice of ascribing attributes, acts, and revelation primarily to God as God (the divine being), rather than routinely dividing such predications among the three persons.
 - (2) Theological justification: roots this practice in classical Reformed commitments - divine simplicity, the unity of the divine essence, and the priority of being over person in predication.
 - (3) Methodological point: argues the move is **epistemic/analogical** - a corrective against anthropomorphic partitioning of the Godhead in theology and apologetics, preserving God‑world antithesis.
 - (4) Response to critique: addresses charges of modalism or of neglecting the economic Trinity by distinguishing ontological from predicational claims; shows how economic statements (e.g., "the Son reveals the Father") remain orthodox when properly qualified.
 - (5) Practical implication: defends Van Til's apologetic claims that speaking of God in one‑person terms promotes the unity of divine revelation and secures Christian presuppositions in argumentation.
- **Figures and interlocutors engaged**
 - Cornelius Van Til (primary); critics within Reformed circles and broader theological commentators who push for stronger three‑person predication.
 - Implicit/explicit engagement with classical sources (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics) on divine simplicity and the Trinity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (ontological vs. economic), divine simplicity, revelation and revelation‑language, theological method, Christology as it bears on revelation.
- **Closing line**
 - Oliphint situates Van Til's one‑person language as a disciplined theological-linguistic strategy: a Reformed corrective that privileges divine unity in predication without surrendering orthodox personal distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats one‑person language primarily as an **epistemological/linguistic principle**, not a metaphysical claim that God is numerically one person.
 - Emphasizes the *hermeneutical* purpose: to prevent the fragmentation of divine revelation into human‑scale categories that impair apologetic witness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts Van Til's practice with critics who insist on routine three‑person predication as the canonical norm; argues such insistence can inadvertently anthropomorphize or bifurcate God.
 - Corrects readings that conflate Van Til's method with modalism; stresses careful ontological qualifications.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and rehabilitates the term **"one‑person language"** as a tool in dogmatic and apologetic method rather than a metaphysical thesis.
 - Articulates a sharper distinction between **predication mode** (how we speak) and **personal ontology** (what God is).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Has become a standard corrective in Van Til scholarship: used by sympathetic Reformed theologians to defend presuppositional practice while accommodating orthodox Trinitarian distinctions.
 - Influenced debates on how apologetics interfaces with systematic theology, especially on the relation of revelation language to metaphysics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a precise model for keeping **Trinitarian orthodoxy** and **apologetic coherence** together; valuable for instructors teaching the interplay of doctrine, language, and apologetic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One‑person language** - Predicating attributes and acts primarily of God (the divine being) to underscore the unity of God in speech and argument.
 - Clarified as epistemic/predicational, not ontological.
- **Economic Trinity** - The way God acts in history; Oliphint insists this remains compatible with one‑person predication when distinctions are explicated.
- **Ontological Trinity** - The inner life of God; Oliphint maintains ontological distinctions of persons are not denied by one‑person language.
- **Divine simplicity** - Reformed metaphysical commitment invoked to justify single‑subject predication.
- **Predication vs. Personhood** - Key analytical distinction: how we speak (predication) vs. who God is (persons).
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - Van Til's method; Oliphint shows one‑person language supports presuppositional claims about divine knowledge and revelation.
- **Anti‑anthropomorphism** - Rationale for one‑person language: avoid reducing God to multiple finite agents.
- **Modalism (critique addressed)** - Opposing charge: Oliphint explains why Van Til's language does not entail modalist ontology.
- **Analogy/antithesis** - Use of analogical language and the Creator/creature antithesis to frame predication.
- **Reformed theological method** - Theological priorities (Scripture, confessions, classical metaphysics) that shape Van Til's language.
- **Apologetic consequence** - How linguistic discipline affects argument form and witness.
- **Hermeneutical priority** - Concept that how Scripture is read should govern theological predication.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Van Til's methodological vocabulary (one‑person language) in courses on apologetics and dogmatics.
- As a **polemic tool** defending presuppositionalism against charges of Trinitarian error while refining theological rhetoric.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for discussions on the relation between theological language, divine simplicity, and the economic/ontological Trinity.
