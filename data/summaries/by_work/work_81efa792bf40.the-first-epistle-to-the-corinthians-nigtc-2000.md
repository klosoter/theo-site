### TITLE
The First Epistle to the Corinthians (New International Greek Testament Commentary, 2000) - Anthony C. Thiselton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century anglophone scholarship; NIGTC series aimed at combining rigorous linguistic exegesis with theological reflection.
 - Thiselton writes from a broadly evangelical, ecumenical academic milieu with strong engagement in contemporary hermeneutics, pragmatics, and philosophy of language.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul confronts church fragmentation by re-situating Christian identity and ethics within the reality of Christ's resurrection and the inaugurated new-creation effected by the Spirit.
 - The key doctrinal problem: how to read Paul's theological claims (especially about resurrection in 1 Cor 15) as both historical claim and present-transformatory power for community life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Detailed verse-by-verse exegesis grounded in Greek semantics and rhetorical/contextual analysis.
 - Major moves:
 - Diagnosis of Corinthian disorders (1-6): social, ethical, liturgical, and intellectual fractures.
 - Theological correction (7-11): marriage, food, worship practices; link between practice and Christology.
 - Wisdom and power (1-4, 8): critique of Greco-Roman rhetoric and gnostic tendencies.
 - Eschatological resolution (chap. 15): sustained defense of bodily resurrection as constitutive of Christian hope and communal ethics; resurrection construed as entry into new creation, not mere individual immortality.
 - Constant interplay of philology, rhetorical criticism, speech-act theory, and socio-historical contextualization.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages traditional commentators (C. K. Barrett, Gordon Fee), historical-critical scholars, and contemporary hermeneuticians (speech-act theorists, semanticists).
 - Dialogues with modern philosophical semantics and pragmatics to sharpen exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology/New creation**, **Christology**, **Pneumatology**, **Ecclesiology**, **Sacrament (Eucharist)**, **Ethics**, **Anthropology (body/soul)**, **Revelation/Wisdom**.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - For Thiselton, 1 Corinthians coheres around the conviction that the risen Christ inaugurates a Spirit-empowered new creation whose reality reshapes personal identity, community practice, and moral formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates rigorous Greek lexical and syntactical analysis with modern pragmatics and discourse theory-reading Paul as an intentional speech-act performer addressing a concrete community.
 - Strong insistence that Paul's resurrection language is both historical and constitutively transformative: bodily resurrection as the ontological ground of communal ethics and new-creation life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters readings that reduce 1 Cor 15 to mere soteriological afterlife promise or allegorical spirituality; rejects dualistic denials of bodily significance.
 - Challenges commentaries that isolate exegetical minutiae from ecclesial and ethical consequences; opposes narrowly historical-critical or purely rhetorical reconstructions divorced from theological synthesis.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Applies speech-act theory, semantic field analysis, and socio-rhetorical criticism to Pauline exegesis in a sustained, programmatic way.
 - Re-frames "resurrection" as intrinsically linked to "new creation" (not only personal immortality), emphasizing communal and cosmic dimensions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely regarded as a landmark commentary: praised for technical mastery and theological depth; influential across evangelical, mainline, and Reformed studies.
 - Adopted as a model for combining philology, hermeneutics, and theological synthesis in Pauline studies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a methodological exemplar for exegetes and theologians who wish to marry linguistic precision with theological import; indispensable for serious study of Pauline eschatology and ecclesial ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (anastasis)** - defended as bodily, historical, and present-implicating; the pivot of Pauline identity in 1 Cor 15.
- **New creation (kainē ktisis / eschatological language)** - frames resurrection as cosmic/communal renewal, not individual resuscitation.
- **Body/soma vs. flesh/sarx** - careful semantic differentiation: "soma" transformed, "sarx" problematized in moral contexts.
- **Spirit (pneuma) / Pneumatology** - Spirit as the agent who effects the new-creation life and maketh present the resurrection reality.
- **Eschatology / inaugurated eschatology** - emphasis on "already/not yet": present transformative effects of future consummation.
- **Koinonia** - communal participation rooted in Christ's death and resurrection; ethical corollary of doctrinal truth.
- **Eucharist / liturgical practice** - interpreted as locus where resurrection new-creation is enacted and community unity is tested.
- **Speech-act theory / rhetorical situation** - methodological tool: Paul as performative speaker whose theology issues in community change.
- **Wisdom (sophia) and power (dunamis)** - contrasts Greco-Roman ideals with cross-shaped wisdom of the cross grounded in resurrection.
- **Corporeality / physicality** - theological insistence on embodied eschatology against dualism.
- **Hermeneutics / semantic field analysis** - commitment to semantics and pragmatics to secure theological readings.
- **Ethics as theological consequence** - moral prescriptions arise from ontological claims about Christ and the resurrection.
- **Apocalyptic motifs** - cosmic scope of redemption reinterpreted within Pauline discourse.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional exegetical resource for Paul's teaching on **resurrection and new creation**.
 - As a polemical and methodological model against reductionist spiritualizing or dualistic readings of Pauline anthropology.
 - As an exegetical-theological model linking detailed philology to systematic loci (eschatology, ecclesiology, ethics) for teaching and advanced research.
