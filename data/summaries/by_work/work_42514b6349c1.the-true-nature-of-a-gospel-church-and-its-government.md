### TITLE
The True Nature of a Gospel Church and Its Government - John Owen (Puritan/Reformed Congregationalist)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Mid-late 17th century English Puritanism; post-Reformation Reformed milieu; written in debate with Presbyterian and Erastian positions during the Interregnum and Restoration tensions over church-state relations.
- **Central thesis:** A true gospel church is a covenantal, voluntary congregation of professing believers governed under Christ by officers and discipline instituted in Scripture; its constitution and government must be determined by Scripture, not by civil authority or imposed external hierarchy.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition of a gospel church as a local covenant community where the Word is rightly preached, sacraments rightly administered, and ecclesiastical discipline exercised.
 - Justification of congregational (independent) polity: congregational consent in admitting officers and members; authority derived from Christ mediated through the congregation.
 - Detailed treatment of officers, discipline, and the limits of civil magistrate interference (anti-Erastian).
 - Criteria for distinguishing true from false churches (marks and evidences).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis (esp. New Testament), Reformation authorities (Calvinian resources), and contemporary opponents - Presbyterians, Erastians, and separatists; polemical engagement with advocates of state-imposed church order.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (nature, marks, government), covenant theology (congregational covenantal form), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), church discipline; doctrine of Christ's headship as ground for ecclesiastical authority; ancillary Trinitarian/Christological assumptions taken as normative.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Scripture alone determines the constitution and government of a gospel church; local, covenantal congregations exercising biblical ministry, sacraments, and discipline are the concrete embodiment of Christ's kingdom on earth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong defense of congregational autonomy combined with a rigorously biblical criterion for what makes a church "gospel" - not mere name or national establishment.
 - Emphasis on voluntary covenanting: churches as constituted by mutual covenant of professing believers.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Presbyterian polity that locates decisive authority in presbyteries/assemblies; to Erastianism that subordinates church governance to the state.
 - Distinguishes itself from Brownist separatism by retaining Presbyterian/Reformed sacramental and doctrinal commitments while insisting on congregational order.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Precise use of the "marks" framework to adjudicate the authenticity of a church (Word, sacraments, discipline) with attention to the role of personal grace as evidence.
 - Nuanced account of admission and removal procedures emphasizing both congregational consent and ministerial function.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential among English Independents/Congregationalists; provided a systematic Reformed defense of independency used in later Congregational polity confessions.
 - Read by subsequent Reformed theologians as a major statement against state-controlled churches and a resource for church discipline debates.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a dense, scripturally grounded resource for ecclesiology courses on polity, the marks of the church, and church-state relations.
 - Models rigorous argumentation for those defending voluntary, covenantal church structures within Reformed theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel church:** A local covenantal congregation where the gospel is truly preached and administered.
- **Covenant of the congregation:** The mutual, voluntary compact by which believers constitute a church community.
- **Visible vs. invisible church:** Distinction retained - visible church is local assemblies with external ordinances; invisible church = all true believers known to God.
- **Marks of the church:** Primary tests of a true church - right preaching of the Word, lawful administration of sacraments, and exercise of discipline.
- **Church officers (pastors/elders/deacons):** Appointed by the congregation in accordance with Scripture; distinct functions but accountable to the body under Christ.
- **Discipline:** Communal corrective and purgative practice necessary to maintain gospel purity and witness; a mark of a true church.
- **Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper):**
 - **Baptism (paedobaptist covenantal use):** Owen affirms infant baptism as a covenant sign - not intrinsically efficacious for regeneration but a sealing of covenant promise that requires subsequent faith.
 - **Efficacy:** Sacraments are means of grace symbolically and confirmingly, not automatic instruments of regeneration.
- **Christ's headship:** Ground for ecclesiastical authority - Christ alone is head of the church; human structures derive authority from him.
- **Erastianism / State church:** Rejected - civil magistrate must not usurp Christ's church government.
- **Independency / Congregationalism:** Owen's polity: local church autonomy tempered by biblical norms and fraternal relations between churches.
- **Admission/Excommunication:** Procedures grounded in Scripture; membership not merely nominal but requires credible profession and may be removed for unrepentant scandal.
- **Communion of Saints:** Real fellowship among regenerate members embodied in the local church.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed/congregational ecclesiology and the nature of the local church.
- As a **polemic** against Presbyterian and Erastian models of church government.
- As an **exegetical and practical model** for the marks of the church, admission, and discipline.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over baptism (paedobaptism as covenant sign) and the relation of visible/invisible church.
