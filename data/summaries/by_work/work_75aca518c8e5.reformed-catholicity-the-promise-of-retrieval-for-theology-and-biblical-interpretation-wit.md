### TITLE
**Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation** (essay: **"Good Works and Merit in the Covenant of Grace"**), Scott Swain; ed. Michael Allen; 2015.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑2010s Reformed retrieval movement: evangelical Reformed theologians reengaging pre‑modern catholic resources (Augustine, medieval scholastics) to remedy perceived lacunae in modern Protestant theology.
 - Conversation shaped by concerns about doctrinal coherence (justification/sanctification), pastoral ethics, and ecumenical misreadings between Protestants and Roman Catholics.
- **Central thesis**
 - A careful retrieval of classical categories of "merit" is compatible with and enriches Reformed covenant theology: good works, rightly understood within the covenant of grace and Christ's mediatorial merit, can be spoken of as meritorious without compromising sola fide or sola gratia.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: modern Protestant tendences either (a) dismiss 'merit' language (antinomian/ethical impoverishment) or (b) accept Roman Catholic formulations that collapse grace and human work.
 - Historical‑doctrinal retrieval: explicates classical distinctions (e.g., condign vs congruent merit) and shows how they can be reworked in Reformed categories rather than adopted wholesale.
 - Covenantal reorientation: centers the **covenant of grace** and Christ's federal headship as the locus where merit (properly speaking) is founded - Christ's obedience earns a reward that is then applied to believers; believers' works derive their value from union with Christ and the covenant promise.
 - Theological consequences: preserves forensic justification by faith while vindicating moral exhortation, promises of reward, and a robust doctrine of sanctification that speaks of Christlike fruit as receiving covenantal recompense.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, medieval scholastics (taxonomies of merit), Thomas Aquinas (terminology), and Reformation figures (Calvin, Luther) in corrective conversation; addresses contemporary Reformed critics who reject any talk of merit.
 - Editor/volume interlocutors: broader "Reformed Catholicity" project themes (retrieval, ecumenical engagement).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace), justification (imputation), sanctification (participation), Christology (federal headship; active/passive obedience), merit (theology of reward), soteriology, ecclesial pastoral implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Swain situates merit within a Reformed, covenantal economy: Christ's meritorious obedience secures promised rewards; believers, in union with him, perform worthy works that God graciously repays - thereby preserving sola fide while recovering a morally robust language of reward.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Recuperates classical merit language not as a rival to grace but as a vocabulary for covenantal reward grounded in Christ's mediatorial work.
 - Stresses the **promise‑oriented** character of rewards: merit language is meaningful because God has promised to recompense faithful obedience in the covenant.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Protestant reductions that banish merit entirely and Roman Catholic models that make human works a basis of justification; offers a middle path that affirms forensic justification by faith and a mediated, Christ‑grounded sense of merit.
 - Counters antinomianism by showing that talk of reward and merit strengthens ethical exhortation without legalistically undermining grace.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reframes scholastic categories (condign/congruent) within federal theology: attributes genuine merit strictly to Christ as federal head while locating believers' "worthiness" in participation with him.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among contemporary Reformed theologians seeking a more catholic lexicon for reward and sanctity; cited in debates over assurance, pastoral theology, and the normative relation between justification and sanctification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a careful, historically informed template for theological retrieval that preserves Reformed commitments while reintroducing useful pre‑modern categories; valuable for systematic theology, pastoral ethics, and ecumenical conversation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of grace**
 - The relational framework in which reward language and merit are intelligible; promises bind God to recompense faithfulness.
- **Merit**
 - Reinterpreted: not autonomous human earning of justification but a relation of reward mediated by Christ's merit and covenant promise.
- **Condign merit**
 - Traditionally "merit of strict justice"; Swain reserves the strictest merit to Christ as federal head (the only one who merits condignly).
- **Congruent merit**
 - Lesser, more analogous merit in classical usage; Swain treats such categories cautiously, translating them into notions of covenant‑appropriate reward rather than legal debit.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness; foundational for explaining how Christ's meritorious obedience benefits believers.
- **Participation / union with Christ**
 - The ontological basis for believers' works having value: good works are wrought in union with Christ and thus receivable of covenantal reward.
- **Active and passive obedience**
 - Christ's obedience as ground both for justification (passive suffering) and for rewards/promises (active obedience); used to locate merit in Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Promise and reward**
 - Key idiom: God's promise gives moral actions covenantal weight and grounds his righteous repayment.
- **Forensic vs transformative language**
 - Maintains forensic justification by faith while integrating transformative, participatory accounts of sanctification and reward.
- **Good works**
 - Fruit of grace that, though not the basis of justification, are appropriate objects of divine recompense within covenantal order.
- **Recompense / reward**
 - Divine giving in response to faithfulness, rooted in Christ's merit and God's promise; not a competing ground for salvation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, covenantal sense of "merit" that safeguards sola fide while permitting reward language.
- As a **polemic** against antinomian disavowals of merit and against Roman Catholic readings that make works justificatory.
- As an **exegetical and theological model** for reading Pauline texts (reward, union with Christ, imputation) within covenantal categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking soteriology and ethics: restores robust moral theology without jeopardizing forensic justification.
