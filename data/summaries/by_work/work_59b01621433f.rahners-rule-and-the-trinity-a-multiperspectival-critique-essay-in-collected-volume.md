### TITLE
Rahner's Rule and the Trinity: A Multiperspectival Critique - Vern Poythress (essay in collected volume)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century post-Barthian and ecumenical debates about Trinitarian method; dialogue between continental theologians (Karl Rahner, Karl Barth) and Reformed analytic theologians.
 - Poythress writes from a broadly Reformed, analytic-theological posture with a developed multiperspectival epistemology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Poythress contests a simplistic transfer between the **economic Trinity** (God as known in history and revelation) and the **immanent Trinity** (God's inner life), commonly summarized under "Rahner's Rule," and evaluates Barth's reformulation of that rule.
 - He argues for a disciplined multiperspectival approach that preserves both epistemic access via revelation and ontological distinction within the Trinity.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Rahner's Rule and Barth's reformulation: sets out the rule's textual shape and the doctrinal risks it aims to avoid.
 - Critique of Rahner:
 - Shows how unguarded identity between economic and immanent can collapse distinctions (risking modalism or reductionism).
 - Highlights problems for predicate transfer and analogical predication.
 - Assessment of Barth's reformulation:
 - Commends Barth's emphasis on revelation as a reliable locus for speaking about God.
 - Argues Barth still leaves unresolved questions about how predicates move from acts to ontological statements.
 - Proposal of multiperspectival corrective:
 - Introduces or applies Poythress's perspectival distinctions (e.g., ontology vs. epistemology; order of being vs. order of knowledge; relational vs. normative perspectives).
 - Offers rules for legitimate predication about God that respects divine aseity, perichoretic relations, and the priority of revelatory witness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), Karl Barth (reformulation), with attention to patristic and scholastic resources on analogy and predication.
 - Secondary: Modern Reformed and analytic commentators on Trinity, plus appeals to scriptural patterns of revelation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation and the relation between revelation and ontology, analogical predication (theology proper), perichoresis, and implications for Christology and soteriology implied by Trinitarian predication.

- **Closing line**
 - Poythress's theological center of gravity: safeguard the integrity of Trinitarian ontology while allowing responsible, revelation-grounded theological speech via a multiperspectival method that regulates predicate transfer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Explicit deployment of a multiperspectival epistemology to Trinitarian method-distinguishing orders of being, knowing, and relating as analytic controls on theological predication.
 - Insistence that rules for predicate transfer must be procedural and formal, not merely asserting identity between economic and immanent.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges Rahner's broad identification of economic and immanent, highlighting epistemic and theological hazards.
 - Affirms Barth's move to prioritize revelation but presses Barth to offer stricter semantic rules for moving from "what God has done" to "what God is."

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of multiperspectival categories (e.g., normative, situational, cognitive) to Trinitarian predication.
 - Use of formal predicate-transfer rules as a theological-analytic tool.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful within Reformed and analytic theology circles seeking to reconcile rigorous metaphysical distinctions with robust doctrine of revelation.
 - Limited uptake in continental circles primarily aligned with Rahner or Barth; valued as a corrective resource in evangelical systematic theology and homiletics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches careful boundary-drawing in Trinitarian language; supplies methodological tools for seminarians and doctrinal theologians working at the intersection of metaphysics and revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The axiom that economic revelation corresponds to the immanent Trinity; Poythress critiques its unguarded application.

- **Barth's reformulation**
 - Emphasizes revelation as normative for speaking about God; Poythress approves but presses for clearer predicate rules.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as acting and revealing in history; the primary locus of theological knowledge.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God's inner life (ad intra); ontologically distinct from but related to the economic Trinity.

- **Predicate transfer / analogical predication**
 - Rules governing when and how predicates used of God's actions may be ascribed to God's inner being.

- **Multiperspectivalism**
 - Poythress's methodological grid distinguishing cognitive, situational, and normative perspectives to control theological inference.

- **Perichoresis**
 - The mutual indwelling of the persons; invoked to preserve relational distinction without modal collapse.

- **Order of being vs. order of knowledge**
 - Analytical distinction used to prevent conflation of epistemic access with ontological state.

- **Analogia fidei / analogia entis**
 - Theological principles regulating analogy in speaking of God; Poythress leans on a constrained analogia fidei.

- **Modalism**
 - A theological error Poythress warns against when economic/immanent identities are overstated.

- **Revelational normativity**
 - The principle that God's self-disclosure in Scripture governs correct theological predication.

- **Aseity**
 - Divine self-existence; a limiting factor for ontological claims about God based purely on economic acts.

- **Social Trinitarianism (critique)**
 - Modern tendency to emphasize personhood and relations; Poythress appreciates relational insight but resists reductionistic tendencies.

- **Epistemic humility**
 - A methodological posture urging restraint in claims about God's inner being beyond revelatory warrant.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for disciplined rules of predicate transfer between economic and immanent Trinitarian talk.
- As a **polemic** resource against overly broad Rahnerian identifications and against careless social-Trinitarian reductions.
- As an **exegetical-method model** for deriving Trinitarian doctrine from Scripture while preserving ontological distinctions.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses linking doctrine of God with epistemology and analytic method.
