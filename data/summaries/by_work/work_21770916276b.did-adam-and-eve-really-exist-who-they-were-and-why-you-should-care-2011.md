### TITLE
**Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? Who They Were and Why You Should Care** - Jack Collins, 2011

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2011 amid heightened evangelical debate over evolution, population genetics, and biblical anthropology.
 - Collins writes from a conservative Reformed evangelical academic setting (Old Testament scholar), addressing both church and academy concerns about Genesis and scientific claims.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A historical Adam and Eve are necessary for the biblical accounts of sin, covenant headship, and Christology; contemporary readings that treat Adam as merely archetypal or nonhistorical undermine core Christian doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical case: reads Genesis 1-5 and related New Testament texts (Paul, Luke) as historical narrative with theological intent; emphasizes grammatical-historical method.
 - Theological case: links Adam to federal headship, original sin, imago Dei, and Christ as the second Adam-argues that these doctrines presuppose a real progenitor couple.
 - Scientific engagement: surveys population genetics (mitochondrial Eve, Y-chromosome Adam, effective population size), critiques simplistic scientific inferences that deny a historical pair, and proposes how a historical pair could be compatible with genetic data (bottlenecks, selection, limits of models).
 - Synthetic conclusion: maintains that biblical affirmation of a historical first couple is plausible and theologically indispensable while interacting responsibly with scientific data.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary interlocutors who deny historicity (various evangelical and scholarly proponents of archetypal/mythic readings), theistic evolutionists (notably public figures in genetics), and scientific literature on population genetics and ancient DNA.
 - Draws on traditional sources (Paul, Augustine in passing, Reformation readings) to buttress theological claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical authority, anthropology (imago Dei), original sin and its transmission, covenant/federal headship, Christology (Adam-Christ typology), creation and providence.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Collins situates the historicity of Adam at the crossroads of exegesis, systematic theology, and science: deny Adam and the gospel's account of sin and redemption loses its grounding; defend Adam and one must responsibly engage scientific evidence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balanced interplay between careful exegetical argumentation and sustained, competent engagement with population genetics and molecular claims.
 - Prioritizes doctrinal consequences (federal headship, imago Dei) as decisive for hermeneutical commitments about Genesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against two common extremes: uncritical literalism divorced from science and liberal/mythic readings that reduce Adam to archetype or literary figure.
 - Challenges functional-only (e.g., some "ancient Near Eastern functional" readings) interpretations that evacuate material/biological claims of Genesis.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes the relation between **historical monogenesis** and contemporary genetic data without reducing the biblical text to a scientific primer.
 - Offers constructive models (bottleneck, special creation within broader hominin contexts) as theological-scientific mediations rather than speculative naturalistic histories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted widely in conservative evangelical seminaries and used as a measured apologetic resource; influential in debates over whether Christian doctrine requires a historical pair.
 - Met with critique from proponents of robust theistic evolution and from some mainstream scientists who see the genetic issues differently.
- **Enduring value**
 - A durable resource for pastors, teachers, and students needing an integrated defense of Adam that respects both biblical theology and scientific testimony.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historicity of Adam**
 - Collins: Adam and Eve were real historical individuals; historicity is required for federal headship and original sin.
- **Federal headship**
 - Adam as covenant representative whose sin constitutes corporate humanity's fall; central to Collins' theological stakes.
- **Original sin**
 - Treated as historically grounded in Adam's fall rather than a mere symbol or archetype.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)**
 - Tied to Adamic status; grounding for human dignity and responsibility in Collins' reading.
- **Mitochondrial Eve / Y-chromosomal Adam**
 - Scientific markers discussed; Collins stresses methodological limits and that these findings do not necessarily refute a historical first pair.
- **Population genetics / effective population size**
 - Used to interact with claims about minimum ancestral population sizes; Collins highlights assumptions and model-dependence.
- **Literary genre: primeval history / historical narrative**
 - Collins argues Genesis 1-5 functions as historical narrative with theological shaping, not merely mythic typology.
- **Historical monogenesis vs polygenism**
 - Collins defends monogenesis (one original pair) as the best fit for biblical theology; critiques polygenism as problematic for doctrine.
- **Adam-Christ typology**
 - Classic Pauline typology reiterated: Adam as "type" whose failure is remedied in Christ.
- **Days of creation**
 - Discussed with caution: Collins emphasizes the theological aims of the creation week while maintaining that Genesis gives a temporal sequence; he resists treating the text solely as a scientific chronology.
- **Hermeneutical principles**
 - Grammatical-historical method; theological reading that takes doctrinal consequences seriously.
- **Theistic evolution**
 - Treated critically where it implies nonhistorical Adam; Collins engages scientific-theological variants rather than rejecting evolutionary science wholesale.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative accounts of Adam's historicity and federal headship.
- As a **polemic** against archetypal/mythic readings and certain theistic-evolutionary reconstructions that deny a historical pair.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis as theological history while responsibly interacting with scientific literature.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology, soteriology, and creation discussions (including debates about the days of creation).
