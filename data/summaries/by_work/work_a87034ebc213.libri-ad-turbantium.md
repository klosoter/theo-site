### TITLE
**Libri ad Turbantium (Books to the Troubled)** 
Julian of Eclanum - principal anti-Augustinian tract(s) addressing the Pelagian controversy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 5th century (c. 410s-430s). Product of the Pelagian controversy sparked in Rome and Africa; composed amid synodal condemnations, episcopal correspondence, and exile politics.
 - Theological milieu: conflict between **Augustinian** formulations of original sin, irresistible/prevenient grace, and predestination vs. defenders of human moral agency (Pelagius, Caelestius, Julian).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defense of robust human free will and denial that Adam's sin transmits guilt or an utterly incapacitating depravity; grace is persuasive and restorative, not coercive or the sole cause of morally good acts.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Polemical rebuttal of Augustine's conclusions about inherited guilt and absolute dependence on prevenient/irresistible grace.
 - Presentation of a moral-psychological account of concupiscence as an illness or inclination, not ontologically culpable transmission of sin.
 - Positive articulation of human ability to choose the good, cooperate with grace, and merit reward.
 - Appeals to Scripture, pastoral reason, and selective Patristic witnesses to undermine Augustine's theological absolutism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: **Augustine of Hippo** (direct rebuttal of his anti-Pelagian writings).
 - Allies/precedents: **Pelagius**, **Caelestius**; appeals to some Eastern Fathers and strands of Western patristic tradition that stress moral exhortation.
 - Contextual authorities: synodal decisions (e.g., Councils condemning Pelagian teachings), Roman episcopal letters, Scripture (Pauline discussions of sin and grace).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (nature of the will, concupiscence)
 - Original sin (transmission of guilt vs. imitation)
 - Grace (nature, mode, necessity)
 - Predestination and divine foreknowledge
 - Soteriology (merit, perseverance, cooperation)
 - Ecclesial praxis (baptismal implications, pastoral assurance)
- **Closing line**
 - At the center: a vigorous defense of moral responsibility and a non-Augustinian account of grace that preserves genuine human agency while affirming the need for divine assistance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that human will retains meaningful, intrinsic capacity to choose righteousness apart from a metaphysical privation that Augustine posits.
 - Recasts concupiscence as a malady and inclination rather than transmitted guilt or ontological corruption.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct corrective to Augustine's formulations: opposes imputational models of guilt, resists predestinarian determinism, and rejects the notion that grace must be efficaciously irresistible to secure salvation.
 - More optimistic account of moral progress and human cooperation than either strict Pelagianism (which denied need for grace) or Augustinianism (which minimizes uncoerced human cooperation).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies a mid-ground vocabulary later associated with **Semi-Pelagian** tendencies: emphasis on "initiation" or "motivation" by grace that does not obliterate free choice.
 - Uses pastoral-psychological categories (illness, habit, inclination) to describe sinfulness, shifting debate from metaphysical inheritance to moral formation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Officially condemned with Pelagianism in multiple synods; Julian himself was marginalized and often maligned in later Latin tradition.
 - Indirectly influential for later debates: his emphases on cooperation and human capacity resurface in medieval semi-Pelagian currents and are read into later Arminian and pastoral theological lines.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for studying early alternatives to Augustinian anthropology and grace theology; useful in teaching historical breadth of Christian accounts of will, sin, and grace and for eking out pastoral models that balance divine aid and human responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - Central: human capacity to choose morally significant good without being rendered passive by grace.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - Julian: not ontological guilt transmitted; rather *imitation/propensity* and moral aftermath (contrast Augustine).
- **Concupiscence (concupiscentia)** - Described as inclination or sickness, not the same as actual culpable guilt inherited at conception.
- **Grace (gratia)** - Helping, persuasive, and restorative rather than coercive or irresistibly efficacious; enables but does not determine moral acts.
- **Prevenient grace** - Emphasized as preparatory and enabling, yet preserving the decisive role of human assent.
- **Predestination** - Rejected as deterministic; divine foreknowledge affirmed but not causal determinism of will or reprobation.
- **Merit and reward (meritum, praemium)** - Human acts can have moral worth and merit before God when aided by grace and freely chosen.
- **Cooperation (cooperatio)** - Key soteriological category: synergy between divine aid and human will.
- **Imputation (imputatio)** - Problematic when applied to Adam's guilt; Julian opposes automatic guilt imputation.
- **Pastoral psychology** - Use of moral/therapeutic imagery (sickness, cure) to describe sin and sanctification.
- **Semi-Pelagian** - Julian's writings supply significant textual material for defining the semi-Pelagian middle position (emphasis on initiative by the will aided by grace).
- **Polemic method** - Combines scriptural exegesis, rhetorical refutation of Augustine, and pastoral examples.
- **Ecclesial consequences** - Implications for infant baptism, assurance, and penitential practice.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a primary source for the **Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian** position (definition and nuance) in historical theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against Augustinian readings of original sin and predestination in studies of grace and free will.
- As an **exegetical model** for pastoral treatments of sin as moral sickness and for conceptual work on cooperation and moral agency.
