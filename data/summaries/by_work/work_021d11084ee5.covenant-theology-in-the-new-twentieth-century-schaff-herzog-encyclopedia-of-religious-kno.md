### TITLE
Covenant Theology - Cornelius Van Til (entry in The New Twentieth Century Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century Reformed theological and apologetic horizon, framed for an encyclopedic readership. Van Til writes from classical Dutch Reformed federal (covenantal) convictions and his developing presuppositional apologetic method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Covenant theology is the organizing principle of redemptive history: God governs salvation by covenants (chiefly the covenant of works and the covenant of grace), which structure revelation, election, union with Christ, sacraments, and the church. The entry aims to summarize the historical formulation and defend its doctrinal coherence against competing schemes.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define the covenants historically and theologically: **covenant of works** (Adam as federal head; law and tenure of life) and **covenant of grace** (promise of redemption in Christ).
 - Trace biblical and patristic roots, development in medieval and Reformation thought, and consolidation in Reformed confessions.
 - Explain soteriological consequences: federal headship (Adam/Christ), imputation, justification, and sanctification within covenantal union.
 - Treat ecclesial and sacramental correlates: baptism and the Lord's Supper as **signs and seals** of covenant membership and spiritual realities.
 - Emphasize epistemic and apologetic bearings: covenant as the key to reading Scripture aright and to grounding Christian knowledge of God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, church fathers, medieval theologians, Reformers (Luther, Calvin), Reformed scholastics and confessions; implicitly contrasts later revisionist movements such as Federal Vision monocovenantalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and covenantal structure; Trinity (as grounding covenantal economy); Christology (mediatorial headship); soteriology (imputation, election, justification); ecclesiology (visible/invisible church); sacramentology (baptism/LS); law and gospel distinction.
- **Closing line:** Covenant theology, properly understood, is the Reformed hermeneutic that centers all redemptive history and soteriology in God's covenantal dealings with humanity, mediated in Christ and sealed by the sacraments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stress on **federal headship** as the interpretive linchpin (Adam/Christ) connecting sin and salvation across covenants.
 - Use of covenant language to unify epistemology and apologetics: revelation is covenantal communication requiring faith-response grounded in God's self-disclosure.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Clarifies and defends the **two-covenant schema** against views that collapse distinctions between law and gospel or between covenantal administrations.
 - Implicitly resists pietistic or moralistic readings that privatize covenantal promises or minimize objective forensic realities (e.g., justification by faith).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integrates classic federal categories with a presuppositional insistence that one's epistemic starting point must be God's revealed covenantal self-knowledge.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Reinforces confessional Reformed teaching and is used by subsequent Reformed scholars as a concise statement of federal theology; his apologetic framing influenced how covenant language is deployed in polemics.
 - Functions as a touchstone in debates with movements like Federal Vision monocovenantalism-both for shared emphases (covenantal continuity) and sharp disagreements (soteriological and sacramental implications).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear synopsis of classical covenantal categories; useful as a bridging resource between historical theology and contemporary controversies about covenant continuity, ecclesial identity, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** God's original administration with Adam; obedience as condition for life; breach inaugurates need for covenantal grace.
- **Covenant of Grace:** God's settled plan to redeem sinners in Christ; promise-based, mediated, and administered through Word and sacraments.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam and Christ as representatives whose status and actions are imputed to their respective covenantal communities.
- **Imputation:** Forensic transfer-Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness-central to justification.
- **Signs and Seals (Sacraments):** Baptism and Lord's Supper as covenantal markers of promise and means by which God confirms covenant membership.
- **Visible/Invisible Church:** Distinction preserved-visible church contains covenant signs and discipline; invisible church is the elect united to Christ.
- **Law and Gospel Distinction:** Law as covenantal administration for works; gospel as covenantal promise fulfilled in Christ.
- **Typology / Covenant-History Reading:** Old Testament persons and institutions as types pointing to Christ and covenantal fulfillment.
- **Continuity / Discontinuity:** How the covenantal economy persists across covenants while respecting changes in administration.
- **Election:** Covenantally framed divine choosing grounded in God's purpose to save a people in Christ.
- **Perseverance & Covenant Fidelity:** Assurance and final preservation considered within covenantal union and promises.
- **Presuppositional Apologetics:** Epistemic claim that covenantal revelation is the necessary presupposition for Christian knowledge.
- **Federal Vision Monocovenantalism (topic cited):**
 - Identified as emphasizing a single, organic covenant of grace across redemptive history; stresses sacramental efficacy and corporate aspects of election.
 - Van Til's federal account is used against monocovenantal readings that risk blurring forensic justification and thus altering classical Reformed soteriology.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed federal categories in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic and paradigm** in debates with monocovenantal or Federal Vision positions over continuity, sacraments, and justification.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture covenantally and for teaching covenantal hermeneutics in seminars.
