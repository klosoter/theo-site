### TITLE
**The Christian Doctrine of God: One Being Three Persons** - Thomas F. Torrance

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed, patristically retrievalist, Barth-informed dogmatics (c. 1996), amid ecumenical dialogues with Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism.
 - Milieu: critique of modern subjectivism and dualisms; constructive ressourcement of Nicene theology under a scientific realist method.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The one God is known as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in His self-revelation; the homoousion secures the identity of the God revealed in the economy with God in Himself, avoiding modalism and tritheism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - From revelation to ontology: the triune God gives Himself to be known in Jesus Christ through the Spirit; epistemology follows ontology.
 - Nicene-Constantinopolitan grammar: homoousion of the Son with the Father extended to the Spirit; perichoretic unity of persons.
 - Incarnation and atonement: the eternal Son assumes our humanity, heals and reconciles it in vicarious obedience and priestly self-offering.
 - Pneumatology: the Spirit effects the Son's mission, anoints Jesus, perfects His humanity, and incorporates the church into the Son's filial communion.
 - Ecclesial participation: preaching, sacraments, and prayer are means by which the triune communion ministers grace in the church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristics: Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Cyril of Alexandria; Western witnesses (Augustine, Calvin).
 - Moderns: Barth (core), Rahner (engaged and qualified), anti-trinitarian tendencies in modern theology; dialogue with Eastern theology on energies/persons.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and theological method; Trinity (immanent/economic); Christology (anhypostasia/enhypostasia, munus triplex); Pneumatology; Atonement and mediation; Ecclesiology and worship.
- **Closing line**
 - The triune God gives Himself to us through the Son and in the Spirit so that, united to Christ, we share by grace in the Son's communion with the Father.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Homoousion as evangelical and ontological axiom**, grounding epistemic realism and worship.
 - **Onto-relational persons**: persons are who they are in perichoretic relations, not detachable centers.
 - **Vicarious humanity of Christ**: Jesus believes, obeys, prays, and offers Himself for us, bearing our response Godward.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **dualism** (God behind God): no gap between immanent and economic Trinity, without collapsing distinctions.
 - Nuances **Rahner's Rule** via Barth: identity without reduction; divine being determines economic action, not vice versa.
 - Balances Eastern and Western trajectories on person-nature and filioque, resisting both **modalism** and **tritheism**.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Scientific theology**: realist, soteriologically-anchored method from God's self-disclosure.
 - Reframing **munus triplex** in explicitly trinitarian, soteriological-ontological terms.
 - Strong account of **Spirit-Christology** in Jesus's life and resurrection.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant in Reformed dogmatics (Scottish and global), ecumenical trinitarian renewal, and sacramental theology; used in dialogue with Orthodoxy and in Barth studies.
- **Enduring value**
 - A coherent Nicene framework uniting Trinity, Christology, soteriology, and ecclesial practice; pedagogically rich for catechesis, preaching, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Homoousion**: consubstantiality securing the identity of the Revealer with God; basis for realism about God.
- **Perichoresis**: mutual indwelling of the divine persons; unity without confusion.
- **Onto-relations**: personal identities constituted by relations of origin and communion.
- **Immanent/Economic Trinity**: who God eternally is and how God acts in salvation; held in identity without collapse. [Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation]
- **Vicarious humanity of Christ**: the Son lives, believes, obeys, and prays on our behalf, healing human response.
- **Anhypostasia/Enhypostasia**: the assumed human nature has no independent personal center but subsists in the person of the Son.
- **Munus triplex**: Christ as Prophet (revelation), Priest (atoning mediation), King (eschatological lordship), enacted in His incarnate life and ongoing ministry. [Munus Triplex]
- **Spirit-Christology**: the Spirit conceives, anoints, empowers, and perfects the incarnate Son's ministry, and raises Him, binding us to His filial life. [Spirits Role In Christs Ministry And Resurrection]
- **Mediation**: the one Mediator reconciles God and humanity, bridging epistemic and soteriological gaps.
- **Scientific theology**: method disciplined by the object's self-presentation; theology as participation in God's self-interpretation.
- **Filial communion**: the Son's relation to the Father into which believers are incorporated by the Spirit.
- **Means of grace**: preaching (Word), sacraments (Baptism/Eucharist), and prayer as trinitarian acts by which Christ ministers grace to His body. [Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer]
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**: the Son is eternally begotten; the Incarnation enacts, not constitutes, His Sonship, uniting deity and humanity for salvation. [Eternal Sonship And Incarnation]

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for Nicene trinitarian grammar across loci (Trinity, Christology, Pneumatology).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating atonement, worship, and ecclesial practices in trinitarian terms.
 - As a **polemic resource** against modalism, tritheism, and subjectivist epistemologies.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** for reading Scripture with patristic categories in a Barth-informed key.
