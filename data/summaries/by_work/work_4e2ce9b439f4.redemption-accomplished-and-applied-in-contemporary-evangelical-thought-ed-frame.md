### TITLE
**Redemption: Accomplished and Applied** - John M. Frame, in Contemporary Evangelical Thought (ed. John M. Frame)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed milieu; Frame as a systematic theologian and editor collecting contemporary evangelical positions.
 - Engages the impulse in Reformed teaching to recover both the objective work of Christ and the experiential life of the believer.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Redemption must be held as both objectively accomplished in Christ and subjectively applied by the Spirit; neglect of either pole distorts soteriology.
 - The essay intervenes in debates about the relation between historia salutis (salvation history) and ordo salutis (order of salvation).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and distinction:
 - Articulates what is meant by "accomplished" (Christ's once-for-all redemptive acts: atonement, resurrection, victory).
 - Articulates what is meant by "applied" (Holy Spirit's work in union with Christ bringing believers into the benefits).
 - Theological integration:
 - Argues for a covenantal-historical framework: redemption unfolds historically but is received in a logically ordered manner.
 - Insists that application is not merely subjective psychology but includes objective forensic effects (justification, adoption) mediated by union with Christ.
 - Methodological point:
 - Uses ordo salutis as a pedagogical/logical tool, not a temporal sequence; defends historia salutis as the primary narrative context.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed scholastic categories (Calvin, later systematicians), contemporary evangelical writers who polarize objective vs subjective emphases, and debates with pietistic/Wesleyan emphases that stress experiential application.
 - Implicitly contrasts those who over-systematize ordo salutis and those who reduce soteriology to existential experience.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (Person and work of Christ), atonement, justification (forensic imputation), sanctification, regeneration, union with Christ, covenant theology, Holy Spirit's role in application.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological gravity: true soteriology must maintain the unity of an accomplished historical redemption and its Spirit-wrought application in believers without collapsing one into the other.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the theological primacy of historia salutis as the narrative framework in which ordo salutis has meaning.
 - Treats application as both objective (forensic effects) and personal (experiential sanctification) mediated by union with Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic or existential reductions that make redemption primarily an inner process.
 - Opposes scholastic ordo-first readings that treat application as a detachable sequence of impersonal acts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies language around "accomplished" vs "applied" to prevent either/or thinking; reframes ordo salutis as pedagogical logic subordinate to historia salutis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among Reformed evangelicals for guarding the objective finished work of Christ while acknowledging ongoing Spirit-work.
 - Used in seminary courses to balance systematic categories with biblical-historical narrative.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear corrective to theological imbalances and a compact model for integrating systematic loci with pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accomplished redemption**
 - The once-for-all objective work of Christ (atonement, satisfaction, resurrection) accomplished in history.
- **Applied redemption**
 - The Spirit-mediated appropriation of Christ's benefits to believers resulting in justification, sanctification, adoption.
- **Historia salutis**
 - Salvation-history: the concrete, historical acts by which God redeems; the primary framework for soteriology.
- **Ordo salutis**
 - Logical/teaching order of salvation doctrines (e.g., calling, regeneration, faith, justification); pedagogical, not strictly chronological.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The central mediating reality by which accomplishment and application are united; ground of imputation and sanctification.
- **Justification (forensic imputation)**
 - Objective legal declaration that belongs to the "accomplished" benefits but is applied through the Spirit.
- **Regeneration**
 - Spirit-work effecting new life; part of application but rooted in accomplished covenantal promises.
- **Objective vs subjective redemption**
 - Objective: Christ's completed work; Subjective: the believer's experiential reception and ongoing conformity.
- **Covenantal-historical framework**
 - Emphasizes promises and acts across redemptive history as the stage for applying theological categories.
- **Atonement / substitution**
 - Articulated as decisive accomplishment whose benefits must be applied to sinners.
- **Effectual calling**
 - The Spirit's application act that moves the elect from accomplishment into personal appropriation.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive fruit of applied redemption; not opposed to justification but consequence of union with Christ.
- **Imputation**
 - Transfer of Christ's righteousness in justification; a connective doctrine between accomplished and applied aspects.
- **Perseverance / final perseverance**
 - Framed as an applied reality grounded in the accomplished, covenantal work of Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for distinguishing objective accomplished work from subjective applied benefits.
 - As a polemic resource against reductionistic pietism or mechanistic scholasticism that mishandles ordo/historia distinctions.
 - As an exegetical and pedagogical model for teaching Pauline soteriology and covenantal theology in seminary and pulpit contexts.
