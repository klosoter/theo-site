### TITLE
The Role Relationship of Men and Women (essay by Wayne Grudem, 1985, in Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1980s conservative evangelical response to rising feminist and egalitarian readings of Scripture. Published within the CBMW volume "Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood" (ed. Piper & Grudem), which sought to consolidate a complementarian manifesto for churches and seminaries.
 - Milieu: Southern Baptist and broadly Reformed-evangelical networks seeking a theologically robust defense of traditional gender-role distinctions.

- **Central thesis**
 - God has instituted complementary but distinct role relationships for men and women rooted in the created order: male headship in family and church is ordained by God and not merely cultural or punitive after the Fall.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation
 - Close readings of Genesis 1-3 (order of creation; man as recipient of mandate; woman as helper/companion) and canonical Pauline passages (1 Cor 11, 1 Tim 2, Eph 5).
 - Systematic-theological claim
 - Role distinctions are part of God's created order and reflect God's will for church polity and family structure.
 - Practical application
 - Prescription for church leadership (male eldership/elder qualifications) and household authority structures.
 - Trinitarian analogy
 - Appeals to relationships within the Trinity (Father-Son ordering) as an analogue or theological warrant for distinguishing roles without denying equal worth.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary egalitarian scholars (critics of traditional readings) and interpreters of Pauline household codes.
 - Draws on classical evangelical/scholastic exegesis and emerging complementarian literature; situates itself against readings that treat Galatians 3:28 as abolishing role distinctions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Scripture (revelation and authority/exegesis), creation and anthropology (imago Dei and created order), fall and its effects on roles, Trinity (economy and relations), ecclesiology (office/eldership), and Christian ethics.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The church must maintain a biblical order of complementary role relationships-grounded in creation and patterned by divine relational ordering-so that male headship in church and home is affirmed as God-ordained and normative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous linking of exegesis to systematic theology: not simply prooftexts but a constructed doctrinal case tying creation, fall, and Trinity to practical church order.
 - Firm insistence that role distinctions are part of the *created* (not merely cultural or punitive) order.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against egalitarian readings that universalize Galatians 3:28 to negate role distinctions.
 - Corrects both liberal denials of male leadership and pietistic reductions that treat role issues as merely cultural.

- **Conceptual / terminological contributions**
 - Popularizes and consolidates the term **complementarianism** as a cohesive theological position in conservative evangelical discourse.
 - Advances the language of "role relationship" as a way to hold simultanously to gender equality in value and distinction in function.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; widely used in seminaries, pastoral training, and denominational debates.
 - Sparked sustained conversation and controversy, especially as Grudem and others later articulated or were associated with the doctrine of **eternal functional subordination (EFS)** of the Son - a locus of intense theological debate.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a primary representative statement of late-20th-century complementarian theology; indispensable for teaching the complementarian case and for understanding subsequent debates over Trinitarian analogies and gender.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Complementarianism** - theological position affirming equal worth but distinct, complementary roles for men and women.
- **Egalitarianism (contrast)** - the opposing view that role distinctions by gender are not biblically mandated for church or home.
- **Created order / ordinance** - the ontological and normative claim that role distinctions originate in creation, not only in the Fall.
- **Headship (kephale)** - key Pauline term interpreted as leadership/authority in family and church; Grudem reads it as normative male headship.
- **Submission (hupotasso)** - relational posture expected within marriage and ecclesial order; distinguished from value or essence.
- **Role relationship** - phrase used to capture functional distinctions without ontological inequality.
- **Pauline household codes** - 1 Cor 11, 1 Tim 2, Eph 5 treated as prescriptive for church and family roles.
- **1 Corinthians 11 / 1 Timothy 2 / Ephesians 5** - primary exegetical loci marshaled for complementarian claims.
- **Imago Dei** - affirmed equal worth of men and women while maintaining role distinctions.
- **Trinity: economic relations** - uses Father-Son relational ordering as an analogue for human role distinctions.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - the contested doctrine invoked by some to ground role distinctions; Grudem's association with EFS later intensified debate over whether functional subordination implies ontological inequality.
- **Authority / eldership** - ecclesial offices retained for male leadership under Grudem's schema.
- **Galatians 3:28 (interpretive locus)** - debated verse; Grudem restricts its scope to salvation and equality of standing, not to functional roles.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary complementarianism and its core commitments.
 - As a **polemic** against egalitarian readings of Genesis and Paul and as a pastoral/disciplinary blueprint for church polity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading household codes in continuity with creation theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates tying Trinitarian relations (economic ordering) to human role distinctions - both used by proponents and critiqued by opponents in EFS controversies.
