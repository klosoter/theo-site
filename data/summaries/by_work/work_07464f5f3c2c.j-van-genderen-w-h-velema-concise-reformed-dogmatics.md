### TITLE
**Concise Reformed Dogmatics - J. van Genderen & W. H. Velema (with the Three Forms of Unity as doctrinal frame)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed systematic theology originating in the Dutch Reformed/confessional milieu; written for pastors, students, and churches committed to the Three Forms of Unity (Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession, Canons of Dort).
 - A corrective to liberal and pietistic trends: seeks to restate classical Reformed orthodoxy in clear, compact form usable in pulpit and classroom.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology is a unified, scripturally grounded science whose proper articulation must be governed by confessional principle; the gospel is covenantal and Christocentric, and all loci of dogmatics cohere under covenant and redemptive-historical categories.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents theology as principled, systematic knowledge (theological method as "science"): starts with revelation and Scripture as principia, then treats God, creation, fall, covenant, Christ, application (justification, sanctification), church, sacraments, and last things.
 - Strong covenantal axis:
 - Distinguishes covenant of works and covenant of grace, tracing administrations (e.g., Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) while insisting on unity of the covenant of grace.
 - Treats Mosaic covenant with careful nuance - analyzed in terms of *administration* and *substance* relative to the covenant of works.
 - Sacramental theology: sacraments are rights of access to Christ, signs and seals, and true means of grace through Word and Spirit (efficacy is instrumental, not magical).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Calvin and Reformed scholastics; confessional standards (Three Forms of Unity); interlocutors include Arminian, Roman Catholic, liberal Protestant, and neo-orthodox positions.
 - Draws also on Kuyperian emphases in cultural-religious engagement but keeps doctrinal dogmatics primary.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), Scripture; Trinity; creation and providence; fall and sin; covenants (works/grace, Mosaic analyzed); Christology (union with Christ, offices); soteriology (justification, sanctification); church and ministry; sacraments (means of grace); eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - A tightly argued, confessional Reformed dogmatics that places **covenant theology** and the **centrality of Christ** at the heart of systematic doctrine, taught as a coherent theological science anchored in Scripture and the Three Forms of Unity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological clarity: theology presented as a responsible science (principia theology as science) - principled beginning in Scripture and confession rather than private experience.
 - Covenantal coherence: uses covenantal categories not merely as one locus but as the organizing principle across loci.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic subjectivism by reasserting objective promises and federal headship.
 - Opposes liberal and existentialist reductions of doctrine to ethics or experience; counters Roman Catholic sacramentalism by stressing Word-centered sacramental efficacy.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Careful analytic distinction between *substance* and *administration* for covenants (esp. Mosaic): allows for a Reformed affirmation that Mosaic law functions with elements of the covenant of works in form while remaining an administration within redemptive history.
 - Terminological clarity on sacraments as **means of grace** (instrumental causality via Word and Spirit), avoiding both magical and purely memorial accounts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in confessional Reformed seminaries and churches; valued for pedagogical clarity and pastoral utility.
 - Criticized by some for conservative confessional commitments and limited engagement with critical-historical scholarship.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable primer for teaching covenantal Reformed theology; durable layout for catechesis, seminary courses, and pulpit exposition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principia / Theology as Science**
 - Theology begins with Scripture and confession as principia; systematic coherence and method emphasized.

- **Covenant of Works**
 - God's original covenant with Adam; standard of obedience as basis for life. Used to frame the law and legal demands.

- **Mosaic Covenant - "Covenant of Works as to Substance"**
 - Mosaic law analyzed as sharing substantive elements with the covenant of works (demand of obedience) while functioning as an administration within covenantal history; distinction between form and redemptive-administrative context is central.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - One unified covenant with multiple administrations, culminating in Christ; salvation by promise, fulfilled in Christ's person and work.

- **Federal Headship**
 - Adam/Christ as representative heads; key to understanding imputation of sin and righteousness.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological category linking justification, sanctification, adoption, and sacramental participation.

- **Sacraments as Means of Grace**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper are signs and seals that efficaciously convey grace through the Word and Spirit; efficacy is instrumental, not automatic.

- **Signs and Seals**
 - Sacramental language emphasizing covenant confirmation and assurance; theological safeguards against sacramentalism and ritualism.

- **Three Forms of Unity**
 - Confessional norm for doctrine and ecclesial practice; used as doctrinal-linguistic framework.

- **Revelation: General & Special**
 - Distinction insisted upon; Scripture as final authority for doctrine.

- **Justification by Faith**
 - Forensic, imputed righteousness of Christ; anchor of gospel proclamation.

- **Antithesis**
 - Principle of cultural and doctrinal separation between regenerate and non-regenerate, informing ecclesial and ethical stances.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed positions (covenant, sacraments, justification).
 - As a **polemic** against liberal and sacramental excesses (clarifying instrumental sacramental theology).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading covenant passages in redemptive-historical sequences (Mosaic as administration).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: covenantal unity organizes doctrine and pastoral catechesis.
