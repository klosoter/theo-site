### TITLE
Ritschl, Albrecht - "Ritschl, Albrecht, and the Rise of Liberal Theology" (secondary: Claude Welch)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 19th-century German theology, post-Enlightenment intellectual climate; reaction to Hegelian speculative systems, Schleiermacherian subjectivism, and apologetic supernaturalism.
 - Emergence of Protestant liberal theology in German universities; Ritschl as formative figure (Wittenberg, Göttingen, Königsberg, Bonn).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ritschl redefines revelation and theological method by grounding theology in the religious value and moral significance of Christ for the believing community rather than in metaphysical speculation or private feeling.
 - The doctrinal problem addressed: how can theology reliably speak of God and redemption in an age skeptical of metaphysics and supernaturalistic proofs?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Rejection of metaphysical natural theology: speculative proofs about God's essence are illegitimate for Christian doctrine.
 - Methodological shift to history and ethics:
 - Theology must judge historical facts and their religious value for the community (value-judgment).
 - Revelation is seen as God's self-disclosure in history, especially in the person and work of Jesus, judged by its moral and religious significance for faith.
 - Revelation as normative only insofar as it produces and sustains the ethical-religious community (the Kingdom of God).
 - Scripture is authoritative as the historical record and witness to the religious value of Christ, not as an apriori metaphysical deposit of revelation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian epistemology (limits of speculative reason), Schleiermacher (religious feeling), Hegel (systematic metaphysics), and contemporary historical-critical scholarship.
 - Secondary commentary and historicizing analysis by Claude Welch, who situates Ritschl within the rise of liberal Protestantism and critiques certain limits (e.g., neglect of metaphysical claims, risk of reductionism).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **General and Special Revelation** (primary focus here): reevaluation of both as historical, ethical, and communal phenomena.
 - Christology (Christ as normative revelation and moral exemplar).
 - Atonement (moral-value emphasis rather than metaphysical substitution).
 - Scripture and authority (witness theology).
 - Theology method, ecclesiology (church as locus of revelation), and ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl's theology centers on **revelation as concrete, historical, and ethically efficacious self-disclosure of God in Christ**, judged by the religious value it creates within the believing community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Value-judgment (Wertrichtung):** theological truth is assessed by the religious-ethical value it engenders in the community rather than by metaphysical correspondence.
 - **Ethical-historical Christocentrism:** Christ's significance is primary and is the criterion for theological claims.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Schleiermacher by moving from private feeling to communal, historical judgment.
 - Corrects Hegelian system-building by refusing speculative identity of God and world; corrects supernaturalists by denying metaphysical proofs as theological grounds.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasting revelation from propositional, metaphysical disclosure to an eventful, communal manifestation of God's saving purpose.
 - Treating Scripture primarily as historical witness and ecclesial norm rather than metaphysical oracle.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Dominant influence on late-19th and early-20th-century liberal Protestant theology (UK and US reception via Ritschlian schools and followers).
 - Provoked vigorous responses from conservative and neo-orthodox theologians (e.g., Barth) who saw Ritschl's reduction of revelation as capitulation to modernity.
 - Claude Welch situates Ritschl as catalyst for liberal scholarly theology while noting internal tensions and limits.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models an ethically focused, historically aware theology; useful for courses on modern theology, method, and the theology-reason relationship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **General Revelation**
 - For Ritschl: limited role; not a source of metaphysical knowledge of God; can be discerned in moral order and providential history insofar as it points toward God's redemptive purpose.
- **Special Revelation**
 - Reinterpreted as God's decisive self-disclosure in the person and work of Jesus, apprehended by the faith community and evaluated by its religious value.
- **Value-Judgment (Wertrichtung)**
 - Central methodological move: theological assertions are warranted by their ethical-religious value in the life of the church.
- **Religious Value**
 - The standard of truth-what fosters the Kingdom and faithful life is affirmed as theologically true.
- **Kingdom of God (Reich Gottes)**
 - The ethical-historical community in which divine revelation is realized and judged.
- **Scripture as Witness**
 - Scripture functions as historical testimony to Christ's religious value; authority is ecclesial and normative, not metaphysical.
- **Historical Method**
 - Emphasis on historical-critical scholarship to reconstruct Jesus and early Christian proclamation judged by ethical impact.
- **Christ as Normative Revelation**
 - Christ's person and work are the locus of revelation; doctrines must be measured against Christ's moral and salvific significance.
- **Rejection of Metaphysics**
 - Denial of speculative theology and natural theology as bases for Christian doctrine.
- **Faith as Trusting Response**
 - Faith is communal trust in the saving significance of Christ rather than assent to abstract propositions.
- **Atonement: Moral-Value Emphasis**
 - Focus on transformative moral consequences rather than metaphysical substitution theories.
- **Church as Locus of Revelation**
 - The believing community is the practical site where revelation is recognized and lived out.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for liberal theology's method (value-judgment; historical-ethical criteria).
 - As a **polemic** target from conservatives and neo-orthodox critics (on revelation, Scripture, and metaphysics).
 - As an **exegetical-model** exemplar: historical-critical reconstruction of Jesus prioritized for doctrinal formulation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of general vs special revelation: shifts debate from propositional content to historical-ethical manifestation.
