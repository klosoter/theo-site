### TITLE
Thomas F. Torrance: Theologian of the Trinity - Paul D. Molnar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Contemporary retrieval (21st century) of mid-20th-century Scottish-Reformed theology.
 - Locates Torrance within Reformed tradition, patristic retrieval, and the immediate influence of Karl Barth and Athanasius.
 - Engage wider conversations: Barthianism, analytic theology of religion, and debates over social vs. classical Trinitarianism.

- **Central thesis**
 - Torrance's theology is irreducibly Trinitarian: the doctrine of the Trinity is formative for his entire theological method and doctrinal system. Molnar argues Torrance reconceives divine being as personal, relational, and historically self-revealing in the incarnate Word.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Torrance's theological method: "scientific theology" grounded in revelation and realism.
 - Detailed presentation of Torrance's Trinitarian ontology: real relations, the Father-Son-Spirit as constitutive of divine being, and the priority of the economic Trinity for knowledge of the immanent Trinity.
 - Clarifies Torrance's Christology and soteriology as Trinitarianly dependent (hypostatic union, atonement as divine act of the triune God).
 - Assessment of potential misunderstandings: avoids labeling Torrance as merely "social" or "modalist"; explains his fidelity to classical creedal commitments while innovating on relational metaphysics.
 - Concluding evaluation of Torrance's contribution to contemporary systematic theology and pastoral doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Thomas F. Torrance (central), Karl Barth (critical interlocutor and influence).
 - Patristic witnesses emphasized: Athanasius and Cyril.
 - Reformed context: Scottish theology (e.g., A. B. Davidson legacy), dialogue with modern philosophical realism and critics of social Trinitarianism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (hypostatic union; incarnation as epistemic center), revelation and theological method, atonement/mediation, doctrine of God (being, personhood, relations), pneumatology, doctrine of creation indirectly through Trinitarian action.

- **Closing line**
 - Torrance, as Molnar renders him, makes the Trinity the epistemic and ontological hinge of Christian theology: God is known and God acts only as the triune God, and this relational, incarnational doctrine must govern all theological loci.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **real relations** within the Godhead: relations are constitutive of divine personhood, not accidental predicates.
 - **Revelation-first "scientific theology"**: theology is disciplined, reality-correspondent inquiry grounded in the historical self-revelation of the triune God in Christ.
 - Incarnation as both theocentric and epistemic - Christology returns the knowledge of God to Trinitarian living relations.

- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond a Barthian stress on revelation alone by integrating patristic ontological categories (Athanasius) with modern metaphysical realism.
 - Distinguishes himself from social trinitarianism by rejecting a purely relational/constituted persons account that risks ontological separability; affirms perichoresis without collapse or division.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts classical talk of "immanent" and "economic" Trinity with an emphasis on **the priority of God's self-revelation** (economic) for knowledge of God's inner life, while preserving the ontological integrity of the immanent Trinity.
 - Uses "relation" in a metaphysically robust sense (not merely relational analogy).

- **Reception and influence**
 - High traction in contemporary Reformed and evangelical circles seeking Trinitarian retrieval.
 - Influential for theologians pursuing integration of doctrine of God with Christology and method (e.g., resurgence of interest in Torrance's scientific theology).
 - Subject of debate in analytic and social-Trinitarian critiques - seen as a corrective to some modern truncations of Trinitarian doctrine.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined way to make Trinitarian doctrine central to all loci.
 - Offers a resource for refashioning theological method around revelation and metaphysical realism.
 - Useful corrective to both reductive social-Trinitarian and non-relational classical accounts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian ontology** - God's being is relational and personal; persons are constituted by relations.
- **Real relations** - relations that are ontologically constitutive, not accidental or merely psychological.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's self-manifestation in history (prioritized epistemically for knowledge of God).
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inner life; preserved as ontologically real while known through the economic.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling: used to secure unity without confusion or division.
- **Hypostatic union** - Christological axiom linking Torrance's Christology to Trinitarian being and revelation.
- **Scientific theology** - disciplined, reality-correspondent theological method grounded in revelation and objective truth.
- **Incarnation as epistemic center** - the incarnation is the decisive disclosure of God enabling true knowledge.
- **Athanasius/Cyril retrieval** - patristic framework used to ground Torrance's Trinitarian metaphysics.
- **Revelation-realism** - epistemological stance combining revelation's primacy with ontological realism about divine and created realities.
- **Anti-social Trinitarian correction** - Torrance's stance that resists reducing Trinitarian identity to social relations among otherwise separable agents.
- **Mediation / Atonement (Trinitarian frame)** - atonement is enacted by the triune God through the incarnate Son, with the Spirit's reconciling work.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for robustly Trinitarian systematic theologies that prioritize incarnation and relations.
 - As a **polemic** against purely social-Trinitarian or reductionist accounts of persons and relations.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading patristic witnesses (esp. Athanasius) into modern dogmatics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** integrating doctrine of God, Christology, and theological method (revelation-realism).
