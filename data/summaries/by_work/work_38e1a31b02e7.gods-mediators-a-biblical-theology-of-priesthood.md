### TITLE
**God's Mediators: A Biblical Theology of Priesthood** - Andrew S. Malone

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary biblical-theological study situated within late 20th-21st century evangelical and academic conversations on canonical theology, Hebrews scholarship, and the intersection of cultic studies and systematic theology. Engages historical-critical results (Second Temple literature, ancient Near Eastern cult) while arguing from canonical and theological priorities.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The biblical storyline is intelligible through the motif of mediation (priesthood): God appoints mediators across the covenantal economy whose roles culminate in Jesus Christ as the definitive High Priest. Understanding priesthood clarifies Christology, atonement, ecclesiology, and worship.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of priestly phenomena in the Old Testament: origins (Gen 14, Melchizedek), Sinai cult (Aaronic priesthood), tabernacle/temple, prophetic critiques, and royal-priestly tensions (Davidic kingship).
 - Intertestamental and Second Temple developments: priesthood in Jewish sectarianism and messianic expectation.
 - New Testament fulfillment: Hebrews as central exposition of Christ's unique priesthood (Melchizedek typology), Pauline and Johannine applications, and the apostolic reconfiguration of priesthood for the church (royal priesthood language).
 - Theological synthesis: distinctions between divine-onerous mediation (Christ's exclusive, once-for-all work) and participatory/practical priesthood (church and ministers), with implications for worship, sacraments, and pastoral office.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive reading of canonical OT and NT texts (esp. Exodus, Leviticus, Psalms, Genesis 14, Hebrews); interaction with Second Temple sources and modern scholars in Hebrews studies, biblical theology, and sacramental/ministerial theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant, Christology, atonement/sacrifice, Trinity (mediatory economy), ecclesiology (royal priesthood), sacramentology, typology, and representation.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Priesthood is the axis of divine-human mediation in Scripture, fulfilled uniquely in Christ while reconstituting corporate and ministerial forms of mediatorship for the people of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats priesthood primarily as a relational, functional category (mediation, representation, intercession), not merely as institutional or ceremonial residue.
 - Reads Hebrews as the canonical hinge that both fulfills and reinterprets Israelite priesthood-Christ's priesthood is ontologically unique yet ecclesially formative.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against readings that either reduce OT priests to mere "types" with no substantive continuity or those that conflate all priesthood with Christ's unique work; maintains both fulfillment and qualified continuation.
 - Challenges privatized or purely spiritualized accounts of "priesthood of all believers" by preserving a categorical distinction between Christ's exclusive mediatorship and participatory priesthood of the church.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Deploys a sustained "mediator" schema across covenants to trace functionally consistent roles (sacrifice, intercession, covenant representation) rather than only titular continuity.
 - Clarifies terms such as ontological vs. participatory priesthood to prevent category confusion in ecclesiology and soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted in evangelical graduate seminars, cited in recent Hebrews and sacramental studies; appreciated for canonical breadth and pastoral relevance.
 - Influences discussions about ministerial identity, the sacramental shape of worship, and theological readings of cultic language.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise canonical-theological framework for connecting Old Testament cult, New Testament fulfillment, and contemporary ecclesial practice.
 - Useful for pastors, homileticians, and systematic theologians wrestling with mediation, ministry, and the church's priestly self-understanding.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mediator:** One who stands between God and people to reconcile, represent, and intercede; the central functional category of the book.
- **Priesthood:** Functional office involving sacrifice, representation, and intercession; analyzed as both historical institutions and theological types.
- **High Priest:** The apex mediatorial figure (Hebrews portrays Christ as ultimate High Priest).
- **Aaronic priesthood:** Institutional, cultic priesthood of Israel with liturgical/ritual responsibilities; seen as foreshadowing but not equalling Christ's priesthood.
- **Melchizedek typology:** Key typological axis linking Genesis, Psalms, and Hebrews to show Christ's superior, timeless priesthood.
- **Royal priesthood:** Corporate identity of the people of God (1 Pet. 2 language) - participatory priesthood for worship and mission, distinct from Christ's unique mediatorship.
- **Sacrifice / Atonement:** Central priestly function; Christ's sacrifice is presented as once-for-all fulfillment that reinterprets cultic language.
- **Temple / Cult:** Spatial and liturgical locus of priestly action; reinterpreted christologically and ecclesiologically rather than simply abolished.
- **Representation (vicariate):** Priest as covenant representative; important for understanding soteriology and substitution.
- **Intercession:** Ongoing priestly activity; Christ's intercession contrasted with priestly mediations within the church.
- **Typology / Fulfillment:** Method of reading continuity and discontinuity between covenants; seeks balanced canonical typology.
- **Ontological vs. participatory priesthood:** Distinction to preserve Christ's exclusive status and the church's derivative, participatory role.
- **Canonical reading of Hebrews:** Methodological pivot - Hebrews as central interpretive lens for priesthood.
- **Mediation (economy):** The broader framework linking covenantal stages and ministries.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional and exegetical source for the theological concept of mediation/priesthood in biblical theology.
 - As a corrective polemic against both reductionist typology and over-broad applications of "priesthood" to church offices.
 - As a conceptual pivot in ecclesiology and sacramental theology to align ministerial identity with Christ's unique mediatorship while upholding corporate priestly vocation.
