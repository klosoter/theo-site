### TITLE
The Philosophy of Information - Luciano Floridi (Oxford, 2011). 
A foundational programmatic work establishing an ontological, epistemological and ethical framework built around the concept of information and the infosphere.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century response to the informational and computational turn in science, technology and culture; situated within analytic philosophy of information and philosophy of computing.
 - Intersects with debates in epistemology, metaphysics (structural realism), and applied ethics (AI, data ethics).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Information is a fundamental ontological category.** Reality should be understood structurally as an infosphere of informational entities; epistemology and ethics must be reconceived in information-theoretic terms.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Establishes a working **definition of information** (the Semantic Concept of Information: well-formed, meaningful and truthful data).
 - Part II: Develops **informational structural realism** - the claim that reality is intelligible as structures of information; argues for ontological primacy of informational patterns over substance metaphysics.
 - Part III: Articulates methodological tools - notably **Levels of Abstraction (LoA)** - for making sense of complex informational systems without reductionism.
 - Part IV: Constructs an **Information Ethics** and consequences for agency, moral patienthood, privacy, and the moral standing of artefacts and inforgs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Shannon (information theory), Turing (computation), Dretske and Bateson (semantic / biological information), Peirce (semiotics), Russell and Carnap (logical empiricism); dialogues with computationalism, reductionist physicalism, and certain strands of post-humanist thought.
- **Doctrines treated (theological loci of implication)**
 - Not explicitly theological but relevant to: **creation (ontology of world as created infosphere), revelation (message/meaning models), anthropology (personhood and informational identity), ethics (moral status of agents, stewardship), ecclesiology (information communities), and providence/omniscience debates** (knowledge as informational access).
- **Closing line**
 - Floridi reframes metaphysics and moral theory by treating the world as an infosphere: to think theologically after Floridi is to ask how divine, human and ecclesial realities participate in and are governed by informational structures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates **information** from an instrumental concept to an ontological and ethical pivot; insists on **truthfulness** as constitutive of semantic information.
 - Proposes **inforgs** (informational organisms) and the **infosphere** as descriptive primitives.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Opposes naive computationalism that reduces mind to mere syntactic processing by emphasizing semantic and truth conditions.
 - Challenges substance-oriented metaphysics; offers structural realism as middle path between robust realism and anti-realist constructivism.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - **Levels of Abstraction (LoA)** as canonical method to avoid category mistakes across scientific and moral descriptions.
 - Systematic articulation of **Information Ethics**: moral duties owed to the integrity of the infosphere.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Increasingly cited in digital theology, ethics of AI, and theological anthropology conversations; used as a conceptual bridge for treating creation as relational/informational rather than merely material.
 - Mixed reception: welcomed for methodological clarity and ethical scope; critiqued by sacramental and relational theologians who stress embodied, covenantal, or eschatological dimensions beyond structural description.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides durable analytical tools (SCI, LoA, infosphere) for engaging technology, metaphysics and ethics - indispensable for contemporary theological work on information, AI, and digital culture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Information (Semantic Concept of Information, SCI)**: **well-formed, meaningful and truthful data**; distinguishes mere data from semantic, veridical content.
- **Data**: syntactic tokens or states that become information when well-formed and meaningful.
- **Infosphere**: the total environment of informational entities and their relations; analogous to biosphere but for information.
- **Inforg**: informational organism or agent inhabiting the infosphere (humans, organisms, artefacts insofar as they process information).
- **Levels of Abstraction (LoA)**: methodological frames for describing systems at appropriate granularity to avoid category errors.
- **Informational Structural Realism**: metaphysical position that ontological primacy belongs to informational structures rather than to matter-substance.
- **Shannon / syntactic information**: metric/engineering measure of uncertainty - distinguished from semantic (meaningful) and pragmatic (useful) information.
- **Semantic information**: information that carries meaning and truth conditions (Floridi centers this).
- **Information Ethics (IE)**: ethical framework that privileges the preservation, flourishing and moral respect of the infosphere; duties not only toward persons but toward informational entities.
- **Computationalism (critique)**: the thesis that cognition is computation; Floridi critiques reductionist forms while retaining computational resources.
- **Veridicality / truthfulness condition**: requirement that for data to count as information it must be true (distinguishes knowledge-bearing information from mere well-formed signals).
- **Ontology of artefacts**: classification of non-biological agents as moral patients/agents within the infosphere.
- **Privacy and informational autonomy**: applied locus where IE grounds duties and rights in informational dignity.
- **Epistemic transparency**: normative ideal about access to and accuracy of information systems.
- **Moral status of informational patterns**: idea that informational integrity itself can be a moral object.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source**: theologians adopt SCI as a precise definition when discussing revelation, scripture-as-information, and digital sacraments.
- **Conceptual pivot**: employed to reconceive creation and creaturely ontology in structural/informational terms (alternative to strict materialism).
- **Polemic / methodological tool**: used against naive technological determinism and against reductionist accounts of mind in theological anthropology and ethics.
- **Exegetical model**: supplies metaphors and models (message, medium, infosphere) for interpreting communicative doctrines (revelation, incarnation, church as information community).
