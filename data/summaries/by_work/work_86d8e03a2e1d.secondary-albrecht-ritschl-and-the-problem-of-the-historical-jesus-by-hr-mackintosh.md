### TITLE
Secondary: Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of the Historical Jesus - H. R. Mackintosh (study of Albrecht Ritschl)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century British-German theological exchange. Mackintosh (Scottish theologian) situates Ritschl (19th-cent. German liberalism) amid post-Enlightenment historical criticism and the rise of systematic theology that privileges ethical-religious norms over speculative metaphysics.
 - Relevant for debates in Reformed covenant theology where the status of historical acts (e.g., covenant events) vs. religious interpretation is at stake.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Mackintosh examines Ritschl's attempt to reconcile the historical Jesus with a theology that defines Christianity by its religious value for the believing community. The core problem: can a theology that reduces Christ to ethical-religious significance sustain doctrines that in Reformed tradition depend on objective historical divine acts (e.g., covenant, atonement)?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Ritschlian method: theology as a practical, value-oriented discipline; restraint of metaphysical claims about Christ.
 - Assessment of the "historical Jesus" question: Ritschl's preference for the Christ as normative for Christian life over metaphysical reconstructions.
 - Critique from Mackintosh: risks of subjectivism, weakening of objective covenantal foundations, and limits of historical criticism as ground for dogma.
 - Conclusion: Ritschl advances important corrective to speculative theology but fails to secure the ontological and covenantal claims central to Reformed dogmatics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Albrecht Ritschl (primary subject), Mackintosh as critic-interpreter; implicit interlocutors include Schleiermacher (subjective religion), Harnack and historical-critical scholars, and Reformed dogmaticians defending covenant objectivity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as religious experience/value vs. propositional/historical event), Christology (ethical-normative vs. metaphysical/historical), atonement (moral-reform emphasis vs. objective substitution/covenantal act), covenant (status of divine acts and promises), authority and the relation of history to faith.

- **Closing line**
 - Mackintosh presents Ritschl as a corrective to metaphysical excess, but ultimately as offering a theology that strains the Reformed claim that God's covenantal acts are historically objective foundations for faith and doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as a discipline of religious value-judgement ("Werturteil"): doctrine evaluated by its capacity to sustain the life and worship of the Christian community.
 - Christ primarily as the normative center of the Christian community rather than as an ontological metaphysical object.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects speculative, metaphysical Christologies (e.g., post-Kantian German idealism) by insisting theology remain practical and experientially rooted.
 - Contrasts sharply with Reformed covenant theology by deprioritizing the objective historicity of divine acts that undergird covenant promises.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The explicit use of "value-judgement" as theological method; redefinition of "kingdom" as ethical-religious community rather than juridical covenantal structure.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential for British and liberal Protestant theology, shaping pastoral and ethical emphases in systematic theology.
 - Criticized by neo-orthodox and conservative Reformed theologians for leading to subjectivism and undermining sacramental/covenantal objectivity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Sharpens methodological awareness: where to legitimate historical-critical insights and where to insist on objective covenantal claims.
 - Useful pedagogically as a case study on limits of ethical-religious reductionism for doctrinal loci like covenant and atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historical Jesus**
 - The scholarly reconstruction of Jesus' life and sayings; Ritschl treats historical data insofar as it serves the community's faith.
- **Christ of Faith vs. Jesus of History**
 - Distinction: Ritschl privileges the Christ as normative for worship/practice; Mackintosh probes the tension with historical claims.
- **Value-judgement (Werturteil)**
 - Ritschl's defining method: theological claims judged by religious value for the believing community.
- **Norm / Normative Christ**
 - The idea that Christ functions as the normative center shaping Christian moral and ecclesial life.
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Recast by Ritschl as the ethical-religious community; contrasts with covenantal-juridical notions.
- **Revelation**
 - For Ritschl: revelation as religious self-knowledge and communal encounter; in Reformed critique, revelation retains propositional and historical content (covenantal acts).
- **Atonement**
 - Ritschlian tendency toward moral-influence or ethical-exemplar readings; criticizable from a covenantal substitutionary perspective.
- **Covenant**
 - Central locus in Reformed theology involving divine acts and promises; Mackintosh uses Ritschl to test the vulnerability of covenantal objectivity under value-centered theology.
- **Method of theology**
 - Practical/rational-religious method (Ritschl) vs. dogmatic-historical method (Reformed).
- **Subjectivism vs. Objectivity**
 - Key axis: Ritschl's emphasis risks subjectivism; Reformed tradition insists on objective historical events as theological ground.
- **Community of Believers**
 - For Ritschl, principal locus of theological validity; Reformed tradition balances community with covenantal institution and sacrament.
- **Historical criticism**
 - Tool for reconstructing Jesus; Mackintosh assesses its theological limits when divorced from confessional claims.
- **Religious experience**
 - Basis for Ritschlian theology; contested as sufficient foundation for doctrines like covenant and atonement.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a definitional source for understanding **Ritschlian method** (value-judgement) and its implications.
 - As a **polemic** against theological subjectivism in discussions of covenant and atonement.
 - As an **exegetical-model caution**: shows limits of grounding dogma solely on historical-critical reconstructions.
