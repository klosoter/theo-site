### TITLE
**The Way of Life** by Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Old School Presbyterianism at Princeton. Written amid Second Great Awakening aftershocks, engaging New Haven theology, Finneyite perfectionism, and Roman Catholic claims, with a pastoral aim to catechize and evangelize using Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The gospel way of salvation is by **grace alone** through **faith alone** in **Christ alone**, as revealed in **Scripture alone** and applied by the **Spirit**, producing holiness and hope.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scripture as the sufficient, perspicuous rule of faith and life.
 - Human sin and inability: original sin, guilt, corruption, and the failure of moralism.
 - Christology and atonement: the Mediator's person and work; satisfaction and substitution.
 - Faith and repentance: their nature, necessity, and relation to justification.
 - Justification by imputed righteousness; assurance grounded in promises and sealed by the Spirit.
 - Regeneration, union with Christ, and sanctification as distinct yet inseparable benefits.
 - Means of grace: Word, sacraments, prayer; church as visible and invisible.
 - Perseverance and the Christian life; death, resurrection, judgment, eternal destiny.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Westminster Standards, Augustine, Calvin, Turretin; in debate with Trent, Socinians/Unitarians, Arminians and New Haven divines, perfectionists, and sacramentalists.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; covenant of works and grace; Trinity implicit in redemptive economy; person and work of Christ; the Spirit's effectual calling and sanctifying agency; church and sacraments; last things.
- **Closing line:** Salvation is a divine work in Christ, through the Spirit, received by faith, nourished by appointed means, and ordered to the glory of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear, popular-level exposition of **forensic justification** and **imputation** within a covenantal frame.
 - Tightly coordinated **Word-and-Spirit** economy; no grace apart from the instituted means.
 - **Experiential Calvinism:** marks of true faith, pastoral treatment of assurance, and the moral aims of doctrine.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Pelagian/Arminian** moral ability and conditional election; affirms total inability and sovereign grace.
 - Against **moral-government** theories of atonement; insists on satisfaction and substitution.
 - Against **Tridentine** intrinsic-justification; maintains imputed righteousness and the instrumentality of faith.
 - Against **perfectionism** and **new measures**; upholds progressive sanctification and ordinary means.
 - Against **sacramentalism** ex opere; sacraments are signs and seals, efficacious by the Spirit through faith.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Not novel in content but notable for accessible precision on **instrumental cause of justification**, **active/passive obedience**, **federal headship**, and the **distinction between faith and assurance**.
- **Reception and influence:** Long used in Presbyterian catechesis and evangelical apologetics; a bridge from Princeton scholastic clarity to congregational instruction; widely cited for soteriology, Scripture, and the means of grace.
- **Enduring value:** A concise, integrated map of Reformed doctrine binding exegesis, system, and piety; reliable for teaching justification, regeneration, assurance, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture: inspiration, sufficiency, perspicuity** - the normative rule of faith; Scripture interprets Scripture.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace** - Adamic probation and Christ's federal headship; frames law and gospel.
- **Federal headship** - Adam's guilt imputed to all; Christ's obedience imputed to believers.
- **Original sin and moral inability** - corruption and guilt render the sinner unable to believe apart from grace.
- **Atonement as satisfaction and substitution** - Christ bears penalty and fulfills righteousness for His people.
 - Contrasts with moral example or governmental views.
- **Active and passive obedience of Christ** - fulfillment of the law and bearing of its curse together ground justification.
- **Justification (forensic, by imputation)** - God declares righteous on the basis of Christ, received by faith alone.
 - Faith as instrument; works as fruit, not ground.
- **Faith and repentance** - faith receives and rests on Christ; repentance is evangelical, inseparable but distinct.
- **Regeneration (monergistic) and effectual calling** - the Spirit grants new birth through the Word.
- **Union with Christ** - benefits of redemption flow from union; ordo coordinated rather than collapsed.
- **Sanctification (progressive)** - Spirit-driven holiness using ordinary means; perfection denied in this life.
- **Assurance and the sealing of the Spirit** - grounded in promises, evidences, and the Spirit's testimony; not of the essence of faith yet ordinarily attainable.
- **Church, visible and invisible** - one people under the covenant; marks, discipline, and ministry of Word and sacrament.
- **Sacraments as means of grace** - signs and seals strengthening faith; efficacy tied to the Spirit's work and faith.
- **Death, resurrection, judgment** - intermediate state, future resurrection, final judgment, heaven and hell orient Christian hope.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definition source for justification, faith, imputation, and regeneration.
 - As a polemical touchstone against Trent, perfectionism, and moral-government atonement.
 - As an exegetical-model compendium of proof texts arranged dogmatically.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking covenant frames to Word-and-Spirit means in Christian life and hope.
