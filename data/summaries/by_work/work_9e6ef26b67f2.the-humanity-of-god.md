### TITLE
**Karl Barth, The Humanity of God (1956/1960)** 
A late-Barth lecture/essay marking a programmatic reorientation from a primarily crisis/dialectical accent to an evangelical, Christologically concentrated account of God's deity as graciously human toward us.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1950s, post-war, mature phase of Church Dogmatics (esp. II/2, III-IV in view).
 - Delivered as a lecture (1956), published in English 1960; emblematic of "late Barth" correcting earlier one-sidedness.
 - Milieu: reactions to liberal Protestantism, dialectical theology, and debates over natural theology and revelation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: The deity of God includes and is shown in His humanity; in Jesus Christ God freely wills to be God-with-us. God's majesty is His condescending fellowship, not solitary remoteness.
 - Problem addressed: overcoming the opposition between a "wholly other" God and an immanent, humanly projected deity; articulating how revelation discloses God as for humanity without collapsing Creator/creature.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reassessment of early dialectical stress: the "No" to human religion was necessary but insufficient; the Gospel's "Yes" must be primary.
 - Christological concentration: in Jesus Christ God's turn toward humanity is definitive revelation of who God is eternally.
 - Freedom-in-love: God's freedom is not aloofness but the sovereign liberty to be with and for the human creature (Immanuel).
 - Knowledge of God: God is known in His self-humiliation; theology must be human (creaturely, churchly) because God speaks in human form.
 - Covenant and creation: the covenant of grace is the internal basis of creation; God's humanity grounds His purpose for humanity.
 - Sin and reconciliation: God's humanity meets human pride and misery; reconciliation occurs as the Judge is judged for us.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Luther (Deus praedicatus, the crib and the cross), Calvin (accommodation), patristic Christology.
 - Critically engaged: Schleiermacher and liberal anthropocentrism; Feuerbach's projection thesis; dialectical misreadings of the "wholly other"; natural theology (analogia entis).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper (freedom, love, impassibility reinterpreted), Trinity ad extra, Revelation/Scripture, Election and Covenant, Creation/Anthropology (imago and relation), Sin, Christology (incarnation, humiliation), Reconciliation.

- **Center of gravity**
 - God's being is in His gracious act toward us in Jesus Christ; the humanity of God is the evangelical name for divine majesty as fellowship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The deity of God includes His humanity; God's majesty is His condescension.
 - Christological actualism: God is who He is in His act of revelation and reconciliation.
 - Theology as a human task grounded in God's humanizing approach (Word in human words).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects earlier one-sided crisis-language that stressed distance; emphasizes the primacy of God's "Yes" in Christ.
 - Rejects liberal reduction of God to human religious consciousness and natural-theological ascent.
 - Reframes classical impassibility: not apathy, but sovereign, compassionate constancy in suffering love.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Humanity of God as explication of divine freedom-in-love.
 - Analogia relationis (relation established by God in Christ) over analogia entis.
 - Covenant as internal to God's purpose; creation ordered to fellowship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Pivotal for readings of "late Barth" (Jungel on God's being-in-becoming; Torrance on mediation).
 - Reoriented Reformed dogmatics toward covenantal, Christocentric theology proper and Scripture's dual nature (divine-human).
 - Engaged by Catholic and Protestant theologians in debates on passibility, election, and revelation; used to counter caricatures of Barth as only "negative."

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies that the Gospel reveals who God eternally is.
 - Integrates theology proper, Christology, covenant, and scripture in a concise, teachable synthesis.
 - Pastoral traction: grounds God's nearness without sentimentalism or loss of transcendence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Humanity of God**: God's gracious turning to us in Christ; not a diminution of deity but its evangelical form.
- **Majesty-as-condescension**: Divine greatness revealed as fellowship and humility, chiefly in the incarnation and cross.
- **Freedom of God**: Liberty to love; freedom for, not from, the creature.
- **Immanuel**: The name summarizing revelation; God-with-us as identity, not episodic intervention.
- **Being-in-act**: God known in His acts; revelation is self-interpretive and ontologically disclosive.
- **Revelation**: God's self-speaking in Jesus Christ; Scripture as human witness taken into service of the Word.
 - Contrasts with natural theology's independent knowledge of God.
- **Analogia relationis**: Knowledge of God grounded in the relation established in Christ, not in created being as such.
- **Election**: God's self-determination to be for humanity in Jesus Christ; basis of covenantal fellowship.
- **Covenant and creation**: Covenant is the internal basis of creation; creation serves fellowship.
- **Sin (pride and misery)**: Human refusal of fellowship met and overcome by God's humanizing grace.
- **Reconciliation**: The Judge judged in our place; God's humanity operative in atonement.
- **Accommodation**: God's self-adjustment to human capacity (Calvin) fulfilled in Christ and Scripture.
- **Scripture's humanity**: Human words instrumentalized by God; analogy to incarnation without confusion.
- **Wholly Other (reframed)**: Transcendence affirmed, but as the One who is transcendent precisely in nearness.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Theology Proper: definitional source for God's freedom-in-love and reinterpreted impassibility.
 - Christology and Atonement: conceptual pivot for the incarnation and reconciliation (Judge judged).
 - Covenant Theology and Creation: grounds the teleology of creation in covenantal fellowship.
 - Bibliology and Method: model for divine-human concurrence in Scripture and the human character of theology.
