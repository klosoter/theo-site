### TITLE
The Fall of Interpretation: Philosophical Foundations for a Creational Hermeneutic - James K. A. Smith

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th / early-21st century conversation in evangelical and Reformed circles about hermeneutics, postmodern critique, and the relationship between theology and philosophy.
 - Responds to continental philosophical hermeneutics (Gadamer, Ricoeur), deconstruction (Derrida), historicist and liberal biblical criticism, and modern epistemologies that claim neutrality.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Interpretation itself is a fallen human practice: sin has corrupted the human capacity to read, so hermeneutics must be re-grounded in a theological account of creation, Fall, and redemption rather than left to secular philosophy or neutral methodological rules.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: surveys major contemporary hermeneutical paradigms and argues they fail because they presuppose either an autonomous interpreter or reduce texts to purely historical/linguistic artifacts.
 - Theological corrective: proposes a "creational hermeneutic" rooted in the doctrine of creation (including the imago Dei), which recognizes interpretation as a created vocation subject to distortion by sin and in need of redemption.
 - Methodological implications: calls for a hermeneutic that integrates theological doctrines (revelation, sin, redemption) with epistemology, recovering norms for interpretation that are both theological and philosophically aware.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Philosophical hermeneuticians: Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, Martin Heidegger.
 - Deconstructionists: Jacques Derrida (criticized for destabilizing meaning).
 - Modern/literalist historicists and critical exegetes (implicitly engages forms of liberal criticism).
 - Theological resources: Augustine, classical Reformation figures (implicitly Calvinian concerns about providence and the Word), and contemporary evangelical interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and general), human epistemology, imago Dei, original sin and its effect on reason, redemption as repairing interpretive capacities, and the normative authority of Scripture for hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - Interpretation must be reclaimed theologically: a creationally grounded, theologically informed hermeneutic acknowledges the Fall, resists secular autonomy, and locates interpretive authority in the triune God and his Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats hermeneutics explicitly as a theological problem (not merely methodological): interpretation is a moral-ontological vocation shaped by creation and corrupted by sin.
 - Emphasizes the need to recover a creational ontology as the proper background for reading - i.e., human knowing is a created capacity with telos and limits.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against claims that philosophical hermeneutics or deconstruction provide neutral or final accounts of meaning.
 - Critiques liberal historicism for reducing meaning to historical reconstruction and critiques postmodernism for dissolving stable meaning without offering normative recovery.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The phrase and programmatic thrust of a "creational hermeneutic" - an interpretive framework that situates reading within creation, fallenness, and redemption.
 - Diagnosis of the "fall" of interpretation as a theological category: not merely error, but disordered human vocation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Used by evangelicals and some Reformed scholars as a corrective to both secular critical theory and naive methodologicalism.
 - Influenced subsequent work linking liturgy, formation, and interpretation (Smith later develops these themes in cultural liturgy work).
 - Criticisms: some scholars find the program abstract or underdeveloped for concrete exegesis; others question historical readings of continental theorists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies why hermeneutics cannot be purely technical; integrates doctrine and method.
 - Provokes renewed attention to theological anthropology in epistemology and biblical interpretation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creational hermeneutic** - interpretive approach grounded in the doctrine of creation; sees reading as a created human vocation.
- **Fall of interpretation** - diagnosis that sin has distorted human interpretive capacities; hermeneutical failures are theological as well as methodological.
- **Imago Dei (interpretive capacity)** - human ability to know and interpret as part of being made in God's image, now damaged but not obliterated.
- **Revelation (special vs. general)** - insistence that Scripture offers normative corrective to fallen interpretive practices, while general revelation situates humans in a created intelligible world.
- **Hermeneutical autonomy** - the modern presupposition that interpreters can be neutral, critiqued as illusory and idolatrous.
- **Philosophical hermeneutics** - Gadamer/Ricoeur lineage engaged and critiqued for failing to account for creation/Fall; useful historically but insufficient theologically.
- **Deconstruction** - Derrida-style skepticism about stable meaning; diagnosed as symptomatic of interpretive fallenness rather than a solution.
- **Epistemic humility** - virtue emphasized: because interpretation is fallen, humility and theological dependence are required.
- **Normative authority** - the claim that Scripture (and the triune God's ordering of creation) supplies norms for interpretation, not merely procedures.
- **Teleology of interpretation** - reading has ends (telos) rooted in creational purposes and redemptive transformation.
- **Anthropology of reading** - reading as a human act embedded in creaturely purposes and social practices.
- **Corrective vs. reconstructive strategy** - Smith favors corrective theological grounding over purely reconstructive historical-critical methods.
- **Hermeneutical ethics** - interpretation is morally laden; the ethic of interpretation matters for truth.
- **Interpretive formation** - reading practices shape readers; implications for pedagogy and ecclesial formation.
- **Rule of faith** - implicit appeal to ecclesial norms as checks on purely philosophical hermeneutics.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "creational hermeneutic" in methodological discussions.
 - As a **polemic** against secular or postmodern hermeneutics in evangelical and Reformed methodological debates.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking theological anthropology, epistemology, and biblical interpretation (less a how-to exegesis manual than a foundational rationale).
