### TITLE
Accommodation and Incarnation - essay by Stephen Williams in The Trustworthiness of God: Perspectives on the Nature of Scripture (2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed apologetic and doctrine of Scripture conversation; book collects conservative and ecumenical responses to challenges about scriptural reliability and the nature of divine revelation.
 - Williams writes from a broadly Reformed perspective, interacting with historical Protestant dogmatics and twentieth-century treatments of revelation (Calvin, Warfield, Barth, etc.).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture's human forms are best understood through an **incarnational analogy**: God accommodates divine speech to finite human modes without forfeiting truthfulness or authorial intent.
 - The theological problem: how to hold both divine transcendence and propositional, trustworthy revelation in Scripture without reducing revelation to mere human projection or making God's speech unintelligible.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Define accommodation as God's intentional condescension: using human languages, categories, and culturally conditioned modes to convey divine truth.
 - Argue for an **analogy with the Incarnation**: just as the Word became truly human while remaining truly divine, divine speech can assume human literary and conceptual forms while remaining truly revelation.
 - Distinguish accommodation from debasement: accommodation does not imply error or mere cultural adaptation that undermines truth-claims.
 - Show how this analogy safeguards both **authorial divine intent** and **human linguistic mediation**; insist that Scripture's human features are not detachable additions but essential to how God chose to reveal.
 - Address objections:
 - Against radical accommodationism that relativizes doctrinal content.
 - Against a strictly univocal divine-language model that ignores human mediation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Calvin's explicit doctrine of accommodation (noted and employed).
 - B. B. Warfield on inspiration and plenary verbal concepts; critiques and appropriation.
 - Karl Barth's stress on the Word made flesh and the priority of Christ as revelation; Williams uses Barth's Christology to ground the analogy while critiquing Barth on certain epistemic moves.
 - Secondary interaction with modern hermeneutical concerns (historicism, reader-response tendencies).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Scripture (inspiration, authority, trustworthiness), Christology (incarnation as analogue), Trinity (implict in doctrine of divine speech), hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - Williams's theological center: Scripture is reliably divine precisely because God chose to speak incarnationally-truth mediated in human words rather than bypassing them.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong formal use of the Incarnation as the governing analogy for understanding accommodation, not merely as an illustration but as a structural principle for doctrine of Scripture.
 - Emphasis on the continuity of divine intent: accommodation is purposeful, not apologetic capitulation to culture.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects radical accommodationists who reduce revelation to conditioned human expression; insists on propositional commitment and authorial intentionality.
 - Counters a naïve literalism that ignores genre, metaphor, and human linguistic constraints.
 - Dialogues with Barth: affirms the centrality of Christ but resists non-propositional readings that deny Scripture's historical truth claims.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys "incarnational analogy" as a theological category for doctrine of Scripture more systematically than many predecessors.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Taken up in Reformed circles as a clarifying move to defend inerrancy/trustworthiness while allowing human form; cited in subsequent conservative treatments that seek a middle path between fundamentalism and liberalism.
 - Useful to evangelical and confessional theologians pressing for a biblically faithful yet hermeneutically sensitive doctrine of Scripture.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact theological grammar for pastors and scholars to hold divine transcendence and human mediation together; pedagogically valuable for teaching doctrine of revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation** - God's condescending mode of speaking using human language, concepts, and forms to make revelation accessible.
- **Incarnational analogy** - The structural parallel that the Word becoming flesh provides for understanding Scripture's divine-human character.
- **Divine speech / fiat** - Emphasis on God as speaking agent; Scripture as record of divine speech enacted in human media.
- **Trustworthiness (vs. inerrancy)** - Williams frames the goal as reliable divine testimony rather than merely proving mechanical inerrancy.
- **Propositional content** - The claim that Scripture carries genuine truth-claims and doctrinal propositions despite human modes.
- **Human mediation** - Literary, cultural, and linguistic features that shape how revelation is expressed; not accidental but chosen by God.
- **Anthropomorphism / anthropopathism** - Treated as instances of accommodation, not literal ascriptions to God.
- **Authorial intent** - Stress on divine intentionality behind accommodation; authorial unity across human diversity.
- **Calvinian precedent** - Use of Calvin's doctrine of accommodation as classical warrant.
- **Barthian Christology** - Used as both resource and corrective; Christ as foundational revelation, shaping how Scripture functions.
- **Hermeneutical balance** - Methodological posture between naïve literalism and relativizing historicism.
- **Genre and form criticism** - Recognized as necessary tools for discerning accommodated modes.
- **Verbal plenary inspiration (qualified)** - Affirmed in spirit: Scripture's words are authoritative as God's chosen vehicles, while noting human linguistic contingency.
- **Analogy vs. identity** - Key distinction: Scripture is analogically, not univocally, like the Incarnation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for accommodation articulated by a Reformed theologian who links it to Christology.
- As a **polemic** against both radical accommodationism/liberal reductionism and naïve literalism.
- As an **exegetical model / hermeneutical pivot**: justifies close attention to genre and historical form while maintaining doctrinal confidence.
