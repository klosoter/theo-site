### TITLE
**The God of Faith and Reason: Foundations of Christian Theology - Robert Sokolowski**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Catholic theological philosophy (early 21st century); Sokolowski writes as a Thomist shaped by phenomenological method (Husserlian descriptive phenomenology) addressing post-war debates over natural theology, revelation, and the credibility of metaphysics.
 - Engages both classical scholasticism and modern critics (notably Barthian suspicion of natural theology).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - It is possible and necessary to articulate a Christian theology in which **faith and reason are mutually illuminating**: God as transcendent personal subject is intelligible to human reason by virtue of analogical knowledge grounded in created being, without collapsing divine otherness.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes a phenomenological/descriptive method for theological metaphysics: begin with the givenness of created reality and human acts of knowing.
 - Argues for a Thomistic account of **analogia entis** (analogy of being) as the proper way to speak about God: human predicates apply analogically, not univocally nor purely equivocally.
 - Critiques both extremes:
 - Against fideism/analogia fidei extremes: rejects the view that divine disclosure alone obliterates rational access to God.
 - Against rationalistic reduction: rejects claims that God is simply another being among beings or fully captured by speculative proofs.
 - Develops implications for doctrines of revelation, attributes of God, and the structure of theological language.
 - Concludes by situating theology as disciplined reason shaped by faith's object (God as personal, triune).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Thomas Aquinas (primary resource for analogical doctrine), Augustine, Anselm.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Karl Barth (critic of analogia entis), modern Catholic theologians and analytic philosophers of religion.
 - Methodological engagement with phenomenologists (Husserlian descriptive accounts).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and natural theology, doctrine of God (attributes, transcendence, immanence), analogical predication, participation and being (esse), implications for Trinitarian theology and Christology by way of method rather than detailed dogmatic treatment.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Theology must secure God's otherness while vindicating the intelligibility of divine reality to human reason: properly understood analogical knowledge (grounded in created being and disciplined by revelation) preserves both faith and reason.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses **descriptive phenomenology** to reframe Thomistic metaphysics: attention to how being and predication present themselves in experience as the basis for theological claims.
 - Strong insistence that God is primarily a **personal subject**, and that talk of God must respect this subjectivity while allowing metaphysical predication.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects radical Barthian anti-natural theology (analogia fidei in exclusive form) by showing that some rational knowledge of God is both possible and theologically necessary.
 - Corrects rationalist or reductionist natural theology that treats God as merely another existent object.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tightens the phenomenological description of **analogy** (how predicates function in lived cognition) rather than relying on purely scholastic syllogistic formulations.
 - Emphasizes the interplay between **participation** and **ontological asymmetry** (creaturely dependence vs divine aseity).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Catholic philosophical-theological circles for clarity and methodical repair of Thomism; cited in contemporary debates about natural theology and analytic theology.
 - Ecumenical impact: used as a constructive interlocutor with Protestant theologians who worry about the legitimacy of analogia entis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, methodical model for integrating phenomenology and classical theism; valuable for teaching doctrine of God, natural theology, and ecumenical discussions about faith/reason tensions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)** - central thesis: predicates of being apply analogically between God and creatures; secures intelligible talk about God without identity.
- **Analogia fidei (analogy of faith)** - contrasted with analogia entis; Sokolowski resists making this the sole principle (i.e., he resists a purely fideistic hermeneutic).
- **Descriptive phenomenology** - methodological lens: describe how being and divine-related predication are given in experience before theorizing.
- **Analogy of predication** - how language about God participates in creaturely predicates with proper adjustment for transcendence.
- **Participation** - creaturely being participates in divine being; used to ground analogy without ontological collapse.
- **Esse (being/existence)** - focal metaphysical category, treated phenomenologically as the basis for analogical knowledge.
- **Divine transcendence / aseity** - insists on God's radical otherness while avoiding epistemic nihilism about God.
- **Natural theology** - defended in a qualified Thomistic form; reason has legitimate access to signs of God.
- **Revelation** - ultimate corrective and fulness for theological knowledge; revelation and reason are complementary.
- **God-as-subject** - theological anthropology of God emphasizes personhood, agency, relationality.
- **Ontological asymmetry** - creature/divine distinction that structures analogy and prevents equivocation.
- **Critique of fideism** - argument that denying analogical access impoverishes doctrine and dialogue.
- **Methodological synthesis** - fusion of Thomistic metaphysical insight with phenomenological attention to givenness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary explicitation of analogia entis (terminology and contours).
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates opposing strong forms of analogia fidei/fideism and rationalist reductionism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on doctrine of God, natural theology, and theological method, supplying a phenomenologically informed Thomistic model.
