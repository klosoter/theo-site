### TITLE
"The Love of God: Its Place, Meaning and Function in Systematic Theology" - Kevin J. Vanhoozer, in The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (1997)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century revisionary systematic theology: post-Barthian and postliberal conversations, renewed interest in Trinitarian retrieval and hermeneutics. Cambridge Companion aimed to map major loci and methods; Vanhoozer writes as an evangelical/analytic-continental interlocutor attentive to doctrinal method.
- **Central thesis**
 - **God's love must be theologically central but properly located:** not a sentimental attribute divorced from Trinitarian being, nor simply an external mode of divine action, but the Trinitarian-relational ground and normative function for doctrine and Christian life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies the distinction between love as an **attribute** (one of God's properties) and love as **relational/ontological** (constitutive of the Triune life).
 - Recounts and evaluates methodological maxims about reading God: notably **Rahner's Rule** and **Barth's reformulation** (see below) as ways to relate the economic to the immanent Trinity.
 - Argues for a doctrine of God's love that integrates:
 - **Revelation**: love as communicative - disclosed in Scripture and in Christ.
 - **Trinity**: love as intradivine relation (perichoresis) that grounds saving action.
 - **Soteriology & Ethics**: love as the motive and model for election, atonement, ecclesial life, and moral formation.
 - Counters sentimentalism and moral reductionism by showing how love is doctrinally mediated (Christocentric and Trinitarian).
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), Karl Barth (Barth's critique/reformulation), classical Augustinian and Thomistic resources; contemporary systematicians recovering Trinitarianism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, revelation, Christology, atonement/soteriology, ecclesiology, divine attributes, moral theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Vanhoozer locates **God's love** as the doctrinal pivot: a Trinitarian, revelatory, and functional principle that orders dogma and Christian praxis without collapsing the economic into the immanent improperly.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats love as both *ontological* (intra-Trinitarian relations) and *performative* (God's self-communication in revelation and redemption).
 - Marries doctrinal precision with a hermeneutic of communicative action: love is what God says and does, not merely what God is described as feeling.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - **To Rahner:** affirms Rahner's intuition that revelation bears on God's inner life but warns against an uncritical identity that effaces the distinction between God's immanent being and historical self‑revelation.
 - **To Barth:** appreciates Barth's safeguarding of divine freedom and the priority of God's act, yet argues Barth can underplay how love names the inner Trinitarian life that coheres God's acts.
 - Vanhoozer thus seeks a mediated posture: use Rahner's hermeneutical move with Barthian caution about epistemic limits.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasizes **love-as-communication** (speech-act resonance) so doctrine is both propositional and performative: confessing God's love participates in God's speech and salvific action.
- **Reception & influence**
 - Adopted in evangelical and Reformed teaching as a corrective to impersonal attribute lists; influential for integrating Trinitarian theology with ethical and pastoral concerns.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact methodological model for placing love at the center of systematic theology without collapsing doctrinal distinctions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Love of God** - the central theological category Vanhoozer defends as both attribute and relational ground.
- **Trinitarian love** - love as constitutive of Father-Son-Spirit relations (perichoresis), not merely an effectual property.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history (revelation, redemption); primary locus where love is manifested.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inner being; Vanhoozer argues it must be inferred carefully from economic revelation.
- **Rahner's Rule** - the methodological maxim that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity (and vice versa); used as a hermeneutical warrant for speaking of God's inner life from revelation.
- **Barth's reformulation** - Barth stresses the priority of God's act and warns against collapsing immanent being into economic acts; Vanhoozer treats Barth as corrective to Rahner while using his insight about divine freedom.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling of divine persons; the ontological locus of Trinitarian love.
- **Revelation / Communication** - love as God's communicative self-giving in Scripture and Christ; doctrine as participatory speech-act.
- **Kenosis** - self‑emptying as an expression of Trinitarian love in Christ's incarnation and atonement.
- **Soteriology / Atonement** - love frames motives and models for election, substitution, and reconciliation.
- **Divine attributes** - Vanhoozer reframes attributes so love orders and interprets others (holiness, justice, freedom).
- **Theological method** - love as organizing principle that mediates between doctrinal loci and hermeneutical rules.
- **Ethical implication** - God's love as normative for Christian practice and communal life.
- **Doctrinal performativity** - confession of God's love participates in the divine communicative act.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for locating love within Trinitarian ontology and systematic frameworks.
- As a **polemic** or corrective in debates between Rahnerian retrievals and Barthian critiques of economic/immanent Trinity relations.
- As an **exegetical-model** to read Scripture and Christology through the lens of divine communicative love.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in syllabi and lectures connecting doctrine, worship, and ethics.
