### TITLE
"Anthropology" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright). 
Entry-length, biblical-theological treatment of human nature from a conservative Reformed perspective.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed theological milieu; oriented to seminary readers and pastors seeking a concise, bibliographically aware survey that integrates biblical theology with confessional concerns.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** articulates a biblically grounded Reformed view of human nature that resists both Greek/Platonic dualisms and modern reductionisms; locates human identity in a psychophysical unity ordered to covenant, sin, and eschatological renewal.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of biblical vocabulary (Hebrew nephesh, ruach; Greek psyche, pneuma) and canonical usage emphasizing functional overlap rather than sharp ontological trichotomy.
 - Rejection of Platonic/Cartesian bifurcation and modern materialistic reduction; defense of an integrative view in which body and soul/spirit jointly constitute the human person.
 - Treatment of origin of the soul and transmission of sin with critique of both creationism and traducianism options, concluding that a Reformed account must explain inherited corruption and God's providential role.
 - Eschatological horizon: the bodily resurrection and new creation shape the normative understanding of human nature and destiny.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** engages Scripture primarily, dialogues with patristic and medieval debates, Reformation sources (broadly Calvinian concerns), modern philosophical challenges (Cartesian dualism, materialism), and contemporary evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** anthropology, imago Dei, original sin (transmission and guilt), soteriology (union with Christ), Christology (incarnation impacts anthropology), and eschatology (resurrection, new creation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** human nature is best understood biblically as a unified, embodied creature whose identity and destiny are governed by covenantal relations with God - ruined by sin and restored in Christ unto embodied resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Biblical-theological method:** prioritizes canonical patterns (Genesis-Psalms-Paul) over speculative metaphysics; reads pneuma/psyche/nephesh in their scriptural milieus.
- **Emphasis on eschatology:** anthropology is interpreted through the lens of resurrection and new creation rather than abstract metaphysical categories.
- **Correction to predecessors:** pushes back against both Platonic/trichotomous legacies and modern Cartesian separations; corrects materialist reductions that ignore biblical personhood.
- **Terminological restraint:** favors speaking of **psychophysical unity** and functional distinctions (soul/spirit) rather than multiplying ontological substances.
- **Reception and influence:** widely used in Reformed seminaries as a concise, conservative reference; influential among those seeking to ground pastoral anthropology in Scripture and covenant theology.
- **Enduring value:** clear, compact resource for teaching and polemics; models how to integrate exegetical sensitivity with confessional commitments and contemporary philosophical awareness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychophysical unity:** human person as a unity of body and nonmaterial life-principle; avoids substance-dualism.
- **Dichotomy:** favored framework distinguishing body and soul/spirit but refusing to divorce them ontologically; emphasizes functional overlap.
 - Contrasts with **Trichotomy** (body/soul/spirit as three distinct substances), which Gaffin critiques as insufficiently scriptural and philosophically influenced.
- **Soul (nephesh / psyche):** biblical usage often denotes the living person, appetite, life; not a detachable "ghost."
- **Spirit (ruach / pneuma):** the relational, responsive dimension oriented to God; distinction from soul is functional and contextual.
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** relational/covenantal capacity for God-directed knowledge, righteousness, and dominion - not a separable immaterial core.
- **Origin of the soul:** discussion framed between **Traducianism** and **Creationism**.
 - Gaffin examines both, emphasizing the need to account for inherited corruption and divine providence; leans toward a solution consonant with Reformed emphases on corporate descent and covenantal solidarity.
- **Traducianism:** view that soul (and body) are derived from parents; used to explain transmission of original sin and corporate solidarity.
- **Creationism (of souls):** view that God creates each soul directly; raises questions about transmission of sin and immediacy of divine action.
- **Original sin / inherited corruption:** anthropological account must explain how sin is transmitted and why the human will is radicalized apart from divine grace.
- **Resurrection / eschatological anthropology:** human destiny is embodied renewal; shapes normative claims about personhood and the fate of body and soul.
- **Anti-reductionism:** critique of materialistic accounts that locate personhood solely in brain processes.
- **Covenantal anthropology:** human identity and responsibility are mediated through federal/headship structures (Adam/Christ).

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for imago Dei, psychophysical unity, and Reformed anthropological basics in classrooms and sermon preparation.
- As a **polemic and exegetical model** against trichotomous and reductionist accounts, deployed in debates over Trichotomy vs Dichotomy and Traducianism vs Creationism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology to soteriology and eschatology: useful for integrating Christology, original sin, and resurrection in curricula.
