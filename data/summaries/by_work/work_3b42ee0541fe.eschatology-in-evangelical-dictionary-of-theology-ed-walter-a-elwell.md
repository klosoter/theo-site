### TITLE
Eschatology - Anthony A. Hoekema (Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, ed. Walter A. Elwell)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century Reformed evangelical milieu; contribution to a popular academic reference (Evangelical Dictionary of Theology).
 - Responds to debates sparked by C. H. Dodd (realized eschatology), Oscar Cullmann (inaugurated eschatology), and renewed interest in millennial typologies and dispensationalism in evangelicalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Eschatology must hold together the **realized** (present) aspects of Christ's kingdom with its **future** consummation; both dimensions are doctrinally necessary and scripturally attested.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of major eschatological motifs in Scripture (kingdom, resurrection, judgment, new creation).
 - Critique of one-sided positions:
 - Excessive realized eschatology collapses the future hope into present experience and undermines final resurrection/judgment.
 - Radical futurism or dispensational separation postpones biblical promises and fragments biblical unity.
 - Defense of a covenantal, incarnational center: Christ's person and work inaugurate the kingdom now; the consummation (parousia, resurrection, final judgment, new creation) remains future and decisive.
 - Assessment of millennial positions (premillennialism, postmillennialism, amillennialism) with theological and exegetical markers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages, implicitly or explicitly: C. H. Dodd, Oscar Cullmann, historic Reformed theologians, dispensational and premillennial advocates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (relevance of the person and work of Christ for eschatology), kingdom of God, resurrection (bodily), final judgment, new creation, covenant theology, ecclesiology (church as present manifestation of kingdom), parousia, millennium debates.
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema centers eschatology on the **already/not-yet** of Christ's reign: ethically transformative present hope grounded in an assured, bodily, and cosmic future consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear, pastoral-academic synthesis: insists on both the present spiritual realities and the future, bodily fulfillment-especially bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal.
 - Roots eschatology in Christ's person (incarnation and work) rather than primarily in prophetic timetable or national promises.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects the excesses of Dodd-style realized eschatology by reasserting finality of resurrection, judgment, and new creation.
 - Contrasts with dispensational futurism by defending covenant continuity between Israel and the church and by resisting sharp ontological separations of present and future promises.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Uses and popularizes the language of **inaugurated eschatology** and **already/not-yet** as mediating categories for evangelical readers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles for balanced critique of both extremes and for an accessible theological synthesis.
 - Frequently cited in seminary instruction as a reliable concise statement of covenantal/inaugurated eschatology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a pedagogical bridge: concise survey, pastoral sensitivity, and a clear hermeneutical stance useful for preaching, teaching, and further academic work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Realized eschatology** - emphasis on the present fulfillment of eschatological promises in Christ and the Spirit; Hoekema warns against reducing all eschatological hope to present experience.
- **Future eschatology** - emphasis on consummation (parousia, resurrection, final judgment, new creation) that remains objectively future.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / Already-not-yet** - the hermeneutical synthesis Hoekema endorses: kingdom begun in Christ, consummated at his return.
- **Parousia** - Christ's future bodily return; central to Hoekema's insistence on future vindication and consummation.
- **Bodily resurrection** - doctrinal non-negotiable; anchors personal eschatological hope and final judgment.
- **Millennium** - category examined historically (premillennialism, postmillennialism, amillennialism); Hoekema evaluates these in light of Christocentric and covenantal criteria.
 - Sub-contrast: **Dispensational premillennialism** (distinct Israel/church divide) vs **historic/covenantal positions** (continuity).
- **Kingdom of God** - both present rule (spiritual, ecclesial effects) and future consummation (cosmic restoration).
- **Final judgment** - eschatological event ensuring moral accountability and the establishment of God's just order.
- **New creation** - cosmic renewal; not merely individual immortality but restoration of heaven and earth.
- **Covenant continuity / discontinuity** - Hoekema favors continuity (fulfillment in Christ) and critiques radical discontinuity in dispensational schemes.
- **Intermediate state** - recognized but subordinate to the ultimate bodily resurrection and final state.
- **Typology / fulfillment** - theological method stressing Christ as fulfillment of covenantal promises.
- **Millennial typology** - used as a diagnostic for reading Revelation and prophetic literature in a Christ-centered frame.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: succinct evangelical-Reformed definition of key eschatological categories.
 - Polemic: corrective against both extreme realized eschatology and dispensational futurism.
 - Exegetical model: a Christocentric, covenantal guideline for interpreting kingdom, resurrection, and apocalyptic texts.
 - Conceptual pivot: serves in curricula as the standard evangelical articulation of inaugurated eschatology.
