### TITLE
The Works of William Perkins (multi-volume collection) - selections focused on Divine Decrees: Election and Reprobation

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 16th-early 17th century English Puritan/Reformed milieu (Cambridge); Perkins (1558-1602) writes against Roman Catholic, humanist, and nascent Arminian tendencies; his collected works systematize pastoral theology, casuistry, and scholastic Reformed doctrine for English pulpit and academy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God, by an eternal, sovereign decree, ordains some to life (election) and permits or ordains others to condemnation (reprobation); this doctrine must be taught with doctrinal precision and pastoral sensitivity so that believers receive assurance and sinners are warned.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition of terms: predestination, election, reprobation, decree (eternal and efficacious).
 - Scriptural exegesis (Romans, Ephesians, John) to ground election as unconditional and eternal.
 - Causal ordering: God is first cause of election (efficient cause), Christ is the appointed means (meritorious/ procuring cause) for the elect.
 - Nature of reprobation: distinction between active/passive forms - either positive decree of passing by or permissive judgment on sin.
 - Pastoral implications: how to preach predestination, how believers attain assurance (marks and fruits), how ministers must avoid fatalism or cruelty.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and his Institutes, Augustine, continental scholastics (e.g., Peter Martyr, Bullinger), Roman Catholic polemicists, and emerging anti-Calvinist voices; heavy reliance on Pauline texts.
- **Doctrines treated:** providence, grace (efficacious/irresistible), free will (bondage of the will), Christology (particular redemption as applied to election), justification, sanctification, assurance, pastoral theology.
- **Closing line:** Perkins anchors Reformed predestination in an uncompromising divine sovereignty that is simultaneously the ground for pastoral consolation and moral urgency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **both** the absolute sovereignty of the divine decree and the necessity of pastoral, experimental signs for assurance.
 - Framing of the doctrine as a *tool for sanctification* - election is not abstract metaphysics but the motive power for devotion and holy living.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - More pastoral and applicatory than continental scholastic treatments; less speculative than some extreme determinists yet more uncompromising on divine causality than moderate Anglicans.
 - Opposes semi-Pelagian and Arminian notions of conditional election and meritorious human cooperation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized the homiletical model of the **"golden chain"** (Romans 8) as a mnemonic and theological frame for the order of salvation and election.
 - Distinguishes carefully between **active reprobation** (positive decree) and **passive permission** (God permits sin leading to condemnation), giving nuanced pastoral options.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central to English Puritan orthodoxy; shaped later Reformed divines and English nonconformity.
 - Widely used by later Calvinists as a practical manual for preaching predestination and producing assurance literature.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplifies how rigorous doctrinal conviction can be married to pastoral care and preaching craft.
 - Serves as a bridge between continental Reformed scholasticism and English pastoral Puritanism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination:** Eternal decree of God determining the eternal state of persons; the master-category for Perkins's discussion.
- **Election:** Unconditional choice of some to eternal life; ground is God's good pleasure, often articulated as efficient decree.
- **Reprobation:** The divine act/ decree by which some are passed over to condemnation; treated with distinction between active and permissive forms.
- **Decree (eternal):** The timeless counsel of God ordering all events; Perkins stresses both immutability and moral ends (God's glory).
- **Effectual calling:** The inward, supernatural summons of the elect by which they are brought to faith; inseparable from election in Perkins's order.
- **Assurance / experimental knowledge:** Practical signs (faith, repentance, sanctification) by which believers may apprehend their election; central to pastoral application.
- **Free will (bondage):** Human will is enslaved to sin before grace; Perkins rejects libertarian merit-based freedom as ground for salvation.
- **Particular redemption / atonement:** Christ's death is propitiatory and effectual for the elect; often implied in his ordering of causes.
- **Providence:** God governs means and ends; divine sovereignty extends to secondary causes without making humans mere puppets in moral responsibility.
- **Golden Chain (Romans 8):** Rhetorical/theological device used to link election, calling, justification, and glorification.
- **Active vs. Permissive reprobation:** Analytical distinction used to avoid simplistic fatalism while upholding divine culpability.
- **Pastoral casuistry:** Application of doctrine to cases of conscience, doubting believers, and public preaching.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Puritan/Reformed formulations of election and reprobation.
- As **polemic** against Arminianism, Roman Catholicism, and moralizing interpretations of grace.
- As an **exegetical-homiletical model** for preaching Romans and for producing assurance literature.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Reformed scholastic causality with pastoral experiential theology.
