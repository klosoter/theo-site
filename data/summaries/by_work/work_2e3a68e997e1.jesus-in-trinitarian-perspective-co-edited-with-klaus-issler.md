### TITLE
Jesus in Trinitarian Perspective (edited by Fred Sanders and Klaus Issler) 
Focused note: implications for the **Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - A contemporary, ecumenically-minded evangelical contribution to renewed Trinitarian theology. Arises from late 20th-early 21st century interest in recovering the Trinity as doxological, pastoral, and exegetical center for Christian doctrine and life.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To read Jesus christologically within a robust Trinitarian frame so that the Son's identity and work are intelligible only within the life of the triune God - with corollary attention to the Spirit who grounds and actualizes Jesus' messianic mission. The volume addresses the problem of Jesus-centered theology that sidelines the Spirit (Christomonism) and of theologies that domesticate the Spirit's personhood or deity.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Multi-author essays move from biblical exegesis to historical theology to systematic retrieval:
 - Biblical studies demonstrate how New Testament portrayal of Jesus presupposes the Spirit's active, divine presence (e.g., at conception, ministry, death, resurrection, and exaltation).
 - Historical-theological pieces trace patristic and medieval formulations that safeguard Spirit-personhood and deity against modalism and subordinationism.
 - Constructive theology articulates a perichoretic account: Son and Spirit are distinct persons whose mutual indwelling makes intelligible the Son's economy without negating the Spirit's full deity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic (Athanasius, Cappadocians), Augustine, Reformers (briefly), and modern interlocutors (20th-21st century theologians who shaped evangelical Trinitarian recovery). Scripture-focused contributors draw on Synoptic, Johannine, Pauline, and Luke-Acts pneumatology.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Trinity (immanent/economic distinction), Christology, Pneumatology (Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit), incarnation, resurrection, revelation, ecclesiology, soteriology (Spirit's role in applying redemption).
- **Closing line:** 
 - The theological center of gravity: Jesus' identity and work must be read within the living relations of the triune God, which simultaneously affirms the Spirit as a divine, personal agent essential to Christ's mission and the church's life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on a pneumatological lens within christology: the Spirit is not ancillary but constitutive of Jesus' messianic identity and saving action.
 - Perichoretic language is used not merely metaphysically but explanatorily - to show how Son and Spirit jointly accomplish revelation and redemption.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against Christomonistic tendencies in some evangelical theologies that minimize the Spirit's distinct agency and deity. 
 - Opposes subordinationist and modalist accounts by recovering both relational distinction and ontological equality among the persons.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Rehabilitation of "pneumatological christology" as a robust category: analyzing how Spirit activity shapes both the economic actions of the Son and the church's appropriation of salvation.
 - Applied perichoresis: a practical-theological move to connect inner-Trinitarian life with pastoral and ecclesial practice.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Received positively in circles seeking a Trinitarian corrective to individualistic and Christ-centered-only patterns; influential among younger evangelical theologians and pastors emphasizing Spirit-empowered discipleship.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a compact, interdisciplinary model linking NT exegesis, historical retrieval, and constructive theology; particularly valuable as a teaching resource on how the Spirit's personhood and deity anchor Trinitarian reading of Jesus.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (immanent/economic):** distinction used to show how inner divine relations (immanent) ground the missions of Son and Spirit (economic).
- **Perichoresis:** mutual indwelling invoked to explain relational unity without confusing persons.
- **Pneumatological Christology:** the conceptual frame insisting the Spirit's agency is constitutive for understanding Jesus' mission and identity.
- **Personhood of the Spirit:** argued for by narrative and doctrinal markers (will, speech, relational actions) against impersonal or functionalist readings.
- **Deity of the Spirit:** defended positively from scriptural attributions (works, names, divine prerogatives) and historically against subordinating schemata.
- **Economy of salvation:** how Son and Spirit cooperate in incarnation, atonement, resurrection, and application of redemption.
- **Impartation/Participation:** terms used to describe how Spirit unites believers to Christ and to the triune life.
- **Spirit and Resurrection:** emphasis on the Spirit as agent who raises Jesus (theopoetic and scriptural motif linking deity and personhood).
- **Spirit's witness:** the Spirit's role in testifying to the Son and enabling faith - theological pivot between revelation and reception.
- **Anti-Christomonism:** polemical posture directed at Christ-centered accounts that neglect pneumatological distinctiveness.
- **Subordinationism (rejection):** explicit correction of views that reduce Spirit's ontology beneath Father/Son.
- **Perichoretic ethics/pastoral:** using intra-Trinitarian relations as models for ecclesial life and ministry.
- **Hypostatic union (relationally re-read):** used to keep Christ's two natures intelligible within triune relations without collapsing persons.

How this work is used across loci:
- Definition source: as a contemporary articulation of the **Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit** within Trinitarian theology. 
- Polemic/resource: deployed against Christomonism, modalism, and pneumatological subordinationism. 
- Exegetical model: a template for NT readings that pair christological passages with pneumatological interpretive threads. 
- Conceptual pivot: a teaching aid to integrate pneumatology into systematic and pastoral theology, linking doctrine to worship and mission.
