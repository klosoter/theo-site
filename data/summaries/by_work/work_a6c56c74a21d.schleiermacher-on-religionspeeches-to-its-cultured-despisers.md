### TITLE
Schleiermacher: On Religion-Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers (Reden über die Religion an die Gebildeten unter ihren Verächtern), 1799 - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1799 amid post-Kantian German Idealism, late Enlightenment critique of religion, and Pietist pastoral concerns.
 - Aimed at the "cultured despisers" - educated skeptics who rejected traditional dogma but retained ethical and aesthetic sensibilities.
 - Intellectual matrix: Kantian epistemology, Fichtean self-consciousness, Rousseauvian emphasis on feeling; reaction against rationalist apologetics and orthodox scholasticism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Religion is fundamentally the *feeling of absolute dependence* (Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhaengigkeit) - an immediate, non-propositional consciousness rather than a system of doctrines.
 - Theological problems (including original sin and imputation) must be reframed in terms of disturbed religious feeling and the restoration of religious consciousness, not primarily forensic metaphysics.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Opening move: redefine religion as an affective, unified life-orientation, hence immune to purely intellectual refutation.
 - Diagnosis of modern unbelief: loss of immediate religious feeling due to misplaced intellectual priorities and moral corruption.
 - Anthropology and sin: human finitude yields a persistent tendency away from the absolute, producing moral disequilibrium (the experience of guilt and estrangement).
 - Soteriology: reconciliation is accomplished in a restoration of the harmonious relation to the absolute through Jesus - as exemplar, mediator of religious feeling, and focal point of communal piety.
 - Practical conclusion: religion reasserts itself in pious life, ecclesial worship, and renewed moral-attunement.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Enlightenment skeptics and rationalists; philosophical debt to Kant and Fichte; corrective to orthodox Lutheran/Reformed forensic emphases.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as inward religious consciousness), sin (original and actual as disturbance of feeling), Christology (Jesus as paradigmatic source of restored religious feeling), atonement (psychological/relational restoration rather than forensic exchange), ecclesiology and ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - Theology's center of gravity shifts from juridical propositions to the restoration of an immediate, communal consciousness of dependence on the absolute - sin and salvation are best read as disorders and healings of religious feeling.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Religion as primarily affective and relational rather than propositional or juridical.
 - Original sin characterized as a universal disturbance of religious self-consciousness and capacity for dependence, not merely legal culpability.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects classical Reformed and Lutheran forensic accounts that make justification and imputation primarily legal acts.
 - Opposes rationalist defenses that treat religion as a set of demonstrable truths; also distances from pietism that reduces religion to moralism.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence" as the constitutive datum of religion.
 - Re-interpretation of imputation: rather than forensic crediting of Christ's righteousness to believers, Schleiermacher emphasizes identification with the redeeming religious life embodied in Christ - imputation becomes participatory/transformative.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major founding text for liberal Protestant theology and modern theology of religion.
 - Provoked strong critique from orthodox defenders of forensic imputation (19th-century confessional Protestants) and later engagement by dialectical theologians.
 - Influenced modern pastoral theology, ecumenical approaches, and subsequent discussions on the psychology of religion.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how doctrines like original sin and imputation can be reframed psychologically and relationally.
 - Useful corrective to purely forensic or purely propositional accounts; valuable for pastoral, historical, and comparative theological work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence (Gefühl der Abhaengigkeit)** - religion's core datum; immediacy of relationship to the absolute.
- **Religious self-consciousness (religioeses Selbstbewusstsein)** - the person's awareness in which religion manifests.
- **Original sin** - not merely inherited legal guilt but a universal disturbance/defect in religious feeling and orientation toward the absolute.
 - Emphasis on dispositional incapacity and alienation rather than forensic condemnation.
- **Guilt / Schuld** - experienced as the felt estrangement from the absolute; psychological consciousness rather than abstract juridical status.
- **Imputation (Zurechnung)** - Schleiermacher's reinterpretation: less a forensic transfer, more a participatory identification with Christ's restored religious life.
 - Often summarized as "communion" or "participation" rather than "crediting" righteousness.
- **Atonement / reconciliation** - therapeutic, restorative process that heals the disordered religious feeling; Christ as exemplar/mediator.
- **Christ as exemplar/center** - Jesus as the paradigmatic human whose perfected religious feeling re-establishes communal access to the absolute.
- **Revelation** - inward, immediate consciousness rather than external propositional deposit.
- **Dogma vs. piety** - Schleiermacher privileges piety (religious life) over systematic dogmatic proofs.
- **Finitude / Egoism** - human limitations and self-centeredness as the root of religious disturbance.
- **Ecclesial community** - primary locus for cultivating restored religious feeling and formative religious identity.
- **Psychology of religion** - Schleiermacher as an early modern proponent of psychological analysis in theological claims.
- **Forensic vs. participatory justification** - Schliermacher leans strongly to participatory models.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "religion as feeling" and for a non-forensic reading of original sin.
 - As **polemic** against classical doctrines of imputation; a foil for defenders of forensic justification.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in historiography of modern theology - explaining the shift to subjective, existential, and psychological accounts of sin and salvation.
