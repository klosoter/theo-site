### TITLE
New Dictionary of Biblical Theology. Edited by T. Desmond Alexander and Brian S. Rosner. IVP/Apollos (evangelical academic reference), turn of the 21st century.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical scholarship seeking to reclaim and renew biblical theology as a discipline that is both critical and confessional.
 - Responds to fragmentation between historical-critical exegesis, systematic theology, and devotional readings; aimed at students, pastors, and scholars in the English-speaking evangelical world.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture must be read as a unified story with theological coherence across OT and NT; biblical theology is the discipline that traces themes, institutions and promises through redemptive history to their Christological fulfilment.
 - Addresses how to do biblical theology in a way that is exegetically rigorous yet doctrinally constructive.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - The work is a multi-author, alphabetically arranged reference of thematic and lexical articles rather than a single monograph argument.
 - Major moves:
 - Define methodological options for biblical theology (canonical, redemptive-historical, thematic, historical-critical intersection).
 - Present sustained treatments of key biblical-theological motifs (covenant, kingdom, temple, prophecy, law, wisdom, priesthood, eschatology).
 - Trace each motif across Testaments with attention to typology, fulfilment language, and hermeneutical continuity.
 - Offer practical theological implications for the church (worship, mission, ethics).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical and contemporary scholars: Vos and Old Princeton traditions, Brevard Childs (canonical criticism), Gerhard von Rad, Martin Noth, E. P. Sanders and the "New Perspective" interlocutors, Walter Brueggemann, N. T. Wright, form-critical and redaction-critical literature; uses both philology and theological synthesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant, Christology, kingdom of God, eschatology, law/torah, prophecy, wisdom, temple/priesthood, soteriology, ecclesiology, mission, typology, revelation.
- **Closing line**
 - A broad evangelical, redemptive-historical reference that seeks to map the Bible's theological architecture from promise to fulfilment and to supply exegetical/theological tools for connecting Scripture's parts into a unified Christian doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Canonical and redemptive-historical reading as default orientation: motifs are followed through Scripture with attention to how later texts reinterpret earlier ones.
 - Balance of rigorous exegesis and theological synthesis aimed at practical theological application.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived excesses of both older systematic appropriation (which ignored diachronic movement) and purely historical-critical fragmentation (which loses theological unity).
 - Less radical than some critical schools (e.g., radical form-criticism or purely literary approaches); more historically and theologically conservative than some modern critical syntheses.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tight linking of lexical study and theological motif-tracing-treatments often combine semantic work on key words with theological trajectory analysis.
 - Frequent use of "fulfilment/fulfilment-interpretation" as a hermeneutical bridge between covenants and Testaments.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical seminaries as a standard reference; praised for clarity and scope.
 - Used as a corrective and supplement by those wanting a biblically centered theology that remains academically respectable.
 - Critiqued by some for confessional presuppositions and uneven contributors' positions on contentious issues (e.g., Israel-church relations, New Perspective debates).
- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable, accessible compendium for students and pastors; durable pedagogical tool for teaching biblical-theological method and key motifs.
 - Functions as a bridge between exegesis and systematic reflection without reducing one to the other.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology** - tracing theological themes within the Bible's own historical and canonical development.
- **Canonical criticism** - reading texts in light of their place in the canon; emphasis on final form and canonical context.
- **Redemptive-historical** - focus on God's acts in history (promise, covenant, fulfilment) as the primary theological horizon.
- **Covenant** - central organizing category; treated as both historical institution and theological matrix for continuity/discontinuity.
- **Kingdom of God** - traced from prophetic/royal motifs to NT inauguration and eschatological consummation.
- **Typology / fulfilment** - method for relating persons, institutions, and events in the OT to their NT fulfilment in Christ.
- **Law / Torah** - analyzed in its covenantal function, role in Israel's life, and re-interpretation in Christ and the church.
- **Prophetic eschatology** - the future-directed dimension of prophecy and its realization in NT horizons.
- **Wisdom literature** - considered both theological and practical; its place in the canon and contribution to ethics and theology explored.
- **Temple / priesthood** - motifs traced to Christological and ecclesiological fulfilments.
- **Israel and the church** - treated with attention to continuity, typology, and diversity of evangelical positions.
- **Messianic expectation** - survey of promise patterns and their NT appropriation.
- **Ethics / holiness** - theological implications of canonical themes for Christian moral life and church practice.
- **Mission** - biblical-theological basis for mission rooted in covenant promise and eschatological hope.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: concise treatments of biblical-theological terms for classroom and sermon use.
 - Exegetical model: exemplifies how to follow motifs across Testaments to inform preaching and systematic reflection.
 - Conceptual pivot: supplies bridges for integrating OT studies, NT studies, and systematic dogmatics in curricula.
