### TITLE
Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory - Bruno Latour (2005)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in English (2005) amid Science and Technology Studies (STS) debates; follows Latour's earlier work (Laboratory Life, Science in Action). Reacts to sociology of the 20th century (Durkheimian collectivism, Marxist structuralism, positivist social science) and to postmodern critiques about fact/value distinction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The category "the social" is not an autonomous explanans; social phenomena are effects of heterogeneous networks of human and nonhuman actors ("actants"). Social explanation should be reconceived as empirical mapping of associations rather than appeal to pre-given social structures.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Critique of sociology's reification of "society" - argues that speaking of "society" as cause obscures the heterogeneous processes that produce collective phenomena.
 - Methodological program: "follow the actors" - empirically trace how associations are formed, stabilized, and maintained.
 - Ontological move: symmetry between humans and nonhumans; nonhuman entities participate as mediators/actants in networks.
 - Analytic vocabulary: translation, enrollment, black-boxing, immutable mobiles, and circulation of reference to describe how networks are built and sustained.
 - Normative implication: politics and ethics must attend to composition of collectives and delegated agency rather than abstract social forces.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Critical dialogue with classical sociologists (Durkheim, Weber, Marx), contemporaries in STS (Michel Callon, John Law), and critics of modernist separation of nature/culture. Draws on case studies from science, technology, law, and infrastructure.
- **Doctrines treated (theological relevance):** Latour does not address theological doctrines directly, but the work implicates:
 - **Creation/ontology:** distributed agency undermines strict human/nature dualisms.
 - **Providence/agency:** reconfigures how teleology and causality are ascribed in social explanation.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacramentality:** networks model communal embodiment and material mediation.
 - **Ethics and sin:** challenges systemic vs. individualistic accounts of responsibility.
- **Closing line:** Latour reframes the "social" as a precarious, contingent composition of human and nonhuman actants, forcing theology to rethink agency, mediation, and the material grounding of communal life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong methodological prescription: empirical tracing over theorizing abstract social wholes.
 - Radical flattening of ontological hierarchies: give explanatory parity to nonhuman actors.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects Durkheimian reification of society, Marxist totalizing structures, and sociologies that assume social forces as autonomous causes.
 - Contrasts with hermeneutic approaches that privilege meanings over material-semiotic processes.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Actor-network, actant, translation, immutable mobile, black-boxing, delegation, mediator vs. intermediary, circulating reference.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Limited uptake in traditional Reformed systematic circles, but growing influence in practical theology, ecological theology, sacramental studies, and constructive/reconstructive theologians who use ANT to rethink agency, materiality, and church-world relations.
 - Used by theologians critiquing social sin as an abstract "system" and by those seeking models of distributed responsibility.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes reexamination of theological categories of agency, mediation, and materiality.
 - Provides a pragmatic toolkit for case-based theological reflection on technology, environment, and institutional life.
 - Stimulates interdisciplinary dialogue between theology, STS, and ecclesial praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Actor-network:** The composite of human and nonhuman actants whose associations produce social effects; emphasis on relations, not essences.
- **Actant:** Any entity (person, thing, institution, text) that acts or can be mobilized to act; no a priori privileged human agency.
- **Translation:** The process by which actors define problems and enroll others (problematisation, interessement, enrolment, mobilization).
- **Black-boxing:** The stabilization of complex networks into apparently self-evident units (technical or conceptual) whose internal workings are no longer scrutinized.
- **Immutable mobile:** Objects or representations that can be transported and keep their form across contexts, enabling coordination (maps, standards, inscriptions).
- **Mediator vs. intermediary:** Intermediaries transmit without transformation; mediators transform, reinterpret, and produce unpredictable effects.
- **Circulating reference:** The iterative process of transforming materials and inscriptions to create durable facts or objects.
- **Symmetry principle:** Treat explanatory roles of human and nonhuman actors symmetrically in analysis.
- **Compositionism:** Normative-political stance favoring attentive assembling of collectives and their material-semiotic ties (alternative to purification or totalizing approaches).
- **Delegation:** The assignment of tasks or capacities to nonhuman entities, shifting responsibility and agency.
- **Association:** The ties binding actants; social outcomes are the effects of such associations rather than prior structures.
- **Purification (Latour's later vocabulary):** The modern tendency to separate nature and culture - ANT opposes this as analytically misleading.
- **Network tracing:** The empirical method of mapping connections, translations, and stabilizations to explain phenomena.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and sacramental theology to argue for the material mediation of grace and distributed agency.
- As a **polemic/tool** in ethics and political theology against abstract accounts of "society" or systemic evil, favoring granular responsibility and composition strategies.
- As an **exegetical model** for case studies (mission, technological practice, environmental stewardship) to map actors and their mediations.
- As a **definition source** for social ontology discussions in constructive theology and interdisciplinary STS-theology engagements.
