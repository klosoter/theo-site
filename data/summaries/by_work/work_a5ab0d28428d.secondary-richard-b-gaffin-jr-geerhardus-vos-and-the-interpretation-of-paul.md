### TITLE
Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "Geerhardus Vos and the Interpretation of Paul" - Gaffin's reading of Vosian redemptive-historical Pauline exegesis and its implications (esp. for debates over Eternal Functional Subordination).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century Reformed orthodoxy revival at Princeton; Gaffin (Princeton/Westminster) recovering Geerhardus Vos (Princeton turn-of-century) for contemporary Pauline and biblical-theological scholarship.
 - Reaction against both liberal historiography and a-theological systematicism; situated within the redemptive-historical movement and conservative Reformed exegetical retrenchment.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Vos supplies a cohesive method for reading Paul that centers on **progressive, covenantal revelation** and the redemptive-historical unfolding of Christ - a method that clarifies Pauline categories (union with Christ, imputation, eschatological fulfillment) and constrains illegitimate transfers between **economic** and **ontological** claims in Trinitarian debates (notably EFS).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Paul must be read as embedded in the history of redemption; his vocabulary (election, justification, union, covenant) points to Christ as the interpretive horizon rather than abstract ethical or metaphysical categories.
 - Theological-methodological move: Distinguish **objective/forensic** accomplishments of Christ (what Christ has done) from subjective appropriation (the Spirit's application), preserving doctrinal categories without collapsing their historical sequence.
 - Trinitarian implication: Economic relations in salvation-history do not automatically entail ontological inequality; Vos' emphasis on the history and covenantal economy resists making intra-Trinitarian functional order into ontological subordination.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Geerhardus Vos (exposition via Gaffin).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Princeton theologians (Warfield), contemporary Pauline interpreters (G. Vos critics and New Perspective proponents), and modern Trinitarian debates (EFS advocates and critics).
 - Implicit contrasts with historico-critical method and with dogmatic systems that detach Scripture from its redemptive context.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Hermeneutics/revelation (progressive, organic).
 - Covenant theology and covenant history.
 - Pauline soteriology: union with Christ, justification, imputation, sanctification, eschatology.
 - Trinity: economic vs immanent Trinity; functional roles in redemption.

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin portrays Vos as giving a rigorous, Christ-centered Pauline hermeneutic that secures redemptive history and protective limits on inferring ontological claims from economic roles, thereby shaping how Paul should inform both soteriology and Trinitarian questions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Redemptive-historical continuity:** Scripture must be read as a unified historical revelation culminating in Christ; Pauline theology is a commentary on that history.
 - **Scripture-driven categories:** The meaning of Pauline terms is anchored in their covenantal and typological place in salvation history rather than later dogmatic abstractions.
 - **Objective accomplishment vs. subjective application:** Clear twofold movement (what Christ accomplished and how the Spirit applies it) retained throughout Gaffin's reading of Vos.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against approaches that either dehistoricize Paul (abstract systematics) or fragment him into disparate ethical loci (liberal criticism).
 - Limits the use of Paul as a direct warrant for ontological claims about intra-Trinitarian subordination; counters EFS moves that read economic subordination as proof of eternal ontological ordering.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-emphasizes Vosian idioms: "organic development of revelation," "type and antitype," and "redemptive-historical categories" as normative for Pauline exegesis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed circles for restoring a Vosian hermeneutic to Pauline theology.
 - Has been invoked in contemporary debates: both as resource against EFS ontological claims and as model for a Christ-centered critique of the New Perspective.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined hermeneutical framework merging careful exegesis with dogmatic restraint; valuable for teaching Pauline theology, covenantal theology, and for adjudicating economic/ontological distinctions in Trinitarian debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-historical method**
 - Reading Scripture as progressive revelation culminating in Christ; Paul interpreted within that history.

- **Organic development of revelation**
 - The idea that later Scripture unfolds and clarifies earlier revelation without contradicting it.

- **Covenant (federal) framework**
 - Covenant history structures Paul's categories: promise/fulfillment, law/fulfillment, people of God.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Central Pauline category (source of justification, sanctification, resurrection life); interpreted historically and ontologically within salvation history.

- **Imputation / forensic justification**
 - Objective declaration grounded in Christ's accomplished obedience; distinguished from subjective appropriation by the Spirit.

- **Objective accomplishment vs subjective application**
 - Twofold movement: Christ's once-for-all work and the Spirit's ongoing application in believers.

- **Typology (type/antitype)**
 - Historical institutions and persons pointing forward to Christ as fulfillment; essential to Vosian exegesis.

- **Grammatical-historical exegesis**
 - Careful attention to language and historical setting within the redemptive-historical frame.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - Roles of Father, Son, Spirit in redemption-history; Vos/Gaffin caution: do not conflate economic roles with ontological subordination.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God's inner life; ontological equality of persons maintained in Vosian approach.

- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**
 - Debated thesis that the Son is eternally functionally subordinate to the Father; Gaffin's reading of Vos provides resources to oppose reading economic subordination as proof of ontological inferiority.

- **New Perspective on Paul (NP) - critique resource**
 - Vosian reading used to defend classical readings of justification and covenant against NP reinterpretations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a disciplined redemptive-historical hermeneutic applied to Paul.
- As a **polemic** against readings that derive ontological conclusions about the Trinity from economic relations (used in EFS debates).
- As an **exegetical model** for grounding Pauline soteriology (union, imputation, justification) in covenantal-history.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in conservative Reformed theology reconciling biblical theology and dogmatics.
