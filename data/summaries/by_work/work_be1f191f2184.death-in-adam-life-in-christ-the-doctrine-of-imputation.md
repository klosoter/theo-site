### TITLE
Death in Adam, Life in Christ: The Doctrine of Imputation - J. V. Fesko

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed scholarship engaged in renewed debate over how Adam and Christ function as corporate representatives. Responds to late‑20th and early‑21st century challenges to classical imputation (e.g., exemplarist, realist, and genetic accounts) within evangelical and Reformed circles. Positioned within confessional Reformed covenant theology and pastoral concerns about doctrine and devotion.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The work defends the classical Reformed doctrine that Adam's sin is legally imputed to his posterity and that Christ's righteousness is legally imputed to believers - grounding both imputations in covenantal representation and forensic justification rather than purely metaphysical or exemplarist schemes.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Close exegesis of key Pauline texts (notably Romans 5 and passages using logizomai/logismos) to establish the New Testament pattern of forensic imputation and representative headship.
 - Historical‑theological survey tracing patristic, medieval, Reformation, and confessional formulations (Augustine, Calvin, Westminster tradition) to show doctrinal continuity.
 - Systematic clarification: distinguishes types of imputation (guilt vs. corruption; active vs. passive obedience) and locates them within covenantal theology.
 - Polemical engagement: critiques exemplarist, purely ontological (realist) inheritance models, and certain contemporary revisionist accounts that downplay legal categories.
 - Theological synthesis: locates imputation within union with Christ and covenantal solidarity so that forensic declaration rests on a real (but non‑metaphysical) representative relation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical sources (Augustine, Calvin), Reformed scholastics and confessional standards, plus contemporary critics and Reforming advocates of non‑imputational models. Uses a mix of exegetical, historical, and doctrinal resources.
- **Doctrines treated:** Original sin, covenant theology (covenant of works/ grace), Christology (second Adam), justification (forensic/legal), union with Christ, atonement (active and passive obedience), anthropology.
- **Closing line:** The book affirms that the biblical, historical, and theological coherence of Christian soteriology depends on holding Adam and Christ as covenantal representatives whose guilt and righteousness are accounted to those whom they head.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reasserts forensic language as primary for understanding both Adamic and Christic transactions; legal imputation is not merely metaphorical but theologically central.
 - Carefully distinguishes kinds of imputation (guilt vs. corruption; active vs. passive obedience) to avoid simplistic conflations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on exemplarist readings that reduce Adam to moral example and on purely ontological accounts that speak of transmitted sin without forensic culpability.
 - Challenges revisionist proposals that separate justification too sharply from covenantal representation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes how corporate solidarity functions as the warrant for forensic declarations - union with the federal head is presented as the legal basis for imputation without collapsing into metaphysical determinism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valuable and frequently cited within contemporary Reformed circles as a concise defense of classic imputation; used in seminary courses on soteriology and covenant theology.
 - Cited in debates where evangelicals and Reformed theologians reconsider historical formulations of original sin and justification.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a corrective against both reductionist naturalistic accounts of sin and novel theologies that weaken justification's forensic character; useful for bridging exegetical work and confessional theology in teaching contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation (logizomai/logismos):** The credited accounting of moral status (guilt or righteousness) from representative head to those he represents.
- **Federal headship / representative solidarity:** Adam and Christ function as covenantal heads whose acts bind their descendants or members.
- **Forensic / forensic imputation:** Legal declaration or accounting - central category for justification and Adam/Christ transactions.
- **Guilt vs. corruption:** Distinguishes imputed guilty culpability from the inherited corrupt nature; both are related but conceptually distinct.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's righteous life credited to believers (positive righteousness necessary for justification).
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death endured for penal substitution - also imputed for forgiveness and satisfaction.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** Framework for understanding Adam's probation and Christ's mediatorial covenantal role.
- **Union with Christ:** The soteriological bond that grounds the believer's reception of Christ's imputed righteousness and the abrogation of Adamic guilt.
- **Exemplarist account:** The view that Adam functions primarily as an example; critiqued for failing to account for Pauline forensic language.
- **Realist/genetic models:** Accounts that emphasize ontological transmission of sin apart from legal imputation; set aside in favor of covenantal representation here.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration of righteousness grounded in imputed active and passive obedience of Christ.
- **Original sin:** Both inherited corruption and imputed guilt are addressed; the book defends their complementary relation.
- How the work is used:
 - As a concise definitional source for the Reformed doctrine of imputation in syllabi and lectures.
 - As a polemical resource against exemplarist and purely ontological accounts of Adam/Christ representation.
 - As an exegetical-model exemplar for reading Romans 5 and Pauline imputation language within covenant theology.
