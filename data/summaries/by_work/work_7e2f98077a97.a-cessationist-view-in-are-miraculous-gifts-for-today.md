### TITLE
A Cessationist View - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed engagement with the charismatic renewal; contribution to an edited volume addressing whether New Testament miraculous gifts continue.
 - Part of a broader Reformed recovery of classical cessationism after mid-century charismatic controversies.
- **Central thesis**
 - The charismatic, revelatory and sign gifts (tongues, prophecy, miracles in their apostolic-authenticating function) were temporary and tied to the apostolic foundation; they are not normative for the church today.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical-theological and exegetical case:
 - Distinguishes *revelatory/authenticating* gifts (extraordinary) from ordinary Spirit ministries (illumination, sanctification).
 - Argues the New Testament presents the extraordinary gifts as linked to the apostolic era and the foundation of the church (e.g., role of apostles, authentication of revelation).
 - Interprets texts on cessation (notably 1 Cor 13:8-13 and related passages) in an eschatological/functional framework: the "perfect" and the apostolic foundation mark the end of extraordinary revelatory need.
 - Theological case:
 - Emphasizes the sufficiency and finality of apostolic-witnessed revelation (canonical Scripture) as replacing the need for ongoing revelatory gifts.
 - Integrates Christology and Trinitarian concerns: miracles served the inauguration and attestation of God's redemptive acts and messengers.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiological implications:
 - Distinguishes legitimate Spirit-empowered ministry (teaching, pastoral oversight, pastoral gifts) from claims to ongoing new revelation or authoritative prophetic office.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with continuationist/charismatic proponents and with classic Reformed cessationists (Warfield, Owen, Calvinian tradition).
 - Engages contemporary kenosis debates insofar as they affect Christology and pneumatology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (baptism of the Spirit, gifts, operations)
 - Revelation and authority (apostolic witness, canonical sufficiency)
 - Ecclesiology (apostolic foundation)
 - Christology (incarnation, exaltation insofar as they shape Spirit's mission)
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's theological center of gravity: the Spirit continues to effect sanctification and illumine Scripture, but the extraordinary revelatory sign gifts served a foundational, apostolic purpose and have ceased with that foundation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong canonical/apostolic locus: cessation is grounded less in philosophical skepticism about miracles and more in the unique, historically bounded role of apostles and the completed apostolic testimony.
 - Careful pneumatological differentiation between ongoing normative operations (illumination, assurance, sanctifying presence) and temporary revelatory/authenticating gifts.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Clarifies and tightens classical Reformed cessationism against caricatures that reduce it to anti-experience rationalism; defends a robust, positive pneumatology (the Spirit's ongoing work) while denying ongoing revelatory gifts.
 - Pushes back on charismatic readings that make present subjective religious experience the primary locus of divine authority.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines the analytic move of "apostolic foundation" as the decisive category for the temporality of certain gifts.
 - Emphasizes an integrated biblical-theological reading rather than merely isolated proof-texting.
- **Reception & influence**
 - Widely cited within conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles as a staple in cessationist literature.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments of baptism of the Spirit and the role of extraordinary gifts in evangelical theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for students teaching pneumatology to show how cessationism can be framed positively (not just negation of charismatic claims) and how it ties to canonical authority and church foundation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism** - the view that certain extraordinary gifts ceased with the apostolic era; Gaffin's positive, canonical defense.
- **Continuationism** - the opposing claim that miraculous/revelatory gifts continue; treated as the interlocutor.
- **Apostolic foundation** - central category: extraordinary gifts authenticated and served the apostolic foundation; once foundation complete, their temporary role ended.
- **Revelatory/authenticating gifts** - tongues, prophecy (in the revelatory sense), apostleship, miracles as evidence of apostolic authority.
- **Normative Spirit work** - illumination, regeneration, sanctification, assurance - ongoing and distinguishable from miraculous gifts.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** - Gaffin treats the baptism historically (Pentecost and Spirit-union with Christ) and as normative for believers' union with Christ rather than a repeated charismatic 'second blessing'.
 - Contrasts with charismatic meaning of recurrent experiential baptism.
- **Canonical sufficiency** - Scripture as the completed, authoritative witness that replaces the need for ongoing revelatory gifts.
- **Eschatological/perfection motif (1 Cor 13)** - "the perfect" as marking consummation/apostolic completion; used to argue cessation of partial revelatory gifts.
- **Kenosis debates** - engaged insofar as kenotic Christologies affect understanding of divine agency and the Spirit's role; warns against kenotic moves that dilute Trinitarian attributions of power and witness.
- **Authentication** - function of miracles as signs validating messengers and revelation.
- **Illumination** - Spirit's ongoing ministry to enable apprehension of Scripture; distinct from revelatory prophecy.
- **Sanctification** - ongoing effect of the Spirit within the covenant community, not evidence of new apostolic revelation.
- **Authority of apostolic witness** - the normative center that displaces claims to ongoing canonical-level revelations.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a definitional and exegetical model for conservative Reformed pneumatology and cessationism.
 - As a polemical resource against charismatic claims to contemporary revelation while supplying a positive account of the Spirit's continuing normative work.
