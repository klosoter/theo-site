### TITLE
The Incarnation and Kenosis (in Contemporary Theological Issues, various essays) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed engagement with continental and analytic theology; response to renewed interest in kenotic Christology among evangelical and liberal theologians.
 - Situated within Frame's broader project of theological method and classical theism, addressing contemporary exegetical and philosophical proposals about Philippians 2:5-11 and the "self‑emptying" of the Son.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The alleged ontological "emptying" (ontological kenosis) of the Son is theologically untenable; the Incarnation must be understood so as to preserve the full deity of Christ, the immutability and essential attributes of God, and Chalcedonian two‑nature doctrine.
 - Accepts a form of voluntary limitation or non‑exercise of divine attributes (functional kenosis) but rejects any account that implies the Son ceased to possess divine attributes in himself.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical move: careful reading of Philippians 2; distinguishes metaphorical language of "emptied himself" from a doctrine implying loss of divine properties.
 - Theological move: articulation of the difference between possession of attributes and the exercise of attributes; defends immutability and impassibility as core to divine ontology.
 - Christological move: insists on Chalcedonian formulation - two natures, one person - and uses the communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties) to explain how divine attributes relate to the incarnate Son without ontological diminution.
 - Practical / soteriological move: argues that ontological kenosis threatens atonement, Trinity doctrine, and the worship due to Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary kenoticists and theologians proposing ontological self‑emptying (broadly: Pannenbergian, Torrance‑adjacent, some evangelical kenotic theologians).
 - Draws on classical sources: Chalcedon, Athanasius, Augustine; Reformed authorities that stress divine immutability.
 - Uses Pauline exegesis (Philippians 2) as central datum; interacts with modern exegetical literature on kenosis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (Incarnation, hypostatic union)
 - Doctrine of God (divine attributes: immutability, omniscience, omnipotence, impassibility)
 - Trinity (economic vs immanent distinctions)
 - Soteriology (implications of Christ's deity for atonement and reconciliation)
 - Biblical exegesis (Pauline theology, Philippians 2)

- **Closing line**
 - Frame locates the theological center of gravity in a **Chalcedonian, Reformed defense of the Son's full deity**, allowing only a voluntary, economic non‑use of divine attributes (functional kenosis), and rejecting any ontological diminution that would compromise the Trinity, atonement, or divine immutability.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear distinction between *possessing* divine attributes and *exercising* them; preservation of divine ontology while accounting for incarnational humility.
 - Emphasis on theological method: doctrine must cohere with biblical exegesis, metaphysical categories (immutability), and ecclesial confessions.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects ontological kenosis by diagnosing its theological costs: undermining Chalcedon, diminishing worship, and compromising soteriology.
 - Contrasts with kenotic proposals that read Philippians 2 as metaphysical description rather than as kenotic hymn using figurative language.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refinement of "functional kenosis" as theologically permissible; recommends careful use of "kenosis" to mean economic self‑limitation, not ontological loss.
 - Reframes the kenosis debate in terms of attribute possession vs exercise rather than mere semantic quarrel over "emptying."

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a corrective to speculative kenoticism.
 - Serves as a go‑to polemical resource against ontological kenosis in academic and pastoral contexts; less influential among scholars who defend more radical kenotic models.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, methodologically robust defense of classical Christology useful for teaching, confessional formulation, and critiquing popularized kenotic accounts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis**
 - General term for "self‑emptying" (Phil 2); Frame insists on careful delimitation (economic vs ontological).

- **Ontological kenosis**
 - The claim that the Son relinquished or lost divine attributes in the Incarnation; Frame rejects this as incompatible with Chalcedonian doctrine.

- **Functional (economic) kenosis**
 - Permissible claim: the Son voluntarily refrained from exercising certain divine attributes while remaining fully God.

- **Hypostatic union**
 - Central Christological category: two natures (divine and human) in one person; Frame insists this safeguards against ontological kenosis.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The sharing of properties between natures in the one person of Christ; used to explain how divine attributes are ascribed to the incarnate Son without ontological loss.

- **Divine immutability**
 - God does not change in essence; Frame invokes this to argue against any ontological self‑emptying.

- **Divine impassibility**
 - God does not suffer as God; Frame navigates this to maintain genuine human suffering of Christ without altering divine impassibility.

- **Philippians 2:5-11**
 - Primary exegetical locus for kenosis debates; Frame reads the hymn as theological/ethical, not a metaphysical inventory of divine properties.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - The economic actions of the Trinity in history; Frame allows kenosis language to describe economic relations without implying immanent Trinitarian change.

- **Atonement implications**
 - Concern that ontological kenosis undermines the efficacy of the atonement by compromising the divine nature of the Redeemer.

- **Possession vs exercise of attributes**
 - Key analytic pair: one may possess attributes (ontological) but voluntarily refrain from exercising them (functional).

- **Chalcedonian orthodoxy**
 - The doctrinal standard Frame defends as the proper guardrail for interpreting kenosis.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing functional vs ontological kenosis.
- As a **polemic** against contemporary ontological kenotic proposals, especially in Reformed circles.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 with theological caution and doctrinal constraints.
