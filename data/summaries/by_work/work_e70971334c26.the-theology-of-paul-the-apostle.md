### TITLE
**The Theology of Paul the Apostle** - James D. G. Dunn (1998)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century Pauline studies shaped by Sanders, the New Perspective on Paul (NPP), and renewed interest in Second Temple Judaism.
 - Dunn synthesizes decades of exegesis (incl. his earlier Baptism in the Holy Spirit) into a full Pauline theology attentive to salvation history and the Spirit.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The center of Paul is not a single slogan like justification, but **Spirit-mediated participation in Christ** within the eschatological people of God. Justification is crucial yet primarily **ecclesiological-entry** and polemical, not the whole soteriological core.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - From Pauls call and gospel to the person and work of Christ.
 - The human plight in Adam and the **gospel of salvation**.
 - **Justification** and the **Law** reframed by NPP: works of Law as boundary markers.
 - **The Spirit** as the experiential power of new life, ecclesial identity, and moral transformation.
 - **The Church** as the Spirit-indwelt body; ethics as the Spirit-empowered fulfillment of the Law.
 - **Eschatology** as already/not yet, climaxing in resurrection and new creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Sanders, Schweitzer, Bultmann, Kasemann; converses with Wright, Martyn; interacts with Ridderbos, Cranfield, Moo, Westerholm as critics of NPP emphases.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (reception, indwelling, gifts, sanctification), **Soteriology** (justification, union, adoption), **Eschatology** (resurrection, new creation), **Ecclesiology**, **Bibliology** (Spirit and revelation), **Christology** (Spirit and resurrection designation).
- **Closing line**
 - Pauls theology coheres as **eschatological participation in Christ by the Spirit**, forming a transethnic people whose life anticipates new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The **Spirit** as the linchpin of participation, assurance, ethics, and ecclesial identity.
 - **Justification** chiefly about covenant membership and unity of Jew and Gentile; transformation rooted more in union/Spirit than in a forensic construct.
 - Strong **already/not yet** eschatology: the Spirit as arrabon and firstfruits of resurrection.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against a solely **forensic center**: justification is vital but not the systematic hub.
 - Against readings of **works of the Law** as generic moral effort; marks them as identity-boundary practices (circumcision, food laws, days).
 - Moderates **apocalyptic rupture** (Martyn) by embedding it in salvation history and temple/new-exodus motifs.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - **Boundary markers** as a hermeneutical key to Pauls polemics.
 - **Participation-in-Christ through the Spirit** as the primary soteriological dynamic.
 - Baptism as **Spirit incorporation**, not a second-blessing scheme.
- **Reception / influence**
 - Catalyzed NPP debates; widely read across traditions. Reformed critics contest the construal of justification and imputation; many nonetheless adopt Dunns pneumatological and ecclesial insights.
 - Influential for Pentecostal/charismatic scholarship on Pauls Spirit theology; standard reference in seminary curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a balanced, text-driven map of Paul that integrates exegesis, Second Temple context, and theology, especially on **pneumatology and ecclesiology**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Participation in Christ**
 - The believers identity is corporate, relational, and Spirit-mediated; union governs ethics and assurance.
- **Justification by faith**
 - Law-court imagery retained but aimed at **covenant inclusion**; Dunn resists classic imputation frameworks and stresses ecclesial unity.
- **Works of the Law / boundary markers**
 - Circumcision, food laws, days as ethnic-identity practices; Pauls critique protects Gentile inclusion without Torah proselytism.
- **The Spirit and resurrection of Christ**
 - Rom 1:4; 8:11: the Spirit designates and raises Jesus; resurrection inaugurates the new age.
- **Resurrection and new creation**
 - The Spirits firstfruits/arrabon guarantees bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal; ethics anticipate new creation.
- **Baptism in/with the Holy Spirit**
 - Initial incorporation into Christ at conversion-baptism; no subsequent rite is required for fullness.
- **Regeneration and indwelling**
 - New life, adoption, Abba-cry, and moral empowerment; the temple motif relocates holiness to the community.
- **Spirit and revelation/illumination**
 - 1 Cor 2: the Spirit unveils Gods wisdom; Scripture is read within the new-covenant community in the Spirit.
- **Union with Christ and the Spirit**
 - En Christo language realized by the indwelling Spirit; the body-of-Christ metaphor frames gifts and unity.
- **Law and the Spirit**
 - The righteous requirement of the Law fulfilled by love through the Spirit; contrasts flesh/Spirit, not Torah/gospel per se.
- **Corporate solidarity: Adam/Christ**
 - Sin and grace as realm-transfer; shapes hamartiology and participation soteriology.
- **Already/not yet eschatology**
 - Present possession, future consummation; explains tension between assurance and struggle.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for Pauline pneumatology and participation across loci.
 - As a **polemic interlocutor** on justification, imputation, and NPP boundary-marker claims.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul within Second Temple Judaism and salvation history.
 - As a **teaching scaffold** for integrating ecclesiology, ethics, and eschatology under the Spirit.
