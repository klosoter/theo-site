### TITLE
Of Schism - John Owen (mid-17th century Puritan/Independent tract; Interregnum England)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Mid-17th century England (Interregnum). Owen writes as a prominent Puritan theologian and leader among the Independents/Congregationalists during intense disputes over church government, toleration, and separation. Engages controversies between **Presbyterians, Independents (Congregationalists), Separatists/Brownists**, and Roman claims to ecclesiastical unity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Schism is a grave sin and unlawful breach of the church's communion and peace; legitimate separation is narrowly circumscribed and must be judged by scriptural and pastoral criteria. Owen seeks to correct radical separatism without validating false church monopolies.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition: precise distinctions between **schism**, **heresy**, and ordinary correction or dissent.
 - Biblical proof: New Testament injunctions to unity, Paul's warnings against factionalism, Christ as the head who establishes church peace.
 - Ecclesial criteria: what constitutes the visible, covenantal communion of the church and when departure is sinful.
 - Practical application: pastoral remedies, discipline, censures, and the limited circumstances where separation may be tolerated.
 - Concluding judgments: moral culpability of voluntary separation versus permitted withdrawal when the gospel is fundamentally corrupted.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (especially Pauline epistles), Augustine and Reformation authorities (Calvin implicitly), contemporary Separatists and ecclesiastical parties in England, occasional engagement with Roman claims about the One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (visible vs invisible church; marks of the church), covenant and communion, authority and discipline of the church, conscience and Christian liberty, ethics of charity and unity.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Owen balances a robust commitment to **visible, covenantal communion and church discipline** with a careful restraint on separatism - schism is primarily an illicit rupture of ecclesial peace and must be resisted unless the gospel itself is decisively corrupted.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Treats schism as a moral and covenantal breach more than merely a polity dispute; locates primary evil in the willful severing of communion and love.
 - Distinguishes lawful ecclesiastical discipline from illicit divisions, stressing corrective charity and patience.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects extreme Separatists who treat any national or mixed congregation as illegitimate - Owen forbids easy withdrawal.
 - Simultaneously resists Roman and hierarchical claims that would equate unity with institutional conformity to a single visible jurisdiction (interaction with the *One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church* concept).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced taxonomy: clear tripartite distinction among **schism (relational breach), heresy (doctrinal deviation), and separation (external withdrawal)** - with different moral and ecclesial consequences.
 - Emphasis on *unlawful separation* as a distinct category of sin.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among English and later Anglo-American Reformed and Congregationalist circles for pastoral ecclesiology and polemics against sectarianism.
 - Cited in Reformation-era and post-Reformation debates on church unity and the limits of dissent; used by later theologians defending disciplined communion without ecclesial absolutism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models disciplined, pastoral theology of unity: helpful for teaching on the **Nature And Marks Of The Church**, corporate discipline, and practical answers to schism in mixed-church contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Schism:** voluntary, illicit breaking of ecclesial communion and peace; morally culpable unless grave gospel corruption exists.
- **Separation:** external withdrawal from communion; may be lawful only in narrowly defined cases.
- **Heresy:** doctrinal error; distinct from schism though often related in practice.
- **Visible Church:** the covenant community manifest in worship, sacraments, and discipline - locus for Owen's practical judgments.
- **Invisible Church:** true elect known to God; used to limit absolutist judgments about individual salvation.
- **Marks of the Church:** truth of doctrine, proper administration of sacraments, and exercise of discipline; Owen uses these to adjudicate legitimacy (ties to Nature And Marks Of The Church).
- **Church Discipline / Censure:** legitimate means to correct and restore, preventing schism by redress within communion.
- **Lawful Authority:** scripturally ordered governance that may restrain schism while avoiding tyranny.
- **Communion of Saints:** relational bond whose breach constitutes schism.
- **Catholicity (One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church):** Owen affirms a genuine catholicity grounded in gospel truth rather than institutional monopoly.
- **Conscience / Liberty:** conscience is honored but not a carte blanche for unilateral separation.
- **Purity vs Unity tension:** balance of preserving gospel purity and maintaining visible unity.
- **Unlawful Separation:** Owen's technical phrase for disallowed exit from church fellowship.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source:** standard Reformed articulation of "schism" and "unlawful separation."
 - **Polemic:** used against Separatists/Brownists and later sectarian movements to justify disciplined corporate boundaries.
 - **Exegetical / ecclesiological model:** applied in Reformation Ecclesiology debates to mediate between catholic unity claims and congregational independence.
