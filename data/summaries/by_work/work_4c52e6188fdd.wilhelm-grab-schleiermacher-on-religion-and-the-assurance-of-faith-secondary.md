### TITLE
Wilhelm Gräb, "Schleiermacher on Religion and the Assurance of Faith" - a historical-theological reading of Friedrich Schleiermacher on Christian assurance and perseverance

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century German theological scholarship engaging 19th-century Protestant dogmatics.
 - Locates Schleiermacher within post-Kantian philosophy, Pietism, and the rise of modern liberal theology.
 - Conversation with Reformed and Lutheran debates about certainty of salvation and pastoral care.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gräb argues that Schleiermacher reconceives assurance not as a forensic, propositional guarantee of salvation but as a form of **religious self-certainty** rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence, ecclesial mediation, and moral transformation - and that this has consequences for understanding perseverance.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical grounding: situates Schleiermacher against Calvinist assurance and Enlightenment skepticism.
 - Exegetical move: close reading of Schleiermacher's Glaubenslehre and related lectures to trace his account of Gewissheit (assurance).
 - Theological synthesis: shows how assurance is experiential, mediated, and ethical rather than purely epistemic or forensic.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences: links assurance to perseverance conceived as sustained religious life and moral-historical continuity rather than juridical perseverance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Friedrich Schleiermacher (early and late writings).
 - Interlocutors: Calvinist/Reformed doctrine of assurance, Kantian epistemology, Romantic theology, Pietist practice.
 - Secondary frame: later liberal Protestant reception and 20th-century critiques.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Assurance (Gewissheit), faith, justification, sanctification, perseverance, church as mediator, revelation, religious feeling/self-consciousness.

- **Closing line**
 - Gräb locates Schleiermacher's center of gravity in an **existential-ecclesial assurance**: faith is assured insofar as the believer experiences inner religious certainty sustained and tested within the life of the church and the practice of discipleship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats assurance as primarily a **psychological-existential** phenomenon without reducing it to mere subjectivism: it is subjective certainty anchored in communal and sacramental life.
 - Emphasizes the **mediating role of the church** and praxis (preaching, sacraments, ethical formation) in producing and sustaining assurance.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts Schleiermacher with Reformed forensic assurance: where Calvin locates assurance in objective promises and forensic imputation, Schleiermacher locates it in inward religious consciousness and moral appropriation.
 - Pushes back on caricatures that read Schleiermacher as simply privatizing faith; Gräb shows communal and doctrinal structures in Schleiermacher's account.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Highlights Schleiermacher's use of **"feeling of absolute dependence"** as the seedbed of assurance.
 - Distinguishes **Gewissheit (assurance)** from epistemic knowledge and from mere subjective confidence - a hybrid category with ethical and communal dimensions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Helped clarify why Schleiermacher became central to liberal Protestantism's pastoral theology and why conservative critics accused him of undermining objective assurances.
 - Influenced later scholarship on the pastoral implications of Schleiermacherian theology, ecumenical readings of assurance, and constructive retrievals for contemporary pastoral care.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a careful bridge between historical scholarship and pastoral application: useful for theologians who wish to take seriously modern subjectivity without abandoning ecclesial and doctrinal accountability.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gewissheit (assurance)** - Schleiermacher's primary term; a lived certainty rooted in religious self-consciousness, not merely propositional knowledge.
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - foundational religious experience for Schleiermacher; the existential ground of faith and assurance.
- **Religious self-consciousness** - the reflective appropriation of the religious feeling into sustained faith and moral life.
- **Assurance vs. objective certainty** - Gräb stresses Schleiermacher's move away from juridical, promise-based certainty toward experiential certainty mediated by spiritual life.
- **Perseverance** - reinterpreted as continued participation in religious community and ethical transformation rather than a forensic guarantee of final salvation.
- **Church as mediator** - the community, its worship and sacraments, serve to confirm and cultivate assurance.
- **Justification / sanctification dialectic** - Schleiermacher blurs strict forensic/transformational distinctions; Gräb teases out how assurance functions within this dialectic.
- **Testimony and confirmation** - ecclesial testimony (preaching, sacraments) as empirical supports for the believer's inner certainty.
- **Subjective certainty** - not mere feeling; a disciplined, reflective conviction shaped by doctrine and practice.
- **Moral transformation** - assurance is evidenced and deepened by ethical renewal and perseverance in discipleship.
- **Pastoral implication** - assurance becomes a pastoral task: fostering religious self-consciousness within communal structures.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Schleiermacher's account of assurance in dogmatic and pastoral loci.
 - As a **polemic/resource** in debates with Reformed forensic models of assurance.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 19th-century doctrinal texts that bridge philosophy and theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology to reconsider assurance, vocation, and perseverance in modern contexts.
