### TITLE
The Hiddenness of God - Michael C. Rea

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic philosophy of religion; late 20th-early 21st century conversation about the epistemology of religious belief and the evidential problem of evil/hiddenness.
 - Dialogue largely takes place within analytic theology, engaging natural theology, epistemology, and Christian doctrinal resources.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The book addresses the *problem of divine hiddenness*: why a God who is loving, omnipotent, and omniscient would permit widespread nonbelief or experiential absence.
 - Rea aims to show that the phenomenon of divine hiddenness does not decisively defeat theism and that the problem is better understood once conceptual confusions and theological resources are brought to bear.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Clarifies key concepts (what counts as "hiddenness," varieties of nonbelief, what is meant by a "loving" God).
 - Examines the strongest philosophical formulations of the hiddenness argument (notably those that claim nonresistant nonbelief is incompatible with a perfectly loving God).
 - Explores epistemic and moral conditions that plausibly explain or justify divine non-manifestation, including:
 - **Epistemic distance**: necessary space for genuine freedom and moral responsibility.
 - **Skeptical-theist-style considerations**: limitations on human access to reasons God might have.
 - **Instrumental goods**: goods (character formation, relational authenticity) that may require non-obviousness.
 - Weighs the resources of Christian doctrine (incarnation, revelation, covenantal relationship) against philosophical objections and integrates them into a response to the hiddenness challenge.
 - Concludes that while hiddenness is a serious challenge requiring theological reflection, it does not provide a conclusive defeater of theism once properly analyzed.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Major interlocutors include contemporary philosophers who have shaped the debate (e.g., John L. Schellenberg on divine hiddenness; Alvin Plantinga and William Lane Craig on epistemology and divine action; Richard Swinburne and John Hick regarding natural theology and religious experience).
 - Engages broader literature on evidentialism, reasons for belief, and theodicy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and its forms (natural, special, relational).
 - Divine attributes (love, omniscience, omnipotence) as they bear on action and disclosure.
 - Providence and purpose (teleology of disclosure vs. hiddenness).
 - Religious epistemology (rationality of faith, defeaters, epistemic distance).

- **Closing line**
 - Rea's theological center of gravity: properly analyzed, divine hiddenness is a complex phenomenon compatible with a loving, relational God once one attends to epistemic limits, moral goods served by distance, and Christian theological resources.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful distinction among types of hiddenness (e.g., total absence vs. nonobviousness; resistant vs. nonresistant nonbelief).
 - Emphasis on the *epistemic and moral legitimacy* of divine non-disclosure rather than mere ad hoc defenses.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges absolute formulations of the hiddenness argument that assume a single, monolithic conception of divine love.
 - Pushes back against purely evidentialist readings that treat immediate divine manifestation as the default standard for rational theistic belief.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refinement of "epistemic distance" as a morally necessary condition for authentic relationship and moral agency.
 - Nuanced taxonomy of nonbelief that helps separate philosophical from pastoral problems.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in analytic philosophy of religion and in coursework on divine hiddenness; influential among those defending the rationality of faith against evidentialist objections.
 - Viewed favorably by those seeking to integrate analytic clarity with Christian doctrinal commitments; a touchstone for further work on relational models of divine presence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear, disciplined framework for teaching the hiddenness problem.
 - Models how to combine philosophical rigor with theological resources without reducing theology to pure apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine hiddenness** - Phenomenon of God's perceptual or experiential absence; central problem to be explained.
- **Nonresistant nonbelief** - Persons who lack belief in God yet are open or non-opposed to belief; pivotal in many formulations of the hiddenness argument.
- **Epistemic distance** - The idea that some degree of cognitive or experiential distance from God is necessary for freedom and moral development.
- **Skeptical theism** - Epistemic strategy that appeals to human cognitive limits to explain why God's reasons for hiddenness might be inscrutable.
- **Evidentialism** - Epistemic standard that treats evidence as the primary determinant of rational belief; often critiqued in Rea's analysis.
- **Natural theology** - Attempt to infer God's existence from nature/reason; assessed in light of hiddenness challenges.
- **Revelation (natural vs. special)** - Discussion of modes of divine disclosure, and how special revelation interacts with apparent hiddenness.
- **Moral goods of hiddenness** - Goods such as character formation and authentic relationship that may justify non-manifestation.
- **Defeaters and epistemic justification** - Concepts from epistemology used to evaluate whether hiddenness constitutes a defeater for theistic belief.
- **Relational model of divine presence** - Emphasis on God as a personal being whose disclosure is governed by relational, not merely evidential, criteria.
- **Reasonable nonbelief** - Category for which the hiddenness argument claims God's existence is incompatible with a loving God.
- **Theodicy vs. plausible theism** - Distinguishes full theodical explanation from restrained, plausible responses that preserve the rationality of faith.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition and taxonomy source** for courses on the epistemology of religion and divine hiddenness.
 - As a **polemic and response** to strong formulations of the hiddenness argument (notably Schellenberg-style claims).
 - As a **model of integrating** analytic philosophy and Christian theological resources in discussions of revelation, providence, and the rationality of faith.
