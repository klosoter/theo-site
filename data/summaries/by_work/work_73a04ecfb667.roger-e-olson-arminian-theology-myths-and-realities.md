### TITLE
**Roger E. Olson, Arminian Theology: Myths and Realities** 
Associated historical theologian: **Jacobus Arminius** (Remonstrant background)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary survey and apologetic (1994; later editions) within late-20th-century evangelical theology reacting to widespread polemics from Reformed/Calvinist critics.
 - Engages classical Arminian heritage (Arminius, the Remonstrants, Wesleyan developments) and modern misconceptions about Arminianism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Many popular descriptions of "Arminianism" are caricatures or myths (e.g., Pelagianism, semi-Pelagianism, soft determinism). Olson aims to correct these and present a coherent, historically grounded Arminian alternative to strict Calvinism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: catalogues common myths about Arminianism (moralism, works-righteousness, weak view of grace).
 - Retrieval: lays out classical Arminian doctrines (prevenient grace, conditional election, universal atonement, resistible grace, conditional perseverance) as coherent and biblically defensible.
 - Defense: exegetical and theological arguments countering Calvinist objections, especially on original sin, imputation, and human responsibility.
 - Pastoral and systematic implications: shows how Arminian emphases shape assurance, evangelism, and ethical life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Jacobus Arminius, the Remonstrants, John Wesley; critics include classical Reformed theologians and contemporary Calvinist apologists.
 - Uses Scripture, patristic/regulatory sources, and historical-theological scholarship to contextualize Arminian claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (election, grace, atonement, perseverance), anthropological issues (original sin, human freedom), and theological method (Scripture, tradition, reason).
 - Explicit attention to **Original Sin and Imputation**: Olson clarifies Arminian nuance on inherited corruption versus forensic imputation of Adam's personal guilt.
- **Closing line**
 - Olson's central gravity: **Arminian theology robustly affirms human depravity and divine grace while insisting that prevenient grace restores morally significant freedom so that election and salvation remain truly conditional upon faith.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong defense of **prevenient grace** as genuinely enabling but not coercive - restores the ability to respond to God.
 - Emphasizes **synergistic** cooperation in conversion without making salvation of human origin.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters claims that Arminianism equals Pelagianism or semi-Pelagianism; insists Arminians affirm total corruption in will (though not Calvinist determinism).
 - Offers alternatives to forensic imputation models: Arminianism stresses inherited corruption and responsibility rather than automatic imputation of Adam's personal guilt.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "free will" in theological vocabulary as **libertarian moral freedom enabled by grace** (not autonomous, not strictly compatibilist).
 - Clarifies the use of "conditional" in election - not arbitrary but anchored in foreseen faith.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as a standard contemporary statement and defense of classical Arminian positions; influential in evangelical debates over sovereignty and human responsibility.
 - Provoked sustained engagement from Reformed scholars and prompted more historically careful typologies of Arminian subtraditions (classical vs. Wesleyan).
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable corrective to caricatured histories; pedagogically useful for teaching the coherence of Arminian soteriology and its biblical claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prevenient grace** - grace that precedes and enables human response; central to Olson's corrective against "works" charges.
- **Conditional election** - election based on God's foreknowledge of faith or foreseen response, not arbitrary decree.
- **Universal atonement** - Christ's death is sufficient and intended for all; particular application depends on faith.
- **Resistible grace** - grace that can be rejected; counters efficacious/irresistible grace claims.
- **Synergism** - salvation involves a cooperative relation between divine initiative and human response.
- **Total depravity (modified)** - full corruption of nature affirmed, but coupled with prevenient grace restoring the possibility of willing faith.
- **Original sin** - humans inherit a corrupted nature and propensity to sin; Olson emphasizes Arminian insistence on real depravity.
- **Imputation (mediate vs immediate)** - Arminian nuance:
 - Rejects simple forensic imputation of Adam's personal guilt to every descendant (immediate imputation).
 - Affirms inherited corruption and a form of mediate responsibility tied to solidarity and consequent sinfulness.
- **Foreknowledge** - not mere foresight but relational foreordering that grounds conditional election in Arminian schema.
- **Libertarian freedom** - ability of the will to choose contrary options; used to articulate moral responsibility.
- **Myths** - shorthand Olson uses for common misunderstandings (Pelagianism, moralism, works-righteousness).
- **Remonstrance / Remonstrants** - historical-genetic term for the 17th-century roots of Arminianism.
- **Perseverance (conditional)** - assurance possible, but fall from grace remains a real possibility in classical Arminianism.
- **Common grace** - God's general benevolence enabling moral acts apart from redeeming grace (occasionally invoked in Olson's framework).

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional source** for classical Arminian soteriology and for distinguishing Arminianism from Pelagianism/semi-Pelagianism.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with Reformed/Calvinist theologians over imputation, election, and grace.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for approaching Romans, Paul's anthropology, and federal-headship discussions around original sin and imputation.
