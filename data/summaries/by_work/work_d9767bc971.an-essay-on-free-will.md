### TITLE
An Essay on Free Will - Peter van Inwagen (1983). Key analytic-philosophy treatment defending **incompatibilism**, developing the **Consequence Argument**, and exploring **agent causation** as a libertarian account of human freedom.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of action (1980s). Reaction to widespread compatibilism in philosophy and to Frankfurt-style challenges to simple formulations of alternative possibilities.
 - Part of a broader revival of metaphysical debate about free will within Anglo-American analytic philosophy; addresses implications for responsibility and theological concerns (foreknowledge, providence).
- **Central thesis**
 - **Free will (as required for moral responsibility) is incompatible with determinism.** If determinism is true, agents lack the relevant freedom to be morally responsible.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Formulation and defence of the **Consequence Argument**: if determinism is true then our present actions are consequences of the past and the laws of nature; because we cannot change the past or the laws, we cannot change those consequences - hence no alternative possibilities and thus no free will.
 - Distinguishes kinds of causation:
 - **Event-causal accounts** (ordinary causal chains) are shown to face a dilemma under determinism.
 - **Agent-causal accounts** are proposed as the promising libertarian alternative: agents themselves, as substances or centers of agency, can originate actions in a way not reducible to prior events.
 - Evaluates objections (Frankfurt cases, the luck objection, compatibilist redefinitions), and argues that while agent causation is metaphysically mysterious, it remains the best hope for libertarian freedom.
 - Ends with modest epistemic posture: strong argument for incompatibilism, but reservations about a fully satisfactory positive metaphysics of libertarian agency.
- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with compatibilists (Humean and modal accounts), with Frankfurt-style objections, and with fellow libertarians (e.g., Robert Kane) and historical figures (Aristotle, Reid implicitly).
 - Intersects theological debates involving Augustine, later Reformed treatments, and contemporary philosophers of religion concerning divine foreknowledge.
- **Doctrines treated (theological relevance)**
 - **Divine foreknowledge and providence** (implications for omniscience and predestination)
 - **Moral responsibility and sin**
 - Indirectly touches **election, grace, and human agency** as these doctrines presuppose positions about freedom.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Van Inwagen centers the debate on the incompatibility of determinism and morally significant freedom and insists that **agent causation**, however mysterious, is the only viable libertarian route-forcing theology to reckon with deep metaphysical questions about agency and divine sovereignty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous articulation of the **Consequence Argument** as the central philosophical case for incompatibilism.
 - Willingness to embrace metaphysical mystery (agent causation) rather than collapse freedom into compatibilist re‑definitions.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges compatibilist reformulations that redefine freedom to fit determinism; argues these miss the intuition central to moral responsibility.
 - Contrasts with event-causal libertarians (e.g., some contemporary libertarians) by favoring agent causation as the only promising libertarian account.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of **sourcehood** (being the ultimate source of an action) to responsibility claims; refines the analytic machinery (modal premises) used in the Consequence Argument.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major influence in philosophy of action and philosophy of religion; sparked renewed attention to incompatibilism among theologians and philosophers of religion.
 - Provoked sustained engagement from compatibilist philosophers and from theologians defending classical doctrines of divine providence and predestination.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, rigorous statement of modern **incompatibilism** and a key resource for anyone connecting metaphysics of agency to theological concerns about foreknowledge, sin, and responsibility.
 - Useful pedagogically for clarifying arguments and counter-arguments in the free-will debate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Determinism** - The thesis that the past plus laws of nature entail every future truth; central target of van Inwagen's argument.
- **Incompatibilism** - The view that determinism and the sort of free will needed for moral responsibility cannot both be true; van Inwagen's maintained position.
- **Compatibilism** - Opposing view that freedom is compatible with determinism; van Inwagen critiques compatibilist redefinitions as failing to capture moral responsibility.
- **Consequence Argument** - Core formal argument showing that if determinism is true our actions are consequences of the past and laws, hence not up to us.
- **Agent causation** - The libertarian proposal that agents (not mere events) can originate actions; defended as the only viable libertarian account despite metaphysical mystery.
- **Event causation** - Ordinary causal chains among events; shown to be inadequate for libertarian freedom under determinism.
- **Sourcehood** - The idea that genuine responsibility requires being the ultimate source of one's actions; central criterion in van Inwagen's analysis.
- **Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)** - The standard claim that moral responsibility requires the ability to do otherwise; van Inwagen connects PAP to incompatibilism and addresses Frankfurt-style challenges.
- **Frankfurt cases** - Thought experiments purporting to show PAP false; van Inwagen assesses but does not let them undercut the Consequence Argument.
- **Moral responsibility** - The normative concept whose metaphysical presuppositions van Inwagen seeks to secure for libertarianism.
- **Divine foreknowledge / providence** - Theological loci affected by van Inwagen's incompatibilism (compatibility of God's foreknowledge with libertarian freedom becomes problematic).
- **Luck objection** - Challenge that indeterministic events make actions a matter of luck; van Inwagen treats this as a serious worry for libertarian models.
- **Metaphysical humility** - Characteristic stance: acceptance of difficulty in fully explicating agent causation while defending its necessity.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for contemporary analytic formulations of incompatibilism and the Consequence Argument.
 - As a **polemic** against compatibilist theological systems that presume determinism-compatible moral responsibility.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about divine foreknowledge and human responsibility, prompting theologians to specify whether they adopt compatibilism, libertarianism, or revise doctrines of providence.
