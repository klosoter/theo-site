### TITLE
**The Image of God in the Human Body: Essays on Christianity and Sports** (2016), edited by **John F. Kilner**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2010s evangelical-academic engagement with embodiment, practical theology, and bioethics. Places Christian theological anthropology in conversation with sports studies, philosophy of sport, and pastoral care for athletes.
 - Kilner brings bioethical and imago Dei expertise to a niche: how Christian convictions about the human person inform and are shaped by athletic practice and culture.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The human body - especially as exercised and displayed in sport - is a significant locus for understanding and living the **imago Dei**. Sport reveals tensions in contemporary views of personhood (commodification, performance ethic, dualism) and offers a practical arena to recover an embodied, relational, teleological image-bearing anthropology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Collection of essays proceeds from descriptive diagnosis to constructive proposals:
 - Diagnose prevailing cultural and athletic distortions (hyper-performance, commodification, commodified bodies, spectator spectacle).
 - Reassert biblical and theological resources that ground human dignity in the imago Dei, emphasizing incarnation and embodiment.
 - Articulate how sport practices can form virtues, express worship, and witness to human flourishing when ordered by Christian teleology.
 - Offer pastoral and ethical implications for athletes, coaches, institutions, and medical/biomedical concerns (doping, enhancement, injury care).
 - Recurring methodological moves:
 - Scriptural exegesis (Genesis, Pauline texts on body and image).
 - Retrieval of classical and Reformation anthropology to critique dualism.
 - Interdisciplinary engagement with philosophy of sport and social science observations.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Biblical texts (Genesis 1-2, Pauline corpus) as primary anchor.
 - Classical and historical theologians implicitly present in anthropological discussions (Augustine/Aquinas as representatives of dualist/teleological debates; Reformation emphases on created order).
 - Contemporary ethicists, bioethicists, and scholars of sport and embodiment; Kilner's own prior work on imago Dei is foundational.
 - Social critiques of modern sport culture (commercialization, celebrity).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology:** imago Dei as embodied, relational, vocational.
 - **Christology / Incarnation:** Christ as corrective to dualism; human body as site of redemption and sanctification.
 - **Ethics / Virtue:** formation of character through embodied practice.
 - **Soteriology / Sanctification:** sport as context for moral growth and discipleship.
 - **Ecclesiology & Worship:** athletic practices as potential forms of communal witness and liturgical expression.

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers the **embodied imago Dei**: human bodies in sport are not mere instruments or spectacles but principal sites where Christian anthropology, ethics, and worship must be recovered and practiced.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes sport a primary theological laboratory for exploring bodily image-bearing rather than treating athletics as peripheral.
 - Emphasizes vulnerability, woundedness, and rehabilitation as intrinsic to a theological account of the body - not only capacities and excellence.
 - Treats athletic practice as a locus for **virtue formation** (habituation, community norms), not just performance.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Cartesian or Platonic tendencies that cast body as inferior to rational soul; resists secular sport narratives that reduce persons to commodities or entertainment units.
 - Challenges purely celebratory accounts of sport (achievement-only) and utilitarian biomedical enhancement paradigms.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames the imago Dei in explicitly **embodied, vocational, and relational** categories tied to concrete practices (training, teamwork, caregiving for injured bodies).
 - Introduces language of sport-as-liturgical-practice for thinking about praise, witness, and communal identity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a helpful interdisciplinary intervention within evangelical ethics, Christian studies of sport, and applied theology; cited in pastoral and chaplaincy resources for athletics.
 - Limited uptake in high-level systematic theology but strong utility in practical theology, bioethics, and pastoral care contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - A concise, practice-oriented corrective to abstract anthropologies; valuable for courses on theological anthropology, ethics of sport, chaplaincy, and bioethics, and for clergy/chaplains working with athletic communities.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (embodied)** - central claim: image-bearing is realized in the whole person, including bodily practices.
- **Embodiment** - the theological category emphasizing incarnation, bodily presence, and practices that form identity.
- **Sport as practice** - sport considered as habituating practice that forms virtues and vices.
- **Dignity of the body** - theological grounding against commodification and exploitation in athletics.
- **Vulnerability & woundedness** - bodies as sites of fragility that call for care, solidarity, and theological reflection.
- **Teleology / Flourishing (eudaimonia)** - sport ordered toward human flourishing under divine purposes, not mere achievement.
- **Sanctification through practice** - bodily disciplines in sport as means of grace for character formation.
- **Incarnation (Christological corrective)** - Christ's embodiment as normative model for valuing bodies.
- **Stewardship & giftedness** - athletic talent framed as gift to be stewarded, not a commodity to be maximized at all costs.
- **Competition vs. cooperation** - ethical distinction where competition can be ordered to common good and mutual flourishing.
- **Aesthetics / beauty of movement** - theological appreciation of embodied beauty as reflective of Creator.
- **Biomedical ethics in sport** - concerns about enhancement, doping, and medical treatment of athletes' bodies.
- **Communal witness / liturgical dimensions** - sporting communities as loci of public Christian witness and communal identity.
- **Virtue formation / habituation** - practice-based explanation of how character develops through embodied sports disciplines.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for an embodied imago Dei in courses on theological anthropology and Christian ethics.
 - As a **polemic** against secularizing or commodifying narratives of sport and body augmentation.
 - As an **exegetical-practical model** linking biblical texts about body and image to pastoral care, chaplaincy, and institutional policies in athletic contexts.
