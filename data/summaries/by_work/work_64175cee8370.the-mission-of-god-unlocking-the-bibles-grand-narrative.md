### TITLE
The Mission of God: Unlocking the Bible's Grand Narrative - Christopher J. H. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 2006 (revised 2010+ editions); emerges from late 20th-early 21st century evangelical mission renewal.
 - Speaks to concerns about fragmented theology of mission: evangelism separated from justice, OT marginalized, and mission treated as church activity rather than God's action.
 - Situated within a biblical-theological movement seeking canonical, redemptive-historical reading of Scripture.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible as a whole narrates **God's mission (missio Dei)** to rescue and bless the nations; mission is not primarily the church's program but God's initiative unfolding from creation to consummation in Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of biblical meta-narrative: creation (God's purpose), fall (fracture), election (Israel as covenant witness), mission of Israel (law, worship, prophecy), exile and return, Jesus as Israel's true fulfillment, church as sent community, and new creation consummation.
 - Emphasizes continuity between OT and NT: Israel's vocation to be a blessing to the nations culminates in Christ and the Spirit-empowered church.
 - Argues for holistic mission: proclamation (word), worship, justice, and life transformation inseparable.
 - Practical theological implications: church identity, discipleship, cross-cultural mission, social justice, and liturgy all reframed as participation in God's mission.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages mission scholars and theologians such as David Bosch, Lesslie Newbigin, John Stott; converses with biblical-theologians (Walter Brueggemann, G. K. Beale) and contemporary evangelical practitioners.
 - Draws on canonical exegesis, Old and New Testament theology, and historical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (canonical narrative), covenant theology (election and vocation of Israel), **Christology** (Jesus as fulfillment of Israel's mission), Trinity (sending motif and missional God), eschatology (consummation/new creation), ethics (shalom, justice, righteousness), worship.

- **Closing line**
 - God's sending-to Israel, in Christ, by the Spirit through the church-constitutes the biblical story's center: mission is the telos of Scripture and the identity of God and his people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Canon-wide, canonical-historical reading: the whole Bible is read as a unity focused on God's mission.
 - Strong recovery of the Old Testament as intrinsically missionary, not merely preparatory.
 - Holistic integration: evangelism, social justice, worship, and cultural transformation are mutually constitutive mission tasks.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters ecclesiocentric models that treat mission as church program; counters pietistic/evangelistic models that neglect social and covenantal dimensions.
 - Pushes back against readings that bifurcate law and gospel by showing law, worship, and justice as part of God's mission agenda.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reinscribes ancient terms (missio Dei) into comprehensive biblical-theological frame; popularizes language of "mission-shaped" biblical narrative within evangelical scholarship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical and Reformed seminaries as a core textbook on biblical mission.
 - Influential in shifting mission discourse toward OT inclusion and holistic praxis; used by mission agencies, pastors, and theologians globally.

- **Enduring value**
 - Robust exegetical synthesis connecting OT and NT mission themes; durable for preaching, curriculum, and missional theology formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
