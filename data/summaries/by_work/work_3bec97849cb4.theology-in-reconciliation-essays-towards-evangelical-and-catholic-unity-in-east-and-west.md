### TITLE
Theology in Reconciliation: Essays towards Evangelical and Catholic Unity in East and West - Thomas F. Torrance

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century ecumenical milieu: postwar search for unity among Protestant (especially Reformed), Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox churches. Reaction against theological liberalism, modernist reductionism, and scholastic aridities.
 - Torrance writes as a Scottish Reformed theologian conversant with patristic, Barthian, and Eastern Orthodox resources.

- **Central thesis**
 - Genuine ecclesial unity requires doctrinal reconciliation grounded in the objective, historical reality of Christ the Mediator: the incarnation and atoning work of the Son reveal the triune God's reconciling activity and provide the theological basis for East-West and Catholic-Evangelical convergence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: modern fragmentation is rooted in faulty epistemologies (subjectivism, nominalism, and reductionist metaphysics) that sever doctrine from the reality of God's self‑communication.
 - Recovery move: retrieve patristic and Reformation insights-particularly Trinitarian and christological realism-that locate revelation in the person and work of the incarnate Word.
 - Constructive move: propose a theological method (theology as a rigorous, reality‑directed science) that preserves objective reconciliation and sacramental participation as normative for unity.
 - Ecclesial move: argue that unity must be theological (doctrinal truth), liturgical (sacramental participation), and relational (mutual recognition), not mere institutional compromise.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages patristic fathers (Athanasius, Cyril), Karl Barth, John Calvin, Orthodox theologians (via themes of theosis and sacramental realism), and critiques of scholastic Thomism and liberal Protestantism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word as event), Trinity (relational being), Christology (hypostatic union, mediation), Atonement (reconciliation as objective divine act), Sacraments/Eucharist (participation in Christ), Ecclesiology (unity and catholicity), Theological method (science, realism, theoria).

- **Closing line**
 - Torrance centers theology on the incarnate Mediator: unity is the corporate participation in the reconciled reality enacted by the triune God in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Reconciliation** as the central hermeneutical category for ecumenism: theology must explicate how the triune God objectively reconciles creation in Christ.
 - **Theology as a disciplined science** oriented to divine reality rather than mere systematic taxonomy or subjective experience.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal theology's subjectivism and scholastic Thomism's abstracted metaphysics by insisting on historical, incarnational, and patristic‑rooted realism.
 - Challenges both Protestant minimalism and Roman Catholic juridical or institutional readings of unity; seeks doctrinal convergence without capitulation to institutional uniformity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts traditional terms (theosis, sacramental union, mediation) within a Reformed realist framework, making them bridges between East and West.
 - Prioritizes "theoria" (vision/participation) alongside propositional truth.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly regarded in Reformed circles for barthean and patristic synthesis; influential in ecumenical dialogues by offering a robust theological basis for East-West conversations.
 - Stimulated renewed interest in sacramental realism and the patristic retrieval among Evangelicals and some Protestants.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a methodological and doctrinal model for constructive ecumenical theology: integrates doctrine, worship, and ontology; valuable for courses on ecumenism, Christology, and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reconciliation**
 - Central axis: the divine act in Christ restoring communion between God and creation; hermeneutical key for unity.

- **Incarnation**
 - Evental revelation: God's self‑communication in the Son as the ground of knowledge and unity.

- **Theosis / Deification**
 - Recast in Reformed register: participatory sharing in divine life through union with Christ, not pantheistic assimilation.

- **Trinitarian relations**
 - Ontological and epistemic basis for theology: revelation is the inner life of the triune God expressed in mediation.

- **Christology (hypostatic union)**
 - Doctrine of person and work: ensures objective mediation and grounds sacramental participation.

- **Revelation (Word as event)**
 - Knowledge of God is evental and personal, not merely propositional.

- **Atonement / Mediation**
 - Objective divine act effected in Christ; emphasizes reconciliation over moral exemplarism.

- **Sacramental realism (Eucharist)**
 - Sacraments as participation in the reconciled reality, loci for ecclesial unity.

- **Theology as science / theological realism**
 - Methodological insistence on disciplined, reality‑oriented theological inquiry.

- **Theoria**
 - Vision/participation: complements doctrinal formulation; experiential knowledge grounded in revealed reality.

- **Patristic retrieval**
 - Use of Eastern and Western fathers to bridge doctrinal divisions.

- **Kerygma**
 - Proclamation-centered approach: doctrine must serve the saving proclamation rooted in Christ's work.

- **Ontology vs. Epistemology**
 - Torrance emphasizes ontological grounding of knowledge in the incarnate Word, correcting epistemic reductionism.

- **Unity vs. Uniformity**
 - Distinguishes true theological and sacramental unity from enforced institutional or liturgical uniformity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "reconciliation" and for a realist theological method.
 - As a **polemic** against theological subjectivism and scholastic abstractions.
 - As an **exegetical/constructive model** for ecumenical Christology and sacramental theology, serving as a conceptual pivot in East-West dialogue.
