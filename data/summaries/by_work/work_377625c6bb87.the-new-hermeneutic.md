### TITLE
The New Hermeneutic - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed response to postwar continental hermeneutical developments (the so-called "New Hermeneutic" and existentialist approaches to Scripture).
 - Van Til writes from the presuppositional-apologetic tradition within Reformed theology, in tension with both liberal historical-critical methods and some forms of neo-orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis**
 - Hermeneutics is not neutral: biblical interpretation must begin with the Christian presupposition of God's self-revelation in Scripture and the antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of neutrality claims: interpretation cannot bracket worldviews; exegesis depends on foundational commitments.
 - Affirmation of Scripture's authority as propositional revelation that structures understanding, yet requires the Spirit for proper appropriation.
 - Proposal of a Christ-centered, covenantal typological method: Scripture's unity in Christ governs fulfillment and typology.
 - Application to contested loci: interpretation of typology and promises to Israel (esp. Romans 11).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Targets and interlocutors include proponents of existential/new-hermeneutic streams (continental exegetes emphasizing "event" and appropriation), historical-critical exegesis, and also some neo-orthodox emphases that downplay propositional content.
 - Draws on Reformed confessional tradition, classical Reformed epistemology, and apologetic exchanges with modern philosophy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, propositional content, necessity of Spirit-wrought illumination)
 - Covenant theology (typology, fulfillment, corporate identity of Israel and Church)
 - Christology (centrality of Christ as interpretive key)
 - Epistemology/worldview (presuppositions, antithesis)
 - Soteriology and eschatology in interpretive application (e.g., Romans 11 material)
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til locates hermeneutics within a presuppositional Reformed framework: correct interpretation flows from confessed dependence on the triune God and Christocentric covenantal continuity, not from purportedly neutral methods.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Explicit transfer of Van Til's presuppositional apologetic method into hermeneutics: interpretation as worldview-dependent, not methodologically neutral.
 - Strong insistence on the priority of divine revelation over autonomous reason in shaping exegesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against the New Hermeneutic's existential "event" focus by insisting that appropriation must not collapse into subjectivism; the objective propositional content of Scripture anchors appropriation.
 - Critiques both liberal historicism (which relativizes Scripture) and some neo-orthodox strains (which can downplay the constitutive propositional character of revelation).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Applies the language of presuppositions and antithesis to interpretive theory-treating hermeneutical stance as analogous to apologetic posture.
 - Recasts typology as a covenantal, Christ-centered interpretive norm rather than merely a literary-historical device.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and conservative evangelical circles that adopt presuppositional approaches; used as a corrective to modus operandi in seminaries resistant to worldview-critical hermeneutics.
 - Largely criticized or ignored by proponents of existential hermeneutics and many mainline academic interpreters who defend methodological neutrality or historicist categories.
- **Enduring value**
 - Sharpens awareness that interpretive theory implicates ontology and epistemology; valuable for training pastors and students to read Scripture with a confessed theological framework.
 - Provides a robust polemical tool against relativizing and subjectivist tendencies in contemporary biblical interpretation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositions**
 - Foundational commitments that condition interpretation; Van Til insists these must be Christian (God-centered).
- **Antithesis**
 - The radical opposition between Scripture-based thought and autonomous human thought; prevents syncretistic reading.
- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture as propositional, normative revelation that functions as the interpreter's ultimate criterion.
- **Propositional revelation**
 - Emphasis that revelation contains truth-claims (not merely existential events) which guide exegesis.
- **Christ-centered hermeneutic**
 - Christ is the controlling key for reading all Scripture; typology and promise find fulfillment in him.
- **Typology**
 - Read typological figures/events covenantally; types point forward to Christ and God's covenantal purposes (see: Typology And Fulfillment).
- **Fulfillment**
 - Theological fulfillment in Christ, not merely chronological coincidence or moral lesson; the hermeneutical telos of Old Testament figures.
- **Covenant continuity**
 - Corporate continuity of God's dealings across Testaments-guides interpretation of promises to Israel and the Church.
- **Worldview / heart**
 - Interpretation flows from the believer's heart-commitments; intellectual neutrality is impossible.
- **Illumination**
 - Necessity of the Spirit to rightly apply and understand Scripture's propositional truth.
- **Exegetical antithesis**
 - Refusal to harmonize Scripture with non-Christian presuppositions in exegesis.
- **Romans 11 (Israel's future)**
 - Uses presuppositional, covenantal lens to read Romans 11 as affirming God's ongoing fiduciary dealings with ethnic Israel that find ultimate meaning in Christ (see: Romans 11 And Israels Future).
- **Analogy vs. assimilation**
 - Distinguishes analogical reading (Scripture interprets Scripture under God's covenantal pattern) from assimilating texts to secular paradigms.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for a presuppositional hermeneutic that links epistemology and hermeneutics.
- As a **polemic** against existentialist/new-hermeneutic and liberal historicist methods.
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing typology and covenantal fulfillment (applied notably in readings of Romans 11 and Old Testament promise texts).
