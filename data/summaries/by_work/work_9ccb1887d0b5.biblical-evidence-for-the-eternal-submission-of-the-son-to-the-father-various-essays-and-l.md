### TITLE
**Biblical Evidence for the Eternal Submission of the Son to the Father** - John M. Frame (essays and lectures; contributions to the Eternal Functional Subordination debates)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Reformed debate over Trinitarian relations, frequently framed as the Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) controversy.
 - Dialogues among contemporary evangelical theologians (e.g., Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware) and critics (e.g., Kevin Giles, Robert Letham). Frame intervenes as a systematic/Reformed voice that is philosophically and scripturally oriented.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Claim: Scripture supports speaking of a real, relational ordering between Father and Son that is eternal in the economy of God (i.e., the Son's submission and the Father's authority), but this must be carefully qualified to avoid any ontological subordination of the Son.
 - Problem addressed: How to affirm both the Son's full deity (ontological equality) and observable relational order (authority/submission) without collapsing into subordinationism or denying historic Nicene orthodoxy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchor: close readings of key texts often appealed to in the debate - John 5, John 14, Philippians 2, 1 Corinthians 15:24-28, Hebrews - arguing these show relational ordering in the Son's role that participates in divine unity.
 - Theological grammar:
 - Distinguish immanent (ontological) Trinity from economic (economic/manifest) Trinity.
 - Maintain ontological equality (same divine essence) while allowing for eternal personal relations of authority and submission in the economic order.
 - Use conceptual tools (careful philosophical distinctions, Frame's broader epistemological method) to prevent category mistakes that turn functional relations into ontological inferiority.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Critiques careless readings that smuggle ontological subordination into texts about economic activity.
 - Critiques equally the rhetoric that denies any eternal relational ordering when Scripture evidences ordered relations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary proponents and critics of EFS (Grudem, Ware, Giles, Letham) and appeals to classical sources (Nicene formulary, Cappadocians, Augustine) for doctrinal guardrails.
 - Deploys Pauline, Johannine, and Hebrews passages; uses systematic checks from creedal theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (Son's person and work), revelation (Scripture as norm for theological language), ecclesiology and gender debates where EFS implications are claimed.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on affirming **the Son's eternal relational submission within Scripture's economy while rigorously defending his ontological equality**, insisting that careful theological and exegetical distinctions must govern any appeal to "eternal submission."

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on precise conceptual distinctions: ontological equality vs. relational ordering; economic vs. immanent Trinity; rejection of category conflation.
 - Strong hermeneutical caution: Frame requires that biblical texts be read within both historical-theological tradition and sound philosophical categories.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects proponents who treat "submission" language as implying ontological inferiority.
 - Corrects opponents who treat any talk of eternal relations as necessarily subordinationist or merely analogical, urging a more nuanced middle path.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Applies systematic-methodological tools (drawing on Frame's broader epistemology) to Trinitarian language - i.e., using triperspectival sensitivity to avoid oversimplified metaphysics.
 - Language that preserves the monarchy of the Father while allowing for persistent interpersonal ordering in the Godhead.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking a guarded defense of relational ordering without doctrinal compromise; used by some as a conciliatory model between hard-line EFS advocates and strict opponents.
 - Criticized by those who see any appeal to eternal submission as dangerous; praised by those wanting scripturally grounded nuance.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined exegetical + systematic interplay; useful for teaching how to hold Nicene commitments while engaging contemporary ecclesial implications (e.g., complementarian debates).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**
 - The claim that the Son is eternally submissive to the Father in role/authority without ontological inferiority; Frame treats it as usable if carefully defined.
- **Ontological equality**
 - The Son's equal divinity and essence with the Father; non-negotiable Nicene affirmation.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God's works and manifested relations in redemptive history; primary locus for discussing submission.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God's inner life and being apart from works; Frame urges restraint in projecting economic relations directly into the immanent life.
- **Relational ordering / authority-submission**
 - Personal relations within the Trinity that express order (Father's monarchy, Son's obedience) without essence-differentiation.
- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling; Frame uses it to guard against isolation of persons or hierarchical ontologizing.
- **Monarchy of the Father**
 - Traditional doctrine of the Father's role as principle or source within the Trinity; retained but not used to imply ontological primacy.
- **Philippians 2 kenosis**
 - Christ's self-emptying in incarnation; exegetically related but distinguished from eternal ontological status.
- **1 Corinthians 15:24-28 subjection motif**
 - Scriptural text often cited for Son's subjection; Frame reads it as functional and eschatological but reflective of eternal relational realities.
- **Triperspectival method**
 - Frame's broader epistemological framework that informs his theological method (normative, situational, existential checks).
- **Analogy of Being / analogy language**
 - Emphasized caution: divine relational language is analogical and must be disciplined by creedal doctrine.
- **Complementarianism (debate use)**
 - The work is often invoked in discussions of gender roles where EFS is used as theological underpinning.
- **Exegetical model**
 - Close-text-driven, systematically constrained exegesis to avoid doctrinal drift.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a precisely qualified EFS that preserves Nicene orthodoxy.
 - As a **polemic tool** both against simplistic EFS formulations and against blanket denials of any eternal ordering.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating careful handling of Johannine and Pauline subordination texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for linking Trinitarian doctrine to ethical and ecclesial questions without collapsing theology into culture-war slogans.
