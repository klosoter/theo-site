### TITLE
**Convergence: Spiritual Journeys of a Charismatic Calvinist** 
Author: Sam Storms 
Genre: Theological memoir / pastoral apologetic / pneumatological synthesis 
Context: late 20th-early 21st century Reformed-Charismatic movement; aimed at bridging tensions between historic Calvinism and continuationist pneumatology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written from within the small but growing movement of *charismatic Calvinists* who seek to hold classical Reformed doctrine while affirming ongoing charismatic gifts.
 - Responds to polarization: strict cessationism in many Reformed circles vs. relativistic charismatic praxis in parts of the charismatic movement.
- **Central thesis**
 - It is possible, theologically necessary, and pastorally profitable to be both *Reformed in doctrine* and *charismatic in practice*: Scripture warrants ongoing gifts of the Spirit exercised within Reformed ecclesiology and doctrinal bounds.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part memoir: personal testimony of conversion, growth, and encounters with the Spirit that shaped Storms's conviction.
 - Theological exposition: defense of continuationism grounded in biblical exegesis, Reformed doctrinal commitments, and historical data.
 - Pastoral application: guidelines for discerning and ordering gifts in local churches, warnings against excess and abuse.
 - Practical theology: liturgical and congregational implications for worship, leadership, and spiritual formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages cessationist arguments common in Reformed circles (representative types rather than polemical catalogue).
 - Dialogues with the broader charismatic tradition (practical leaders and Pentecostal scholarship) while appealing to classic Reformed resources (confessions, Puritans, systematicians).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (primary): nature, purpose, and present operation of the Holy Spirit.
 - **Spiritual gifts** (charismata): prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles, discerning of spirits.
 - **Ecclesiology**: order, authority, normative practices for congregational life.
 - **Scripture and authority**: sola Scriptura as boundary for charismatic experience.
 - **Sanctification and soteriology**: relation of gifts to growth in holiness and assurance.
- **Closing line**
 - Storms's work centers on a theologically disciplined continuationism: vibrant pneumatology anchored in Reformed orthodoxy and shaped by pastoral prudence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A sustained attempt to synthesize robust Reformed theology with an unabashedly continuationist pneumatology-"convergence" as method and goal.
 - Emphasis on *ordered* charismatic practice: gifts rightly exercised promote edification, not spectacle.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects cessationist overreach that reduces the Spirit's present activity to ordinary graces only.
 - Counters unbridled charismatic practice by insisting on confessional boundaries, doctrinal clarity, and ecclesial accountability.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses "convergence" as a normative descriptor for a theological identity that refuses the either/or between Calvinism and charismatic experience.
 - Frequently frames charismatic phenomena through terms like *regulated spontaneity*-spiritual freedom within doctrinal order.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among Reformed charismatics as a go-to articulation of the identity; influential in planting and reforming churches seeking both Reformed doctrine and charismatic life.
 - Critiqued by strict cessationists for perceived epistemic risks; praised by continuationsists for tempering excess.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a practical and theological model for pastors and seminaries wrestling with pneumatology, ecclesial practice, and pastoral governance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Convergence** - the central category: fusion of Reformed theology and charismatic practice.
- **Continuationism** - belief that charismatic gifts continue today; argued from exegetical and experiential grounds.
- **Cessationism** - foil position; Storms critiques strongest forms while acknowledging legitimate prudential concerns.
- **Charismatic Calvinist** - identity marker: Calvinist doctrinally, charismatic pneumatologically.
- **Regulated spontaneity** - proposed modus operandi for gifts: spontaneous Spirit-work under ordered oversight.
- **Charismata** - overview treatment of prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles, and their purposes (edification, testimony, confirmation).
 - Prophecy: emphasized as subordinate to Scripture, normative when revelatory claims are tested.
 - Tongues and interpretation: treated as legitimate but not normative for universal congregational practice.
- **Ecclesial authority / discernment** - procedural norms for validating prophetic and miraculous claims.
- **Sola Scriptura** - boundary principle: experiences must cohere with Scripture.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - reads gifts in light of covenant and redemptive progression rather than purely experiential categories.
- **Pastoral prudence** - recurring theme: balance of openness and guardedness in church life.
- **Order vs. spectacle** - repeated contrast: gifts function for edification, not sensationalism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the term "charismatic Calvinist" and as a model identity in contemporary Reformed networks.
- As a **polemic** against strict cessationism and against unregulated charismatic excess.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading 1 Corinthians, Acts, and New Testament pneumatology within Reformed commitments.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary and pastoral formation for integrating pneumatology into Reformed ecclesiology and pastoral praxis.
