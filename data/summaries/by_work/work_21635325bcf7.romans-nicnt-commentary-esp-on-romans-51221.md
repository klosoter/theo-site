### TITLE
John Murray, Romans (NICNT), with focus on 5:12-21: Adam-Christ solidarity, imputation, and the superabundance of grace

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Westminster Theological Seminary; classic Reformed exegetical theology amid postwar critical scholarship.
 - NICNT early series volumes: rigorous Greek exegesis serving confessional dogmatics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How the one sin of Adam brings death and condemnation to all, and how the one obedience of Christ brings justification and life to the many; whether Paul teaches real guilt-imputation and federal headship.
- **Core argument or structure (5:12-21)**
 - v.12: Thesis stated: death through sin, spread to all, **because all sinned**.
 - vv.13-14: Parenthesis: sin and death prior to Moses prove a law-relation and a solidarity with Adam (even infants), not merely imitation.
 - vv.15-17: Contrast and a fortiori: Adam's trespass brought death's reign; Christ's grace abounds and establishes the reign in life.
 - vv.18-19: Resumption and parallelism: one trespass to condemnation for all in Adam; one righteous act/obedience to justification and life for all in Christ.
 - vv.20-21: Law's ancillary role: it came in alongside to increase trespass, so that grace might superabound and reign through righteousness to eternal life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Augustine vs. Pelagius; classic Reformed federalism (Calvin, Turretin, Shedd, Hodge).
 - Dialogues with older critical and Lutheran readings (Sanday-Headlam; Nygren), and grammar/lexicon debates on eph ho, anacoluthon, paraeiserchomai.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology/Hamartiology:** original sin, death (penal and comprehensive), solidarity in Adam.
 - **Soteriology:** imputation, justification as forensic, union with Christ, reconciliation, definitive sanctification (esp. ch. 6).
 - **Christology:** the one obedience as entire mediatorial obedience culminating at the cross (active + passive).
 - **Covenant/Federal headship:** representative structure of humanity in Adam/Christ.
 - **Eschatology:** two-age scheme; reign of death vs. reign in life.
 - **Pneumatology (ch. 8):** the Spirit as the agent of life that issues from justification.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: God's superabounding grace in the second Adam, judicially securing and effectually communicating life to a new humanity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Robust defense of **immediate imputation** of Adam's guilt and of Christ's righteousness.
 - Tight Adam-Christ typology: corporate, representative, and forensic, yet issuing in transformative life.
 - Reading of 5:12 as causal (because all sinned) while insisting the sin in view is **all sinned in Adam**, not merely in personal acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rejects Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian and purely exemplarist readings; resists realist/seminalist accounts that bypass federal representation.
 - Counters moral-influence or purely existential accounts by foregrounding condemnation/justification as judicial acts.
 - No universalism: the scope of the two alls is delimited by covenantal headship (all in Adam = humanity; all in Christ = the redeemed).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies Pauline syntax: anacoluthon between 5:12 and 5:18; paraeiserchomai as law "came in alongside."
 - Integrates **definitive sanctification** (Rom 6) with the forensic center without conflating categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical within Reformed exegesis; a standard foil to later New Perspective proposals on justification and corporate identity.
 - Frequently cited in debates on imputation (Federal Vision, union-with-Christ discussions) and on Adamic headship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of confessional exegesis that respects Greek detail and canonical theology.
 - A durable framework for teaching original sin, justification, and the two-Adam structure of redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal headship (Adam/Christ)**: Representative governance of the many by the one; grounds condemnation and justification.
- **Immediate imputation**: Adam's guilt reckoned to all; Christ's righteousness reckoned to believers apart from prior inherent change.
- **Because all sinned (eph ho pantes hemarton)**: Causal; the all-sinned refers to sinning in Adam, not first personal transgression.
- **Anacoluthon (5:12-18)**: Broken construction in 5:12 resumes at 5:18 to complete the just-as/so-also parallel.
- **One trespass vs. one righteous act**: Adam's single infringing act contrasted with Christ's entire obedience culminating in the cross.
- **Condemnation / Justification (forensic)**: Judicial verdicts; justification issues in life but is not itself moral transformation.
- **Reign of death / Reign in life**: Two-age, two-kingdom contrast; grace establishes dominion through righteousness.
- **Law came in alongside (paraeiserchomai)**: Mosaic law's ancillary role was to increase trespass and reveal sin's dominion.
- **Original sin and death (including infants)**: Death's universality, even among those without like transgression, evidences imputation.
- **The many / the all**: Collective terms conditioned by covenantal headship, not arithmetical universalism.
- **Union with Christ**: The relational matrix in which imputation is applied and life is communicated.
- **Definitive sanctification (Rom 6)**: Once-for-all break with sin's dominion flowing from union and justification.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition-source for imputation, federal headship, and justification's forensic nature.
 - As an exegetical model for parsing Pauline syntax and typology (Adam-Christ).
 - As a polemical anchor against Pelagianism, mediate-imputation schemes, and universalist readings of the alls.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking soteriology with eschatology (two reigns) and with sanctification by union.
