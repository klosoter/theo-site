### TITLE
Against Two Letters of the Pelagians (Contra duas epistolas Pelagianorum) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 5th century Augustine, during the Pelagian controversy (context of councils and synods c. 418). Written as an epistolary refutation of Pelagian correspondence and teachings that minimized original sin and amplified human moral ability.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Augustine aims to show that the Pelagian claim of unaided human ability to obey law and earn salvation is false; human nature is wounded by Adamic sin, grace is necessary, and the Mosaic law cannot be read as a life‑giving covenant of works apart from God's grace.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Identification of Pelagian assertions in two letters and isolation of their principal errors (denial of transmitted guilt, overestimation of nature).
 - Exegetical rebuttal using Scripture (Adam, Paul, the Prophets, and the Mosaic law) to demonstrate the reality of original sin, concupiscence, and need for prevenient/justifying grace.
 - Theological clarification of law and gospel: law reveals sin, threatens punishment, and cannot effect internal renewal; grace alone forgives and renews.
 - Practical pastoral consequences: sacraments (baptism), prayer, and dependence on God's mercy over human merit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary opponents: Pelagius and Pelagian correspondents (and implicitly Celestius).
 - Scriptural interlocutors: Paul (Romans, Corinthians), Moses/Law, and Old Testament witnesses.
 - Tradition: Augustine mobilizes patristic authority and rhetorical refutation rather than systematic scholastic categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** original sin (transmission of guilt), grace (prevenient, efficacious, necessary), free will (enabled but not autonomous), law (Mosaic), covenantal structure implicitly developed (covenant of works vs covenant of grace), baptism and ecclesial means, merit and punishment.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The law exposes human incapacity and condemnation; only God's gracious action-not human merit-secures forgiveness and renewal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that human nature is damaged (concupiscence) such that unaided will cannot secure righteousness.
 - Framing law primarily as a revealing and condemning instrument that drives creatures to seek grace, rather than as a self‑sufficient covenantal path to life.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Pelagius: rejects the notion that Adam's sin harmed only himself or that death is merely a physical inheritance without moral culpability.
 - Contrasts with any reading that would make the Mosaic covenant effectively a restorative covenant of works granting life upon obedience.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - While not offering a later systematic "covenant of works/covenant of grace" schema, Augustine anticipates those categories by distinguishing law's demands from grace's gift.
 - Nuanced use of "merit" and "desert": human works are real but cannot be the ground of redemption.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Highly influential in medieval and Reformation receptions as a primary anti‑Pelagian authority; formative for Reformed insistence on original sin, total depravity (in modified form), and grace.
 - Used by Calvin and post‑Reformation theologians as a patristic anchor for covenantal and soteriological claims.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models forensic and pastoral integration: doctrinal precision tied to pastoral urgency.
 - Serves as a key witness for debates about the Mosaic law's function and whether it can be construed as a covenant of works "as to substance" (see below).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism:** the set of doctrines Augustine opposes-denial of hereditary guilt and overconfidence in natural human ability.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale / culpa originis):** Augustine's claim that Adam's sin wounded human nature, transmitted guilt and liability to death and condemnation.
- **Grace (gratia):** prevenient and efficacious divine gift required for any saving obedience; Augustinian grace is indispensable.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium):** real but impaired; freed by grace to cooperate with God, not autonomous.
- **Mosaic law / Law of Moses:** presented as covenantal instruction that condemns and reveals sin; it does not confer life apart from grace.
 - Relation to Covenant of Works: Augustine treats the Mosaic covenant as requiring obedience (thus resembling a covenant of works "as to substance"), but he denies it can justify-its demands only highlight need for grace.
- **Covenant (implicit use):** not systematized by Augustine, but present in distinction between law's demands and God's covenantal mercy (proto‑covenantal thinking).
- **Merit / Desert:** human deeds have moral weight but cannot ground justification without divine gift.
- **Concupiscence (concupiscentia):** the disordered appetite that remains after the Fall and hampers obedience.
- **Imputation:** Augustine affirms Adam's sin as affecting all; debates concern how guilt and corruption are transmitted.
- **Baptism:** ecclesial sign of forgiveness and an instrument of grace, opposed to Pelagian minimization of sacraments.
- **Judgment / Condemnation:** law pronounces guilt; grace rescues.
- **Pedagogy of the law:** law functions as tutor pointing to Christ and the need for grace.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **polemic** against Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian positions on sin and human ability.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading the Mosaic law as convicting and preparatory rather than salvific by human merit.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for later formations of covenant theology and Reformed doctrines of sin and grace.
