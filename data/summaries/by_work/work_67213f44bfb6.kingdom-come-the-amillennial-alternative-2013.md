### TITLE
**Kingdom Come: The Amillennial Alternative - Sam Storms (2013)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st-century evangelical milieu marked by renewed debates over eschatology: persistent influence of dispensational premillennialism, resurgence of historic premillennial arguments, and growth of charismatic/Reformed convergences.
 - Storms writes as a broadly Reformed, charismatic pastor-scholar addressing both academic and ecclesial audiences dissatisfied with futurist literalism.
- **Central thesis**
 - Amillennialism provides the biblically faithful, pastorally responsible, and theologically coherent reading of the millennium texts: the thousand-year reign is not a future, earthly, political reign of Christ after a bodily return but a present, spiritual reign inaugurated at the resurrection and consummated at Christ's return.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: sustained reading of key texts (Revelation 20; Daniel; Matthew 24-25; 1-2 Thessalonians; Pauline references to resurrection and reign) showing symbolic/figurative and already/not-yet features.
 - Theological integration:
 - Kingdom of God as inaugurated - Christ reigns now by Spirit and Word through the church.
 - The binding of Satan (Rev 20) is interpretively tied to Christ's victory and the present restraint of evil, not a complete removal.
 - Final resurrection, judgment, and new heavens/new earth follow the single, climactic return of Christ.
 - Polemic: critiques literalist premillennial reconstructions for exegetical weaknesses, theological fragmentation, and adverse ecclesial consequences (escapism, pessimism toward cultural engagement).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on patristic (Augustine) and Reformation-era amillennial resources; dialogues with modern premillennial proponents (dispensationalists and historic premillennialists), and engages recent scholars who treat inaugurated eschatology (e.g., George Ladd, N. T. Wright insofar as inaugurated kingdom themes appear).
 - Engages contemporary charismatic practice by integrating pneumatology with amillennial expectations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennium, resurrection, judgment, consummation)
 - Christology (kingly reign, victory accomplished in the cross/resurrection)
 - Pneumatology (present reign effected by Spirit)
 - Ecclesiology (church as manifestation of kingdom in the present age)
 - Covenant theology implications (continuity of people of God across ages)
- **Closing line**
 - Storms argues that the amillennial vision most faithfully preserves biblical testimony: Christ reigns now, the kingdom is inaugurated, and the consummation awaits a single, glorious return.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates a robust charismatic pneumatology with classic amillennial hermeneutics - the Spirit's present activity is central to the realized aspect of the kingdom.
 - Strong pastoral concern: eschatology should shape Christian hope, mission, and perseverance, not retreat from cultural or ecclesial responsibility.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensational literalism by challenging rigid literal-historical readings of apocalyptic symbolism and by emphasizing typological/fulfillment patterns.
 - Contrasts with historic premillennialism by denying an intervening earthly golden age after Christ's return and by rejecting a two-phase reign of Christ on earth before final judgment.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames the debate as an "alternative" constructive amillennialism rather than merely a critique - emphasis on positive, integrated account of kingdom-realization.
 - Uses contemporary language of "inaugurated eschatology" combined with classical amillennial categories to bridge scholarly and pastoral vocabularies.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among Reformed charismatics and some broader evangelical circles as a clear, pastoral defense of amillennialism.
 - Cited in dialogues between Pentecostal/charismatic movements and Reformed interlocutors as a resource that both affirms Spirit-led experience and restrains futurist speculations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear exegetical treatment of Revelation 20 and key NT eschatological passages.
 - Useful synthesis for teaching: marries rigorous biblical argument with pastoral application and pneumatological sensitivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Amillennialism**
 - The view that the "thousand years" of Revelation 20 is not a literal future earthly epoch but corresponds to Christ's present reign until his return.
- **Millennium**
 - Interpreted symbolically/typologically as the present age of Christ's reign, not a distinct future political reign on earth.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Kingdom as "already/not yet": present spiritual realization and future consummation.
- **Binding of Satan (Rev 20)**
 - Understood as a present restraint enabling gospel advance, not a total removal of Satanic activity.
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Present spiritual reign manifested in the church and in gospel progress; consummated at return.
- **Consummation**
 - Single, climactic return of Christ culminating in resurrection, judgment, and new creation.
- **Present spiritual reign**
 - Emphasizes Christ's sovereign rule effected through Word and Spirit in the church era.
- **Resurrection(s) and judgment**
 - Final resurrection and universal judgment occur post-return; no intermediate thousand-year earthly resurrection-jubilee.
- **Pneumatology (charismatic integration)**
 - The Spirit's gifts and works are signs of the kingdom's present reality; charismatic experience does not demand a premillennial framework.
- **Literalism vs. typological reading**
 - Storms privileges typological/symbolic readings for apocalyptic texts where genre and canonical harmony demand it.
- **Covenant continuity**
 - Continuity of God's people across ages undergirds his reading of kingdom passages.
- **Ecclesiology as kingdom presence**
 - Church functions as the visible agent of the kingdom in the present age.
- **Earthly future kingdom (contrast)**
 - The premillennial expectation of a future earthly political kingdom is rejected as exegetically unnecessary and theologically problematic.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary amillennial theology and inaugurated eschatology.
- As a **polemic** against dispensational and historic premillennial readings.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Revelation 20 and synoptic eschatological texts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** integrating charismatic pneumatology with Reformed eschatological commitments.
