### TITLE
Karl Barth - Theological Anthropology (as read through John Webster)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Located primarily in Barth's Church Dogmatics (1930s-1960s); formed within **neo-orthodox** reaction to 19th-century liberal theology and philosophical anthropology.
 - Webster reads Barth from a late-Reformation and Augustinian-Reformed trajectory: stresses theology as Word-centered, covenantal, and Trinitarian.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Anthropology must be grounded in the **Word of God in Jesus Christ**: human nature is understood only in relation to God's creative, revelatory, and redeeming action.
 - Primary question: what does it mean to be a creature whose identity is defined by God rather than by autonomous selfhood or naturalistic categories?
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Humanity is creature: finite, contingent, and wholly dependent on God's **creative Word and Spirit**.
 - The **Imago Dei** is not a set of attributes but a relation: human being as capable of relation to God (analogia relationis) and constituted by the covenantal event in Christ.
 - Sin disfigures this relational status; anthropology therefore must be inseparable from Christology and soteriology - humans are defined as sinners and as those whom God elects and reconciles in Christ.
 - Barth resists metaphysical speculation about the constitution of the soul; focus is on theological testimony rather than philosophical mechanism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Augustine, Luther, Reformation theology, and modern figures (e.g., Schleiermacher, Hegelian anthropology). Webster situates Barth against both classical medieval metaphysics (Aquinas) and 19th-century natural theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (as grounding human relationality), Creation (creatio), Providence, Imago Dei, Sin and Fall, Election, Christology, Spirit (regeneration, life), Covenant.
- **Closing line**
 - Barthian anthropology: human being is a creature known only through God's revelatory Word and Spirit in Christ - a relational, covenantal identity that resists autonomous or metaphysical reduction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Christocentric anthropology**: every statement about humanity must be anchored in Christ as the decisive event of revelation and reconciliation.
 - **Relational ontology**: the Imago Dei is primarily a relation to God, not an assemblage of capacities.
 - **Anti-speculative posture**: theological humility regarding metaphysical accounts of soul-origin or substance.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **liberal autonomy**: denies anthropology grounded in autonomous human dignity or culture.
 - Against classical **substance dualism** and speculative accounts (both certain forms of traducianism and mechanistic creationism): emphasizes creaturely dependence over mechanism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of **analogia relationis** to reframe Imago Dei debates; emphasis on **evental** rather than ontological definitions (humanity defined by God's acts).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in Reformed and ecumenical theology; spawned sustained debate on Imago Dei, sin, and reconciliation.
 - Webster and others have recuperated Barth for constructive systematic work, shaping contemporary evangelical and Reformed anthropology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust corrective to both secular reductionism and speculative metaphysics; valuable for teaching a Christocentric, covenantal anthropology that keeps soteriology central.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - human likeness to God conceived as relational capacity to be addressed and reconciled in Christ (not merely rational attributes).
- **Analogia relationis** - the image as analogy of relation: human existence is oriented toward God and neighbor.
- **Creature / creatureliness** - primary category: finitude, contingency, dependence on God's creative act.
- **Word and Spirit** - God's means of creating, sustaining, revealing, and renewing human beings; anthropology is theological testimony to these acts.
- **Christocentric anthropology** - every anthropological claim is measured against the revelation of Jesus Christ.
- **Sin / Fall (hamartia)** - not a mere privation but a relational corruption that renders human self-understanding false; anthropology is inseparable from doctrine of sin.
- **Election** - human identity is given within God's elective grace in Christ; anthropology has an eschatological orientation.
- **Person / individual** - Barth avoids metaphysical individualism; personhood is ecclesial and covenantal, realized in relation to the Triune God.
- **Traducianism vs Creationism** - Barth resists dogmatic commitment to mechanism:
 - he criticizes both **traducianism** (soul transmitted from parents) and a simplistic **creationism** (each soul separately created) as speculative;
 - he insists on the theological priority of God's creative and redemptive act and treats the origin of the soul under the umbrella of creaturely dependence rather than technical metaphysics (Webster highlights Barth's refusal to be pinned to either system).
- **Imputation / solidarity** - anthropology tied to Christ's representative work; human status is determined by Christ's righteousness and reconciling work.
- **Eschatological anthropology** - true human being is disclosed in resurrection and consummation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Christ-centered, covenantal Imago Dei in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic** against naturalistic or speculative anthropologies and for theological primacy of revelation.
- As an **exegetical model** that reads anthropological texts through Christological and Trinitarian lenses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates over personhood, sin, and the ethical implications of being made in God's image.
