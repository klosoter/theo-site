### TITLE
**Commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians - Charles Hodge (Princeton, mid-19th century)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century Princeton School; conservative Reformed milieu reacting to German higher criticism and growing liberalism.
 - Hodge writes as systematic theologian and exegete: pastoral and doctrinal aims; intended for clergy, seminarians, and informed laity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate Paul's apostolic authority and the objective content of the gospel (atonement, justification, reconciliation) against Judaizing opponents, false apostles, and contemporary skepticism; to show how suffering and weakness manifest the power of Christ.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prefatory material: authorship, date, occasion - defense of Pauline authorship and historical setting (Corinthian controversies).
 - Exegetical traversal: close, verse-by-verse exposition combining Greek philology and doctrinal interpretation.
 - Thematic syntheses interspersed:
 - Paul's defense of ministry and authority (chaps. 1-7).
 - Theology of reconciliation and the new covenant (chaps. 5-7).
 - Collection for Jerusalem and ethical exhortation (chap. 8-9).
 - Defense against slander and vindication of apostleship (chap. 10-13).
 - Final pastoral application: implications for church order, Christian suffering, almsgiving, and pastoral integrity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul and the Corinthian opponents ("false apostles").
 - Sources: Greek text and classical philology, patristic and Reformed commentators (notably Calvin), and contemporary German scholarship (critique and selective appropriation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration; Pauline apostolic authority; justification and reconciliation; atonement and imputation; union with Christ; sanctification and Christian suffering; ecclesiology and ministry; Christian charity (offering).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Hodge presents 2 Corinthians as a defense of the objective gospel - a gospel whose truth is proven in Christ's reconciling work and whose power is manifest most clearly through weakness and suffering in faithful ministry.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the objectivity of the gospel (doctrine over mere religious experience); the paradox of divine power in human weakness is central.
 - Integration of close exegesis with systematic theology: passages are read to confirm Reformed loci (justification, union with Christ, substitutionary atonement).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Polemical correction of German higher criticism and romantic pietism: rejects purely subjective or naturalistic readings of Paul.
 - Contrasts with more mystical readings by emphasizing forensic and covenantal categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No radical neologisms; rather, sustained reapplication of Reformed categories to Pauline rhetoric (e.g., consistently reading "ministry" and "reconciliation" in covenantal-forensic terms).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in 19th- and early 20th-century Reformed and evangelical circles; standard Princeton exegetical resource.
 - Influenced preachers and systematicians who sought to marry exegetical precision to confessional theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Exemplifies a careful historical-grammatical method married to confessional theology.
 - Useful model for defending apostolic authority, teaching on suffering and ministry, and conservative Pauline exegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reconciliation**
 - Central Pauline theme; Hodge treats it as forensic restoration between God and sinner effected by Christ's atoning work.
- **Justification**
 - Read in covenantal-forensic terms; not reduced to moral transformation but remains declarative and imputed.
- **Apostolic authority**
 - Hodge defends Paul's unique commission; authority proven by suffering, fidelity to gospel, and divine attestation.
- **Ministry (diakonia)**
 - Understood as stewardship of the mysteries; ethical and sacrificial, not a claim to worldly honor.
- **Suffering and weakness**
 - The paradoxical locus of divine power; Hodge emphasizes theological significance over mere psychological consolation.
- **Treasures in earthen vessels**
 - Phrase used to show gospel power dwelling in fragile ministers; illustrates doctrine of means and God's sovereignty.
- **Ministry of the Spirit vs. ministry of death**
 - Contrast used to distinguish new covenant efficacy from the letter that kills; Hodge stresses objective new covenant realities.
- **Letters of recommendation / boasting**
 - Rhetorical motifs Hodge explicates as markers of Paul's authentic apostolic defense.
- **Collection for Jerusalem**
 - Treated as moral theology: Christian charity as evidence of gospel reality and unity between Jew and Gentile.
- **False apostles / Judaizers**
 - Described and refuted; used to delineate boundaries of orthodoxy and legitimate ministry.
- **Vindication**
 - Recurrent theme: Paul's vindication both before God and the Corinthian church is theological and pastoral.
- **Inspiration**
 - Assumes and defends supernatural inspiration against skeptical critique; grounds authority for exegesis.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a conservative exegetical model for Pauline theology and pastoral application.
 - As a polemical resource against higher criticism and liberal theological readings.
 - As a definitional source for Reformed treatments of justification, reconciliation, and ministry ethics.
