### TITLE
Tractationes Theologicae (selected tractations, esp. on justification and covenant) - Theodore Beza

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 16th to early 17th century Reformed Geneva; product of post-Calvinian consolidation and polemic against Roman Catholic casuistry and emergent Arminian tendencies. Intended for academical instruction at the Geneva Academy and for Reformed polemics across Europe.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To defend and systematize the Reformed understanding of **justification by faith alone** within a federative (covenantal) framework: that sinners are declared righteous solely on account of Christ's obedience and satisfaction, received by faith, not by the law or intrinsic merit.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical opening on key Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) to establish the scriptural warrant for imputation and forensic declaration.
 - Doctrinal propositions that distinguish **forensic justification** from sanctification and inner renewal.
 - Explication of federal (covenantal) relations between God and humanity: role of covenant of works (law) and covenant of grace (gospel) in mediating status before God.
 - Polemic sections directed at Catholic doctrine of infused righteousness and merits, and at any compromise that makes works the ground of justification.
 - Practical and pastoral applications: assurance, sacramental use, and the believer's duty as fruit of justification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin as primary theological precedent; frequent engagement with Roman Catholic theologians (Jesuits, Tridentine formulations), occasional dialogue with Lutheran formulations (especially on imputation vs. inherent righteousness), and later Reformed interlocutors concerned with covenantal formulations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification, imputation of Christ's righteousness, covenant theology (works/grace), law-gospel distinction, sanctification vs justification, Christology (obedience and satisfaction), sacraments as visible seals.
- **Closing line capturing centre of gravity:** Beza's tractations press a rigorous forensic-covenantal scheme: sinners are declared righteous by the legal exchange effected in Christ and apprehended by faith; the law convicts but the gospel absolves.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - A sharpened forensic vocabulary: clear separation of **legal status** (positional righteousness) from **moral renewal** (progressive sanctification).
 - Strong federative language about covenantal representation - Christ as the Surety whose obedience and suffering are federally imputed to believers.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic insistence on infused righteousness and merits by arguing those confuse justification's ground (Christ's obedience) with its fruit (good works).
 - Tends to secure Calvin's insights against Lutheran ambiguity about the relation of alien/infused righteousness and the imputation question.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of covenantal categories to explain Pauline soteriology; clearer linking of law-gospel distinction to covenantal contracts (law as covenantal demand, gospel as covenantal promise).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed academies; influenced Continental Reformed orthodoxy, English Puritan expositions, and Dutch Reformed theology.
 - Served as a reference point in later controversies on imputation, assurance, and the covenantal ordering of soteriology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable exemplar of post-Reformation scholastic method applied to justification and covenant.
 - Provides a compact polemical articulation of Reformed law-gospel contrasts that remains instructive for doctrinal and pastoral questions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration by God that a sinner is righteous; ground is Christ's obedience and satisfaction, received by faith.
- **Imputation:** The crediting of Christ's righteousness (positive) and believers' sins (negative) to Christ's account; central to forensic righteousness.
- **Forensic/Forensical language:** Legal categories (condemnation, absolution, acquittal) used to describe soterial transactions.
- **Covenant of Works:** Prelapsarian legal covenant emphasizing obedience as ground of life; used to explain law's demand and humanity's failure.
- **Covenant of Grace:** Divine promise mediated in Christ securing salvation by faith; frames gospel administration and sacraments.
- **Law-Gospel Distinction:** Law sets forth God's demand and reveals sin; gospel announces the promise and pardon through Christ - Beza emphasizes their distinct functions.
- **Union with Christ:** Federal and spiritual union whereby benefits (righteousness, life) are communicated to believers; basis for imputation.
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** Christ's lifelong obedience (active) and suffering/death (passive) both counted to believers for justification.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive moral renewal distinguished from justification; necessary fruit and evidence but not ground.
- **Merit and Satisfaction:** Rejection of human merit as basis; Christ's satisfaction is the sole efficacious meritorious cause.
- **Absolution:** Declarative act of God pronouncing pardon; tied to covenantal promise and forensic imputation.
- **Seal/Sign of the Covenant:** Sacraments function as visible assurances of gospel promises, not as conferring inherent righteousness.
- **Use across loci:**
 - **Definition source:** Clear statements for the Reformed definition of justification and imputation.
 - **Polemic tool:** Frequent deployment against Roman Catholic and heterodox Protestant positions.
 - **Exegetical model:** Serves as a template for reading Pauline soteriology through covenantal and law-gospel lenses.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Used in systematic theology to connect Christology, soteriology, and covenant doctrine.
