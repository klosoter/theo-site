### TITLE
Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament (2006) - John H. Walton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2006 amid intensified evangelical interest in Genesis, creation-science debates, and growing access to ANE primary texts and philological studies.
 - Walton writes from an evangelical scholarly context aiming to reconcile faithful biblical exegesis with ANE comparative data and contemporary science-theology tensions.

- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis (especially Genesis 1) must be read through the conceptual lens of ANE thought: it is primarily a book about **function, role, and divine ordering** (a functional ontology), not a modern material account of origins. The days of creation are inaugurative assignments of function and status rather than descriptions of material origins.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological premise: textual meaning is best recovered by understanding ancient Near Eastern conceptual categories and literary conventions.
 - Major moves:
 - Demonstrates parallels between biblical language and ANE temple/creation motifs (e.g., Enuma Elish, cosmic-temple imagery).
 - Analyses Genesis 1 as an inauguration/temple-consecration schema: creation = ordering and assigning functions.
 - Reinterprets key theological loci (image of God, human vocation, the Fall, covenant) in ANE functional terms rather than primarily Western substance-metaphysical categories.
 - Engages contemporary interpreters and theologians (notably Meredith G. Kline) to compare covenantal and intrusion frameworks with Walton's functional reading.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary ANE material: Enuma Elish, Atrahasis, Ugaritic and Egyptian creation texts; biblical texts (Genesis 1-3, Psalms, Sinai tradition).
 - Scholarly interlocutors: Meredith G. Kline (covenant/intrusion model), traditional evangelical commentators who read Genesis as material origins, and broader ANE scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (cosmology; days of creation), anthropology (image of God; human vocation), sin and its effects (the Fall and consequences), covenantal categories, revelation (genre and communicative intent).
- **Closing line**
 - Walton reframes Genesis as divine assignment and temple inauguration: theological meaning is found in function and status rather than in modern materialist categories.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Functional ontology**: beings are defined by what they do (function/status) not primarily by what they are materially.
 - **Cosmic temple motif**: creation as God's enthronement and the cosmos as his temple; the sabbath as liturgical culmination.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that treat Genesis 1 as a scientific/material origin account, and against readings that uncritically import modern metaphysics into ancient texts.
 - Engages and modifies Klinean covenant/intrusion perspectives by reframing "violation" of Eden more in terms of failure to perform assigned functions than primarily juridical-covenantal breach (Walton sees overlap but emphasizes ANE role-language).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized "functional ontology" in Genesis studies; foregrounded "assignment" and "consecration" language for creation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and academic circles; became a touchstone for those seeking to harmonize Genesis with science without abandoning theological seriousness.
 - Provoked critique from some conservatives who fear erosion of traditional doctrines (original sin, material creation), and from some scholars who question over-systematizing ANE parallels.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust methodological model for reading ancient texts on their own terms and for rethinking theological categories (especially creation, image, and human vocation) in light of ANE context.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Functional ontology** - The central hermeneutical claim: biblical categories denote function/role/status rather than primarily material substance.
- **Cosmic temple / enthronement** - Creation narrative as divine inauguration of a temple-world where God takes up rulership.
- **Days of Creation (interpretive site use)** - Walton reads the "days" as **functional assignments** (ordering and commissioning) culminating in liturgical rest rather than chronological material origins.
- **Creation as assignment / inauguration** - Creation described as God assigning roles and functions to cosmic elements and living beings.
- **Image of God (functional reading)** - Being the imago Dei denotes delegated function/authority to represent and rule, not merely an ontological trait.
- **The Fall and its consequences (interpretive site use)** - Sin understood as failure to perform given functions and a disruption of created order and relational status; consequences are vocational/functional and communal rather than solely ontological loss of status (Walton holds humans remain image-bearers but impaired in role).
- **Covenant form / treaty vocabulary** - Use of ANE treaty and covenant forms to illuminate biblical covenant language without collapsing Genesis into later legal models.
- **Intrusion ethics / Klinean covenant framework (interpretive site use)** - Walton engages Meredith G. Kline's model of creation-covenant and "intrusion"; he acknowledges kinship but reframes the Fall as primarily a functional/institutional breakdown rather than only a juridical intrusion.
- **Order vs. material origins** - Key contrast to elucidate how ancient authors addressed "why things are" in terms of order and purpose, not material genesis.
- **Sabbath as cosmic liturgy** - Sabbath functionally consummates creation as worshipable temple.
- **Primeval history genre** - Emphasis on how literary form shapes theological intent.
- **Use across theological loci**
 - Employed as a **definition source** for "functional" readings of creation and imago Dei.
 - Used **polemically** against literalist/materialist interpretations in science-theology debates.
 - Adopted as an **exegetical model** for Genesis 1-3 and for reinterpreting anthropology, sin, and covenant theology in light of ANE conceptual patterns.
