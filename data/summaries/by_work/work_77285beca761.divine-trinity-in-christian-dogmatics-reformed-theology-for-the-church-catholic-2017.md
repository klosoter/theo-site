### TITLE
**Divine Trinity** - chapter in Christian Dogmatics: Reformed Theology for the Church Catholic (2017), Scott R. Swain.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed systematic theology, published within a multi-author Christian Dogmatics project (2017).
 - Aimed at situating classical Trinitarian doctrine within confessional Reformed commitments and catholic (ecumenical) patristic resources.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The economy of God (God's acts in history) is not a merely modal or functional manifestation separate from the inner life of God; rather, the economic revelation discloses the immanent Trinity. A robust Reformed account must avoid both modalism and a sharp ontological/economic split that fractures divine simplicity and covenantal theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Articulates the classical distinctions (ousia/hypostasis; immanent/economic) while insisting on their disciplined identity: what God does (economy) reveals who God is (immanent life).
 - Reconstructs Trinitarian doctrine starting from Scripture and patristic orthodoxy, then integrates Reformed resources (Calvin, Reformation confessions) and scholastic clarifications to defend divine simplicity and personal distinctions.
 - Stakes theological consequences for Christology, soteriology, and covenantal thought: the Son's mediatorial work corresponds to his eternal personhood; economic acts are not mere temporary roles.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on patristic (Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Augustine), Reformation (Calvin), and post-Reformation scholastic formulations.
 - Engages contemporary discussions: Barthian emphases on revelation, modern social-trinitarian proposals, and analytic debates about ontological vs economic distinctions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation, divine simplicity, procession (generation/spiration), Christology (incarnation and the Son's person), covenant and redemption as Trinitarian acts.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The triune God revealed in the economy is the same God of the immanent life: faithful Reformed theology must hold the economy as revelatory of, not dissociated from, the inner life of the Trinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes the *identity* of economic and immanent realities while preserving real personal distinctions - a calibrated retrieval of classical orthodoxy within Reformed dogmatics.
 - Prioritizes covenantal and redemptive-historical implications of Trinitarian personhood (the Son and Spirit are active participants in covenantal mediation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects tendencies toward a sharp ontological/economic bifurcation that detaches the inner life of God from God's revelatory acts.
 - Pushes back against both modalist simplifications and social-trinitarian models that risk making the persons quasi-independent divine centers.
 - Dialogues critically with Barthian stresses on revelation while reclaiming patristic categories to secure a stable metaphysical grounding (divine simplicity and relations of origin).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of classical terms (economic/immanent, ousia/hypostasis) reframed for Reformed systematic use-less speculative division, more theological correlation between revelation and being.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among contemporary Reformed and evangelical theologians seeking a classical Trinitarian theology that supports confessional and pastoral commitments.
 - Used as a corrective resource in debates over social trinitarianism and ontological subordination.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, pedagogical bridge between patristic classicalism and Reformed dogmatic concerns - useful for seminaries, pastors, and students wrestling with Trinity-Christology-covenant integration.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed and acting in history (Father sending Son and Spirit); Swain: authoritative disclosure of immanent life.
- **Immanent (Ontological) Trinity**
 - The inner life and relations of God apart from creation; Swain insists on identity with the economic insofar as revelation is true.
- **Ontological vs Economic Trinity (topic)**
 - The debate over whether the immanent life is distinct or identical with the economic revelation. Swain rejects a sharp split and affirms the economy as genuinely revelatory of being.
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God is not compositionally complex; Swain shows how simplicity undergirds a non-atomistic Trinitarianism that avoids making persons separate gods.
- **Ousia / Hypostasis**
 - Substance/being and persons; classical categories rehabilitated for Reformed clarity about unity and distinction.
- **Eternal Relations (generation, spiration)**
 - Relations of origin grounding personal distinctions; used to secure real personhood without metaphysical composition.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling)**
 - Describes interpersonal unity-in-difference; Swain uses it carefully to avoid confusing persons or erasing distinction.
- **Appropriation**
 - The customary linking of particular works to particular persons (e.g., Father begets, Son redeems, Spirit sanctifies) - affirmed, but within total divine unity.
- **Revelation / Economy as epistemic center**
 - Revelation is primary warrant for speaking of God's inner life; Swain holds Scripture as decisive for orthodoxy about the immanent Trinity.
- **Christological implications**
 - The Son's eternal personhood secures the personal union in the incarnation; economic actions of the Son correlate to his immanent identity.
- **Covenantal application**
 - Trinitarian persons are actors in covenantal history; theological articulation supports sacramental and ecclesial life.
- **Anti-social-Trinitarian pivot**
 - Use as a polemic against models that over-personalize or politicize intra-Trinitarian relations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise definitional source on the relation of economic and immanent Trinity in systematic theology.
 - As a polemical resource against social-trinitarian and ontological-subordination positions.
 - As an exegetical-modeling aid for linking biblical economy (sending, incarnation, resurrection, Spirit) to orthodox formulations of person and being.
