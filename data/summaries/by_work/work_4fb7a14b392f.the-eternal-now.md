### TITLE
**The Eternal Now - Paul Tillich**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Protestant existential theology (post‑WWII). Tillich writes from the inter‑war and post‑war crisis of meaning, deploying existentialist and Hegelian resources; addresses a theological audience wrestling with secularization, historicity, and ultimate concern.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The decisive religious moment is the "eternal now" - an ontological and eschatological presence of God that breaks into temporal existence to effect new being. Eschatology is not merely future expectation but present transformation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Framework: correlation of existential human questions and Christian answers (method of correlation).
 - Diagnosis: secular temporality produces estrangement and anxiety; traditional future‑oriented eschatology can appear external or deferred.
 - Proposal: conceive God as the "eternal present" (eternal now) - the ground of being whose presence actualizes redemption here and now while consummating the future.
 - Consequence: resurrection, final judgment, baptism of the Spirit, sacraments, and sanctification are reinterpreted as real ontological acts that disclose new being in time.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages Heideggerian existential analysis, Hegelian dialectic, Bultmannian demythologizing, and critiques of Barthian revelation and conservative literalism; draws from biblical eschatological imagery but reframes symbolically.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (individual and cosmic), Pneumatology (Spirit as actualizing presence), Christology (Christ as manifestation of the eternal present), Anthropology (new being, regeneration, indwelling), Ecclesiology & Sacraments (means of grace as existential signs), Final judgment and resurrection as ontologizing events.
- **Closing line:** The work centers on God as the ontological "eternal now" that simultaneously fulfills future hope and effects present transformation - eschatology realized as new being in the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Eschatology reframed as an ontological event rather than primarily chronological future: the eschaton is present as transformative presence.
 - Prioritizes existential categories (conflict, estrangement, courage, faith) over propositional doctrinal formulations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves beyond Barthian emphasis on historical revelation by stressing ontological presence; critiques Bultmann where demythologizing risks emptying hope of ontological efficacy.
 - Rejects simplistic futurism and pietistic inwardness; insists on a link between cosmic renewal and concrete existential change.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Eternal Now" as theological category marrying eternity and temporal immediacy.
 - "New Being" (neues Sein) as theological anthropology: regeneration conceived ontologically rather than merely ethically or juridically.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in liberal, neo‑orthodox, and progressive Protestant circles; shaped pastoral theology, existential hermeneutics, and theological anthropology.
 - Criticized by conservative Reformed theologians for metaphysical language, alleged downplaying of forensic soteriology and propositional revelation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable for courses on modern eschatology, pneumatology, and theological method; a pivotal resource for rethinking how future hope governs present praxis and ecclesial life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Now:** God as present ground of being whose presence actualizes eschatological reality in the present.
- **Ground of Being:** Ontological foundation (not a being among beings) that sustains temporality and allows new being to emerge.
- **Correlation Method:** Theological method correlating existential questions with Christian answers; frames Tillich's argument for the eternal present.
- **New Being / Regeneration:** Regeneration as ontological transformation - the Spirit brings new existence rather than merely moral reform.
 - Relates to **Regeneration And Indwelling**: indwelling is the Spirit's presence that constitutes new being.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit:** Interpreted as existential incorporation into the eternal now; experiential and ontological initiation rather than ritual magic.
- **Means of Grace (Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer):** Seen as symbolic-real events that open persons to the eternal present and effect new being.
 - Links to **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** sacramental acts mediate the Spirit's presentizing work.
- **Resurrection and New Creation:** Resurrection read as ontological victory over estrangement; points to realized and consummated new creation.
 - Connects with **Resurrection And New Creation** and **New Heavens And New Earth**: cosmic renewal conceived as transformation of being.
- **Final Judgment and Eternal States:** Judgment interpreted existentially - disclosure of ultimate orientation (acceptance or rejection) in the eternal now rather than a future mechanical sentencing.
- **Individual and Cosmic Eschatology:** Tight coupling of personal transformation and cosmic consummation; personal new being participates in cosmic redemption.
- **Spiritual Gifts and Sanctification:** Gifts as manifestations of the Spirit's presentizing power; sanctification as progressive participation in new being.
- **Anthropology & Doctrine of Creation:** Creation as ontologically open to consummation; human destiny is participation in the ground of being through the eternal now.
- **Christology:** Christ as the decisive self‑disclosure of the eternal present; the historical event that actualizes the eschatological now.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** for reinterpreting eschatology and pneumatology in ontological, existential terms.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical eschatological language symbolically while retaining ontological efficacy.
- As a **polemic** against both futurist pietism and rigid doctrinal literalism; employed in critiques of narrow forensic soteriology.
- As a **definition source** for courses on modern theology, especially when contrasting existential and propositional approaches to hope, judgment, and renewal.
