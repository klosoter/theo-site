### TITLE
The Ground of Union: Deification in Aquinas and Calvin (Michael Allen, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2011 amid renewed ecumenical interest in classical theism, patristic deification (theosis), and Reformation retrieval. Engages both historical theology and systematic retrieval within an evangelical/Reformed academy.
 - Moves between medieval scholastic metaphysics (Aquinas) and early Reformed covenantal/union theology (Calvin), reading each on its own terms while arguing for a substantive continuity.

- **Central thesis**
 - Aquinas and Calvin, despite differing metaphysical vocabularies, locate the "ground of union" with Christ in a real participatory transformation (deification) mediated by grace and Spirit; Allen argues that Calvin is not merely forensic or legalistic but affirms a genuine ontological participation comparable to Aquinas, though grounded differently.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Exposition of Aquinas - ontology of participation, sanctifying grace as habitual participation in divine life, formative role of sacraments and charity.
 - Part II: Exposition of Calvin - union with Christ as covenantal/communion reality, role of Spirit, sacraments, and justification as the social and relational ground of participation.
 - Part III: Comparison and synthesis - isolates the "grounding" question (what makes union efficacious?) and shows both traditions provide a substantive ground for deification while diverging on metaphysical language and locus (habitual grace vs. covenantal union).
 - Methodological moves:
 - Implements a historically sensitive comparative theology (invokes **Rahner's Rule** as a hermeneutical heuristic to read each tradition's latent resources).
 - Engages Karl Barth's critique/reformulation of deification to test whether Calvin's framework resists claims of mere forensicism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas (Summa theologica, scriptural commentary), John Calvin (Institutes, sermons, commentaries).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Karl Barth (as critic/re-framer of deification), Karl Rahner (methodological heuristic), contemporary scholars in Reformed and patristic studies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (participation in Trinitarian life)
 - Christology (union with Christ, communicatio idiomatum)
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, deification)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as agent of union)
 - Sacramentology (means by which participation is effected)

- **Closing line**
 - Allen's theological center: **Union with Christ grounds genuine deification; Aquinas and Calvin offer complementary, not antithetical, accounts of how grace and Spirit effect participatory transformation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes Calvin not primarily as an opponent of deification but as a theologically credible proponent, with union and the Spirit securing real participation.
 - Insists on the question of the *ground* of union (what ontological or relational basis makes union efficacious) rather than merely its fruits.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that set Aquinas's metaphysical participation against Calvin's forensic model; instead shows parallel concerns (how finite creatures partake in divine life).
 - Contrasts Aquinas's habit/essence language with Calvin's covenantal/communion language and locates the theological consequences of that divergence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advocates a cross-traditional taxonomy: **ground (foundational basis)** vs **mode (how union is effected)** vs **fruit (deification outcomes)** - helpful terminological tool for comparative theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed theologians seeking to reclaim a richer soteriology (participation, sanctification) without abandoning forensic justification.
 - Used in ecumenical dialogues that aim to bridge scholastic and Reformed vocabularies on sanctification and theosis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a measured, scholarly corrective to simplistic taxonomy (Aquinas = deification, Calvin = legalism), valuable for seminars on union with Christ, Reformation retrieval, and constructive theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ground of union**
 - The foundational basis that makes union with Christ metaphysically/relationally efficacious (habitual grace, covenantal communion).

- **Deification (theosis)**
 - Participation in divine life; not identity with God's essence but real transformation by grace.

- **Participation (participatio)**
 - Aquinas' metaphysical language for creatures sharing in divine perfections through grace.

- **Habitual grace**
 - Aquinas' account of an ingrained disposition by which souls are made capable of divine life.

- **Covenantal union**
 - Calvin's relational account: union grounded in covenantal election, Spirit-mediated communion, and the Word/sacramental bond.

- **Justification vs. Sanctification**
 - Allen stresses their union: justification secures relational status; sanctification reflects the participatory reality that flows from union.

- **Pneumatological mediation**
 - The Spirit as the agent who effects and maintains deifying union in both traditions.

- **Sacramental instrumentality**
 - Means (Word/sacrament) by which the ground of union is applied and sustained.

- **Rahner's Rule**
 - Methodological heuristic Allen uses to read latent theological coherence across traditions rather than impose categories from one onto another.

- **Barth's Reformulation**
 - Barth's shift to a strictly Christocentric, revelation-first vocabulary; invoked as a foil to test whether Calvin's model is properly participatory or merely forensic.

- **Ground vs. Mode vs. Fruit**
 - Terminological triad Allen employs to clarify comparative claims.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Christological principle relevant for accounts of participation and how human creatures partake in divine life through Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "ground of union" in contemporary systematic and historical theology.
 - As a **polemic/resource** in Reformed retrieval projects arguing Calvinian compatibility with theosis.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading doctrinal trajectories without collapsing distinctives into homogeneity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** when teaching the interrelation of justification, sanctification, and union with Christ.
