### TITLE
Taking God at His Word (2014) - Kevin DeYoung

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the early 21st-century American evangelical milieu amid renewed debates over biblical authority, inerrancy, and hermeneutics. Addresses concerns arising from liberal criticism, cultural accommodation, and postmodern relativism within Protestantism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians must accept the Bible as the authoritative, trustworthy Word of God; doing so is decisive for right doctrine and for genuine sanctification. Denying Scripture's authority undercuts the gospel and Christian life.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: widespread casual or skeptical treatment of Scripture in contemporary Christianity.
 - Theological defense: Scripture as divine speech - authoritative, trustworthy, and sufficient for faith and life.
 - Hermeneutical prescription: adopt a plain, grammatical-historical reading that respects genre and context.
 - Practical outworking: submission to Scripture yields repentance, faith, and progressive sanctification; Scripture forms church teaching and individual obedience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Appeals to classical Protestant authorities (confessions and Reformers implicitly), contemporary evangelical defenders of inerrancy (e.g., Warfield in background), and critiques of liberal critics and relativistic postmoderns. Uses pastoral anecdotes and biblical exegesis rather than heavy academic polemics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (primary), authority, sufficiency and clarity (perspicuity) of Scripture, hermeneutics, implications for sanctification, gospel and obedience, ecclesial practice.
- **Closing line capturing theological gravity:** Taking God at His word is both the condition for true Christian faith and the engine of sustained, gospel-shaped sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents Scripture foremost as divine speech - not merely ancient literature but God addressing his people - which grounds both epistemology and praxis.
 - Marries apologetic for inerrancy with pastoral application: authority is not an abstract doctrine but the basis for repentance and holiness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against liberal and postmodern tendencies to relativize or historicize away biblical commands, arguing this weakens conversion and sanctification.
 - Contrasts with lower-critical or purely literary approaches by insisting the Bible intends to be understood as true and normative.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Less novelty in terminology; notable is the crisp framing of "taking God at his word" as both epistemic trust and moral submission - a compact slogan linking doctrine and life.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles for lay and pastoral formation; popularized semester-long or small-group studies in churches.
 - Criticized by liberal scholars for upholding inerrancy and by some evangelicals for under-engaging complex historical-critical issues.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Durable resource for teaching the doctrine of Scripture in pastoral, parish, and introductory seminary contexts.
 - Valuable for linking biblical authority directly to the theology and practice of sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture as Divine Speech:** Bible described as God speaking; obligates hearers to assent and obey.
- **Inerrancy / Trustworthiness:** Scripture is reliable in all it affirms; foundation for doctrinal certainty.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture:** Scripture contains what is necessary for faith and life; no equal competitor for norms of sanctification.
- **Perspicuity / Clarity:** Bible is suitably clear for its central purposes (faith and obedience), though requires careful reading.
- **Grammatical-historical (plain) reading:** Hermeneutic advocated - respect genre, context, and ordinary sense.
- **Authority:** Scripture's commands are binding; authority is practical, not merely propositional assent.
- **Obedience as response:** Taking God at his word yields repentance and progressive sanctification; obedience is evidential and formative.
- **Definitive and Progressive Sanctification:** 
 - **Definitive:** positional realities (justification/union with Christ) grounded in declarative Word.
 - **Progressive:** ongoing growth shaped and disciplined by Scripture's commands and promises.
- **Word and Sacrament/Ecclesial practice:** Scripture shapes preaching, catechesis, and corporate formation.
- **Plain Reading vs. Cultural Accommodation:** Tension between reading the Bible straightforwardly and reinterpreting to fit contemporary norms.
- **Gospel centrality:** Scriptural authority is anchored in the gospel; Scripture calls sinners to faith in Christ.
- **Pastoral Hermeneutics:** Emphasizes application-oriented exegesis for sanctification and church life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for teaching the doctrine of Scripture in systematic and pastoral theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against liberalizing or relativizing readings of the Bible in ecclesial disputes.
- As an **exegetical model** for pastors seeking to connect text, trust, and obedience in sermon and discipleship.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking affirmation of Scripture's authority to both definitive and progressive aspects of sanctification.
