### TITLE
Theological Perspectives on Open Theism - Peter A. Lillback (lectures and essays)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Reformed response to the rise of Open Theism (notably work of Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Gregory Boyd). Lillback writes from conservative Reformed, confessional commitments within an evangelical academic and pastoral milieu.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Open Theism's claim that God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free actions undermines classical doctrines (sovereignty, immutability, covenantal assurance). Lillback argues that the proper Reformed corrective is to affirm **divine condescension** (God's voluntary accommodation) rather than claimed epistemic limitation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnoses open theist moves as motivated by pastoral and relational concerns (genuine relationship, risk, prayer) but methodologically driven by anthropomorphic readings of Scripture.
 - Reasserts classical attributes: exhaustive foreknowledge, immutability, and providential sovereignty as coherent and biblical.
 - Reframes the pastoral aims of open theism within **condescension**: God may relationally accommodate and speak in temporal, responsive terms without forfeiting exhaustive knowledge or sovereign control.
 - Uses exegetical contests over key texts (e.g., God's repentance in Genesis, forecasting in the prophets, kenotic language in Christ) to argue for accommodational readings rather than epistemic limitation.
 - Concludes: genuine relationality and prayerful engagement are preserved by divine self‑accommodation, not by denying omniscience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** primary interlocutors are contemporary open theists (Pinnock, Sanders, Boyd, Hasker). Appeals to classical and Reformed authorities (Calvin, Westminster tradition, classical theists), and scriptural exegesis across Genesis, Psalms, Prophets, and New Testament kenosis passages.
- **Doctrines treated:** divine attributes (omniscience, immutability, simplicity), providence, foreknowledge, covenant theology (assurance and promise), revelation and accommodation, Christology (kenosis and condescension), prayer and divine‑human interaction.
- **Closing line:** The work's center of gravity: defend the biblical and confessional conviction that God sovereignly, knowably, and immutably governs history while condescending to creatures in speech and covenantal engagement - thereby answering pastoral aims raised by Open Theism without surrendering classical doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Elevates **divine condescension** as the primary hermeneutical and theological tool to reconcile Scripture's anthropic language with classical theism.
 - Prioritizes covenantal continuity: God's promises presuppose exhaustive foreknowledge and therefore cannot coherently rest on a God who is epistemically surprised by the future.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects open theist appeals to relational authenticity by showing that genuine relationship does not require divine ignorance; rather, God's condescension can create space for genuine creaturely freedom without epistemic limitation.
 - Pushes back against kenotic readings that treat Christ's incarnation as forfeiture of divine knowledge; instead reads kenosis as functional/volitional self‑limitation consistent with omniscience.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts pastoral concerns (risk, prayer, suffering) into a theological grammar of **accommodation vs. ontological diminution** - accommodation preserves attributes while adapting revelatory language.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely received among conservative Reformed and evangelical critics of Open Theism as a clear, pastorally aware rebuttal.
 - Open theists critique Lillback for preserving a seemingly abstract God; dialogue continues over exegetical points and pastoral implications.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful exemplar of integrating confessional theology, exegesis, and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Serves as a compact refutation-model for seminarians and pastors encountering Open Theist claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism:** The view that the future contains real possibilities unknown exhaustively to God; used as the primary foil.
- **Divine Condescension:** God's voluntary accommodation in revelation and relation; central constructive category for preserving both intimacy and divine sovereignty.
- **Omniscience (Exhaustive Foreknowledge):** Affirmed as essential; argued to be compatible with genuine creaturely freedom via condescension.
- **Immutability:** Defended against motes of temporal change proposed by open theists; maintained while allowing relational responsiveness in language, not ontology.
- **Providence:** God's effective governance of events; argued to be incompatible with an epistemically limited deity.
- **Covenantal Assurance:** The theological stake - promises and gospel assurance presuppose a God who knows and will secure future events.
- **Kenosis (Incarnational Self‑Limitation):** Treated functionally: Christ's/Homoousios condescension does not entail loss of divine attributes.
- **Accommodation:** Hermeneutical category explaining anthropomorphic and temporal language about God without attributing metaphysical limitation.
- **Foreknowledge vs. Predestination:** Distinction underscored to show foreknowledge need not negate human responsibility.
- **Relationality (Divine‑Human Interaction):** Emphasized as preserved through condescension, not via the open theist's epistemic revision.
- **Prayer (Theology of Prayer):** Used pastorally to argue that meaningful prayer is compatible with divine foreknowledge and sovereignty.
- **Anthropomorphism:** Diagnosed as methodological error when taken as literal metaphysics; corrected by appeal to accommodation.
- **Temporal Openness / Contingency:** Characterized as theological problem raised by Open Theism and resolved, per Lillback, by distinguishing epistemic language from ontological reality.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and polemical source** against Open Theism in systematic theology and apologetics.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading anthropomorphic and kenotic passages via accommodation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology: preserving prayerful intimacy without conceding divine omniscience.
