### TITLE
**Emil Brunner - The Christian Doctrine of God (1946)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post-World War II Protestant theology (1946). Brunner as a leading Swiss Reformed neo-orthodox voice reacting to 19th-century liberalism and in sustained debate with Karl Barth.
 - Milieu: recovery of revelation-centred theology while engaging modern philosophy, biblical scholarship, and Reformed patrimony.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God is known only in divine self‑disclosure (revelation) yet human beings possess a created "point of contact" that permits genuine knowledge of God; theology must preserve both God's transcendence and personal self‑presence in covenantal encounter.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Exposition of revelation as the decisive datum for theology: revelation is eventful, personal, and kerygmatic rather than merely propositional or speculative.
 - Critical engagement with natural theology: defense of a limited, real "point of contact" (Anknüpfungspunkt) in human nature through which revelation finds purchase.
 - Doctrine of God proper: attributes, transcendence (God as "wholly other"), and immanence (God as personal and relational).
 - Trinitarian theology: God as three‑personed relational life; implications for revelation and human communion with God.
 - Covenant and Christocentric culmination: covenant as the form of God's self‑giving and Christ as the decisive revelation/incarnation.
 - Practical theological implications for prayer, ethics, and church doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal interlocutor: Karl Barth (notably disagreeing about natural theology).
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Reformation (Calvin), scholasticism (critique of analogia entis), and modern philosophers (existential and personalist influences).
 - Engagements with biblical theology and contemporary Protestant scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (nature, epistemology)
 - Natural theology (limited but real)
 - Trinity (relational ontology)
 - Covenant (personal, historical form of God's dealing)
 - Christology / Incarnation (decisive revelation)
 - Attributes of God, providence, and human response (faith)

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Theology of God as the account of a personal, triune God who is both absolutely transcendent and personally present, revealed decisively in covenantal history and Christ - mediated to finite creatures through accommodation but requiring faith to actualize knowledge.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong personalist tilt: God primarily as personal relation rather than abstract being.
 - "Point of contact" (Anknüpfungspunkt) as a middle way between full natural theology and strict revelation-only positions.
 - Covenant as the hermeneutical form of divine self‑disclosure (aligns with but nuances Reformed covenantal categories; see Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Karl Barth: rejects Barth's wholesale dismissal of any natural knowledge of God; maintains a genuine albeit damaged human capacity to receive revelation.
 - Against scholastic analogia entis: resists equating creaturely being with divine being; insists on accommodation and historical revelation rather than ontological continuity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the German Anknüpfungspunkt in anglophone theology as "point of contact."
 - Framing revelation as an eventful, incarnational encounter rather than only propositional disclosure.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Fueled one of the mid-century's most significant Barth-Brunner debates; shaped neo‑orthodox and some evangelical receptions.
 - Adopted selectively in Reformed circles that value covenantal and personalist emphases; criticized where strict Barthian or classical Reformed positions prevail.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to overly abstract doctrines of God; valuable for integrating doctrine of revelation, incarnation, and pastoral theology.
 - Provokes ongoing discussion on limits and legitimacy of natural theology within Reformed and wider Protestant traditions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (Offenbarung)** - God's self‑disclosure as primary datum for theology; eventful and relational.
- **Point of contact (Anknüpfungspunkt)** - created human capacity through which God's revelation can be grasped; allows a qualified natural theology.
- **Accommodation** - God condescends to human finitude in revelation; central to Brunner's account of incarnation and scripture (see Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy).
- **Analogy / analogia entis** - rejected as an adequate basis; Brunner prefers relational/communicative models over ontological analogy.
- **Wholly other (ganz anders)** - emphasis on divine transcendence balanced with God's self‑presence.
- **Trinity** - relational life of God as the ground for human fellowship and covenantal revelation.
- **Covenant** - the concrete, historical form of God's self‑giving; key interpretive frame for revelation and ethics (cf. Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition).
- **Christocentrism / Incarnation** - the decisive fulfilment of revelation; incarnation exemplifies accommodation and analogy in practice.
- **Natural theology** - limited but real; must be subordinated to revelation to avoid idolatry.
- **Kerygmatic event** - revelation described in dynamic, proclamational terms rather than abstract propositions.
- **Personhood of God** - God's primary mode is personal relation, not merely metaphysical substance.
- **Faith as response** - epistemic and existential reception of revelation; not mere assent but trustful participation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the "point of contact" concept and as a model of qualified natural theology.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal naturalism and Barthian rejection of natural knowledge.
 - As an **exegetical and theological resource** for incarnational models of accommodation and for covenantal readings of divine revelation.
