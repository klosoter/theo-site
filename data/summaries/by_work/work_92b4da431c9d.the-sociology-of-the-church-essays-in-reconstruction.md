### TITLE
The Sociology of the Church: Essays in Reconstruction - James B. Jordan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed/neo-Calvinist milieu concerned with cultural renewal and ecclesial reform; dialogues overlap with theonomy/Christian Reconstruction and emerging debates later associated with the Federal Vision/monocovenantalism discussions. Addresses a perceived need to reconstruct church life after modern individualism and secular privatization.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The church must be understood and reconstituted as a covenantal social organism (household, polis, and sacramental society), not primarily as a collection of private believers. Contemporary ecclesiology has erred by atomizing faith and severing social institutions (family, polity, liturgy) from covenantal shape.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose: modern churches reflect individualism, voluntarism, and a therapeutic/consumerist ethos that undermines corporate identity and discipline.
 - Theological frame: recover a covenantal sociology that locates the church within redemptive-historical continuity, typology, and the social power of sacraments and ordinances.
 - Prescription: reshape polity, liturgy, baptismal practice, family life, and public order to reflect a sacramental, corporate covenant-reform schooling, discipline, and civic engagement accordingly.
 - Method: exegetical appeals to Old and New Testament covenant forms, use of typology and social-ontological claims about institutions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Broadly engages Reformed covenantal tradition (scriptural exegesis, patristic and Reformation insights), and is in conversation with thinkers concerned for cultural and ecclesial reconstruction. Works cited or in dialogue are those that privilege covenantal structure and corporate identity; later readers connect Jordan to debates involving Meredith G. Kline, reconstructor traditions, and Federal Vision interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (structure and sociological implications), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, discipline, polity), sacraments (baptismal inclusion, Lord's Supper), family/domestic church (oikos), law and social order, typology, and social aspects of redemption/kingdom.
- **Closing line:** The work centers on a covenantal sociology that insists the church is a public, sacramental household and social order whose life must be reconstructed from biblical covenantal patterns rather than modern individualism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats ecclesiology explicitly as a branch of social theory: the church is analyzed as a social institution shaped by covenantal and sacramental realities.
 - Strong stress on the household (oikos) as the primary locus of covenantal formation and transmission.
 - Integrates public social ordering with liturgical and sacramental practice: sacraments have social, not merely personal, efficacy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against liberal privatization of religion and pietistic individualism by restoring corporate, juridical, and familial dimensions of covenant life.
 - Challenges purely spiritualized or mystical conceptions of the church that neglect social institutions, and also rejects purely functional, sociological reductions that omit theological categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Sociology of the church" as a theological category - treating covenant structures as constitutive social forms.
 - Articulation of sacramental practice as constitutive of communal identity and social order.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Read sympathetically by those arguing for stronger covenantal continuity between Testaments; influential among readers sympathetic to reconstructionist and some Federal Vision concerns.
 - Contested by critics who see the social emphases as lending themselves to over-identification of visible structures and covenantal status.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provocative resource for courses on ecclesiology, covenant theology, and the relation of church to family and society.
 - Useful corrective to individualistic ecclesiologies and a stimulus for renewed attention to liturgy, discipline, and public order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** Central social bond defining membership, obligations, inheritance, and corporate identity; not merely personal faith.
- **Household (oikos):** Primary unit of covenant formation; locus of discipline, catechesis, and sacramental transmission.
- **Sociology of the church:** Analytical frame treating church as social institution shaped by theological categories.
- **Sacramental social order:** The claim that sacraments structure and sustain communal life and public identity.
- **Visible/invisible church:** Emphasizes visible corporate marks (discipline, sacraments, polity) as socially constitutive.
- **Baptismal inclusion:** Baptism as a social covenant sign that incorporates households and shapes communal membership.
- **Polity and discipline:** Institutional mechanisms (eldership, excommunication) seen as essential to covenant maintenance.
- **Typology and redemptive-historical continuity:** Use of Old Testament household and covenant patterns to inform New Testament ecclesial ordering.
- **Monocovenantalism (Federal Vision relevance):** Jordan's covenantal continuity and emphasis on visible corporate signs have been used in discussions that favor a single-covenant reading across redemptive history; his work is often cited and debated in Federal Vision/monocovenantalism contexts.
- **Public order / cultural mandate:** The church's role in shaping family, education, and civic life as part of covenantal reconstruction.
- **Reconstruction:** Project to reorder church and society according to biblical covenantal patterns.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for ecclesiology that prioritizes social-institutional categories (household, polity, sacraments).
- As a **polemic** against privatized, consumerist church models and for restoring discipline and corporate formation.
- As an **exegetical model** for covenantal readings of baptism, liturgy, and family practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over Federal Vision/monocovenantalism, particularly regarding covenant continuity and visible marks of the covenant.
