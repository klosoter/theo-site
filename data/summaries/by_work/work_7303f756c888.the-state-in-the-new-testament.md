### TITLE
The State in the New Testament - Oscar Cullmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century, post‑World War II Protestant scholarship; Cullmann (Lutheran New Testament scholar) writing in an ecumenical, historically oriented theological milieu concerned with church/state ethics after totalitarian collapse.
 - Engages contemporary social ethics and New Testament exegesis; responds to political theologies that either sacralize the state or withdraw the church from public responsibility.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents the state as a God‑ordained, provisional institution for temporal order and justice, *distinct* from but under the lordship of Christ; Christians owe obedience to civil authority except where it conflicts with God's kingdom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of NT texts on authority, magistracy, and civic duty (Pauline, Petrine, Johannine, and Apocalypse material).
 - The state functions legitimately within the temporal order but is not the bearer of eschatological salvation; its authority is derivative and limited.
 - Eschatological horizon: Christ's messianic kingship inaugurates the kingdom of God - the church's ultimate allegiance transcends civil loyalties.
 - Practical implication: Christian obedience, conscientious dissent, and witness are negotiated within an already/not‑yet eschatology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with New Testament corpus; methodological conversation with Bultmannian form criticism and with Barthian emphases on Christocentric sovereignty.
 - Polemically addresses both theocratic and purely secularist positions; dialogue with historical Lutheran and Reformed traditions implicitly present.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (messianic consciousness, kingly lordship), eschatology (inaugurated/realized eschatology), ecclesiology (church as witness under occupation), political theology (state, magistracy, law), providence and conscience.
 - Methodological insistence on **historia salutis** (salvation history) as the interpretive key rather than a priori doctrinal ordering.
- **Closing line**
 - Cullmann centers the NT testimony: the state is a legitimate temporal instrument under God, but the decisive reality is Christ's eschatological reign - Christians live loyally under civil order while awaiting and witnessing the kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong historical‑exegetical grounding: interprets state‑related texts in their NT and Jewish‑Roman context rather than deducing a formal two‑kingdom system.
 - Balances respect for civil authority with eschatological priority of Christ - nuance between accommodation and rebellion.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects political messianist readings that expect a national/political overthrow; shows Jesus' messianic consciousness as eschatological and not inherently political revolution.
 - Counters both radical church withdrawal from public life and attempts to sacralize state power.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Applies **historia salutis** hermeneutic to political theology: the unfolding historical action of God frames how NT texts regulate Christian political ethics.
 - Clarifies functional distinctions (magistracy vs. gospel mission) without collapsing them into separate spheres of equal eschatological status.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in mid‑century Protestant scholarship; influenced subsequent debates in Christian social ethics, political theology, and pastoral responses to authoritarian regimes.
 - Taken up cautiously in Reformed circles as an exegetical resource for a restrained civic theology; used in Lutheran contexts for pastoral guidance on state relations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a measured, textually attentive model for handling church/state questions under the eschatological priority of Christ - valuable to exegetes, ethicists, and pastors wanting to avoid both triumphalism and retreat.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God**
 - The eschatological reign inaugurated by Christ; decisive for Christian allegiance and the hermeneutic of political obedience.
- **Messianic consciousness**
 - Jesus' self‑awareness as Messiah interpreted as eschatological king, not as a call to earthly nationalist revolution.
 - Site use: clarifies Christ's role in "Christs Messianic Consciousness And Kingdom."
- **State / Magistracy**
 - The temporal authority instituted by God for order and justice, legitimate but non‑soteriological.
- **Obedience and Conscience**
 - General duty to comply with civil law, with principled refusal when laws contradict divine commands.
- **Eschatological inauguration (already / not‑yet)**
 - The kingdom is present in Christ yet awaits consummation; shapes limits of political hope and action.
- **Historia salutis**
 - Salvation history as the primary interpretive framework; priority over abstract systematic sequencing.
 - Site use: deployed in discussion of **Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis**, favoring historical unfolding over systematic ordering.
- **Ordo salutis**
 - Systematic ordering of soteriological moments; Cullmann critiques over‑systematization that abstracts from historical revelation.
- **Lordship of Christ**
 - Over both church and state; theological constraint on any absolutizing of political power.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance includes provision for the civil order; state as instrument within providential care.
- **Witness / Martyrdom**
 - Christian vocation in the public sphere, including prophetic dissent and possible suffering for gospel fidelity.
- **Realized eschatology**
 - Emphasis on concrete historical manifestation of salvation in Christ as basis for political ethics.
- **Use across loci**
 - As an **exegetical model** for NT treatment of political authority and civic ethics.
 - As a **polemic resource** against politically messianic or theocratic proposals.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology for privileging historia salutis in political theology and ecclesial practice.
