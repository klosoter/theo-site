### TITLE
Retrieving the Reformed Confession (with Michael Allen, 2008) - Scott Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century retrieval of historical Reformed theology within evangelical and confessional circles; the volume aims to reclaim classic confessional formulations for contemporary theology and church life (2008).
 - Reaction against both pietistic antinomian tendencies and revisionist proposals that blur the Reformation-era doctrine of justification and covenant.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reaffirm the classical Reformed confession that good works are the necessary and normative fruit of union with Christ but are not a basis of Christian merit or justification before God.
 - Problematizes modern revisions that either minimize the covenantal structure of soteriology or reintroduce a form of merit/condignity to human works.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical retrieval: reconstructs how Reformed confessions (Calvinian, Belgic, Westminster, Dort) locate good works within the covenant of grace.
 - Theological clarification: distinguishes types of "merit" and locates any true merit solely in Christ's person and work; human obedience has familial/disciplinary worth but not condign merit for salvation.
 - Exegetical support: reads Pauline and covenantal texts through a confessional lens to show continuity between justification by faith and the necessity of sanctification.
 - Pastoral implication: defends a robust assurance of salvation grounded in forensic imputation while upholding the indispensability and normative role of sanctified living.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary appeal to Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed standards and theologians (Calvin, Reformed confessions, classical scholastics).
 - Critical engagement with contemporary critics: Neonomian tendencies, some forms of "evangelical legalism," and revisionist readings that collapse forensic and moral categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (esp. covenant of grace), justification (imputation), sanctification, good works, merit (condign/congruent distinctions), assurance, law (moral/ceremonial/civil).
- **Closing line**
 - The work locates the Reformed center of gravity in a covenantal theology that secures justification in Christ alone while insisting that genuine union with Christ necessarily issues in sanctified obedience without attributing salvific merit to human works.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly covenantal framing: good works are argued for primarily in terms of covenantal identity and familial fitness rather than as supplementary grounds of divine favor.
 - Forensic clarity: reasserts the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness as ontologically decisive for standing before God.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived contemporary drift toward forms of Neonomianism that would make Christ's death contingent on human cooperative merit.
 - Counters antinomian tendencies by insisting that sanctification is a necessary evidence and outflow of covenant union.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes careful taxonomy of "merit" language within Reformed idiom to prevent equivocation-distinguishing relational/instrumental worth of works from any condign merit that would rival Christ.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in confessional Reformed circles for sharpening catechetical and pastoral handles on assurance, works, and covenant life.
 - Used by scholars and pastors as a corrective to both liberalizing and pietistic distortions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, teachable synthesis linking confession, exegesis, and pastoral practice on the contested relationship between good works and salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of grace** - the theological framework in which salvation, justification, and sanctification are ordered; the locus for understanding works as covenantal fruit.
- **Good works** - normative, necessary fruits of union with Christ; evidences of election and means of God-glorifying obedience, not grounds of justification.
- **Merit (condign vs. congruent)** - careful distinction:
 - **Condign merit**: true earning that would obligate God (denied for human works in salvation).
 - **Congruent/relative merit**: an accommodation notion sometimes used historically but not allowed to compromise Christ's exclusive merit.
- **Imputation** - forensic attribution of Christ's righteousness to believers; the decisive ground of acceptance before God.
- **Inherent righteousness** - the progressive, sanctified life and implanted holiness; valuable for covenant life but distinct from forensic standing.
- **Justification** - declarative act of God by which believers are acquitted on the basis of Christ's righteousness alone.
- **Sanctification** - real progressive renewal enabling good works; necessary as fruit and evidence but not meritorious for acquittal.
- **Assurance** - confidence grounded legally in imputation and pastorally in the evidential presence of good works.
- **Law (moral/civil/ceremonial)** - moral law as abiding guide for Christian life; distinctions used to argue for law's role without reverting to works-righteousness.
- **Neonomianism** - contemporary theological tendency argued against; the reconfiguration that makes obedience co-operative ground of acceptance.
- **Antinomianism** - minimized via insistence on normative covenant obedience.
- **Forensic vs. familial categories** - recurrent analytic pair: forensic = standing before God; familial = covenantal relationship and conduct.
- **Retrieval method** - historical-theological recovery of confessional categories to solve contemporary problems.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for teaching the Reformed covenantal relation between works and salvation.
- As a **polemic resource** against Neonomian and antinomian errors.
- As an **exegetical-model** exemplar for reading Pauline soteriology within covenant and confessional categories.
