### TITLE
Schleiermacher: Theology as a Way of Life (S. Gerrish - secondary reading of Schleiermacher)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th century German Protestantism; post-Kantian philosophy and Romanticism shaping theology.
 - Key works by Schleiermacher: On Religion (1799), The Christian Faith (1821/22). Gerrish reads Schleiermacher mid- to late-career as reorienting theology toward life and piety.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology should be read and practiced as a formative, lived discipline: it discovers and cultivates the religious self (religious feeling / God-consciousness) rather than primarily adjudicating forensic legalities.
 - Gerrish frames Schleiermacher as responding to the breakdown of orthodox forensic categories (e.g., imputed righteousness) and to the need for a theological account that secures communal, ethical, and experiential faith.
- **Core argument / structure (Gerrish's reading)**
 - Schleiermacher locates the core of religion in **the feeling of absolute dependence / God-consciousness**; theology explicates and disciplines that feeling.
 - Doctrinal formulations (Christology, soteriology, sacraments) are reconceived as expressions and mediations of renewed religious life, not as primarily metaphysical or juridical propositions.
 - Justification and redemption are interpreted as transformation of religious awareness and incorporation into the redeemed community rather than as chiefly forensic declarations.
 - Gerrish traces Schleiermacher's method: descriptive anthropology of religious consciousness followed by constructive dogmatics oriented to pastoral formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Kant (critique and appropriation of moral epistemology), Romantic thinkers (emphasis on feeling), the Lutheran/Reformed forensic tradition (as foil), contemporary Enlightenment critiques of religion.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as mediated God-consciousness), Christology (Christ as perfect God-consciousness / exemplar), soteriology (renewal of religious life), justification (reinterpreted away from classic forensic imputation), ecclesiology and sacraments (forms that sustain piety), ethics (life shaped by feeling-of-dependence).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Schleiermacher, as Gerrish reads him, makes theology vocational: its truth is measured by its capacity to cultivate authentic God-consciousness and communal piety, displacing forensic status as the primary theological aim.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Religion as feeling**: primary locus of theology is affective consciousness rather than propositional assent or juridical standing.
 - **Theology as formation**: doctrines are tools for shaping life, not merely truth-claims to be defended abstractly.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves decisively away from scholastic and orthodox reliance on **forensic imputation** as the central account of justification.
 - Corrects Enlightenment reductionisms by recovering the spiritual depth of religious experience while rejecting naïve metaphysics.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - **God-consciousness / feeling of absolute dependence** as the foundational category.
 - Recasting **justification** in existential/communual terms rather than strictly legal-declarative terms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply formative for 19th-20th century liberal theology, pastoral theology, and modern hermeneutics of religion.
 - Criticized by confessional and Reformed theologians for subjectivizing soteriology and abandoning biblical forensic language; harnessed by some scholars to support non-forensic readings of justification (resonances with New Perspective debates).
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to reductionist forensic-only models; invaluable for studies seeking to reconnect doctrine, piety, and pastoral formation.
 - Useful as a hermeneutical pivot in contemporary debates over the nature of justification and the role of experience in theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - fundamental religious consciousness; the primary datum for theology.
- **God-consciousness** - self-awareness informed and transformed by the divine presence; Schleiermacher's anthropological christology centers here.
- **Theology as formation** - doctrine conceived primarily as means of cultivating life, not only propositional truth.
- **Justification (reinterpreted)** - for Schleiermacher (Gerrish's reading): deeper incorporation and renewal of religious selfhood rather than a purely forensic imputation.
 - Related contrast: **Forensic imputation** - classical view that God declares sinners righteous by imputing Christ's righteousness; Schleiermacher sidelines this as the central paradigm.
- **Revelation as mediation** - revelation is God's self-disclosure apprehended in feeling and communal forms (preaching, sacraments).
- **Christ as perfect God-consciousness** - Christ's significance is exemplary and ontologically formative for believers' own God-consciousness.
- **Piety / religious life** - the primary telos of theology; social and ethical implications flow from renewed piety.
- **Sacraments / church** - institutional mediations that nurture and formalize religious feeling and communal identity.
- **Subjectivism (critique)** - charge that Schleiermacher reduces doctrine to subjective feeling; central to conservative critiques.
- **Hermeneutic of religion** - method that reads doctrines as expressions of lived religiosity.
- **Anthropological method** - starting point in theology: description of human religious capacity.
- **Moral influence / ethical transformation** - elements of Schleiermacher's soteriology that echo but differ from classic moral influence theories.
- **Reception in NPP debates** - Schleiermacher is sometimes invoked in modern critiques that challenge forensic-only readings of Paul; his emphasis on communal/participatory identity resonates with New Perspective themes.
- **Pastoral model** - used in homiletics and pastoral theology to integrate doctrine and congregational life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for non-forensic, experiential accounts of justification and soteriology.
- As a **polemic** against scholastic forensic imputation (and conversely, by critics to argue theological subjectivism).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates linking justification, ecclesial identity, and the role of religious experience (including resonance with some New Perspective critiques).
