### TITLE
Correspondence with Lutheran and Reformed Theologians (selected letters)
Theodore Beza

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 16th century Geneva and wider Reformation Europe; Beza as Calvin's successor at Geneva, engaged in polemical and pastoral correspondence with Lutheran and Reformed leaders amid post-Reformation confessionalization.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defense and clarification of Reformed positions against Lutheran critiques on justification, the relation of law and gospel, sacramental presence, and predestination; letters aim to preserve doctrinal coherence for the Reformed cause while persuading opponents or settling disputes.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - opening pastoral or polemical anecdote addressing the interlocutor;
 - statement of disputed point (e.g., nature of justification, law/gospel relation, Eucharistic presence);
 - appeal to Scripture and patristic authority (notably Augustine) and to Calvinistic theological categories;
 - propositional refutation of the opponent's claims, often distinguishing semantic/terminological confusions;
 - exhortation to ecclesial peace or further disputation when necessary.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Theodore Beza; echoes of John Calvin; Lutheran interlocutors and controversies (representatives of Lutheran sacrament theology such as those defending the Real Presence or consubstantiation); patristic and Augustine-centered appeal; occasional references to councils and contemporary Reformed colleagues.
- **Doctrines treated:** Law-Gospel distinction (explicit and recurring); justification by faith (forensic imputation); predestination (decrees, supralapsarian tendencies in Beza's thought); sacramentology (spiritual presence vs. corporal/real presence); covenantal motifs (covenant of grace); ecclesiology and pastoral governance.
- **Closing line:** A sustained Reformed defense that privileges forensic justification, a Christocentric gospel that fulfills and supersedes the law, and a sacramental spirituality of spiritual union with Christ as the hermeneutical center of doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - persistent insistence on the **law's pedagogical use**: law reveals sin and drives to Christ rather than securing righteousness (explicitly treats the Law-Gospel Distinction).
 - firm articulation of **forensic imputation** and the believer's legal standing before God as central to soteriology.
 - sacramental language emphasizing a **spiritual, instrumental union with Christ** rather than a carnal presence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - corrects Lutheran conflation of law and gospel when that leads to reliance on works for justification; disputes Lutheran Eucharistic realism by denying a corporal ubiquity of Christ's body.
 - refines Calvin's formulations in correspondence tone-more polemical and sometimes more systematic (e.g., predestinarian ordering).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - sharper use of juridical vocabulary (imputation, justification, acquittal) in pastoral polemic.
 - clarifies categories within the law (moral/civil/ceremonial) and their distinct soteriological roles.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read among Reformed scholastics and polemicists; served as a model for concise confessional disputation.
 - Contributed to confessional boundaries between Lutheran and Reformed camps; influenced later Reformed sacramentology and covenantal formulations.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - exemplary case of correspondence as theological method: concise, scripturally anchored, pastorally aware.
 - useful for tracing the development of the Law-Gospel Distinction within Reformed polemic and for teaching forensic categories of justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law (lex):** Reveals sin, condemns, and drives to Christ; not the means of justification.
 - relation to Gospel: complementary in pedagogy but antithetical in soteriological function (Law-Gospel Distinction).
- **Gospel (evangelium):** Promise of forgiveness in Christ; the instrument of justification.
- **Forensic justification:** Legal declaration of righteousness by God through imputation of Christ's righteousness.
- **Imputation:** Christ's righteousness counted to the believer; central remedial mechanism against works-based righteousness.
- **Union with Christ:** Spiritual, instrumental union effected by the Spirit and signified in the sacraments.
- **Sacramental presence:** Spiritual presence of Christ at the sacrament; repudiates corporeal/ubiquitous presence claims.
- **Predestination:** Divine decree concerning election and reprobation; Beza's correspondence tends toward a high view of divine sovereignty (often supralapsarian tones).
- **Covenant of grace:** The framework for understanding law, promise, and sacraments; gospel fulfillment of covenantal promises.
- **Pedagogical use of the law:** Law's role to teach and convict, not to justify.
- **Works vs. Faith:** Works necessary as fruits but not grounds for justification.
- **Augustinian authority:** Frequent appeal to Augustine to counter Lutheran claims and to legitimize Reformed positions.
- **Polemic rhetoric:** Concise, juridical language aimed at confessional clarification rather than speculative system-building.
- **Confessional boundary:** Letters help define and cement doctrinal divides between Lutheran and Reformed traditions.
- **Exegetical method:** Scripture-first hermeneutic with patristic corroboration.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **polemic** resource against Lutheran sacramentology and law-based righteousness.
 - As an **exegetical and doctrinal model** for teaching the Law-Gospel Distinction and Reformed forensic soteriology.
