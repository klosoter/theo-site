### TITLE
**The Bible and the Future of the Earth** (2011) - Richard Bauckham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 2011 amid growing interdisciplinary interest in biblical theology and ecological concerns.
 - Bauckham: respected New Testament scholar (Anglican context) bringing careful exegesis to contemporary ecological and eschatological debate.
 - Part of a broader turn against dualistic or escapist eschatologies in late 20th-early 21st century theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible portrays the future of the earth as **renewal and transformed continuity**, not annihilation or simple replacement by a non-physical heaven.
 - The task: reclaim biblical eschatology as a foundation for taking the fate of the physical creation seriously.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical pivot on key texts (Isaiah 65-66; Revelation 21-22; Romans 8; Colossians 1).
 - Argues for theological unity between Old and New Testaments on the destiny of creation.
 - Main moves:
 - Establish biblical motif of "new heavens and new earth" as re-creation language rooted in covenantal promises.
 - Read Revelation's city-and-temple imagery as the consummation of God's dwelling with renewed creation, not mere spiritualization.
 - Show soteriological implications: Christ's work is cosmic, ordering redemption of persons and creation together.
 - Practical corollary: eschatological hope grounds environmental responsibility.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical texts primarily; dialogues with contemporary scholars (e.g., N. T. Wright, G. K. Beale) and with theological traditions that spiritualized or minimized the created order.
 - Implicitly contrasts with classical Platonizing strands (e.g., overly spiritualized afterlife) and with apocalyptic annihilationist readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology**, **creation doctrine**, **Christology** (cosmic christology), **soteriology**, **covenant**, **revelation**, **resurrection** (corporate/cosmic implication), and **divine presence** (temple/tabernacle motif).

- **Closing line**
 - Bauckham's theological center: **God will consummate covenantal faithfulness by dwelling with a renewed, bodily creation - the new heavens and new earth - thereby providing robust biblical grounds for stewarding the planet now.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on **continuity between present creation and eschatological renewal**; the future earth is transformed, not discarded.
 - Strong use of temple/tabernacle and divine presence motifs to link God's dwelling with physical reality.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects dualistic/escapist readings that relegate earth to temporary status.
 - Counters annihilationist or purely spiritualized readings of Revelation and Isaiah.
 - Aligns with but nuances N. T. Wright's "new creation" emphasis by stressing covenantal and temple imagery.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes **"consummatory continuity"**: continuity preserved through divine re-creation.
 - Reframes "new heavens and new earth" as covenantal consummation rather than metaphorical afterlife.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and ecotheological circles as a corrective to escapism.
 - Influential among pastors and scholars advocating creation care rooted in biblical eschatology.
 - Appreciated for rigorous exegesis, sometimes critiqued by those favoring stronger discontinuity theses.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact exegetical-theological model connecting biblical texts to ecological ethics.
 - Serves as a clear, scholarly resource for teaching on eschatology, creation, and Christian responsibility toward the earth.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New heavens and new earth**
 - Central biblical phrase denoting transformed, renewed cosmos rather than removal of the physical order.

- **New creation**
 - Pauline and Johannine theme; Bauckham stresses cosmic scope (not merely individual salvation).

- **Consummation / consummatory continuity**
 - The final state in which continuity with present creation is preserved through transformation.

- **Divine presence / temple motif**
 - God's dwelling with humanity and creation is the axis of eschatological fulfillment (Revelation's city/temple imagery).

- **Cosmic Christ / Christology**
 - Christ as origin and agent of cosmic renewal (Colossians 1, Romans 8).

- **Covenantal faithfulness**
 - God's promises to creation and people frame the future of the earth as an enacted promise.

- **Judgment as purification**
 - Eschatological judgment is presented as cleansing or renewing rather than wholesale destruction.

- **Continuity and discontinuity**
 - Balanced hermeneutic: continuity of identity with discontinuity of form (renewed, glorified creation).

- **Eschatological hope**
 - Hope that motivates present care for creation; theological ground for ecological responsibility.

- **Resurrection (corporate/cosmic)**
 - Resurrection logic applied to creation's restoration, not only human bodies.

- **Temple/City imagery**
 - Symbolic language in Revelation reframed as literal consummation of God-with-us in a renewed world.

- **Environmental ethics**
 - Practical extension: biblical eschatology provides normative basis for stewardship.

How the work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for a biblically rooted concept of the new creation (useful in systematic theology and homiletics).
- **Polemic** against escapist, dualistic, or annihilationist eschatologies in contemporary debates.
- **Exegetical model** for reading Isaiah, Romans, and Revelation together to derive theological and ethical conclusions.
