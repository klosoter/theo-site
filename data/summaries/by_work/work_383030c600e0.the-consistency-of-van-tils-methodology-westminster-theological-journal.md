### TITLE
The Consistency of Van Til's Methodology - K. Scott Oliphint (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th-century Reformed apologetics, engaging the rising prominence of Cornelius Van Til's presuppositional method and critiques from both Thomistic and neo-orthodox camps.
 - Published in a learned Reformed journal aimed at consolidating and clarifying Van Til's philosophical-theological method for scholarly and pastoral use.

- **Central thesis**
 - Oliphint defends the internal coherence of Van Til's methodology: that Van Til consistently grounds human knowledge in the self-revelation of the triune God and does not collapse theological categories despite rhetorical tensions noted by critics.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Statement of the alleged inconsistencies leveled at Van Til (e.g., charges arising from his use of one-person language and from supposed reliance on analogical reasoning that resembles analogia entis).
 - Exegesis of Van Til's epistemic commitments: revelation as normative, the impossibility of neutral presuppositions, and the transcendental character of apologetics.
 - Clarification of Van Til's Trinitarian commitments: how human predicates and analogies function properly without erasing divine distinctions.
 - Systematic reconciliation: showing how Van Til's rhetoric and methodological moves cohere when read in light of his covenantal/relational epistemology and rejection of ontological analogy.
 - Response to critics: demonstration that alleged lapses are rhetorical shorthand or misreadings, not methodological contradictions.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Cornelius Van Til (primary subject).
 - Interlocutors implicitly include Thomistic advocates of analogia entis and critics from neo-orthodox or Barthian tendencies (notably those concerned with "one-person" language).
 - Secondary reference to broader Reformed apologetic tradition (presuppositionalists and their opponents).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and epistemology (normativity of Scripture; epistemic dependence upon God).
 - Trinity (language about persons, perichoresis, and human analogies).
 - Apologetics (transcendental argument, antithesis, presuppositional method).
 - Indirectly touches on Christology (Christ as the decisive revelation) and the doctrine of God (attributes and knowability).

- **Closing line**
 - Oliphint locates Van Til's theological center of gravity in a Trinitarian, revelational epistemology that consistently binds knowledge to divine self-disclosure and so resists both ontological analogizing to creaturely being and claims of internal inconsistency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the transcendental character of apologetics: it is not merely evidential but foundational - showing the necessary conditions for intelligibility are rooted in God's revelation.
 - Covenantal/relational description of human knowing: knowledge is the fruit of an epistemic relation to God, not neutral correspondence to reality.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to Thomistic analogia entis: Van Til (as defended by Oliphint) refuses an ontological bridge between creature and Creator; resemblance is relational and derivative, not metaphysical continuity.
 - Clarifies tensions with Barthian/one-person critiques: where critics see collapse or ambiguity, Oliphint reads disciplined rhetorical economy and Trinitarian safeguards.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Focus on "consistency" as methodological virtue: both logical-coherence and theological fidelity, tested by Scripture as normative criterion.
 - Re-presentation of Van Til's rhetorical moves as disciplined presuppositional proof, not ad hoc polemic.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Reinforced Van Til's standing among Reformed presuppositionalists; provided scholars a systematic rejoinder to charges of incoherence.
 - Serves as a touchstone for subsequent defenses of transcendental apologetics in academic and pastoral settings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how to speak analogically about God without capitulating to an analogia entis posture.
 - Useful for advanced students parsing tensions between doctrinal orthodoxy (Trinity, revelation) and apologetic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Apologetic stance that begins with the Bible as the necessary presupposition for intelligibility and rationality.

- **Transcendental argument**
 - An argument that seeks the necessary preconditions of intelligibility (e.g., moral, logical, or rational order) and locates them in God's nature and revelation.

- **Antithesis**
 - The fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought; no neutral common ground for reasoning apart from God.

- **Covenantal epistemology**
 - Knowledge conceived as relational and covenantally mediated by God's self-disclosure rather than as autonomous human attainment.

- **Analogia entis**
 - The Thomistic claim of an ontological analogy between Creator and creature; Van Til (Oliphint) rejects this as compromising divine transcendence.

- **Analogia fidei**
 - Knowledge of God ordered and constrained by Scripture and faith; for Van Til this governs analogical speech about God and preserves epistemic dependence on revelation.

- **One-person language (Van Til's use and critique)**
 - Issue: critics claim certain rhetorical usages collapse Trinitarian personhood; Oliphint shows Van Til's language is operational shorthand governed by Trinitarian commitments, not an ontological reduction.

- **Revelation-normativity**
 - Scripture as the final rule and measure for doctrine and apologetic claims.

- **Divine attributes (analogical talk)**
 - Human predicates trace divine attributes analogically via revelation; similarity is analogical by reference, not entitative.

- **Point of contact / noetic effect of sin**
 - Discussion of where non-Christians can think truly (if at all) and how sin distorts cognitive faculties; Van Til emphasizes both genuine but fallen common grace and epistemic dependence on God.

- **Normative criterion**
 - The standard (Scripture) by which theological and apologetic consistency is judged.

- **Rhetorical economy**
 - The disciplined use of shorthand in theological speech that must be read in light of systematic commitments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary formulations of presuppositionalist and transcendental apologetics.
- As a **polemic resource** against advocates of analogia entis and against charges of Van Tilian incoherence (esp. on Trinitarian language).
- As an **exegetical-model/heuristic** for reading apologetic rhetoric through doctrinal norms (Revelation and Trinity).
