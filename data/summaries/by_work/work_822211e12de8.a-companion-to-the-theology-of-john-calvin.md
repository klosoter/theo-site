### TITLE
A Companion to the Theology of John Calvin - Anthony N. S. Lane

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary scholarly engagement with Reformation and historical theology; part of the modern revival of careful, context-sensitive Calvin studies that draws on Calvin's Institutes, commentaries, sermons and archival material while dialoguing with 20th-21st century theologians and historians.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Calvin's theology is best understood as a coherent, biblically-rooted, pastoral and pastoral-ontological system in which **God's glory, sovereign grace and union with Christ** form the center. Lane seeks to expose the internal logic of Calvin's doctrinal corpus and to correct caricatures born of later scholastic or polemical readings.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Foundations: Scripture as norm and rule (sensus fidelium shaped by Scripture) and theological method (exegesis driving doctrine). 
 - God and Trinity: Calvin's God is sovereign, covenant-making and covenant-keeping; Trinity is doctrinal frame rather than abstract metaphysics. 
 - Christology and redemption: emphasis on the person and work of Christ as constitutive of union with believers-Christ as mediator, head, and active redeemer. 
 - Soteriology: justification by faith as forensic and relational, union with Christ as the existential center of salvation, and grace as transforming. 
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: church as visible body, sacraments as Word-signs that mediate grace, discipline and pastoral care central. 
 - Ethics and law: Law as guide and tutor (uses of the law), sanctification as practical outworking of union with Christ. 
 - Providence and predestination: sovereignty in providence and election explained within pastoral and pastoral-theological concerns rather than abstract determinism. 
 - Methodological note: recurrent interplay of exegetical work (commentaries) and systematic statements (Institutes).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: Calvin's Institutes, commentaries, sermons, letters. 
 - Interlocutors: earlier Reformed writers and later scholastic appropriations, contemporary Calvin scholarship and constructive theologians whose readings shaped debates about continuity, pastoralism and doctrinal coherence.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Revelation and Scripture; Trinity; Christology; union with Christ; justification; predestination/election; providence; covenant theology; sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper); ecclesiology; law and ethics; grace and sanctification.

- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 Calvinic theology coheres around the triune God's saving action in Christ-disclosed by Scripture, mediated by Word and sacrament, and lived out in a covenantal, church‑shaped life oriented to God's glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - **Union with Christ** as the central organizing category linking justification, sanctification, sacraments and ecclesial life. 
 - A sustained stress on **biblical exegesis** as Calvin's theological engine: doctrine issues from careful reading of Scripture more than from speculative metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Counters both caricatures that depict Calvin as a dry systems‑builder and portrayals that reduce him solely to double predestination. Instead, Lane stresses Calvin's pastoral aims and exegetical nuance. 
 - Distinguishes Calvin from later Reformed scholasticism-less abstract ontology, more pastoral and scriptural theology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes familiar terms (election, providence, law) in light of relational and covenantal language, highlighting **relational rather than merely juridical** motifs.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Serves as a corrective resource in academic Calvin studies and in theological education; used by scholars to recalibrate readings of Calvin toward his pastoral‑exegetical priorities. 
 - Influential in constructive conversations where Calvin is read as a resource for contemporary theology (ecclesiology, sacramental theology, pastoral doctrine).

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Clear, integrative overview that links textually-grounded exegesis to doctrinal synthesis-valuable for seminars, advanced undergraduates and scholars reorienting Calvin studies away from caricature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture (Sola Scriptura):** normative rule; Calvin's theology derives from careful exegesis rather than abstract system-building. 
- **Institutes:** primary systematic locus; used with commentaries to show method and development. 
- **Union with Christ:** central category; explains justification, sanctification, sacraments and ecclesial identity. 
- **Justification by faith:** forensic declaration grounded in and inseparable from union with Christ. 
- **Election / Predestination:** sovereign, pastoral framed; not reducible to fatalism-contextualized in covenantal promises. 
- **Providence:** divine governance that preserves covenantal order and human responsibility. 
- **Covenant theology:** relational framework binding God's promises, Christ's mediation and the church's life. 
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** "word‑signs" that genuinely mediate grace through faith; ecclesial and corporate. 
- **Law and Gospel:** law as tutor; ethical formation flows from the gospel and union with Christ. 
- **Grace (common and special):** unmerited favor, operative for calling, preservation and sanctification. 
- **Church / Ecclesiology:** visible church, discipline, pastoral oversight-community as locus of mediation. 
- **Glory of God:** telos and motive of creation and redemption; ethical and doxological orientation. 
- **Exegesis as method:** Calvin's commentaries as theological laboratories shaping doctrine. 
- **Pastoral theology:** doctrinal claims driven by the care of souls and practical application.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for Calvinian categories (union, covenant, election) grounded in primary texts. 
 - As an **exegetical-model** exemplar showing how commentary and systematic theology interrelate in Calvin. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates that seek to retrieve Calvin for constructive theology (ecclesiology, sacramental theology, ethics).
