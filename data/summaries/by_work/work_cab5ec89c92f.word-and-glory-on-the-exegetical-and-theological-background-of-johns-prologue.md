### TITLE
**Word and Glory: On the Exegetical and Theological Background of John's Prologue** - Craig A. Evans

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Johannine studies; part of resurgence in emphasizing Jewish backgrounds to New Testament theology.
 - Reaction to readings that privilege Greek philosophical categories for the Fourth Gospel; aligns with work stressing Second Temple Jewish literary and religious contexts (Philo, LXX, Wisdom literature, Temple traditions).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Prologue (John 1:1-18) should be read primarily as theologically rooted in Jewish Wisdom and Temple/eschatological traditions rather than as a Hellenistic philosophical treatise; it articulates a **messianic consciousness** tied to God's revelation, glory, and inaugurated kingdom.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of semantic field for key Johannine terms (logos, doxa, phos, sarx, heos) in LXX, Philo, Wisdom literature.
 - Demonstration that the Johannine "Word" functions as a Jewish personified agent of creation/revelation, continuous with Wisdom and agent-theology.
 - Argument that "glory" in John aligns with temple/eschatological manifestations (enthronement, kingdom) and is central to Johannine Christology - the Word not only speaks but receives and manifests divine glory.
 - Conclusion that the Prologue constructs an incarnational, revelatory, messianic identity for Jesus: the preexistent agent who enters history to reveal and inaugurate God's rule.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Philo of Alexandria, Septuagintal renderings, Wisdom of Solomon, Second Temple apocalyptic streams.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: classical Johannine critics (Rudolf Bultmann, C.K. Barrett, Raymond Brown) and those emphasizing Hellenistic logos-interpretations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (preexistence, incarnation, revelatory function)
 - Revelation (Word as revelation and revelation-as-glory)
 - Kingdom/eschatology (inaugurated kingship implied by glory motifs)
 - Implicit Trinitarian implications (distinctions in relation of Word and God)
- **Closing line**
 - The Prologue is best read as a Jewish theological overture: the preexistent Word, identified with Wisdom and temple-glory, inaugurates God's messianic reign by becoming flesh and manifesting divine glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong prioritization of Jewish Wisdom and Temple categories over Platonic or Stoic logos readings.
 - Emphasis that **glory (doxa)** is the hermeneutical pivot linking preexistence, revelation, and messianic kingship in John.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects readings that reduce the Prologue to Hellenistic metaphysics or abstract philosophical logos; challenges approaches that detach John from Jewish messianic expectation.
 - Pushes back against interpretations that isolate "Word" language from Wisdom traditions and LXX usage.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts the Johannine Logos as a functional, cultic-eschatological actor: Word-as-Wisdom-as-temple-glory rather than Logos-as-Greek-principle.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among scholars seeking a more Jewish-pneumatological reading of John; used in debates over background influences (Philo vs. LXX vs. Hellenistic philosophy).
 - Valued in evangelical and academic circles for re-centering Jewish hermeneutical horizons in Christological interpretation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the nexus between prologue language and messianic/kingdom expectations, making it indispensable for teaching Johannine Christology and for exegetical models that resist Hellenizing over-readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Logos (Word)**
 - Personified, preexistent agent; aligned primarily with Jewish Wisdom and creative agency rather than Platonic abstract principle.
- **Doxa (Glory)**
 - Central motif linking revelation, enthronement, and messianic manifestation; often temple/eschatology-inflected.
- **Phos (Light)**
 - Symbol of revelation and salvific knowledge; tied to presence and revelation of God in the person of the Word.
- **Sarx (Flesh)**
 - Emphasis on true embodiment: the Word "becoming flesh" underlines incarnational testimony and historical messiahship.
- **Sophia (Wisdom)**
 - Jewish wisdom tradition provides conceptual matrix for Logos as divine agent active in creation and revelation.
- **Septuagint (LXX) usage**
 - Key lexical resonance point for John's terms; helps root Johannine language in Jewish scripture engagement.
- **Philo**
 - Important comparative witness; Evans uses Philo cautiously - acknowledges parallels but insists on distinctively Jewish (not merely philosophical) reception.
- **Messianic consciousness**
 - The Prologue frames Jesus as the expected agent who reveals God and inaugurates kingdom realities; not an abstract divine emanation but the eschatological Messiah.
- **Kingdom (implicit)**
 - Not always explicit in prologue vocabulary but present via glory/enthronement motifs indicating inaugurated rule.
- **Incarnation / Revelation**
 - The double claim: Word was with God and became flesh to reveal the Father's glory and bring people into the kingdom.
- **Revelatory agency**
 - The Word functions as revealing presence; John's Christology is primarily revelatory and salvific.
- **Community horizon**
 - The prologue speaks from and for a community shaped by Jewish scriptural reading and messianic expectation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading John 1 within Second Temple Jewish contexts (LXX, Wisdom, Temple).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Christology courses to connect Logos, Glory, and Messianic Kingdom without defaulting to Hellenistic philosophies.
- As a **polemic historiographical resource** against readings that overstate Platonic or Stoic influences on Johannine theology.
