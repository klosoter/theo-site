### TITLE
Evangelical Interpretation: Perspectives on Hermeneutical Issues - Millard J. Erickson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical engagement with modern hermeneutics; response to both liberal critical methods and fundamentalist literalism.
 - Aimed at clarifying a responsible evangelical hermeneutic within academic and church contexts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Establish a coherent evangelical hermeneutic that preserves **biblical authority and inerrancy** while employing sound interpretive methods (grammatical-historical, canonical, and typological) and avoiding both anti-intellectual fideism and corrosive skepticism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defense of a historically grounded, authorial-intent approach as primary; genre and context determine interpretation.
 - Affirmation of **inspiration and inerrancy** (properly defined) but qualified: inerrancy pertains to the autographs and must be read with sensitivity to genre and rhetorical devices.
 - Integration of responsible historical-critical tools where they illuminate text without usurping the primacy of Scripture.
 - Anthropological treatment arguing for **dichotomy** (body + immaterial aspect) over ontological trichotomy, while recognizing functional distinctions in soul/spirit language.
 - Practical proposals for preaching, theological construction, and ecumenical engagement grounded in this hermeneutic.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with historical evangelical defenders of Scripture (e.g., Warfield-style formulations), contemporary evangelical scholars, and critiques from continental hermeneutics and liberal-critical positions.
 - Dialogues with modern hermeneutical theorists insofar as they illuminate reader-text dynamics and historical situatedness.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy, authority of Scripture, anthropology (dichotomy vs trichotomy), canon and canonicity, typology, role of tradition and reason.

- **Closing line**
 - Erickson situates the evangelical center of gravity in a disciplined, authorial-intent hermeneutic that defends Scripture's trustworthiness while allowing doctrinal precision and exegetical nuance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balances robust commitment to **inerrancy** with methodological nuance: inerrancy of the autographs, interpretive fallibility of readers, and genre sensitivity.
 - Emphasizes the **grammatical-historical method** as indispensable but open to selective historical-critical insights.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both fundamentalist literalism that ignores genre and modern critical relativism that undermines authority.
 - Contrasts with trichotomy advocates by treating soul and spirit as overlapping functions of one immaterial aspect rather than distinct ontological components.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Articulates a pragmatic synthesis: evangelical dogmatics and contemporary hermeneutics can be integrated without surrendering doctrinal commitments.
 - Frames inerrancy as a theological-propositional claim tied to inspiration, not a simplistic claim about modern copies or reader consensus.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received among moderating evangelicals as a clarifying resource on hermeneutics and biblical authority.
 - Used in seminaries to mediate between conservative confessionalism and academically rigorous exegesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for pastors and scholars seeking to maintain evangelical convictions while engaging critical scholarship responsibly.
 - Serves as a model for teaching hermeneutical method that is both confessional and academically credible.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics**
 - Evangelical framework advocating grammatical-historical reading anchored in authorial intent.
- **Grammatical-historical method**
 - Primary interpretive procedure; attends to language, context, literary form, and original author's meaning.
- **Inspiration**
 - Divine origin of Scripture; basis for authority and doctrinal trustworthiness.
- **Inerrancy**
 - Scripture without error in its autographs; Erickson insists on careful definition and limits to avoid caricature.
 - Related: distinction between autographs and extant manuscripts.
- **Accommodation**
 - God's condescension in revelation-genre and human language shape divine communication.
- **Canonicity / Canonical reading**
 - Canon as interpretive horizon; unity of Scripture guides theological synthesis and typological reading.
- **Typology**
 - Legitimate canonical method when constrained by grammatical-historical controls and authorial intent.
- **Authorial intent**
 - Central criterion for meaning; Erickson rejects reader-response extremes that ignore historical intent.
- **Historical-critical method**
 - Accepted selectively as a tool, not as a controlling norm; used to clarify background, dating, and authorship where helpful.
- **Dichotomy (body + immaterial)**
 - Erickson's favored anthropological model: human = body + immaterial aspect; **soul** and **spirit** denote functional nuances, not separate ontological substances.
- **Trichotomy (body, soul, spirit)**
 - Discussed and critiqued; Erickson argues against strong ontological trichotomy in favor of a functionally differentiated dichotomy.
- **Biblical authority**
 - The theological center; hermeneutic is designed to preserve authoritative Scripture in doctrine and practice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical articulations of inspiration and inerrancy (see chapters on Inspiration And Inerrancy).
 - As a **polemic and pedagogical resource** in debates over human nature (see treatment of Trichotomy vs Dichotomy), and as an **exegetical model** for seminary courses on hermeneutics and biblical theology.
