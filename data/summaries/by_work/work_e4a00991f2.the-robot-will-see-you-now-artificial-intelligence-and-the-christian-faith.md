### TITLE
The Robot Will See You Now: Artificial Intelligence And The Christian Faith - John Wyatt

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary moment (post-2010s) of rapid advances in machine learning, widespread deployment of AI in medicine, pastoral care, and everyday life.
 - Written from a Christian, clinical, and pastoral vantage point: dialogues across theology, bioethics, and computer science amid popular anxieties about automation, autonomy, and transhumanism.

- **Central thesis**
 - Artificial intelligence is neither merely a technical problem nor an abstract philosophical puzzle but a pastoral-theological challenge: Christians must discern AI's uses and limits in light of the imago Dei, incarnation, and vocation to love, shaping policy and practice to promote human flourishing while resisting idolatry.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define terms and survey AI capabilities and myths (weak vs strong AI; predictive algorithms; embodied robots).
 - Diagnose theological anxieties: threats to personhood, prayer, moral responsibility, and community.
 - Theological resources:
 - **Anthropology** (imago Dei): grounds human uniqueness and dignity.
 - **Incarnation and Christology**: model for embodied presence and relationality that technology cannot replace.
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacramentality**: implications for mediated worship, pastoral care, and sacramental practices.
 - **Ethics and eschatology**: prudence about technological ends; hope reframes tool-use.
 - Practical prescriptions:
 - Ethical frameworks for clinicians, pastors, and developers (stewardship, accompaniment, transparency).
 - Institutional recommendations (regulation, interdisciplinary governance).
 - Pastoral guidance for congregations encountering AI (discernment, formation, literacy).
 - Concluding reflection: technology must be critiqued and appropriated under Christian convictions that prioritize relationship, responsibility, and human flourishing.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary AI discourse (popular and technical), classic theological sources (scripture, Augustine/Aquinas themes), and bioethical literature.
 - Interlocutors include techno-optimists (transhumanists) and techno-skeptics (Luddites/critical theorists), with practical case studies from medicine.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology (imago Dei)** - central.
 - **Christology & Incarnation** - model for human-bodied relational presence.
 - **Ecclesiology** - church life, pastoral ministry, sacraments mediated by tech.
 - **Ethics/Teleology** - ends of human flourishing, justice, stewardship.
 - Secondary touchpoints: revelation (mediated vs immediate), eschatology (future orientation to tech), and moral responsibility.

- **Closing line**
 - Wyatt's theological center: view AI as a tool to be judged and guided by incarnational, relational, and ethical commitments rooted in the imago Dei - enabling human flourishing without surrendering personhood to machines.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Practically oriented: integrates clinical casework and pastoral scenarios, not merely abstract ethics.
 - Balanced posture: neither romantic rejection of technology nor uncritical enthusiasm for autonomy-enhancing tech.
 - Incarnational standard: uses Christ's embodied ministry as normative for evaluating technological mediation of care.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects transhumanist projects that collapse human uniqueness into upgradeable processes by reasserting a theological anthropology of relationality and creaturely dependence.
 - Contrasts with secular AI ethics that focus primarily on utility, privacy, or rights by foregrounding worship, vocation, and sin.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "accompaniment ethics": assessing tools by their capacity to accompany human flourishing and relational presence.
 - Focus on "moral opacity" of algorithms as a theological problem - not only a technical one - because hidden decision-making undermines accountable love.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in theological bioethics, pastoral theology, and Christian medical ethics as a measured, practice-sensitive resource.
 - Adopted in some Anglican and clinical training contexts; cited by ethicists working at the intersection of religion and technology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a bridge between clinicians, pastors, and technologists.
 - Durable resources: incarnational critique, pastoral case methodology, and a framework for ecclesial response to technological change.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - Wyatt's umbrella term for algorithmic systems, machine learning, embodied robots; distinguished functionally rather than anthropomorphically.
- **Weak AI vs Strong AI** - weak: task-specific systems; strong: claims to mind/consciousness; Wyatt treats strong-AI claims skeptically on theological grounds.
- **Imago Dei** - foundational criterion for human dignity and moral status; constrains claims that machines can be persons.
- **Personhood** - Wyatt argues personhood is relational, embodied, and theologically grounded, not reducible to information-processing.
- **Incarnation** - normative pole: Christ's embodied love shows what pastoral presence requires and what AI cannot fully replicate.
- **Accompaniment ethics** - proposed evaluative norm: does a technology accompany human flourishing and relationality?
- **Moral opacity / algorithmic bias** - ethical problems that require transparency, accountability, and ecclesial advocacy.
- **Stewardship** - responsibility for shaping technologies to serve human and common good, not dominion understood as exploitative control.
- **Autonomy vs Agency** - distinction between machine autonomy (operational independence) and human moral agency (responsibility, accountability).
- **Embodiment** - theological critique of disembodied notions of mind; central for sacramental and pastoral practice.
- **Transhumanism** - critiqued as a theological rival that secularizes eschatological hope into technological progress.
- **Flourishing (eudaimonia)** - telos for evaluating AI use; social, spiritual, and bodily dimensions.
- **Pastoral presence** - rubric for assessing deployed technologies in care settings.
- **Regulatory wisdom** - practical term for interdisciplinary governance promoted by Wyatt.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Christian theological anthropology in discussions of AI and personhood.
 - As a **pastoral/clinical model** for training clergy and clinicians to respond to AI in care contexts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in interdisciplinary conversations - bringing incarnational and stewardship lenses into AI ethics debates.
