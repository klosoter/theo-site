### TITLE
**B. B. Warfield, Selected Shorter Writings** (2 vols., ed. John E. Meeter; P&R, 1970s)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th c. Old Princeton: confessional Presbyterianism confronting higher criticism, revivalism, holiness/early Pentecostalism, and Darwinian naturalism.
 - Meeter gathers Warfield's journal essays and reviews into thematic clusters, preserving method and voice across loci.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The sovereign, triune God saves sinners by grace through Christ, by the Spirit, as authoritatively revealed in the inerrant Scriptures; theology is the scientific organization of revealed facts for the church's faith and life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Typical Warfield move: close exegesis and historical retrieval -> dogmatic synthesis -> polemical clarification -> pastoral/theological payoff.
 - Bibliology: verbal-plenary inspiration, inerrancy in the autographs, theopneustos, concursive operation of God and human authors.
 - Theology Proper & Trinity: providence and concursus; defense of the Son's autotheos alongside eternal generation and consubstantiality.
 - Christology: true humanity and full deity; impeccability; the emotional life and human development of Jesus.
 - Pneumatology: monergistic regeneration; progressive sanctification; cessation of charismatic gifts tied to redemptive-historical attestation.
 - Soteriology: inability and effectual calling; faith as receptive instrument; forensic imputation; ordo salutis ordered around union with Christ.
 - Eschatology: hopeful, church-centered advance of the gospel; resurrection and consummation without speculative timetables.
 - Anthropology & Creation: imago Dei, Adamic headship, original sin; guarded openness to providentially guided development against naturalistic evolutionism.
 - Ecclesiology/Practice: means of grace over revivalist technique; confessional subscription; catholicity within Reformed bounds.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Allies: Augustine, Calvin, Turretin; Princeton colleagues (Charles and A. A. Hodge).
 - Interlocutors: Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Wellhausen; Wesleyan perfectionists; Roman Catholic theology of merit; Finneyite revivalism; Darwin/Spencer; early Pentecostals.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; providence; Trinity; Christ's person; sin and grace; Spirit's work; justification and sanctification; miracles; creation; last things; church and confession.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **God saves sinners** through Christ by the Spirit according to the infallible Word, and Reformed dogmatics expounds this with exegetical rigor and historical depth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Concursive, verbal-plenary inspiration**; Scripture's truthfulness as divine speech through human writers.
 - **Forensic soteriology** with robust imputation and monergistic regeneration; pastoral anchoring of assurance in Christ's finished work.
 - **Cessationism** grounded in the apostolic, foundational function of miracles and their post-apostolic decline.
 - **Autotheos of the Son** articulated to safeguard full deity while affirming eternal generation.
 - **Postmillennial (or optimistic amillennial) expectancy** tethered to ordinary means of grace.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **perfectionism**: sanctification is progressive, sin remains.
 - Against **revivalism**: grace is mediated ordinarily through Word and sacrament, not technique.
 - Against **higher criticism**: historical-critical claims falter before Scripture's own witness and the church's doctrine.
 - Against **naturalism**: evolution, if affirmed, sits under providence and does not negate Adamic headship or miracle.
 - Nuancing **Kuyperian antithesis** with a Princeton confidence in publicly accessible reasoning under revelation.
- **Conceptual/terminological contributions**
 - Stabilizes usage of **concursus**, **theopneustos**, **verbal-plenary inspiration**, **ordo salutis**, and **imputation** across Reformed discourse.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical for conservative Presbyterianism and broader evangelicalism; shapes the inerrancy movement (e.g., Chicago Statement), cessationist arguments, and confessional pedagogy.
- **Enduring value**
 - A model of theological method: exegetically controlled, historically informed, pastorally useful; reliable touchstone across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration (verbal-plenary)**: God's breathing-out of Scripture extending to words; safeguards authority without suppressing human authorial particularities.
- **Inerrancy (autographs)**: Scripture tells the truth in all it affirms; truthfulness is covenantal and comprehensive.
- **Concursus**: Non-competitive concurrence of divine and human agency in inspiration and providence.
- **Theopneustos**: Exegetical anchor (2 Tim 3:16) for inspiration's mode and effect.
- **Autotheos (of the Son)**: The Son is God of himself with respect to essence; harmonized with eternal generation to secure Nicene orthodoxy.
- **Providence**: Exhaustive divine government; permits speaking of developmental processes without ceding to naturalism.
- **Miracle/Charismata**: Redemptive-historical signs authenticating revelation; extraordinary gifts cease with the apostolic foundation.
- **Regeneration**: Monergistic new birth by the Spirit, logically prior to faith in the ordo salutis.
- **Faith**: Non-meritorious, Spirit-wrought instrument receiving Christ; distinguished from repentance and works.
- **Imputation**: Forensic reckoning of Adam's sin and Christ's righteousness; grounds justification.
- **Perfectionism**: Holiness teaching corrected by progressive sanctification and remaining sin.
- **Assurance**: Objective ground in Christ and promises; Spirit's testimony confirms, not replaces, gospel objectivity.
- **Ordo salutis**: Ordered relations of calling, regeneration, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification, under union with Christ.
- **Eschatological hope**: Gospel-driven leavening of the nations; confidence without triumphalism.
- **Image of God/Original Sin**: Created dignity with fallen corruption and guilt under federal headship.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Bibliology: definition source for inspiration/inerrancy and method.
 - Pneumatology/Ecclesiology: primary cessationist rationale and critique of revivalism/perfectionism.
 - Soteriology: standard formulations of regeneration, faith, imputation, assurance.
 - Anthropology/Creation/Eschatology: careful statements on Adam, providence and development, and restrained optimistic eschatology.
