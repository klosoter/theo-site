### TITLE
**Interpreting Scripture with the Great Tradition: Recovering the Genius of Premodern Exegesis** - Craig A. Carter

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid renewed interest in retrieval theology and critiques of modern historical-critical dominance.
 - Part of a broader movement in evangelical and Reformed circles to recover patristic and medieval resources for contemporary hermeneutics.
 - Site reference used: "Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective" as background on Christocentric and eschatological horizons that inform premodern reading.

- **Central thesis**
 - Modernist historicism fractured Scripture into isolated historical fragments; recovery of premodern exegetical practices (the "great tradition") restores a theologically rich, church-shaped reading that is faithful to canonical, Christ-centered revelation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern historical-critical methods produce atomized meaning and undercut ecclesial authority.
 - Retrieval: explicates defining features of premodern exegesis - the rule of faith, four-fold senses, typological reading, canonical and liturgical contexts.
 - Methodological proposal: a disciplined, ecclesial hermeneutic that privileges the rule of faith, sees Christ as the interpretive key, and integrates sensus literalis with spiritual senses.
 - Practical application: implications for preaching, doctrine formation, and devotional reading; critiques naïve allegory but defends theological typology and canonical coherence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary models: Augustine, Origen (with caution), Gregory, Aquinas, medieval commentators, and patristic typology more broadly.
 - Secondary interlocutors: modern proponents of historical criticism and some strands of Enlightenment hermeneutics.
 - Site citation: "Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective" used to underline eschatological dimensions in Christ-centered reading.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, sensibility of canonical shape)
 - Christology (Christ as fulcrum of interpretation; typology)
 - Ecclesiology (church as interpretive community, rule of faith)
 - Covenant and biblical theology (canonical continuity)
 - Eschatology (anagogical sense, telos of reading)
 - Implicitly touches doctrine of tradition, sacrament, and theological method.

- **Closing line**
 - Carter's theological center of gravity: a recovered premodern hermeneutic reorients exegesis toward the church, Christ, and the canonical-covenantal unity of Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong defense of the *rule of faith* as an interpretive constraint that prevents private or atomistic readings.
 - Restoration of disciplined typological reading that is neither arbitrary allegory nor reductive literalism.
 - Insistence that senses of Scripture are complementary, with the literal sense read within a canonical and christological horizon.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern extremes: rejects both uncritical patristic allegorism and reductive historical literalism.
 - Contrasts with historical-critical dominance by emphasizing ecclesial reception and doctrinal coherence over isolated historical reconstruction.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rearticulation of the fourfold sense for contemporary use (literal-historical integrated with spiritual senses).
 - Frames "premodern exegesis" as a coherent methodological cluster usable ecumenically rather than as nostalgic antiquarianism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively among evangelicals seeking richer hermeneutics; used in seminaries to introduce canonical and typological methods.
 - Provokes caution from strict historical-critical scholars and some who fear return to unchecked allegory.
 - Influential in conversations about integrating liturgy, doctrine, and biblical interpretation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust corrective to individualistic, purely historical reading.
 - Offers a practicable hermeneutic for preaching, catechesis, and theological synthesis.
 - Serves as a bridge between patristic insight and contemporary evangelical commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Premodern exegesis**
 - Cluster of patristic and medieval interpretive practices emphasizing church rule, senses of Scripture, and typology.

- **Rule of Faith**
 - Creedal and ecclesial norm that guides interpretation and guards orthodoxy.

- **Fourfold sense**
 - Literal/historical; allegorical/typological (Christological); tropological/moral; anagogical/eschatological.
 - Carter: literal and spiritual senses are complementary, not opposed.

- **Typology**
 - Historical persons/events as prophetic foreshadowings realized in Christ; disciplined, canonical typology favored over arbitrary allegory.

- **Sensus plenior**
 - Fuller meaning of Scripture found in canonical, christological reading beyond immediate historical intent.

- **Canonical reading**
 - Interpreting individual texts within the unity and telos of the biblical canon.

- **Ecclesial interpretation**
 - The church as the rightful interpretive community - creeds, liturgy, reception history shape meaning.

- **Christocentric interpretation**
 - Christ as the decisive hermeneutical key for reading Old and New Testament texts coherently.

- **Historical-critical method**
 - Modern approach Carter critiques for fragmenting meaning and marginalizing ecclesial reception.

- **Analogia fidei**
 - Interpretation by analogy with the whole counsel of God; doctrinal coherence as hermeneutical norm.

- **Sensus literalis vs. sensus spiritualis**
 - Carter reframes the literal sense to include canonical-historical dimensions while allowing spiritual senses to disclose theological fulfillment.

- **Reception history**
 - Value of patristic and medieval exegesis as living interpretive traditions worth retrieving.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for what constitutes premodern/medieval hermeneutical practice.
- **Polemic** against unbridled historical-critical monopoly in biblical studies.
- **Exegetical model** in homiletics and systematic-theological courses to integrate doctrine and text.
- **Conceptual pivot** for projects seeking to reconcile evangelical commitments with catholic, historical reading practices.
