### TITLE
**The Liturgy of Creation - Michael LeFebvre**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Situated in late-20th/early-21st-century liturgical and Reformed renewal conversations; engages contemporary ecological theology and worship renewal movements.
 - Dialogue partner to patristic retrieval, Reformed sacramental recovery, and contemporary liturgists (post-Schmemann, Eastern and Western ressourcement).
- **Central thesis**
 - Creation itself is ordered as corporate praise: the cosmos is fundamentally liturgical, and Christian worship both discloses and effects the re-creation of creation toward its eschatological telos.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: modern desacralization and privatized worship sever liturgy from creation and covenantal practices, producing ecological and ecclesial distortions.
 - Exegetical: close readings of Genesis, Psalms, and New Testament texts to show creation as temple/household and innate to covenantal praise.
 - Theological retrieval: patristic and Reformation resources (esp. Calvinian sacramentology and covenantal ordering) are marshaled to show continuity between creation and cult.
 - Constructive proposal: a liturgical theology that is sacramentally realist and covenantal - worship as formative practice that restores creation's order and trains creatures for eschatological fellowship.
 - Practical corollaries: liturgical rhythms (Sabbath/Lord's Day), sacramental practice, and church ordering as means for ecological ethics and cultural witness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages patristic authors (implicit emphasis on temple imagery), Calvin and other Reformation writers, Orthodox liturgical theology (Schmemann), contemporary liturgiologists and ecological theologians; dialogues with Barthian and postliberal concerns about Word and sacrament.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, providence, covenant, sacraments, Trinity (divine worship as Trinitarian), Christology (Word active in creation and re-creation), ecclesiology, Sabbath/temporal theology, and eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Worship is not merely human response but the primary formative locus in which God re-forms creation into its intended doxological vocation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats creation itself as intrinsically liturgical rather than merely a context for human worship; liturgy is ontologically formative.
 - Strong linkage of liturgical practice to ecological responsibility - worship trains creatures for right relations with creation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against privatized or consumerist models of worship common in modern Protestantism; also nuances certain Barthian reductions by insisting on sacramental continuity between creation and covenantal signs.
 - Contrasts thin moralistic or experiential worship with thick, covenantal, and sacramental liturgy that shapes communal life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Formulates a "liturgical ontology" - the claim that liturgy participates in constituting social and cosmic being.
 - Articulates "sacramental ecology" as a way to read sacraments as formative for creation-care.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited within niche circles of Reformed liturgical renewal, worship studies, and eco-theology; functions as a bridging text between Reformed sacramentalists and broader liturgical theologians.
 - Influential as a resource for pastors and liturgists seeking robust doctrine-worship integration, though less prominent than major systematic works.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for recovering a theology that unites Scripture, sacrament, and creation; provides a usable framework for liturgical formation, Christian ethics, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liturgy of Creation**
 - The central phrase: worship understood as the formative structure of creation's praise and fulfillment.

- **Sacramental realism**
 - Sacraments as real means that participate in re-creation, not merely symbols.
- **Cosmic doxology**
 - The idea that all creation's purpose is to glorify God; liturgy articulates that doxology.
- **Creation covenant**

- **Word-Sacrament nexus**
 - Emphasis on the inseparability of proclamation and sacrament in forming creation.
- **Sabbath / Lord's Day formation**
 - Liturgical rhythm as central to temporal and ecological restoration.
- **Sacramental ecology**
 - Use of sacramental practice to cultivate ecological virtue and stewardship.
- **Re-creation / eschatological formation**
 - Worship as participation in God's ongoing work to bring creation to its consummation.
- **Church as microcosm**

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: supplies a working definition for "liturgical ontology" and "sacramental ecology" in worship theology courses.
 - Polemic: leveraged against privatized, consumerist worship models and thin moralistic piety.
 - Exegetical model / conceptual pivot: used to read Genesis, Psalms, and New Testament worship texts as normative for ecclesial practice and ecological ethics.
