### TITLE
Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church - Hughes Oliphant Old

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century historical-liturgical study situated in the Reformed worship renewal movement; Old reads sixteenth-eighteenth-century Reformed practice for contemporary pastoral and ecclesial application.
 - Combines confessional, liturgical, and pastoral sources (prayers, catechisms, church orders, sermons) from continental Reformed, English, Scottish, and Dutch contexts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper in Reformed piety is not a bare memorial but a formative, covenantal means of grace: Christ is really present in a spiritual union with communicants, and the Eucharist shapes Christian identity and ecclesial discipline.
 - Persistent problem addressed: balancing sacramental realism (real presence as spiritual) with concerns about superstition, physicalism, and lax pastoral practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological reconstruction: trace how doctrinal formulations (Calvin, Bucer, Knox) are embodied in liturgical texts and pastoral procedures.
 - Liturgical-text analysis: prayers, confessionals, and rubrics show how Reformed churches taught presence, preparation, and reception.
 - Pastoral practice: examination of fencing the table, admission procedures, catechesis, and the interplay of preaching, prayer, and sacrament.
 - Practical-theological synthesis: argues for revival of formative sacramental practice integrated with preaching as means of grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Scottish and English Reformers, Dutch Reformed praxis, Heidelberg and Westminster catechisms/church orders.
 - Interlocutors: Zwinglian memorialists (for contrast), medieval sacramental theology, later Protestant laxity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eucharistic presence (spiritual/real union), covenant theology, Christology (becoming present to believers), ecclesiology (discipline, admission), sacramentology (means of grace), pastoral theology, liturgy and prayer.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Reformed Lord's Supper is a covenantal encounter: spiritually real, pastorally disciplined, and integrally bound to preaching and prayer as formative means of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on *piety* - how sacramental practice forms devotional life and communal identity, not merely doctrinal correctness.
 - Detailed attention to *fencing the table* and *admission* as theological-pastoral practices that embody ecclesiology and moral formation.
 - Integration of liturgical texts (prayers, rubrics) with theological analysis-treats liturgy as theological argument.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters reductionist memorialism by demonstrating how Reformed texts affirm a real, spiritual presence without reviving medieval physicalist categories.
 - Critiques neglect of discipline and formative catechesis in later Protestantism; urges retrieval of pastoral rigour paired with pastoral charity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames the Lord's Supper primarily as a *means of grace* within a triadic nexus: preaching - sacrament - prayer.
 - Recasts "fencing" not as exclusionary ritualism but as a pastoral boundary-making that safeguards covenantal integrity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed liturgical renewal, seminary courses on worship, and ecumenical Eucharistic conversations.
 - Valued for archival work on prayers and for making concrete pastoral proposals; influential among pastors seeking historically grounded practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - A model for combining historical scholarship with pastoral theology; rich primary-text material and usable frameworks for contemporary sacramental formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spiritual presence** - Christ truly present to believers in a non-corporeal, spiritual union effected by the Spirit; distinct from transubstantiation and simple memorialism.
- **Real presence (Reformed sense)** - affirms efficacy and reality (union, nourishment), not local or physical presence in elements.
- **Means of grace** - sacraments, preaching, and prayer as ordinary instruments by which God communicates covenantal blessing and forms piety.
 - Emphasizes interdependence: preaching prepares hearts, prayer frames reception, sacrament seals union.
- **Fencing the table** - pastoral discipline determining who may commune; practiced to preserve covenantal order and promote worthy reception.
- **Admission / examination** - catechetical and pastoral procedures for ensuring informed, penitent participation.
- **Sealing / appropriation** - language of the sacrament effecting assurance, spiritual benefit, and confirmation of covenant promises.
- **Catechesis / preparation** - instruction and repentance required before admission; central to Reformed practice.
- **Liturgical prayers (anaphoral elements)** - prayers and rubrics evidencing theological claims about presence and grace; Old catalogs these as primary evidence.
- **Covenant piety** - devotional life shaped by covenantal self-understanding, expressed and renewed in the Supper.
- **Preaching-sacrament nexus** - the theological claim that preaching and sacraments work together as complementary means of grace.
- **Worthiness / worthy reception** - Reformed emphasis on faith and repentance (not works righteousness) as necessary dispositions for receiving grace.
- **Pastoral charity vs. discipline** - tension between maintaining discipline and welcoming penitents; Old advocates principled pastoral balance.
- **Ecclesial identity** - Eucharist as constituting the church community, not merely reflecting it.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional and exegetical source for the Lord's Supper presence, fencing, and admission practices (see: "Lords Supper Presence Of Christ Fencing And Admission").
 - As a pastoral-theological model for the means-of-grace nexus-integrating preaching, sacraments, and prayer in Reformed worship formation (see: "Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer").
