### TITLE
Man Overboard: The Story of Jonah (for biblical-theological method) - Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th/early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical milieu; pastoral and academic impulse to recover typological, Christ-centered readings of Old Testament narrative within evangelical biblical-theological method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The story of Jonah functions as a Christ-foreshadowing narrative and a test-case for a biblical-theological method that reads Old Testament history and narrative as oriented to Christ and the expansion of God's kingdom to the nations.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Opening: situates Jonah within prophetic and narrative literature and frames the book as a compact theological parable rather than a mere historical anecdote.
 - Exposition of Jonah's flight: explores human rebellion, misplaced zeal, and the theological problem of a prophet who resists divine mercy.
 - The "man overboard" motif: Jonah's being cast into the sea and swallowed by the great fish as typological signs of death, burial, and deliverance - a prefiguration that points forward to Christ's death and resurrection.
 - Nineveh and Gentile mission: reads the conversion of Nineveh as anticipatory of the Gentile mission and the widening of the covenantal horizon of God's kingdom.
 - Christological synthesis and methodological reflection: argues that the canonical reading of Jonah provides a legitimate, pastorally responsible Christocentric hermeneutic for Old Testament narratives.
 - Application: pastoral implications for preaching Christ, understanding divine compassion, and the church's mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformed and evangelical exegetical tradition (implicitly Calvinistic typology), contemporary biblical-theological voices (narrative and canonical critics), pastoral homiletical practice. (Ferguson dialogues more by style and method than by systematic citation of a single rival school.)
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (prefiguration and messianic consciousness), kingdom of God (mission to Gentiles), typology/typological method, providence, divine mercy/chesed, repentance, covenant expansion, biblical revelation and canonical reading.
- **Closing line:** Jonah is presented as an anti-type whose failure highlights human rebellion and sets the stage for the true Messianic obedience and mercy embodied in Christ, thereby offering a concise model for a Christ-centered biblical-theological method.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats Jonah explicitly as a Christ-foreshadow and as a vehicle for reflecting on **messianic consciousness** and the nature of God's kingdom.
 - Uses the image of "man overboard" to stress human helplessness and divine rescuing - a compact pastoral motif linking narrative detail with Christological interpretation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against purely historical-critical or reductionist readings that demythologize Jonah or treat it solely as satire; insists on canonical and typological readings within a confessional posture.
 - Contrasts with overly allegorical approaches by rooting typology in historical-narrative contours and canonical purpose rather than arbitrary spiritualization.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes the idea of an OT narrative functioning as a "sign" pointing to Christ and the kingdom - not only predictive prophecy but narrative typology that shapes Christological expectation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in Reformed-pastoral circles as a concise, usable model for preaching Jonah and teaching Christ-centered reading of OT narratives; used in homiletics and biblical-theology syllabi.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact exemplar of how to combine careful narrative exposition with theological typology; valuable for pastors, teachers, and students seeking a Christ-centered hermeneutic that remains anchored in canonical and pastoral concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Jonah:** The narrative-prophet whose flight and recovery serve as the work's focal typological material.
- **Man overboard:** Central image; human sin and helplessness placed against divine rescue - used as pastoral-catechetical motif.
- **Typology / type and anti-type:** Jonah functions as a type (and anti-type) pointing to Christ's death, burial, resurrection, and mission.
- **Sign:** Narrative events as theological signs - the fish, the sea, and the city of Nineveh function as signs oriented to Christ and kingdom reality.
- **Messianic consciousness:** Ferguson's reading stresses how Jonah's story anticipates and clarifies expectations surrounding the Messiah and contrasts human prophetic failure with Messianic fidelity.
- **Kingdom of God:** Understood as covenantal rule extended to Gentiles; Nineveh's repentance anticipates the expansion of the kingdom.
- **Divine mercy / chesed:** Central theological datum - God's compassion toward enemies and nations is a hermeneutical key to Jonah and to Christ's mission.
- **Gentile mission / Nineveh:** Nineveh serves as paradigmatic Gentile recipient of God's grace, prefiguring the church's mission.
- **Death-resurrection symbolism:** Jonah's immersion and emergence read typologically as prefiguring Christ's redemptive work.
- **Repentance:** Corporate and individual repentance as the expected human response to God's revealed word and sign.
- **Providence:** God's sovereign orchestration of events (storm, fish, plant) as revelatory for mission and mercy.
- **Canonical reading:** Emphasis on reading Jonah within the canonical whole and theological economy rather than isolated historical-critical slices.
- **Narrative theology:** Use of narrative form as theological argument and hermeneutical vehicle.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for typological and Christ-centered reading of OT narrative.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching and teaching Jonah and similar prophetic narratives.
 - As a **polemic resource** against non-typological or purely historical-critical dismissals of Christological readings in Old Testament theology.
