### TITLE
**Bavinck on the Christian Life: Following Jesus in Faithful Service** (edited by John Bolt) 
Author: Herman Bavinck (selections) - practical-theological essays, lectures, and excerpts assembled to show Bavinck's theology of Christian discipleship.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Dutch Reformed context (neo-Calvinist milieu linked to Kuyper; Bavinck as academic theologian and pastor).
 - Editor John Bolt curates texts to highlight Bavinck's pastoral-ethical application of dogmatics for modern readers.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life is covenantal and ecclesial - a sustained, sanctified response of faithful service rooted in union with Christ and governed by revelation. Doctrine and devotion are inseparable.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Exposition of Christian vocation: life ordered by calling, prayer, sacraments, and communal worship.
 - Theology as formative: dogmatic truths (Trinity, incarnation, atonement) shape moral formation and practice.
 - Practical outworking: sanctification as habitual obedience, social responsibility grounded in common grace, and perseverance in faith.
 - Pastoral emphases: pastoral care, catechesis, and the church's institutional means of grace sustain the Christian life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture, Calvin and classic Reformed scholastics, contemporary Kuyperian concerns; dialogues implicitly with pietism, liberal moralism, and modern secularizing culture.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Word/sacrament, covenant theology, union with Christ, holiness/sanctification, vocation, ecclesiology, and pastoral theology.
 - Underpinning dogmatic commitments (Trinity, Christology) used to ground ethical prescriptions.
- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers the Christian life as the faithful, covenantal service of believers formed by the revealed triune God and sustained by union with Christ through the church's means of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of systematic theology with concrete pastoral practice: doctrine is inherently formative for life.
 - Emphasis on the corporate and covenantal character of piety - sanctification is ecclesial, not merely individualistic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against pietism that severs doctrine from practice; corrects liberal moralism that detaches ethics from objective revelation.
 - More scholastically disciplined than popular pietistic devotionalists, but more pastoral and existentially concerned than cold academic dogmatics.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses classic scholastic distinctions (e.g., attributes) to undergird practical theology; frames Christian life as "faithful service" highlighting duty and grace together.
 - Treats vocation broadly (personal, familial, societal) as an arena of sanctification shaped by grace and calling.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Revived interest among Reformed pastors and scholars for bridging dogmatics and discipleship; influential in neo-Calvinist and contemporary Reformed renewal.
 - Used as a corrective resource in pastoral training and in movements emphasizing robust doctrine in spiritual formation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how careful theology can and should inform pastoral care and Christian ethics; supplies a durable framework for teaching vocation, worship, and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological category explaining origin, sustenance, and goal of the Christian life (source of sanctification and service).
- **Covenant**
 - Organizing framework: relational promises that bind God and people and structure Christian duty and assurance.
- **Faithful service**
 - Bavinck's preferred idiom: service as covenantal obedience empowered by grace rather than mere moralism.
- **Revelation (Word and Sacrament)**
 - Means by which God forms believers; ecclesial practices are formative for Christian living.
- **Vocation**
 - Broadly conceived calling - domestic, ecclesial, public - as the context for faithful discipleship.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive, communal, and pastoral: discipline, means of grace, and church life produce holiness over time.
- **Absolute attributes**
 - Attributes of God "in himself" (e.g., simplicity, immutability, eternity, infinity).
 - Bavinck uses the absolute/relative distinction to guard divine aseity while explaining how we name God analogically.
- **Relative attributes**
 - Attributes "toward" creaturely relations (e.g., love, mercy, wisdom, power as apprehensible in relation to creatures).
 - Function in Bavinck to show how God knows and acts toward creation without fragmenting the divine essence.
- **Analogia fidei**
 - Principle that knowledge of God is governed by revelation (faith-shaped analogy): theological language must conform to the pattern of Scripture and the Christ-event.
 - Bavinck privileges this as hermeneutical control for theology and piety.
- **Analogia entis**
 - The notion of an ontological analogy of being (creaturely being analogous to divine being) - treated critically.
 - Bavinck warns against relying on an autonomous analogy of being independent of revelation; emphasizes analogia fidei to avoid speculative projection.
- **Common grace**
 - Grounds civic responsibility and social ethics; enables cultural engagement without erasing the need for redemption.
- **Church / Means of Grace**
 - Ecclesial structures (preaching, sacraments, discipline) are formative instruments for the Christian life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **praxis-oriented definition source**: connects dogmatic loci (union with Christ, covenant) to pastoral duties and sanctification.
- As a **polemic and corrective**: supplies arguments against pietistic antinomian tendencies and liberal moralist ethics by reasserting doctrinal foundations.
- As an **exegetical/pedagogical model**: exemplar for teaching pastoral theology that remains thoroughly doctrinal and ecclesial.
