### TITLE
**Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament - Gregory K. Beale**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical scholarship (late 20th-early 21st c.) seeking to systematize how the New Testament authoritatively re-reads the Old. Positioned within conservative, canon-aware hermeneutics and informed by recent literary and intertextual methods.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament treats the Old Testament not merely as background but as divinely authoritative Scripture whose texts function Christologically and canonically; accurate NT interpretation requires mapping forms of citation, allusion, and typological recapitulation while preserving historical-grammatical integrity and doctrinal confidence in inspiration.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey and typology of NT uses of OT: explicit citation, midrashic reapplication, echo/allusion, citation with intentional recontextualization.
 - Methodological proposal: integrate form-critical, redactional, and intertextual tools within a **canonical-canonicalizing** frame that gives priority to the NT authors' intentions and to the unity of Scripture.
 - Theological payoff: NT hermeneutics yield Christocentric and covenantal readings that underpin key doctrines (Christology, soteriology, covenant).
- **Major moves / sub-bullets**
 - Differentiate concrete citation types and propose criteria to distinguish literal quotation from typological fulfillment.
 - Defend the theological legitimacy of NT reapplication of OT texts (including expansions, ethical displacements, and covenantal reinterpretation).
 - Situate NT use within doctrines of inspiration and inerrancy: apostolic citations confirm OT meaning and canonical continuity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical and modern interpreters: patristic typologists, medieval allegorists, Reformation covenant theologians, modern critics (form-critical, historical-critical), and scholars of canonical criticism.
 - Dialogues with Meredith G. Kline on covenant formulations and with scholars proposing midrashic models for NT citation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/inspiration/inerrancy; Christology; typology and fulfillment; covenant theology; biblical theology vs. systematic theology; ethics arising from covenantal intrusion.
- **Site usages (selected topical references)**
 - **Klinean Covenant Theology & Intrusion Ethics** - discusses Klinean covenant structures where NT fulfillment functions as covenantal "intrusion" that reorders ethical norms (see sectional treatments on covenantal recapitulation).
 - **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology** - argues for a canonical-biblical-theological method that informs systematic claims rather than being subordinate to abstract systems.
 - **Inspiration & Inerrancy** - frames NT use of OT as evidence for authoritative inspiration; citation practices reinforce a high view of scripture.
 - **Typology & Fulfillment** - extensive analysis of typology as a legitimate, rule-governed hermeneutical category linking persons/events/rites in the OT to their eschatological realization in Christ.
- **Closing line**
 - The Handbook centers on a **canonical, Christocentric hermeneutic**: the NT's authoritative reuse of the OT is both theologically normative and methodologically tractable, grounding doctrine and preaching in the unity of Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic mapping of citation types with practical criteria for locating **allusion vs. quotation vs. echo**.
 - Championing of a canonical approach that preserves authorial intention while honoring the theological reading practiced by NT writers.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against reductive historical-critical accounts that relegate NT uses to purely rhetorical or midrashic play; insists on theological intentionality and apostolic authority.
 - Corrects naïve typology by supplying methodological guardrails (not allegorizing; historically rooted correspondences).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clear taxonomy of intertextual relations (verbal citation, formal quotation, echo, allusion, recapitulation) used heuristically across exegetical practice.
 - Use of "canonical-citation praxis" to name the NT habit of treating OT texts as normative for present theological claims.
- **Reception & influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical scholarship and seminary classrooms as a standard reference; cited in debates over Christology, preaching, and biblical authority.
 - Critiques mainly from proponents of strictly historical-critical approaches who caution against conflating theological re-use with original meaning.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for integrating exegesis, theology, and homiletics; supplies reliable criteria for pastors and scholars discerning legitimate typology and fulfillment claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Intertextuality** - broad category for how NT texts relate to OT language and thought (includes quotation, allusion, echo).
- **Quotation vs. Allusion vs. Echo** - taxonomy distinguishing precise citation from looser verbal or thematic resonance.
- **Typology** - patterned correspondence between OT persons/events/institutions and Christ, governed by criteria that avoid arbitrary allegory.
- **Fulfillment** - NT claim that OT figures/events reach eschatological reality in Christ; can be partial, anticipatory, or consummative.
- **Canonical approach** - interpretive stance prioritizing the final canonical shape and the NT authors' reading of the OT.
- **Inspiration / Inerrancy** - doctrinal backdrop: NT re-use presupposes and reinforces the divine authority and trustworthiness of the OT.
- **Covenant recapitulation / intrusion ethics** - idea (linked to Klinean thought) that NT fulfillment "intrudes" to reorder covenantal obligations and ethics.
- **Midrashic model** - comparative category; Beale distinguishes genuine rabbinic midrash from theologically governed apostolic reapplication.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic** - principle that Christ is the key to OT meaning as exercised in NT interpretation.
- **Hermeneutical criteria** - concrete rules for assessing when NT use preserves original sense vs. adapts it for theological ends.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - tracing progressive revelation and fulfillment across Scripture.
- **Canonical-citation praxis** - Beale's term for NT's normative use of OT Scripture.
- **Allusional network** - the web of echoes and citations through which authors build theological argument.
- **Ethical displacement** - how fulfillment reconfigures prior covenant stipulations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: practical guide to identify and justify types of OT use in NT exegesis.
 - As a **definition source**: precise terminology for typology, citation types, and canonical reasoning.
 - As a **polemic resource**: defense of inspiration/inerrancy and critique of purely historical-critical reductions.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking biblical theology (canon-focused reading) to systematic claims (Christology, covenantal ethics).
