### TITLE
Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Greek Palaeography - Bruce M. Metzger (late 20th-century introduction to Greek biblical palaeography)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century scholarship in New Testament textual criticism and historical philology.
 - Oriented to academic and seminary audiences needing practical skills in manuscript study; reflects a largely ecumenical, historically grounded Protestant-critical milieu.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reliable study of the Greek biblical text requires systematic palaeographical and codicological skill: dating, classifying, and reading manuscripts is foundational for reconstructing the text behind the printed Bible and for grounding claims about canon and tradition.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of scripts and hands: characteristics of uncials (majuscule) and minuscules; regional and chronological script features.
 - Codicological features: material supports (parchment, papyrus), quire structure, ruling, binding, and page layout.
 - Scribal practice and apparatus: nomina sacra, punctuation, breathings/accents, ligatures, corrections, marginalia, colophons, and lectionary markings.
 - Technical methods for dating and provenance: comparative typology, internal evidence, and the limits of precision.
 - Practical illustrations: photographic plates and specimen hands to train identification and dating.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the work of earlier textual critics and palaeographers (Tischendorf, Scrivener, Gregory), catalogues of manuscripts, and archaeological finds (papyrus discoveries).
 - Dialogue with contemporary practices in philology and codicology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Not a doctrinal theology; implications bear on **Canon and Tradition**: how manuscript evidence undergirds historical claims about the formation, transmission, and authoritative status of biblical texts.
 - Indirect bearing on doctrines of revelation and inerrancy to the extent that textual history informs claims about original wording.
- **Closing line**
 - Metzger frames Greek manuscripts as material witnesses whose careful palaeographical study is indispensable for honestly situating the biblical text within the history of canon and tradition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Practical, skill-oriented primer: trains readers to *see* and date hands, not merely to read secondary summaries.
 - Integration of palaeography with codicology and text-critical concerns rather than treating script as isolated antiquarian interest.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters casual or dogmatic appeals to an imagined pristine autograph; resists simplistic notions of uniform transmission by highlighting variety and gradual stabilization.
 - More empirically grounded than earlier 19th-century romantic or purely conjectural textual approaches.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operational criteria for dating and classification; accessible use of specimen plates standardizes teaching practice.
 - Emphasizes the interpretive weight of paratextual features (colophons, lectionary apparatus) for reconstructing reception history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard introductory text in seminaries and university courses on New Testament textual criticism; widely cited across confessional lines.
 - Influenced generations of textual critics, paleographers, and historians of the biblical canon.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as the durable methodological bridge between manuscript evidence and theological claims about canon and tradition; indispensable for courses on text criticism and for primary-source work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Palaeography**
 - Study of ancient handwriting; primary method for dating and localizing Greek biblical manuscripts.
- **Uncial (majuscule)**
 - Early, rounded script used until roughly the 9th century; key for identifying early witnesses.
- **Minuscule**
 - More compact, cursive script emerging circa 9th century; correlates with major shifts in manuscript production and text-type dissemination.
- **Nomina sacra**
 - Standardized sacred-name abbreviations; diagnostic of Christian scribal practice and helpful for identifying Christian codices.
- **Codicology**
 - Study of the book as object (quires, ruling, binding); complements palaeographic dating and informs use contexts (liturgical vs. private).
- **Colophon**
 - Scribal or owner note often giving date, place, or circumstances of copying; crucial but cautious evidence for chronology and provenance.
- **Palimpsest**
 - Reused parchment preserving earlier texts; important source of otherwise-lost readings.
- **Palaeographic dating**
 - Relative dating by script comparison; useful but imprecise-typically estimates within a century.
- **Breathings and accents**
 - Later orthographic features whose presence/absence helps date and localize manuscripts and affects reading practice.
- **Marginalia / corrections**
 - Witness to reception history and the process of textual standardization; reveals correcting hands, lectionary adaptations.
- **Lectionary apparatus**
 - Markings indicating liturgical use; ties text transmission to ecclesial practice and canonical usage.
- **Ligatures & scribal hands**
 - Idiosyncratic connections and hand features used to distinguish scribes and workshops.
- **Text-type markers (Byzantine, Alexandrian indicators)**
 - Codicological and palaeographical correlation helps map how text-types spread and how canonical texts were standardized.
- **Sigla and description conventions**
 - Standardized labels for manuscripts; Metzger emphasizes consistent descriptive practice.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for manuscript description and palaeographic criteria in studies of Canon and Tradition.
 - As an **exegetical model** for establishing a working text before theological interpretation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over textual reliability and the historical formation of the biblical canon.
