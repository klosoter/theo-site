### TITLE
**The Work of Christ** (1993), Robert Letham 
IVP, Contours of Christian Theology series; Reformed-evangelical ressourcement with strong patristic retrieval

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical theology; renewed attention to Trinity, patristics, and atonement models.
 - Part of IVP Contours series, aiming at biblical, historical, and systematic integration.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The work of Christ is the whole incarnational economy of the Son from incarnation to ascension and session, accomplished in Trinitarian coordinates and applied by the Holy Spirit in **union with Christ**. The cross is penal and victorious; Christ's obedience is vicarious, active and passive; the Spirit unites believers to his once-for-all achievement.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Christ's mission in Scripture: OT promises, prophetic hope, Second Adam, Servant.
 - Incarnation and life: true humanity, **impeccability** rightly construed, representative obedience.
 - Atonement: integrating **penal substitution** with Christus Victor and recapitulation.
 - Resurrection, ascension, session: royal priesthood, continuing intercession.
 - Application by the Spirit: **union with Christ** as the nexus for justification, sanctification, adoption, perseverance.
 - Ecclesial and sacramental dimensions under the **munus triplex** (prophet, priest, king).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic: Irenaeus (recapitulation), Athanasius, Cyril, Gregory Nazianzen.
 - Medieval: Anselm; Reformation and Post-Reformation: Luther, Calvin, Owen, Turretin.
 - Modern: Barth and Torrance (critically engaged), Berkouwer, Packer, Stott.
 - Confessional anchors: Westminster Standards; Augustinian anti-Pelagian tradition.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin and grace (original sin, **imputation**, bound will), person and work of Christ, atonement models, Trinity and economy, pneumatology of union and application, eschatological consummation.
- **Center of gravity**
 - Christ's vicarious obedience and atoning death, in Trinitarian mission, brought home by the Spirit as **union with Christ**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Whole-Christ soteriology: incarnation, obedient life, death, and exaltation all salvific under one divine mission.
 - **Union with Christ** as the architectonic principle for applying every benefit.
 - Explicit Trinitarian frame: the Father sends, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit unites.
 - Retrieval of patristic **recapitulation** and measured engagement with **theosis** within Reformed categories.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** accounts of nature and grace; affirms Augustinian bondage of the will and gracious initiative.
 - Resists reductive atonement: neither moral exemplarism nor Christus Victor alone; guards the penal, substitutionary core.
 - Defends **impeccability** without evacuating the reality of temptation; rejects kenotic diminutions of the incarnation.
 - Balances federal imputation with transformational union, avoiding a merely external or legalistic soteriology.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Re-centering on **active and passive obedience** as one vicarious obedience.
 - Emphasis on the Spirit as the **bond of union** (Calvin) with the exalted Christ.
 - Fresh deployment of **Second Adam** and **federal headship** within a patristically enriched frame.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Seminary staple in Reformed and evangelical curricula; often paired with works on Trinity and union with Christ.
 - Used ecumenically to map atonement models and to engage Orthodox accounts of deification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, integrative account across biblical, historical, and dogmatic lines; reliable on sin, atonement, and union.
 - Pedagogically strong for showing how Christ's finished work and the Spirit's application cohere.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active and Passive Obedience**: Christ's lifelong law-keeping and his sufferings unto death as one unified, vicarious obedience imputable to believers.
- **Impeccability (non posse peccare)**: The incarnate Son could not sin; temptations test and display obedience without implying peccability.
- **Original Sin**: Adamic corruption and guilt; depravity and death transmitted to humanity.
 - **Imputation**: Forensic reckoning of Adam's guilt to humanity and Christ's righteousness to believers (Rom 5).
- **Union with Christ**: Spirit-wrought participatory and forensic bond with the risen Christ; locus for every benefit of salvation.
- **Spirit as Bond of Union**: The Holy Spirit personally unites believers to the exalted Son, effecting participation and applying atonement.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism / Augustinianism**: Contrasting accounts of sin and grace; Letham sides with Augustinian monergism.
- **Sin and Free Will**: Post-Fall will is in bondage; grace liberates. Freedom defined as acting according to renewed nature.
- **Christus Victor and Penal Substitution**: Victory over powers through a penal, substitutionary death; not alternatives but integrative.
- **Recapitulation**: Christ re-heads humanity, retracing Adam's path in obedience for us.
- **Munus Triplex**: Christ's threefold office (prophet, priest, king) spanning earthly and exalted ministries.
- **Second Adam / Federal Headship**: Covenant representation of Christ over a new humanity, parallel to Adam.
- **Ascension and Session**: Ongoing priestly intercession and royal reign; soteriologically effective in the church.
- **Theosis (qualified)**: Participation in God by grace in Christ through the Spirit; analogized to Reformed sanctification and glorification.

- **How the work is used**
 - As a definitional source on union with Christ, active/passive obedience, and impeccability.
 - As a polemical reference against Pelagian and exemplarist atonement reductions.
 - As a conceptual bridge integrating atonement models and pneumatology across loci.
 - As an exegetical-dogmatic model linking Romans 5, Isaiah's Servant, and the Gospels to systematic theology.
