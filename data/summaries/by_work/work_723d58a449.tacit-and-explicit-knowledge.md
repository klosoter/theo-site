### TITLE
Tacit and Explicit Knowledge - Harry Collins

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published within Science and Technology Studies (STS) debates (Collins, sociologist of science, late 20th-early 21st century; book c.2010).
 - Responds to epistemology of science, cognitive science, and debates about artificial intelligence and skill transmission.
 - Method: empirical sociology/ethnography of scientific practice (laboratory studies, apprenticeship cases).

- **Central thesis**
 - Knowledge exists as **tacit** (embodied, practice-bound, socially distributed) and **explicit** (codified, propositional), and the relationship is complex: tacit elements can often be made explicit, but some knowledge remains inherently social or embodied.
 - Offers a taxonomy and mechanisms explaining when and how tacit knowledge can be converted to explicit knowledge.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose confusions in prior literature (notably Polanyi) that treat tacit as mysteriously ineffable.
 - Introduce a **tripartite taxonomy**:
 - **Relational Tacit Knowledge (RTK):** tacitness due to contextual constraints on articulation; could be made explicit with the right context/tools.
 - **Somatic Tacit Knowledge (STK):** bodily skill and perceptual know-how (e.g., riding a bike); difficult to verbalize but teachable by imitation and practice.
 - **Collective Tacit Knowledge (CTK):** knowledge embedded in group practices and coordination; not reducible to individual know-how or propositions.
 - Give empirical cases illustrating conversion processes (teaching, instrumentation, standards) and limits to explicitization.
 - Argue for the primacy of **social mechanisms** (apprenticeship, enculturation, artifact-mediated practices) in knowledge transmission.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Michael Polanyi (famous dictum "we know more than we can tell") - Collins critiques and refines Polanyi.
 - Philosophers/phenomenologists of skill (e.g., Dreyfus), philosophers of language (Wittgensteinian considerations on rule-following), cognitive scientists, AI proponents who assume full explicitability.
 - STS colleagues: Latour, Knorr Cetina, and sociologists of scientific practice.

- **Doctrines treated (implications rather than explicit theology)**
 - Epistemology of revelation, tradition, and authority: how propositional statements intersect with embodied community practices.
 - Transmission of doctrinal knowledge (analogies to catechesis, liturgy, sacramental know-how).
 - Hermeneutics and ecclesial formation: doctrine as both explicit teaching and tacit formation.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Collins reframes knowledge as fundamentally **embodied and social**, so theology must attend to communal practices and formation as much as propositional statements.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Empirical sociology grounding philosophical claims about tacit knowledge; avoids metaphysical mystification.
 - Clear taxonomy (RTK, STK, CTK) that separates sources and limits of tacitness.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges Polanyi's rhetorical claim of ineffability by showing many tacit aspects are explicable given social/instrumental changes.
 - Counters simplistic cognitive/AI positions that assume all knowledge is eventually codifiable.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The formal distinction between **relational**, **somatic**, and **collective** tacit knowledge as analytic tools.
 - Emphasis on **explicitization mechanisms** (tools, protocols, standardization, pedagogy) as social technologies.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in STS, sociology of knowledge, and philosophy of science.
 - Adopted in some theological and pastoral formation circles to analyze tradition, liturgy, and vocational formation though not a mainstream Reformed doctrinal text.
 - Used in debates over digital humanities, AI, and knowledge management.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides an operational vocabulary for exploring how beliefs and practices are learned in communities.
 - Useful for seminarians and theologians studying ecclesial formation, sacramental practice, ministerial apprenticeship, and the interplay of propositional doctrine and lived faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tacit knowledge**
 - Knowledge that is non-propositional, embodied, context-sensitive; resists simple codification.

- **Explicit knowledge**
 - Codified, articulable knowledge (texts, rules, diagrams) shareable without direct apprenticeship.

- **Relational Tacit Knowledge (RTK)**
 - Tacitness due to constraints of context or lack of appropriate language/tools; potentially explicitizable with the right relations.

- **Somatic Tacit Knowledge (STK)**
 - Bodily know-how and perceptual skill (e.g., manual techniques, musical timing) learned by practice and imitation.

- **Collective Tacit Knowledge (CTK)**
 - Knowledge held in group practices, conventions, and coordinated activities; not reducible to any individual's explicit statements.

- **Explicitization mechanisms**
 - Technologies and social processes (standardization, measurement, instruction, artifacts) that convert tacit into explicit.

- **Apprenticeship / enculturation**
 - Primary channels for transmitting tacit and collective knowledge; emphasize imitation, correction, and tacit norms.

- **Embodiment / embodied practice**
 - The idea that cognition and knowledge are shaped by bodily skill and situated action.

- **Social epistemology**
 - Focus on community as locus of knowledge production and maintenance.

- **Ethnography of practice**
 - Methodological stance: close study of practitioners to reveal tacit elements.

- **Polanyian critique**
 - Collins reframes Polanyi: accepts the insight that practice matters, rejects treating tacit as metaphysically ineffable.

- **Knowledge management**
 - Practical application in institutions seeking to preserve or transmit know-how.

- **AI/codification debate**
 - Collins used as a corrective to claims that all expert skill can be encoded for automation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing kinds of tacit knowledge in theology (formation, liturgy, sacramentality).
- As a **polemic/resource** against claims that doctrinal transmission is purely propositional - stresses apprenticeship and practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in practical theology and ecclesiology to justify attention to embodied practices, rituals, and communal formation.
