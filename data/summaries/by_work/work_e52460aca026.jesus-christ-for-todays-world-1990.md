### TITLE
Jesus Christ for Today's World (1990) - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century postwar European theology; written amid Moltmann's mature phase (after The Crucified God and Theology of Hope).
 - Engages a theological climate attentive to eschatology, political theology, liberation movements, and renewed interest in Christology after modern biblical criticism and Barthian revival.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reconstruct a Christology that is both faithful to the church's confession (incarnation, cross, resurrection) and adequate for present social, political, and eschatological challenges: Jesus Christ must be understood as the eschatological, crucified, and risen Lord whose life, death, and Spirit-mediated presence summons and empowers a transformative public witness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: traditional abstracted Christologies have often depoliticized or privatized Jesus; modern theology needs an incarnational, ecclesial, and future-oriented account.
 - Positive construction:
 - Jesus as Messiah and eschatological subject: his messianic consciousness and proclamation inaugurate the kingdom.
 - Suffering and crucifixion: God participates in human suffering; the cross exposes evil and grounds hope.
 - Resurrection and Spirit: the Spirit is the power of the future present now, guaranteeing and making operative the risen Christ.
 - Ethics and church: Christology underwrites communal and political responsibility; the church embodies the eschatological sign.
 - Systematic clarifications: engages classical formulations (e.g., Chalcedon, hypostatic union) but reframes them within a dynamic, Trinitarian, eschatological ontology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Karl Barth (critique and appropriation), Bultmann (engagement with demythologizing), patristic and Chalcedonian material, liberation and political theologians, contemporary ecumenical debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central): incarnation, eternal Sonship, hypostatic union, kenosis, impeccability.
 - **Trinity**: social/relational emphasis; Spirit as agent of resurrection and presence.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit's role in Jesus' ministry and post-resurrection life.
 - **Soteriology / Ecclesiology**: salvation as communal and political; church as sacrament of the kingdom.
 - **Eschatology**: future as present power; Antichrist and lawlessness as final opposition.
- **Closing line**
 - Moltmann's Christology centers on a living, eschatologically-shaped Jesus - crucified, risen, and present in the Spirit - who summons the church and world to a transformative, public hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Eschatological ontologizing**: the future (God's promised future) is constitutive of present reality; Christ is the point where future breaks into history.
 - **Suffering God / political solidarity**: the cross reveals God's solidarity with the oppressed; Christology is inherently political and liberative.
 - **Spirit as continuation of Christ's messianic action**: pneumatological continuity between Jesus' ministry, resurrection, and the church's mission.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects abstract, purely metaphysical Christologies (detached Chalcedonian readings) by re-embedding classical doctrines in narrative, historical, and eschatological frameworks.
 - In dialogue with Barth: affinities in Christocentrism but clearer social-political application and stronger eschatological futurity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts hypostatic union and eternal Sonship in dynamic, relational language emphasizing mission and temporality rather than static categories.
 - Emphasizes "Christ as the eschatological subject" and "Spirit as power of the future" as recurring technical turns.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Protestant social ethics, political theology, and contemporary ecumenical Christology.
 - Critiqued by some conservatives for perceived downplaying of classical metaphysical categories or for rhetorical political emphasis; praised by liberation and feminist theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating classical confession with contemporary concerns: politics, suffering, and hope; indispensable for courses treating modern Christology, political theology, and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological subject** - Christ as the agent through whom the future invades present reality; not merely future event but present power.
- **Crucified God** - God revealed in suffering; the cross as epistemic center for understanding divine solidarity and justice.
- **Resurrection as eschatological inauguration** - resurrection is the firstfruits that guarantees the future and grounds present transformation.
- **Spirit as power of the future** - the Holy Spirit enlivens the church and world with the presence and hope of the risen Christ; links Jesus' ministry to ongoing mission.
- **Hypostatic union (reframed)** - insists on the personal union of natures while stressing relational, historical, and eschatological dynamics over static metaphysics.
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation** - Sonship is both eternal relation and historical becoming; incarnation is revelatory of God's future-oriented presence.
- **Chalcedonian Definition (appropriated)** - affirms two natures but read through narrative and soteriological lenses; avoids abstract separation from life and mission.
- **Munus triplex (threefold office)** - Christ's prophet, priest, and king roles highlighted, especially kingly/eschatological and prophetic social critique.
- **Messianic consciousness & kingdom** - Jesus understood as conscious agent of God's kingdom; kingdom as present and future reality demanding ethical response.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - addressed within the context of Christ's full participation in human life without sin; source of hope for communal sanctification.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness** - eschatological oppositions framed as systemic powers and ideologies opposing God's future.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying)** - used to explain Christ's solidarity with suffering and divine humility without collapsing divinity.
- **Political theology / church as sign** - church embodies eschatological sign and performs public witness in society.
- **Resurrection-Pneumatology nexus** - resurrection and Spirit are inseparable: Spirit mediates resurrection power into community life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary Christology, relocating classical doctrines within eschatological and social frameworks.
- As an **exegetical and theological model** for reading Jesus' ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection as politically and socially formative.
- As a **polemic** against privatized or depoliticized theologies and as a resource for constructing public, hopeful Christian witness.
