### TITLE
One with Christ: An Evangelical Theology of Salvation - Marcus Peter Johnson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** contemporary evangelical theological renewal that re-centers classical Reformed and Pauline resources on the theme of union with Christ. Responds to late-20th/early-21st-century debates over forensic justification, the New Perspective on Paul, and the fragmentation of soteriology into separate doctrines (justification, sanctification, adoption).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** salvation is best understood as participation in the life of Christ; **union with Christ is the organizing principle** that coherently explains justification, sanctification, adoption, and final glorification without reducing them to mere legal fictions or purely moral processes.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation in Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians) establishing incorporation into Christ as Pauline soteriological grammar.
 - Theological framing: union with Christ as ontological and relational - grounded in Christ's person (hypostatic union) and the Spirit's work (regeneration and indwelling).
 - Doctrinal integration: shows how **imputation and participation** are complementary - justification is forensic declaration grounded in real union; sanctification is the outworking of participation.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: union informs sacramental theology, Christian identity, and ethical formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** classical Reformers (Calvin), recent Reformed scholars (Horton, Ferguson-style interlocutors), Pauline exegetes, and critics from both forensic-reductionist and New Perspective camps. Also engages broader corpus theology on covenant and Trinity.
- **Doctrines treated:** union with Christ (central), justification, sanctification, adoption, regeneration, imputation, substitutionary atonement, covenant theology, ecclesiology, sacramental implications, Trinitarian grounding, and eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Salvation is a single, Trinitarian, christocentric reality - believers are made one with Christ, and that union is the formal cause of all aspects of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Places **union with Christ** not as an adjunct to soteriology but as its formal organizing principle.
 - Argues for a **both/and** relation between forensic imputation and participatory transformation rather than an either/or.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects forensic-only accounts that treat justification as a purely legal fiction disconnected from real change.
 - Pushes back on some New Perspective tendencies that underplay individual forensic standing by restoring the complementary role of divine declaration within a participatory framework.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Treats union as the **formal cause** of salvation (philosophically robust language applied theologically) - union explains why imputation is true and why sanctification follows.
 - Systematizes a vocabulary that keeps **imputation** and **participation** analytically distinct but inseparable in praxis.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Valued among evangelicals and many in the Reformed tradition for offering a synthesized framework that preserves both classical doctrines and existential realities.
 - Serves as a bridge text for pastors and teachers seeking to avoid polarizing forensics vs. participation debates.
 - Criticized by strict forensic reductionists for perceived dilution of forensic precision and by some New Perspective advocates for retaining robust forensic claims.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, pastorally sensitive model for teaching soteriology around a unifying center.
 - Useful as a curricular text in advanced BTh/MDiv courses on soteriology, Pauline theology, and pastoral doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** central category - believers are ontologically incorporated into Christ by the Spirit; ground of all salvation.
- **Imputation:** forensic reckoning of Christ's righteousness to believers; maintained as valid but explained relationally via union.
- **Participation:** believers share in Christ's life, death, and resurrection; the experiential outworking of union.
- **Forensic/legal:** the legal dimension of justification; not discarded but located within relational union.
- **Federal headship:** Christ as representative/head; union explains how his obedience and suffering belong to believers.
- **Regeneration/indwelling Spirit:** the Spirit actualizes union, enabling new life and identity in Christ.
- **Sanctification:** ethical and spiritual formation that flows from being one with Christ; both declarative and transformative.
- **Adoption:** social/legal incorporation into God's family grounded in union.
- **Substitutionary atonement:** affirmed; its efficacy is secured by union - Christ's substitution transfers benefits to those in him.
- **Eschatological consummation:** union is already-not-yet; final glorification completes the participatory reality.
- **Formal cause (union as):** technical move to show union explains why other soteriological descriptions are true.
- **Covenant theology:** used to frame corporate and interpersonal dimensions of union - covenantal membership in Christ.
- **Ecclesial/sacramental implications:** sacraments as signs/seals and means that mediate union in the church.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for courses on soteriology emphasizing union-centered frameworks.
 - As a **polemic** that moderates both forensic-reductionist and anti-forensic extremes.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts where incorporation and participation are primary interpretive keys.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and pastoral formation to unify doctrine and discipleship.
