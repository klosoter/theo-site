### TITLE
Contributions by Richard B. Gaffin Jr. to "Theonomy and Eschatology: Reformed Perspectives" - a redemptive-historical, covenantal critique of theonomy situating law within inaugurated eschatology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th/early 21st-century Reformed debates over theonomy (advocates: Rushdoony, North, Bahnsen) and responses from covenantal/evangelical Reformed theologians.
 - Gaffin writes from a confessional Reformed, redemptive-historical perspective shaped by Vosian covenant theology and careful patristic and Reformation reception (notably Augustine and Calvinic trajectories).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Theonomy mistakes the eschatological status of the Mosaic civil order by failing to distinguish inaugurated from consummated aspects of Christ's kingdom; it thereby risks juridical and moral errors that undermine Augustinian/Reformed emphases on grace and the bondage of the will.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic move: defines theonomy's claim (continuing civil application of Mosaic law) and exposes its underlying premises about covenant continuity and the mediatorial kingdom.
 - Eschatological correction: deploys an inaugurated/consummated eschatology to locate Christ's present reign as real but not yet exhaustive, so that expectations for immediate civil theocratic realization are misplaced.
 - Law-teaching move: distinguishes the abiding moral imperatives rooted in God's character (and summarized in the Ten Commandments) from the temporary civil-ceremonial prescriptions tied to Israel's covenant economy.
 - Soteriological safeguard: aligns with Augustinian emphases against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian tendencies - argues theonomy can implicitly reintroduce human merit and overestimates human capacity for covenantal conformity apart from definite grace.
 - Practical implication: cautions the church and magistrate to pursue justice and moral order without presuming direct transposition of Mosaic civil sanctions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal interlocutors: theonomic advocates (Rushdoony, North, Bahnsen) and contemporary Reformed critics.
 - Theological resources: Augustine (grace and sin), Reformation expositors (Calvin on law and gospel), Vosian redemptive-historical method, and Pauline law-gospel distinctions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (inaugurated/consummated), covenant theology (continuity and discontinuity), the doctrine of law (moral vs ceremonial/civil), soteriology (grace vs human ability), ecclesiology and the role of the civil magistrate, and hermeneutics of Old Testament law.

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's contribution centers the argument that a rightly ordered Reformed theology of law must be governed by redemptive-historical eschatology and Augustinian soteriology, preserving the moral normativity of God's law without collapsing the already-not-yet kingdom into a demand for present civil imposition of Mosaic sanctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong integration of inaugurated eschatology as the hermeneutical key to questions about law and civic order.
 - Careful rearticulation of the moral law's abiding normative role while rejecting direct civil transplantation of Israel's theocratic statutes.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects theonomy by insisting on eschatological restraint: Christ's present reign transforms but does not consummate social-political reality.
 - Contrasts with Rushdoony/North/Bahnsen who read greater civil continuity in Mosaic prescriptions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the phraseology of "mediatorial kingdom present but not consummate" as decisive for legal-political theology.
 - Frames theonomy's tendency toward moralism as a quasi-Pelagian slide - a terminological linkage that foregrounds soteriological stakes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by many conservative Reformed readers as a cautionary corrective to theonomic programs; influential in Reformed seminaries teaching law/eschatology.
 - Functioned as a bridge between confessional Reformed eschatology and practical polity debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable template for assessing any movement that seeks to impose Old Covenant legal forms on the New Covenant church/state.
 - Useful as a model for integrating biblical-theological exegesis with practical political theology under the banner of covenantal continuity/discontinuity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theonomy**
 - The claim that Mosaic law (including civil sanctions) continues to bind modern civil magistrates; Gaffin critiques its eschatological presuppositions.

- **Inaugurated eschatology (Already/Not Yet)**
 - Central hermeneutical category: Christ's kingdom is present in power but awaits consummation; limits theonomy's civil expectations.

- **Mosaic law (civil, ceremonial, moral distinction)**
 - Gaffin insists on a tripartite distinction: moral law normative, ceremonial fulfilled in Christ, civil tied to Israel's covenant context.

- **Mediatorial kingdom**
 - The reign of Christ as mediator: present efficacy for salvation and normative instruction, yet awaiting full public social manifestation.

- **Covenant continuity/discontinuity**
 - A hermeneutical axis: continuity in promises/persons, discontinuity in specific covenantal administrations and sanctions.

- **Law-Gospel distinction**
 - Clarifies pastoral and pedagogical roles of law without making law the ground of civil justification or human merit.

- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism**
 - Used as polemical categories: theonomy is warned to risk Pelagianizing moral responsibility (overestimating unaided human conformity) or semi-Pelagian appeals to human initiative in covenant life.

- **Augustinianism**
 - Gaffin roots his soteriological guardrail here: human bondage to sin and primacy of prevenient/gracious work of God against any juridical moralism.

- **Civil magistrate**
 - Discussed as having God-ordained duties to restrain evil and promote justice, but not to function as Israel'socratic administrator of Mosaic ceremonial/capital codes.

- **Redemptive-historical exegesis**
 - Methodological stance: read OT law in the unfolding economy of redemption with Christ as climactic interpreter and fulfillment.

- **Normativity of the Ten Commandments**
 - Affirmed as theological and moral guide for Christian life, distinct from Mosaic civil penalties.

- **Consummation**
 - Eschatological term used to delimit present application of law and the limits of Christian political ambition.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against theonomic political programs and theocratic legislation proposals.
- As an **exegetical and hermeneutical model** for reading OT law in a redemptive-historical frame and teaching law/gospel distinctions in systematic theology and homiletics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Augustinian soteriology and Reformed covenantal polity in discussions of church/state relations and Christian ethics.
