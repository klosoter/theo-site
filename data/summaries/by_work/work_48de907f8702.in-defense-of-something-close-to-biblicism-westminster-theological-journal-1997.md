### TITLE
**John M. Frame, "In Defense of Something Close to Biblicism," Westminster Theological Journal 59 (1997): 227-249.**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical milieu (1990s). Responds to rising pressure from historical-critical scholarship, popular theistic-evolution accounts, and internal evangelical debates over biblical authority.
 - Published in WTJ, signaling an audience of theological scholars concerned with hermeneutics, systematic theology, and apologetics.

- **Central thesis**
 - A qualified form of **biblicism**-one that privileges Scripture as the controlling norm for theology and interpretation-is both defensible and necessary. This stance best supports the historicity and **federal headship of Adam**, and hence core doctrines of sin, covenant, and atonement.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological claim: interpretive stance should start with Scripture's self-witness; Scripture interprets Scripture; theological coherence governs reading of contested texts.
 - Epistemic defense: biblical authority is the proper presupposition for theological knowledge; alternatives (e.g., critical naturalism) illegitimately displace the Bible.
 - Exegetical moves:
 - Read Pauline passages (esp. Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) as presupposing a historical Adam whose action is the ground for federal representation.
 - Typological and covenantal readings require an actual Adam to function as federal head and prototype of Christ.
 - Polemic: critiques both liberal-critical denials of Adam and naïve literalisms that ignore literary/genre issues; rejects theistic-evolution moves that decouple historical personhood from Pauline and covenantal structures.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with modern critical scholarship and theological accommodations to evolutionary narratives; dialogues implicitly with other Reformed thinkers who have proposed non-historical readings.
 - Draws on Pauline exegesis, covenant theology tradition, and presuppositional apologetic principles associated with Reformed epistemology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation & authority of Scripture (hermeneutical priority).
 - Anthropology (origins, Adam).
 - Hamartiology (origin and corporate nature of sin).
 - Soteriology (atonement and Adam-Christ typology / federal headship).
 - Covenant theology (federal representation).

- **Closing line**
 - Frame advances that a principled, theologically informed biblicism is the best hermeneutic for securing the historicity and federal significance of Adam and, by extension, the coherence of gospel doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats "biblicism" not as crude literalism but as an epistemic-theological posture: Scripture as controlling norm that shapes method, not an a priori rule that ignores literary and historical nuance.
 - Strong linkage of epistemology (how we know) with hermeneutics (how we read Scripture).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal-critical approaches that treat Genesis as myth or non-historical antecedent to Paul.
 - Distinguishes itself from fundamentalist surface readings by allowing nuanced genre and typological interpretation while still insisting on historical referents where theology requires them.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "biblicism" as a defensible, moderate posture-"something close to biblicism" rather than caricatured extremes.
 - Emphasizes **federal headship** as an interpretive hinge: whether Adam functions as an actual head-person affects soteriological exegesis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed scholars and pastors debating Adam's historicity and the compatibility of evolution with orthodox soteriology.
 - Cited in subsequent defenses of a historical Adam and in debates over evangelical hermeneutics; respected for clarity and methodological refinement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating theological commitments with rigorous exegesis.
 - Useful corrective to both anti-supernaturalist readings and to uncritical literalism; valuable for teaching hermeneutics, systematic theology, and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblicism** - framed as a principled stance giving Scripture normative control over theology and interpretation (qualified, not simplistic).
- **Historicity of Adam** - argued to be theologically required by Pauline and covenantal claims; not merely a pagan or mythical figure.
- **Federal headship (Adam as federal head)** - Adam functions as representative of humanity; his act has corporate consequences (ground for Romans 5 theology).
- **Scripture interprets Scripture** - hermeneutical maxim: unclear passages must be read in light of clearer biblical teaching (esp. Paul).
- **Paulinian typology** - Adam as type/prototype of Christ; typology demands an actual historical referent for theological efficacy.
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - epistemic posture that places the Word of God as prior to secular and critical presuppositions.
- **Theological coherence** - criterion for reading Scripture: interpretations that undermine core doctrines (sin, atonement) are inadequate.
- **Qualified literal-historical reading** - affirms historical reality where the text and its theological usage require it; allows for literary sensitivity without relativizing truth.
- **Hermeneutical priority** - the theological and redemptive-historical context governs exegesis.
- **Critique of accomodationism** - objects to theological revisions (e.g., certain theistic-evolution accounts) that disconnect biblical teaching from historical claims.
- **Doctrine of revelation** - undergirds authority claims; revelation is propositional and historically grounded for Frame's argument.
- **Covenant theology** - background framework that makes federal headship theologically salient.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for a moderate, defensible form of biblicism in hermeneutics and epistemology.
- As a **polemic** against non-historical or accommodationist readings of Adam (useful in debates over evolution and origins).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts that depend on a historical Adam (Romans 5; 1 Cor 15) within covenantal theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching to connect revelation, covenant, and soteriology around the person of Adam.
