### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Divine Covenants (entry in The Imperial Bible Dictionary) - Patrick Fairbairn (19th-century Scottish Reformed theologian)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑19th century British/Scottish Reformed milieu; contribution to a widely used encyclopedic reference for Bible students and clergy.
 - Written against the background of Enlightenment criticism, rising historical‑critical methods, and continuing debates within covenant theology among Presbyterians and other Reformed communities.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To expound and defend the classical Reformed schema of the divine covenants: especially the reality and juridical character of the **Covenant of Works** with Adam and the Covenant of Grace after the Fall; to show their relation and theological significance for Christ, redemption, and ecclesial practice.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and nature: covenants are divine, legally framed relations between God and humanity grounded in revelation and law.
 - The Covenant of Works: pre‑Fall arrangement, probationary condition for Adam, sanction and promise tied to obedience; not merely hypothetical but a real federal bond.
 - The Covenant of Grace: instituted after the Fall, founded upon divine mercy while preserving legal and forensic aspects (promises, conditions, mediation).
 - Continuity and distinction: unity of divine economy (one plan of redemption) yet different administrations and legal relations (works vs grace, law vs promise).
 - Christ as Mediator and Federal Head: Jesus fulfills the demands of the Covenant of Works on behalf of the elect and secures the promises of the Covenant of Grace.
 - Practical/ministerial consequences: sacraments, preaching, and pastoral assurance framed by covenantal categories (signs, seals, federal imputation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformed orthodox authorities (Calvinic and Westminster traditions), uses biblical exegesis (Law/Gospel, Pauline forensics), and responds implicitly to 19th‑century rationalists and some revivalist or legalistic distortions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (covenantal disclosure), covenant theology, law and gospel, Christology (mediatorial/headship), soteriology (imputation, justification), ecclesiology (sacraments as covenant signs).
- **Closing line**
 - Fairbairn presents covenant theology as the juridical backbone of redemption: Adam's probationary Covenant of Works establishes law and liability, Christ's mediatorial obedience secures the Covenant of Grace and the church's covenantal life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the *real, juridical* character of the Covenant of Works (not a mere didactic or hypothetical construct) and its concrete sanctions and promises.
 - Balances forensic/legal categories with pastoral and typological readings - law is strict but providentially ordered toward grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against readings that reduce the Covenant of Works to an abstract moral principle or mere probation without legal standing.
 - Distinguishes itself from antinomian or purely moral‑therapeutic readings by keeping legal imputation and federal headship central.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic clarity in treating covenants as "administrations" within one divine economy - helpful terminological bridge between earlier federal theology and later covenantal systems.
 - Emphasizes sacramental and ecclesial ramifications of covenant categories (signs/seals as covenantal instruments).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in 19th‑century Scottish and broader Reformed circles as a lucid, pastoral defence of classical covenant theology; used in clergy education and reference.
 - Influence waned in some modern trends but remained a touchstone for conservative covenant theologians in subsequent histories of doctrine.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact statement of covenantal structure that aids exegetical work on Adamic theology, Pauline forensic argument, and sacramental theology; useful as both historical summary and polemical exemplar for defenders of federal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Pre‑Fall federal bond between God and Adam; obedience as condition, sanction at breach; real legal arrangement.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Post‑Fall covenant grounded in promise and mediation, maintaining legal elements but founded on divine mercy through Christ.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Adam (and then Christ) as representative parties whose acts accrue to many; central to imputation and forensic reckoning.
- **Probation**
 - The testing period constituted by the Covenant of Works; moral and legal responsibility centered on Adam.
- **Imputation**
 - Transfer of righteousness/ guilt between federal head and constituents; key to justification and original liability.
- **Administration (of covenants)**
 - The ways covenants are dispensed historically (typology, sacraments, promises) while retaining one divine plan.
- **Typology**
 - Use of Old Testament persons/events as covenantal precursors fulfilled in Christ; aids pastoral exposition and sacramental logic.
- **Sacraments as Signs/Seals**
 - Baptism and the Lord's Supper seen as covenantal instruments that confirm promises and obligations.
- **Law vs Promise**
 - Law as covenantal requirement (works); promise as covenantal assurance (grace) - yet linked in the divine economy.
- **Forensic/Juridical Language**
 - Emphasizes legal metaphors (debt, obligation, verdict) in describing covenant relations and soteriology.
- **Original Righteousness**
 - The condition owed to Adam under the Covenant of Works prior to the Fall.
- **Mediatorial Obedience**
 - Christ's fulfilling of covenantal demands on behalf of the elect.
- **Continuity/Discontinuity**
 - Analytical pair to explain unity of redemptive plan and changed administrations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for classical Covenant of Works formulations in historical theology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductive or non‑federal interpretations of Adamic probation.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Adamic, Pauline, and sacramental texts under a federal framework.
