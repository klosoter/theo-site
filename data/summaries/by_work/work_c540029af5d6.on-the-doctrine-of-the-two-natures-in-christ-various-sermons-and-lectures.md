### TITLE
On the Doctrine of the Two Natures in Christ (various sermons and lectures) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th century German Protestant theology (late Enlightenment / Romantic era); Schleiermacher lectured at the University of Berlin and preached in Reformed contexts. These Christological treatments arise from his lifelong project to reconcile historic Christian doctrine with modern subjectivity, philosophical critique (Kantianism), and historical criticism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to hold the classical Chalcedonian claim of **two natures (divine and human) united in one person** without collapsing into metaphysical dualism, Nestorian separation, or Monophysite fusion - and while making Christian doctrine intelligible in terms of religious consciousness and ethical life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of scholastic/metaphysical accounts that treat natures as abstract substances separable from personal lived unity.
 - Re-framing of the hypostatic union in **psychological and existential terms**: the decisive datum is Christ's unique **religious (God-)consciousness** and the personal unity this consciousness establishes between divine and human modes of being.
 - Preservation of Chalcedonian boundaries by insisting on real difference of natures (no confusion) while grounding unity in the **person (Hypostasis)** and the continuous life of God-consciousness rather than in metaphysical aggregation.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences: Christ's perfect religious consciousness is the archetypal mediator enabling revelation, sanctification, and atonement - the Word becomes subjectively present and ethically formative for believers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages implicitly and explicitly with: the **Chalcedonian Definition** (451), patristic Christology, Reformation emphases on person and work of Christ, contemporary German philosophy (Kantian critical method), and Romantic emphases on feeling/religious experience.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: **Christology** (person, natures, incarnation, kenosis).
 - Secondary: revelation (as personal/self-disclosing God), atonement and mediation, soteriology (sanctification by Christ's exemplar), and ecclesial proclamation.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Schleiermacher relocates the doctrine of two natures into the living reality of Christ's singular God-consciousness: true Chalcedonian fidelity, for him, is not abstract ontological partitioning but the affirmation that the divine and human coexist without confusion within the personal, revelatory life of Jesus.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Prioritizes **religious consciousness** over metaphysical categories; the hypostatic union is a real personal unity constituted by a distinctive mode of divine-human consciousness.
 - Presents incarnation as **continuous life** (not intermittent accommodations), stressing ethical and representational functions of Christ's humanity.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on scholasticism's substance-language; resists both Nestorian dualism and Monophysite absorption by reframing natures functionally in relation to personhood and consciousness.
 - Distinguishes himself from Hegelian identity theology by preserving a real distinction of natures (avoids reducing divine-human relation to absolute metaphysical identity).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts hypostasis in experiential terms - "person" as locus of religious self-consciousness rather than merely metaphysical substratum.
 - Treats "nature" more as relational mode and capacity (divine capacity to reveal; human capacity to receive and respond) than as static substance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply formative for 19th-century liberal Protestant Christology and pastoral theology; used as a bridge between classical doctrine and modern subjective religiosity.
 - Criticized by conservative theologians for apparent reductionism (objective atonement and metaphysical grounding seemed undermined).
 - Rediscovered by some modern theologians as a resource to read Chalcedon existentially while retaining doctrinal contours.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise model for integrating Chalcedonian boundaries with modern concerns about subjectivity, ethics, and the communicability of divine life; valuable for pastors and theologians reworking Christology for contemporary faith contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - reinterpreted as the unity of divine-human life in the single person grounded in Christ's God-consciousness.
- **Two natures (divine & human)** - affirmed as distinct modes/capacities; not confused or separated, but reconciled in personal consciousness.
- **God-consciousness** - central term: the self-awareness of divine presence in Christ that secures revelation and mediation.
- **Person (Hypostasis)** - located in subjective continuity of life; the primary category for unity over metaphysical substrata.
- **Nature (Natur)** - used relationally: what belongs to divine being vs. human being as capacities expressed within the person.
- **Kenosis** - implied in Schleiermacher's account as ethical self-emptying expressed in perfect receptivity and responsiveness, not as ontological diminution of deity.
- **Revelation** - occurs in the personal self-disclosure of God in Christ's consciousness and life, making doctrine existentially verifiable.
- **Atonement / mediation** - understood via exemplary and representative union: Christ's perfect religious life both reconciles and forms believers.
- **Sinlessness / perfection** - Christ's human nature is perfected through participation in divine consciousness; necessary for mediation.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - treated as doctrinal boundary; Schleiermacher re-translates its technical claims into existential and ethical categories.
- **Subjectivity vs. objectivity** - Schleiermacher emphasizes subjectivity (experience) but aims to safeguard objective claims about person and work.
- **Illocutionary-power of revelation** - Christ's life has formative force for the church's faith and moral formation.
- **Exemplarism** - Christ as normative religious exemplar whose consciousness becomes the pattern for believers' life.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for rearticulating Chalcedon in existential/psychological vocabulary.
 - As a **polemic** against scholastic metaphysics and reductionist readings of incarnation.
 - As an **exegetical/constructive model** for pastoral Christology that links doctrine to worship, ethics, and religious experience.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in modern theology for translating classical categories into terms accessible to contemporary philosophical sensibilities.
