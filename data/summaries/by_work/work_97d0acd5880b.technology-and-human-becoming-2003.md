### TITLE
**Technology and Human Becoming** (2003) - Philip Hefner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early 21st-century theology engaging rapid advances in biotechnology, information technology, and robotics. Situated within the science-and-religion conversation, influenced by American Protestant theological reflection and interdisciplinary bioethics (theology, biology, sociology of technology).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Humans are essentially "created co-creators": their God-given vocation to make and transform world (through culture and technology) is intrinsic to human identity. Theologically adequate anthropology must account for how technology participates in human becoming without collapsing creation into mere artifact.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Humans are a psychosomatic unity whose embodied existence is always mediated by cultural and technological constructs. 
 - Technology is not extrinsic instrumentality but constitutive of human formation (habits, embodiment, self-understanding). 
 - Christian doctrine of creation and imago Dei provides resources to frame technology as a vocation (responsible co-creation) rather than either total triumphalism or fatalistic despair. 
 - Ethical implications follow: responsibility for design, prudence in enhancement, justice in access, and theological hope that frames technological projects within eschatological accountability.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit dialogue with philosophers and theologians concerned with technology (e.g., Martin Heidegger's critique of instrumentality; Hannah Arendt's vita activa), bioethical literature on genetic engineering, and theologians who emphasize vocation and creation. Uses scientific examples (biotech, cybernetics) to test theological claims.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Creation** (ongoing creation through human culture), **Imago Dei** (re-articulated as co-creative vocation), **Anthropology** (psychosomatic unity and formation), ethics (virtue and responsibility), with secondary engagement of eschatology as horizon for moral accountability.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - Technology is theologically intelligible only when human making is read as a God-given vocation of responsible co-creation grounded in the psychosomatic unity of embodied persons and the doctrine of creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - **"Created co-creator"** as a concise theological anthropology: humans are created beings whose calling is creative transformation. 
 - Emphasis on **technology as constitutive** of human formation (not mere tool-use): technologies shape embodiment, identity, and social practices.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against binary positions: rejects both naive technological utopianism and totalizing techno-pessimism (e.g., simplified readings of Heidegger). Argues for a middle theological posture that preserves human responsibility without technophobia.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Frames culture and technics as forms of "continuing creation"-a theological idiom that integrates technical practice into divine providence without eliminating human moral agency.
 - Recasts imago Dei from static status to **vocational competency** (capacity to co-create).
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited in theology-of-technology and science-and-religion studies; used by ethicists and theologians addressing biotech, cybernetics, and human enhancement. Influential in Protestant academic circles for re-framing anthropological debates.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a robust, theologically anchored vocabulary for discussing technology and embodiment; useful for courses on theological anthropology, bioethics, and religion-technology intersectionality.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Created co-creator** - Human identity as created by God and called to creative, transformative work; central anthropological claim.
- **Psychosomatic unity** - Emphasizes integrated body-mind (soul/body) locus of moral and technological formation; technology shapes both dimensions.
- **Continuing creation** - Cultural and technological activity as participation in divine creativity, not autonomous world-making.
- **Technological mediation** - The idea that technologies mediate perception, action, and self-understanding; not neutral instruments.
- **Anthropotechnic** - Descriptor for human-technology entanglement; persons whose capacities and practices are technologized.
- **Imago Dei (vocationally read)** - Imago as capacity and responsibility to co-create; ethical implications for stewardship and design.
- **Responsible co-creation** - Normative stance: technological agency constrained by justice, prudence, and theological accountability.
- **Embodiment and formation** - How technologies become part of bodily habits and moral character (virtue formation via tech).
- **Technological virtues** - Practical virtues adapted to technoscientific contexts (prudence, humility, care, justice).
- **Design ethics** - Theological warrant for assessing technologies at the point of creation and implementation.
- **Mediation of relationships** - Technologies reconfigure social relations and communal identity; theology must address ecclesial and political consequences.
- **Eschatological accountability** - Final horizon that frames technological pursuit within hope and responsibility.
- **Human enhancement** - Treated as theological and ethical problem: permissible as co-creative stewardship only under accountable norms.
- **Technosocial systems** - Complex of technical artifacts, institutions, and practices that co-shape human life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a vocationally grounded theological anthropology in the age of technoscience. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in bioethics and technology ethics curricula to shift debates from tool-neutrality to constitutive mediation. 
- As a **polemic resource** against both techno-utopian and technophobic theological positions, offering a third-way constructive alternative.
