### TITLE
The Soul of Theological Anthropology - Joshua R. Farris

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary theological intervention situated at the intersection of systematic theology, historical theology, and philosophical anthropology.
 - Addresses debates in Reformed and broader Protestant theology about the status of the soul given pressures from naturalism, neuroscience, and anti-reductionist trends in philosophy of mind.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Argues that a robust theological anthropology must recover a theologically disciplined doctrine of the **soul** that preserves biblical personhood, embodied continuity, and Trinitarian relationality while resisting both Cartesian dualism and materialist reductionism.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: surveys modern threats to a theological notion of soul (biological reductionism, eliminative materialism, shallow psychosocial models).
 - Retrieval: reconstructs resources from Scripture, patristic authors, scholastic hylomorphism, and Reformed voices to re-articulate soul-language.
 - Integration: proposes a model that affirms a **psychosomatic unity** structured by soul as the personal center of life and relationship.
 - Application: draws consequences for Christology (union with Christ), soteriology (regeneration and sanctification), eschatology (bodily resurrection), and pastoral ethics (care for embodied persons).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Canonical scriptural exegesis of Genesis, Psalms, Pauline anthropology, and Johannine existential language.
 - Historical interlocutors: patristic (Augustine-type), medieval hylomorphism (Aquinas-type), classic Reformed theologians (Calvinic emphases on will and affections), and contemporary thinkers in analytic philosophy of mind and theology.
 - Contemporary critics from neuroscience, naturalism, and some strands of process and liberation theologies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (imago Dei, personhood, soul/body relation)
 - Trinity (relational ontology as model for human personhood)
 - Christology and Union: how the soul participates in incarnational and soteriological realities
 - Pneumatology (regeneration, sanctifying presence)
 - Eschatology (bodily resurrection, continuity and discontinuity)
 - Ethics and pastoral implications (care of souls, mental health, bioethics)

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers theological anthropology on a recovered, relationally grounded doctrine of the **soul** that secures personal identity, embodied continuity, and the church's pastoral commitments in the face of modern reductionisms.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Presents the soul as a relational, incarnational center rather than an isolated immaterial substance or mere functional property.
 - Stresses Trinitarian relationality as the theological model for human personhood - persons are constituted by relations of love and agency, not by isolated substantialism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Cartesian dualism by rejecting an atomized immaterialism divorced from bodily form and social location.
 - Counters naturalistic reductionism by insisting on irreducible personal capacities (conscience, deliberative will, moral imagination) grounded in created capacities bestowed by God.
 - Revises some Reformed tendencies that over-individualize soteriology by emphasizing communal and ecclesial formation of souls.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Proposes practical terminologies such as **soul-as-center** and **psychosomatic personal nexus** to capture integrated personhood without slavish return to scholastic categories.
 - Articulates a spectrum between **ontological continuity** (personal persistence) and **eschatological transformation** (resurrectional renewal).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Gaining traction in Reformed academic circles for providing a theologically responsible alternative to reductionist anthropologies.
 - Used in interdisciplinary conversations with ethics, pastoral theology, and bioethics; less known outside evangelical/Reformed networks but regarded as a helpful corrective in wider systematic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for reconciling historical doctrine and current scientific-cultural challenges.
 - Useful pedagogically for courses in systematic theology, pastoral care, and Christian ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Soul (psyche/anima)**
 - The personal center of life and relational capacity; neither a ghostly interiority nor a mere function.

- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - The doctrine that personhood is constituted by an integrated soul-body unity.

- **Hylomorphism (retrieved)**
 - Uses the form-matter intuition to explain soul as the form of the body while reinterpreting it in relational and incarnational terms.

- **Imago Dei**
 - Human likeness to God expressed principally in relationality, rationality, and moral responsiveness - the seat and shape of the soul.

- **Personhood**
 - Defined relationally and functionally: possessors of consciousness, moral agency, and social identity grounded in creation.

- **Trinitarian relationality**
 - Theological model for human personhood: persons are constituted by relations mirroring intra-Trinitarian life.

- **Embodiment / embodied eschatology**
 - Emphasizes continuity between earthly embodied life and resurrectional transformation.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Soteriological locus where soul and body are redeemed and reconstituted in personal and communal ways.

- **Sanctification and the soul**
 - Soul as the theatre of renewed affections, habits, and virtues under the Spirit.

- **Sin and the soul**
 - Corruption affects personal center and relational capacities; remedy is both forensic and formative.

- **Psycho-physical continuity**
 - Account of personal identity across death and resurrection that preserves both continuity and divine re-creation.

- **Faculty language (reworked)**
 - Retains talk of capacities (will, reason, affections) but avoids mechanistic schematics.

- **Natural and supernatural capacities**
 - Distinguishes created human powers and their elevation by grace without collapsing one into the other.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for imago Dei and personhood in systematic anthropology.
- As a **polemic** against materialist/reductionist accounts and Cartesianism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical anthropology that links text, tradition, and practical theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for ethics, pastoral care, and bioethical reasoning concerning personhood and mental health.
