### TITLE
**Cornelis P. Venema, Accepted and Renewed in Christ: The "Twofold Grace of God" and the Interpretation of Calvin's Theology**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary Reformed scholarship addressing intramural disputes in Protestant orthodoxy and Calvin studies; a corrective within the Three Forms of Unity / Dutch Reformed interpretive horizon to late 20th-early 21st century readings that bifurcate Calvinian grace.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The common reading that Calvin taught a sharply "twofold grace" (one grace that accepts sinners, another that renews them) mischaracterizes Calvin. Venema contends that Calvin's theology coheres when read through **union with Christ**: divine acceptance and inward renewal are distinct aspects of one saving grace grounded in the believer's union with Christ.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Survey of the "twofold grace" claim as found in contemporary Reformed commentaries and confessional readings. 
 - Close exegesis of Calvin's key texts (Institutes, commentaries, pastoral writings) to trace Calvin's use of "grace," "union," and related soteriological vocabulary. 
 - Theological synthesis arguing that Calvin's language of imputation, indwelling, and participation presupposes a single, complex grace established in union with Christ. 
 - Polemical engagement: demonstration that separating acceptance and renewal into two graces produces theological and pastoral problems (e.g., dualism between forensic and experiential salvation).
 
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, exegetical corpus). 
 - Secondary/interlocutors: interpreters within the Three Forms of Unity tradition and recent Reformed scholars who articulate a "twofold grace" model; broader engagement with Reformed covenantal and union-theology streams.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Union with Christ (hermeneutical center) 
 - Grace (nature, operations) 
 - Justification and sanctification (forensic and transformative dimensions) 
 - Imputation and participation 
 - Covenant theology and Christology (federal union, Christ's person and work)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 For Venema, Calvinian theology is best read as a unity centered on union with Christ: one saving grace manifests as both acceptance and renewal without reducing either to an autonomous or separable divine gift.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Elevates **union with Christ** from one doctrine among many to the primary hermeneutical key for Calvin. 
 - Treats "grace" as a single, multifaceted divine activity rather than two discrete graces.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects readings that treat justification (acceptance) and sanctification (renewal) as isolated operations with distinct graces. 
 - Challenges confessional or pietistic tendencies to create a chronological or ontological gap between being declared righteous and being made righteous.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes the "twofold grace" label as a heuristic problem rather than an accurate theological category; proposes "one complex grace in union" as an alternative interpretive formula.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used among conservative Reformed scholars and seminarians to rethink Calvin in a way that integrates systematic and pastoral concerns. 
 - Influential in debates about covenantal theology, pastoral assurance, and the doctrine of sanctification in Reformed circles.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a compact, textually attentive model for reading Calvin coherently. 
 - Valuable for courses on union with Christ, Reformed soteriology, or Calvin studies, especially where pastoral-theological implications are emphasized.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Twofold grace of God:** label critiqued by Venema; the claim that Calvin taught two separate salvific graces (acceptance and renewal). 
- **Union with Christ:** the central hermeneutical and soteriological category Venema argues Calvin employs to unify justification and sanctification. 
- **Acceptance (forensic justification):** God's declarative reception of sinners in Christ - not treated as an isolated gift but as grounded in union. 
- **Renewal (sanctification):** the Spirit-wrought inward transformation that proceeds from the same union-based grace. 
- **Imputation:** forensic crediting of Christ's righteousness - integrated with participation in Christ rather than standing alone. 
- **Participation/Communion:** the believer's real participation in Christ's life and benefits; a key link between justification and sanctification. 
- **Grace (single complex activity):** Venema's preferred way to speak of God's saving work: one grace with multiple effects. 
- **Forensic vs. transformative categories:** analytic distinction used by Venema to show differences but not separation in Calvin. 
- **Federal union / covenant of grace:** covenantal frameworks that support reading union as federal and relational, not merely juridical. 
- **Calvin's language of "being in Christ":** textual locus Venema prioritizes for explaining how grace operates.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition source** for a unified Reformed account of grace and union with Christ. 
- As a **polemic** against bifurcated readings that isolate justification and sanctification. 
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Calvin's Institutes and sermons with attention to participatory language. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching soteriology and pastoral theology within the Three Forms of Unity and broader Reformed contexts.
