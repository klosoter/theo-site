### TITLE
**Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament** (2007), eds. Gregory K. Beale and D. A. Carson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century resurgence in biblical theology, evangelical scholarship attentive to intertextuality and the unity of Scripture. Engages debates shaped by Dodd, Ellis, Hays, Kaiser, Childs, and Second Temple Jewish interpretation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How and why the NT employs the OT. The editors argue that NT writers use the OT contextually, canonically, and typologically under divine authorial intent, culminating in Christ and the inaugurated new-creation eschaton.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Book-by-book NT commentary focused on every explicit citation and significant allusion.
 - For each instance: identifies form (quotation, allusion, echo), textual source (MT/LXX), OT context, interpretive move (typology, promise-fulfillment, wisdom, apocalyptic), and theological function in the NT passage.
 - Hermeneutical introductions clarify criteria for detecting allusion/echo and for relating divine and human authorship.
 - Syntheses highlight redemptive-historical patterns: new exodus, temple, Adam-Christ, servant, covenant, new creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** LXX and Hebrew Bible as primary sources; Qumran pesher and rabbinic midrash as comparative backdrops; scholarly interlocutors include C. H. Dodd, E. E. Ellis, Richard B. Hays, Walter Kaiser, Brevard Childs, and studies on Second Temple literature and apocalyptic.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Bibliology:** inspiration, canon unity, divine-human authorship, sensus plenior guarded by original context.
 - **Covenant theology:** promise-fulfillment, new covenant, people of God.
 - **Trinity and Christology:** NT application of YHWH texts to Christ and the Spirit.
 - **Anthropology and sin:** Adamic headship, bondage of will, universal sin.
 - **Eschatology:** inaugurated-consummated kingdom, resurrection and new creation, Antichrist/man of lawlessness, new heavens and new earth.
- **Closing line:** The volume commends Christ-centered, canon-conscious exegesis in which OT texts, read in their own horizons, reach their telos in the NT's redemptive-historical fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on reading OT citations in their literary and historical contexts before tracing NT fulfillment.
 - Balanced account of **divine authorial intent** allowing fuller sense without abandoning OT meaning.
 - Clear taxonomy and criteria for quotation, allusion, and echo, with disciplined skepticism toward over-reading.
 - Consistent highlighting of **inaugurated eschatology** and **typological** development.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Pushes back on atomistic proof-texting and on unconstrained reader-response intertextuality.
 - Nuances sensus plenior against both denial of development and unfettered allegory.
 - Distinguishes NT use from Qumran pesher and later midrash, noting both continuities and limits.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Operational criteria for detecting allusions and echoes.
 - Methodological template: OT context - NT context - hermeneutical rationale - theological synthesis.
 - Emphasis on LXX's role in shaping NT diction and argument while weighing MT/Hebrew Vorlage.
- **Reception and influence:** Became a standard evangelical reference; widely used in Reformed circles and beyond for preaching, teaching, and research. Praised for methodological clarity and comprehensiveness; occasionally critiqued for conservative judgments on some putative echoes.
- **Enduring value:** A durable map of canonical interconnections that undergirds doctrinal formulation across loci (eschatology, Trinity, anthropology, sin, covenant) and models exegetical discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Quotation:** Explicit OT citation, often with formulaic markers (it is written); analyzed for text-form and function.
- **Allusion:** Implicit yet intentional OT reference signaled by shared wording, themes, or structure.
- **Echo:** Fainter resonance of an OT text or theme; identified using cumulative criteria and used cautiously.
- **Formula citation:** Introductory phrases that frame OT references and cue interpretive expectations.
- **LXX (Septuagint):** Greek OT that frequently mediates NT wording and sometimes shapes argument.
- **MT/Hebrew Vorlage:** Hebrew textual base; divergences with LXX are weighed for interpretive payoff.
- **Typology:** God-ordained patterns in history (type-antitype) culminating in Christ and the church.
 - Contrasted with allegory as anchored in historical correspondences and escalation.
- **Sensus plenior:** Fuller divine intent consonant with original meaning; disciplined by canonical context.
- **Intertextuality:** Text-to-text relations; here practiced with historical and canonical controls, not free association.
- **Pesher:** Qumran technique applying prophecy to the community; a comparator, not the NT's norm.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** Already-not yet fulfillment structuring NT use of prophetic texts.
- **Federal headship:** Adam and Christ as covenantal representatives; critical in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15.
- **New creation:** Isaianic and prophetic motifs reworked in resurrection, Spirit, and new heavens and earth.
- **YHWH texts applied to Christ:** OT divine prerogatives and names given to Jesus and, by extension, to the Spirit, informing high Christology and triune revelation.

- **How the work is used across loci:**
 - **Eschatology:** Exegetical backbone for inaugurated-consummated readings of kingdom, resurrection, new heavens and earth, Antichrist texts.
 - **Trinity and Christology:** Documentation of NT appropriation of YHWH passages for Jesus and the Spirit.
 - **Anthropology and sin:** Support for Adam's historicity and federal headship, with implications for sin and will.
 - **Bibliology and covenant:** Model for canon unity, divine authorial intent, and promise-fulfillment across covenants.
