### TITLE
**The New Perspective on Paul: Covenantal Nomism and Justification (Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal, 2004)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century debate within Pauline studies and Reformed theology responding to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) as articulated by E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and N. T. Wright.
 - Poythress writes from an evangelical/Reformed vantage, addressing academic and confessional audiences concerned with the doctrine of justification.
- **Central thesis**
 - Poythress contends that while NPP corrects certain caricatures of Second Temple Judaism (notably via Sanders' covenantal nomism), it does not eliminate the theological need for a forensic, imputed righteousness in Paul; covenantal categories and forensic justification must be held together to account for Pauline texts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of NPP claim: Judaism as covenantal nomism (entrance by grace, maintenance by works) and its reinterpretation of "works of the law" as boundary markers.
 - Affirmation that historical revision is valuable: NPP rightly corrects supersessionist and anachronistic portraits of Judaism.
 - Critical moves:
 - Linguistic and exegetical analysis showing Paul uses forensic/declarative language (e.g., dikaioun, dikaioo) in ways that carry a judicial-declarative force.
 - Theological argument that union with Christ, imputation, and forensic declaration perform salvific functions that covenantal membership language alone cannot explain (e.g., forgiveness, double imputation, justification as status).
 - Rebuttal of attempts to reduce justification to socioreligious covenant membership or to read "works of the law" solely as ethnic boundary markers without a soteriological legal import.
 - Synthesis proposal: preserve covenantal categories while retaining the forensic model-Paul's rhetoric is multivalent and includes covenantal and forensic idioms coherently.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engages primarily with E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and N. T. Wright; also interacts with classical Reformation interpreters of justification.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic imputation vs covenantal status), covenant theology (covenantal nomism), soteriology (union with Christ, imputation), Pauline hermeneutics and anthropology.
- **Closing line**
 - Poythress centers the debate on the need to hold forensic imputation and covenantal categories together: NPP's historical corrections are salutary, but they neither supplant nor obviate Paul's forensic doctrine of justification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balanced integration: neither wholesale rejection of NPP nor uncritical defense of old caricatures of Judaism; stresses theological complementarity.
 - Attention to linguistic nuance: emphasizes the judicial force of justification vocabulary alongside covenantal metaphors.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects NPP overcorrection that attempts to eliminate forensic aspects of Paul; contrasts with Wright's strong socioreligious reading by reinstating legal/declarative dimensions central to Reformed soteriology.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Proposes a hermeneutic that treats Pauline texts as functioning within multiple interlocking paradigms (covenant, forensic, mystical union) rather than a single explanatory category.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in conservative Reformed critiques of the NPP as a nuanced corrective-frequently cited in anti-NPP polemics and in syllabi on justification.
 - Influential among theologians seeking to preserve imputation without ignoring NPP's historical insights.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching due to its methodological temperance: models how to accept historical corrections while maintaining doctrinal commitments; strong clarifier for pastors and students on why forensic language remains theologically necessary.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenantal nomism**
 - The socioreligious thesis (Sanders) that Judaism is covenant-maintained by obedience after divine election/grace.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Collective term for Sanders, Dunn, Wright re-evaluation of Second Temple Judaism and Pauline rhetoric.
- **Justification (forensic)**
 - A judicial declaration of righteousness (status-imputation) before God; Poythress insists this remains central in Paul.
- **Imputation**
 - The forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers; defended against purely covenantal or ethical readings.
- **Works of the law**
 - NPP: boundary markers (circumcision, food laws); Poythress: also carries soteriological/legal implications that Paul critiques.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Mystical/ontological ground related to but distinct from forensic declaration; used by Poythress to supplement imputation.
- **Forensic/declarative language**
 - Terms and metaphors indicating courtroom verdicts, acquittal, and legal standing-argued to be indispensable for Pauline soteriology.
- **Covenant membership / boundary markers**
 - Social-communal language for inclusion in God's people; Poythress insists it cannot wholly replace legal declaration.
- **Soteriological function**
 - How justification, imputation, and union effect salvation (forgiveness, adoption, reconciliation); Poythress emphasizes complementary roles.
- **Exegetical multivalence**
 - Principle that Paul employs overlapping idioms (covenant, forensic, union) that require integrated interpretation.
- **Polemic use**
 - This work is often cited to argue against reducing justification to socio-ethnic status.
- **Pastoral-theological use**
 - Used to formulate sermons and catechesis that preserve forensic assurance alongside covenantal belonging.
- **Methodological model**
 - Serves as an exegetical template: accept historical insights from NPP, but test them against theological categories like imputation.
- **Teaching resource**
 - Employed across loci as a concise defense of traditional forensic justification informed by contemporary scholarship.
