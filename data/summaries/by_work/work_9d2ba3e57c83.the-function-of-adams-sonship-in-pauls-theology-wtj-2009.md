### TITLE
The Function of Adam's Sonship in Paul's Theology (Lane Tipton, WTJ 2009)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published in Westminster Theological Journal (2009); situated in conservative/Reformed Pauline studies reacting to recent literary and covenantal readings of Paul.
 - Engages both historical (Augustine, Calvin, Murray) and contemporary Pauline interpreters (e.g., N. T. Wright, Dunn, Hays) amid debates over federal headship and the ontology of Adamic representation.

- **Central thesis**
 - Paul's references to Adam's "sonship" serve a functional role: they mark Adam as the paradigmatic human-origin and representative head whose created relational status (not merely his later sinful act) organizes Paul's contrast between life in Adam and life in Christ. Tipton contends that recognizing Adam's sonship as constitutive of human origin clarifies Paul's anthropology, soteriology, and the theological force of the Adam/Christ parallel.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Pauline texts where Adam-language appears (Rom 5; 1 Cor 15; implicitly Rom 8; Gal 4 motifs) with attention to terminology (tekna, huios, arche/kephale).
 - Distinguishes between *created sonship* (Adam as the original human in relation to God) and *adoptive/eschatological sonship* (the status conferred to believers in Christ).
 - Argues that Paul's use of Adamic sonship functions to:
 - Establish solidarity and representation (corporate identity grounded in origin).
 - Provide a narrative foil for Christ's recapitulation/second Adam work.
 - Preserve the ontological continuity of humanity even in the doctrine of sin and imputation.
 - Considers the counterfactual question "What if Adam had not sinned?" to show how Adam's created sonship would have been the axis of covenantal life and blessing - and how sin disrupts but does not erase that created telos which Christ fulfills.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Calvin, John Murray on federal headship and imputation.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Pauline scholars debating Adam/Christ typology and the meaning of "in Adam/in Christ" (e.g., Wright, Dunn).
 - Scriptural base: Genesis creation texts (creation of Adam), Pauline corpus (Romans 5, 8; 1 Corinthians 15; Galatians 4 implicitly).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (origins, imago Dei), original sin and its imputation, covenant/federal headship, Christology (second Adam/recapitulation), soteriology (union with Christ vs. union with Adam), adoption/sonship language.

- **Closing line**
 - Tipton locates the theological gravity of Paul's Adam/Christ schema in Adam's function as created son and representative origin, a status refracted and fulfilled in Christ's redemptive recapitulation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses *created* sonship (Adam as ontological origin) rather than reducing Adam to merely a legal-transgressive representative; thereby bridging creation theology and soteriology.
 - Uses the counterfactual "What if Adam had not sinned?" as a heuristic to recover the normative role of Adam's sonship in Paul's logic.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back on readings that confine Paul's "in Adam" language solely to forensic/imputational categories; insists on an underlying ontological-relational dimension.
 - Counters interpretations that make adoption language purely an individualistic benefit by emphasizing corporate/representative dynamics.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Clarifies the distinction and relation between *created sonship* and *adoptive/eschatological sonship* in Pauline discourse.
 - Reorients the function of arche/kephale and hupostasis language toward origin/solidarity, not only juridical headship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for rehabilitating a robust federal framework that is sensitive to Pauline nuance.
 - Cited by exegetes and theologians as a corrective to reductionist readings; contributes to ongoing debates about Paul's anthropology and covenantal thinking.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching on Adam/Christ typology, for integrating creation theology with redemption, and for clarifying how Paul's sonship language operates across Pauline loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam's sonship**
 - Adam as the original human's relational status to God; the ontological starting-point for human solidarity.

- **Created sonship vs. adoptive sonship**
 - Created: Adam's status as humanity's origin.
 - Adoptive/eschatological: believers' status conferred in Christ (huiothesia).

- **Federal headship**
 - Representative function; Tipton nuances this with ontological origin rather than only juridical representation.

- **Union with Adam / Union with Christ**
 - Corporate solidarity in Adam explains universal death; union with Christ explains universal life for believers.

- **Imputation**
 - Forensic accounting of Adam's trespass; Tipton argues imputation operates against the background of Adam's representational sonship.

- **Recapitulation / Second Adam**
 - Christ as the recapitulating Head who fulfills the trajectory of Adam's created sonship.

- **Arche / Kephale (head)**
 - Representative origin-language; used to interpret how Paul frames corporate identity.

- **Tekna / Huios (children/sons)**
 - Technical distinctions in Pauline vocabulary for corporate members (tekna) vs. status-bearing sons (huios).

- **What If Adam Had Not Sinned**
 - Counterfactual used to expose the normative telos of Adam's sonship and what Paul presupposes about creation's intended relational order.

- **Original righteousness / imago Dei**
 - Background for created sonship; helps explain the telos Paul recovers in Christ.

- **Solidarity / corporate identity**
 - Central sociological-ontological category for understanding Paul's argument.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies theological categories of created vs. adoptive sonship.
 - Exegetical model: deployed as a reading strategy for Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15, emphasizing origin and solidarity.
 - Polemic/conceptual pivot: used in debates to defend a nuanced federal view against strictly forensic or purely existential readings.
