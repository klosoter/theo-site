### TITLE
Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th - early 21st century analytic evangelical apologetics; first published 1994 with later editions. Craig writes within an Anglo-American analytic-philosophy idiom, addressing both academic and lay audiences in evangelical circles.
 - Engages contemporary science (cosmology), analytic metaphysics, and historical apologetics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity is rationally defensible: core Christian claims (God exists, divine attributes, providence, resurrection, revelation) can be shown to be reasonable and knowable by a cumulative case combining philosophy, science, and historical testimony.
 - Tackles classical apologetic problems: existence and knowability of God; divine foreknowledge and providence vis-a-vis human freedom and the problem of evil; relation of science and Scripture (esp. Genesis 1-11).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: cumulative-case apologetics - multiple independent arguments strengthen rational warrant for theism/Christianity.
 - Major moves:
 - **Cosmological (Kalam) argument** for a cause of the universe (support from Big Bang cosmology) (see Existence And Knowability Of God).
 - **Fine-tuning and teleological arguments** for design.
 - **Moral argument** for objective moral values grounded in God.
 - **Historical argument for the resurrection** as central evidential foundation for Christ's divinity and Christian truth-claims.
 - **Theodicy and providence**: employs Molinist middle knowledge to reconcile divine foreknowledge/providence with libertarian freedom and to respond to the problem of evil (see Divine Foreknowledge Providence And The Problem Of Evil).
 - **Science and Scripture**: argues for compatibility of theism with mainstream cosmology and science; treats Genesis 1-11 primarily as theological narrative, not modern scientific description (see Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophers: Alvin Plantinga (reformed epistemology), Richard Swinburne, J.L. Mackie, David Hume, contemporary cosmologists (Big Bang proponents), critics of Kalam.
 - Theologians and biblical scholars on Genesis debates; interlocutors include both skeptical philosophers and skeptical scientists.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, natural theology, providence, divine foreknowledge, human freedom, problem of evil, creation/ex nihilo, resurrection, epistemology of religious belief.

- **Closing line**
 - A rigorous analytic apologetic that marshals cosmology, philosophy, and historical evidence to defend the reasonableness and knowability of core Christian claims while proposing a Molinist-providential framework for human freedom and evil.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Revival and popularization of the **Kalam cosmological argument** within contemporary apologetics, tied closely to Big Bang cosmology.
 - Systematic defense of **Molinism (middle knowledge)** as the best reconciliation of providence, divine foreknowledge, and libertarian freedom.
 - Strong commitment to a **cumulative-case** methodology rather than reliance on a single decisive proof.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against naturalistic, purely materialist explanations for the origin of the universe and moral order.
 - Distances himself from both strict fideism and simplistic evidentialism - aims for evidential warrant without reducing faith to mere inference.
 - Contrasts with young-earth literalist readings by treating Genesis 1-11 as theological narrative compatible with mainstream cosmology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Strategic use of cosmological physics (actual infinity, past-eternal objections) in philosophical premises.
 - Operationalizing middle knowledge as an explanatory tool in apologetic and theodicy contexts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in evangelical and Reformed-adjacent apologetics; standard textbook in many apologetics courses.
 - Criticized by analytic philosophers over Kalam premises (e.g., impossibility of an actual infinite) and by some theologians for philosophical prioritization over biblical-theological nuance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of disciplined, interdisciplinary apologetics; valuable for instructing students in how to integrate philosophy, science, and historical reasoning for Christian defense and teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kalam cosmological argument**
 - Premise: whatever begins to exist has a cause; universe began to exist; therefore, universe has a cause.
- **Actual infinite / impossibility of an actual infinite**
 - Craig argues against past-eternal temporal series by appeal to paradoxes of actual infinites.
- **Temporal beginning / creation ex nihilo**
 - Scientific (Big Bang) and philosophical support for a beginning and hence a transcendent cause.
- **Fine-tuning**
 - Physical constants tuned for life as evidence of design; used as cumulative support for theism.
- **Molinism / middle knowledge**
 - God's knowledge of counterfactuals of freedom used to explain providential ordering without violating libertarian freedom; central to Craig's solution to foreknowledge/providence tensions.
- **Divine foreknowledge & providence**
 - Treated as compatible with human libertarian freedom via middle knowledge and divine choice of an actual world.
- **Problem of evil**
 - Addressed via free will defenses, Molinist greater-good strategies, and skeptical-theist moves about epistemic limits on human judgment of God's reasons.
- **Resurrection as historical argument**
 - Priority evidential anchor for Christian truth claims; argued on criteria of historical method.
- **Science and Scripture (Genesis 1-11)**
 - Scripture is theological and historical, but not a modern scientific textbook; Craig stresses methodological naturalism in science vs metaphysical naturalism.
- **Cumulative-case methodology**
 - Multiple independent lines of evidence collectively warrant theism/Christianity.
- **Warranted Christian belief**
 - Epistemic concept-Craig aims to show Christian belief can be rationally warranted, not merely fideistic.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and contemporary exemplar for the Kalam cosmological argument in metaphysics and philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic** against naturalism and atheistic responses to cosmology, fine-tuning, and the resurrection.
- As an **exegetical/practical model** for integrating scientific findings (Big Bang) with a non-concordist reading of Genesis 1-11.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching on providence and freedom by deploying Molinism in theodicy and divine foreknowledge debates.
