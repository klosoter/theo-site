### TITLE
Van Til, Calvin, and the Trinity (Westminster Theological Journal 56, 1994) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late-20th-century Reformed theological reflection (1994) responding to intra-confessional disputes over Trinitarian language and apologological method.
 - Engages Cornelius Van Til (presuppositional apologetics) from a confessional-Reformed, historically grounded vantage that appeals frequently to Calvin and patristic/classical categories.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin examines and critiques Van Til's use of what he calls "one-person language," arguing that Van Til's insistence on the unity of God risks improper suppression or reconfiguration of personal distinctions in the Trinity, with problematic consequences for Christology, revelation, and orthodox Trinitarian grammar.
 - He seeks to recover a Calvinian and classical Reformed account that preserves both divine unity and genuine personal distinction.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: isolates Van Til's rhetorical/grammatical practice that tends to speak of God in a strongly unitary (one-person) manner in certain theological contexts.
 - Analytic move: shows how that practice functions in Van Til's apologetic, connected to his emphasis on divine incomprehensibility, antinomy, and the priority of God's oneness in revelation.
 - Corrective move: appeals to Calvin and classical trinitarian categories (ousia/hypostasis; immanent/economic Trinity) to argue for a balanced grammar-one that affirms ontological unity without effacing real personal distinctions.
 - Practical-theological move: ties correct Trinitarian grammar to the integrity of Christology and redemptive-historical revelation (e.g., the Son's distinct relation to the Father in incarnation and redemption).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Cornelius Van Til (his published writings and apologetic practice).
 - Authoritative sources: John Calvin, classical patristic and scholastic formulations (perichoresis, hypostatic distinction), Reformed confessional expectations.
 - Secondary referents: issues in contemporary trinitarian debates (e.g., social trinitarianism, modalism) implicit in the critique.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central): ontology and grammar of personhood and unity.
 - Revelation: how Trinitarian language shapes and is shaped by redemptive revelation.
 - Christology: necessity of distinct personhood for the Son in incarnation and atonement.
 - Apologetics: interplay between presuppositional method and Trinitarian doctrine.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Gaffin urges a Calvin-grounded retrieval: maintain the primacy of divine unity while defending classical personal distinctions as essential to faithful biblical theology, Christology, and apologetic practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focuses on grammatical and linguistic discipline in Trinitarian theology: how talking about God matters for doctrine and practice.
 - Integrates historical-theological exegesis (Calvin) with constructive critique of a modern apologetical figure.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects Van Til where his one-person emphases risk collapsing personal relations; contrasts Van Til's rhetorical moves with Calvin's balanced language that secures both unity and distinction.
 - Distinguishes Gaffin's classical-Reformed retrieval from both modalism (which collapses persons into one mode) and "social" readings that over-individualize the persons.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Not a novel vocabulary but a methodological insistence: disciplined "Trinitarian grammar" as a corrective to apologetical expediency.
 - Emphasizes fidelity to scriptural and Calvinian idiom as theological norm.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted among Reformed scholars wary of conflating apologetics with dogmatic revision.
 - Influential in debates about the proper dogmatic framing for presuppositional apologetics and for re-centering Calvin in contemporary trinitarian retrieval.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful historical-theological critique of a modern theologian from within confessional commitments.
 - Useful corrective resource in teaching doctrine where equilibrium between unity and persons is required for biblical theology and Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One-person language**
 - Van Til's rhetorical tendency to foreground divine unity in a way Gaffin thinks risks minimizing personal distinctions.
- **Trinitarian grammar**
 - The set of linguistic practices and theological categories that govern correct speech about God (Calvinian/classical focus).
- **Hypostasis / Person**
 - Real, personal distinctions within the one divine essence; Gaffin defends classical usage against collapse.
- **Ousia / Essence**
 - Divine unity that must be preserved; distinguished from hypostatic plurality.
- **Immanent vs. Economic Trinity**
 - Distinction maintained: ontological relations among persons (immanent) and God's redemptive actions (economic); Gaffin insists both inform proper speech.
- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling as a safeguard of unity without identity of persons; employed to rebut simplistic reductions.
- **Calvinian retrieval**
 - Use of Calvin's Trinitarian idiom as corrective and exemplar for Reformed theological speech.
- **Apologetic grammar**
 - The way apologetical aims can shape trinitarian language-Gaffin warns against apologetic ends determining dogmatic form.
- **Christological implication**
 - Assertion that proper personhood language is indispensable for the doctrine of the Son in the incarnation and atonement.
- **Modalism / Social Trinitarianism**
 - Implicit contrasts: modalism (error to avoid) and social models (over-emphasis on personhood) as pitfalls.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for disciplined Reformed Trinitarian language and its limits.
- As a polemical corrective against apologetical practices that reshape dogma (esp. critiques of Van Til).
- As an exegetical-model exemplar: appeal to Calvin to ground doctrinal formulations in Scripture and historical usage.
- As a conceptual pivot in courses on Trinity, Christology, and Reformed apologetics to discuss interplay of dogmatics and methodology.
