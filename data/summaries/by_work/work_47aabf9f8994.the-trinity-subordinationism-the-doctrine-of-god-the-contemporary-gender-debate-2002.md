### TITLE
The Trinity & Subordinationism: The Doctrine of God & the Contemporary Gender Debate (Kevin Giles, 2002)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 2000s evangelical debates over gender roles; rise of the Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) thesis as a theological grounding for male headship.
 - Giles writes from within evangelicalism but critiques a growing trend among some complementarians (notably Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware) to locate male headship in an eternal intra‑Trinitarian order.
 - Engages patristic, medieval, Reformation, and contemporary sources to assess continuity with classical orthodox Trinitarianism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Giles argues that **Eternal Functional Subordination (the Son eternally submits to the Father in authority/role)** undermines the classical doctrine of the Trinity. He contends submission in Scripture is **economic/creational/incarnational**, not an ontological or eternal property of the Son.
 - The question: can intra‑Trinitarian relational ordering of "authority" and "submission" be posited without compromising divine unity, immutability, and consubstantial equality?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical‑theological survey: patristic consensus denies eternal subordination as an attribute of the Son; classical theology distinguishes *ousia* (essence) and *hypostasis* (persons) but preserves equality of being.
 - Biblical exegesis: analyzes key texts (Phil 2; John 5-6, 14; 1 Cor 15; passages using hypotasso) to show NT motifs of submission are tied to the economy (incarnation, mission) and not statements about intra‑divine ontological inferiority.
 - Theological analysis: appeals to Nicene logic-relations of origin (begetting/spirating) are relational properties without implying inequality; EFS reads authority/submission into relations and thereby makes a relative inequality constitutive of the Godhead.
 - Practical implications: shows how EFS is used to justify gender hierarchies and argues this move weakens Trinitarian orthodoxy and leads to problematic theological consequences.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primary contemporary interlocutors: Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware (EFS proponents).
 - Historical sources: Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, later orthodox formulations (Nicene, Chalcedonian logic).
 - Uses scriptural exegesis and patristic testimony to test contemporary proposals.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs economic distinction), revelation, Christology (incarnation, humiliation/exaltation), theology of personhood (hypostasis), ecclesiology and gender ethics as applied consequences.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Giles: to preserve Nicene orthodoxy and a truly Christian doctrine of persons, **the Son's submission belongs to the economy (mission/incarnation)**; it must not be recast as an eternal ontological subordination used to ground contemporary gender hierarchies.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong reclamation of patristic and Nicene categories to rebut a contemporary innovation; emphasis on historical continuity as a theological norm.
 - Careful distinction between relations of origin (begetting/spirating) and relational authority/status.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to Grudem/Ware: asserts their appeal to eternal authority/submission misconstrues patristic evidence and collapses ontological distinctions into functional hierarchies.
 - Contrasts an EFS grounding of gender roles with a complementarianism that seeks other grounds (e.g., created order, incarnational role in Christ).

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reasserts the importance of "economic" vs "immanent" Trinity language and presses against reifying economic roles into eternal properties.
 - Clarifies usage of "subordination" (incarnational/functional vs ontological/eternal).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant stimulus in evangelical Trinitarian debates; cited by egalitarians and by some complementarians who reject EFS.
 - Provoked sustained responses and rejoinders from EFS proponents; contributed to renewed patristic study in gender‑Trinity discussions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a historically informed, theologically conservative yet critical approach: useful for teaching Trinitarian theology, evaluating doctrinal novelties, and tracing ethical applications of Trinitarian claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - thesis that Son eternally submits to Father in role/authority; Giles argues this entails ontological inequality and is theologically illegitimate.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history (mission, incarnation); for Giles, the proper locus of the Son's submission.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inner life/relations; should not be described by authority/submission as eternal properties.
- **Ontological equality** - consubstantial equality (same ousia); cornerstone of Giles's critique.
- **Relations of origin** - begetting (Father→Son), spirating (Father→Spirit); legitimate intra‑divine relations that do not imply inequality.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling; Giles uses this to resist hierarchical models that fracture unity.
- **Hypostasis / Ousia distinction** - classical categories Giles redeploys to argue persons are distinct without inequality in being.
- **Submission (hypotasso)** - NT term often functional/voluntary; Giles: primarily economic/missional usage.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - classical doctrine emphasizing Father as source; Giles allows monarchy of origin but denies monarchy as authority‑subordination axis.
- **Functional subordination (incarnational)** - Son's submission in the incarnation/mission; legitimate and temporal, not eternal.
- **Nicene orthodoxy** - standard against which Giles tests modern proposals.
- **Complementarianism / Egalitarianism** - social/ethical loci affected by Trinitarian claims; Giles warns against grounding complementarianism on EFS.
- **Authority vs. role** - Giles stresses a difference: role differentiation need not imply ontological authority disparities.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and negative source** for critiques of EFS and any intra‑Trinitarian grounding of gender hierarchies.
- As a **polemic** in debates over complementarianism, often cited to show theological costs of EFS.
- As an **exegetical‑historical model** for reading patristic texts and NT submissions language with doctrinal restraint.
- As a **conceptual pivot** encouraging scholars to root gendered role distinctions outside of eternal intra‑divine authority structures.
