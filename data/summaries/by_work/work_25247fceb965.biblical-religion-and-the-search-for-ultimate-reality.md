### TITLE
Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century (1950s), postwar Protestant theology; Tillich operating within continental existentialist and systematic traditions, addressing modern secular culture, science, and philosophical critiques of religion.
 - Positioned between liberal accommodation, dialectical/neo‑orthodox reaction, and rising fundamentalist defenses of bibliology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Biblical religion must be read as the symbolic, existential encounter with the "ultimate" - not as a primitive natural theology nor as a set of literal propositions. The theological task is to correlate the existential questions of contemporary man with the biblical symbols that disclose ultimate reality (the "Ground of Being").

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Religion is rooted in an "ultimate concern" - faith is the state oriented toward what ultimates reality is.
 - God is spoken of not as a supreme being among beings but as the "Ground of Being" - an ontological and existential category that reorients metaphysics and reveals.
 - Biblical language is primarily symbolic; symbols participate in and point to the ultimate, and must be interpreted dynamically, not read as literal scientific or metaphysical descriptions.
 - Revelation is an event/presence - Scripture is a carrier of witness and symbol, not an infallible self‑attesting propositional system.
 - Method of correlation: engage contemporary philosophical and scientific questions, then bring biblical symbols into dialogue to disclose meaning.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages existentialist philosophy (Heidegger, Kierkegaard), Bultmann (demythologizing), Karl Barth (dialectical theology), Schleiermacher and modern liberalism, as well as scientific critiques (modern natural science and historical criticism).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (bibliology), theology proper (God as Ground of Being), Christology (Jesus as decisive symbol of presence), anthropology (ultimate concern and estrangement), eschatology (ultimate fulfillment as existential hope), and indirect interaction with covenantal language (as symbolic relational form).

- **Closing line**
 - Tillich reframes Christian doctrine: biblical religion is the symbolic, existential meeting with ultimate reality (the Ground of Being), requiring a hermeneutic that correlates contemporary existential questions with the transforming power of biblical symbols.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **"Ground of Being"** as the central ontological category replaces classical theism's substantive predicates.
 - **Ultimate concern** reframes faith as existential orientation rather than mere assent to propositions.
 - Strong insistence on **symbolic rather than propositional** character of biblical language.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Moves beyond Schleiermacher's emphasis on religious feeling and Barth's absolutist revelation by insisting on the ontological character of God and the mediating role of symbols.
 - Opposes literalist/inerrantist readings; critiques both conservative bibliology and reductive liberalism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of "ultimate" and "ultimate reality" as theological categories; method of correlation institutionalized for engaging culture.
 - Reinterpretation of revelation as event/presence instead of static propositional content.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in mainline Protestant seminaries and liberal/neo‑orthodox circles; foundational for many later theological attempts to correlate faith and modern culture.
 - Sharply criticized by conservative and Reformed theologians for undermining scriptural inerrancy and objective covenantal formulations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating modern philosophy and science with Christian theology.
 - Offers hermeneutical tools for reading Genesis 1-11, covenant language, and Christology symbolically while preserving existential import.
 - Continues to serve as a corrective to both naive literalism and disenchanting secular reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ultimate Reality / Ultimate Concern**
 - Faith oriented toward that which ultimatively grounds existence; replaces simple theistic predication.

- **Ground of Being**
 - Central ontological term for God; not a highest being but the condition for being itself.

- **Method of Correlation**
 - Theological procedure: relate existential questions of the age to biblical symbols that answer them.

- **Symbolic Language**
 - Language of the Bible functions sacramentally: participates in and points to the ultimate; must be dynamically interpreted.

- **Revelation as Event / Presence**
 - Revelation is experiential/presentational, not reducible to propositional infallibility.

- **Biblical Religion**
 - The way the Bible mediates ultimate concern; a mode of being-with-God through symbolic witness.

- **Demythologizing (symbolic)**
 - Related to Bultmann but Tillich emphasizes reinterpretation of myth as existential symbol rather than elimination.

- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture's authority is witness-bearing and existentially persuasive rather than self-attesting propositional inerrancy.

- **Christ as Symbol / Ontological Presence**
 - Jesus is the decisive symbol in which the Ground of Being becomes present; supports a substantive but non‑literal Christology.

- **Science and Scripture / Genesis 1-11**
 - Genesis narratives treated as symbolic responses to ultimate human questions, not scientific histories; useful for constructive dialogue with modern science.

- **Covenant (symbolic framing)**
 - Covenantal language is construed as relational symbol disclosing ultimate divine‑human orientation rather than merely juridical federal transactions.

- **Existential Interpretation**
 - Focus on human estrangement, anxiety, and hope as lenses for reading biblical material.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **hermeneutical model** for reading Genesis and covenantal texts symbolically rather than literally.
- As a **polemic** against inerrancy, dispensational literalism, and propositionalist bibliology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses for integrating philosophy, science, and biblical witness (revelation, Christology, anthropology).
- As a **definition source** for "ultimate concern" and "Ground of Being" in discussions of theology and modernity.
