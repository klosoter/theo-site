### TITLE
The Knowledge of God - G. C. Berkouwer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu (Dutch Gereformeerde tradition). Reaction to neo-orthodoxy (Barth), existentialist hermeneutics (Bultmann), and modern skepticism about natural theology.
 - Part of Berkouwer's larger dogmatic project to ground Reformed doctrine in Scripture while engaging contemporary philosophical-theological currents.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How God is truly known by creatures: the nature, limits, and content of divine knowledge as given in revelation and received in faith, without collapsing God into human categories or removing real personal relation.
 - Balances God's transcendence and hiddenness with Christocentric revelation and covenantal disclosure.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Natural knowledge of God is inadequate because of sin and finitude; modern attempts at natural theology and anthropological projection fail.
 - Positive proposal: Knowledge of God is primarily revelatory - God discloses himself in history, supremely in Christ; faith recognizes and articulates that disclosure.
 - Systematic treatment of divine attributes and analogical language: distinguishes absolute (God-in-himself) and relative (God-in-relation-to-creatures) aspects while resisting both pantheism and deistic detachment.
 - Pastoral-theological implications: knowledge of God is existential and covenantal, shaping worship, prayer, and ethics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Karl Barth (emphasis on revelation), Emil Brunner (natural theology tension), Bultmann (hermeneutics), classical scholastics (Aquinas), Reformers (Calvin), and modern philosophers of religion.
 - Dialogue with contemporary movements such as existential theology and early articulations of what later became "open theism."

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and knowledge (epistemology of faith), Scripture as witness, Christology (revelatory center), Trinity (relations as ground of relational knowing), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), providence and human freedom.

- **Closing line**
 - Berkouwer locates true knowledge of God in God's self-communication in Christ received by faith, preserving divine transcendence while ensuring personal, covenantal encounter.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that divine knowledge is essentially revelatory and covenantal rather than speculative, making soteriological knowing primary.
 - Nuanced use of the **absolute vs relative attributes** distinction: absolute attributes refer to God's being in himself; relative attributes denote God's mode of being in relation to creation - both must be preserved without reduction.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Barthian overreaction to natural theology by allowing guarded analogical speaking of God grounded in Scripture.
 - Opposes reductionist modern accounts (including certain strains of open theism) that portray God's knowledge as temporally changing; yet he also contests rigid classical formulations that make God impassible and immutable abstractions to the point of denying genuine relationality.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Reframes divine attributes so that **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility** are understood in relation to God's communicative and covenantal action - i.e., these attributes do not negate genuine responsiveness or condescension.
 - Emphasizes the epistemic role of faith: knowledge of God is not merely propositional cognition but trustful appropriation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in postwar Reformed theology for bridging confessionalism and contemporary thought.
 - Used as a corrective in debates over divine immutability and relationality; read by those resisting both classical Thomism and radical process/open theist alternatives.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced hermeneutic for talking about God's attributes without depersonalizing God or capitulating to modernity; valuable for teaching doctrine, pastoral theology, and debates on divine knowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (self-disclosure)**
 - Primary source of divine knowledge; Christ as the decisive revelation.

- **Faith-as-knowledge**
 - Knowledge that is trustful, ecclesial, and existential, not merely intellectual assent.

- **Analogy of being**
 - Guarded use: human language analogical, not univocal or equivocal.

- **Absolute attributes**
 - The properties of God in himself (e.g., simplicity, aseity); bear on God's intrinsic being.

- **Relative attributes**
 - Properties ascribed to God in relation to creatures (e.g., mercy, covenant-faithfulness); important for theological speech about God's action.

- **Simplicity**
 - Affirmed, but interpreted so it does not nullify God's personal relations; avoids overly metaphysical abstraction.

- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence; underlines divine independence while allowing for condescending self-communication.

- **Immutability**
 - Preserved as faithfulness and reliability; reinterpreted to allow real historical engagement without ontological change.

- **Impassibility**
 - Treated delicately: Berkouwer resists crude denial of God's feeling or responsiveness while guarding God from creaturely passions that imply defect.

- **Divine condescension**
 - Central: condescension is how infinite God enters human history authentically (linked to Christology); tempers debates with open theism by insisting condescension does not imply ontological mutability.

- **Open Theism (critique)**
 - Implicitly critiques any portrayal that collapses divine knowledge into temporal flux; affirms God's responsive relation but maintains divine foreknowledge and faithfulness.

- **Christocentric knowledge**
 - All true knowledge of God is mediated through the incarnate Word.

- **Providence and freedom**
 - God's sovereign governance compatible with genuine creaturely responsibility within the covenantal framework.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a careful, scripturally grounded distinction between absolute and relative attributes.
- As a **polemic resource** against simplistic forms of open theism and against depersonalizing classical theism.
- As an **exegetical-model** and conceptual pivot for teaching how divine simplicity/aseity/immutability/impassibility relate to biblical accounts of God's condescension and relational action.
