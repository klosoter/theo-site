### TITLE
Westminster and the Gospel (WTJ article) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - WTJ piece written amid late 20th / early 21st century Reformed controversies over the Federal Vision and monocovenantal emphases. Engages a post-Reformation, confessional (Westminster) milieu determined to defend classical Protestant soteriology against perceived covenantal revisionism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The Westminster understanding of the gospel is essentially forensic and declarative: justification is an objective, imputed acquittal grounded in Christ's obedience. This must be upheld against Federal Vision tendencies that reconceive the gospel as primarily covenantal participation or covenantal status achieved through sacraments and visible membership.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Historical-theological reading of the Westminster Standards to show their sustained commitment to forensic justification and imputation. 
 - Theological exegesis linking Christ's active and passive obedience, union with Christ, and the once-for-all declarative act of God in justification. 
 - Critical contrast with monocovenantal/Federal Vision claims that collapse forensic declaration into covenantal participation or that relativize imputation. 
 - Pastoral implications concerning assurance, sacraments, and the preaching of the gospel as proclamation rather than covenantal administration primarily.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: Westminster Confession and Catechisms, texts of the Puritans and Westminster divines. 
 - Theologian interlocutors: proponents associated with Federal Vision/monocovenantalism (broadly named) and contemporary Reformed defenders of the classical doctrine of justification. Scripture and Reformed systematic loci are used throughout.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Justification (forensic nature, imputation), union with Christ, covenant theology (covenant of works / covenant of grace distinctions and continuity), Christology (active/passive obedience), sacraments (signs and seals vs. means that confer covenantal status), assurance, sanctification (distinguished from justification).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** 
 - Gaffin insists that Westminster's gospel is the declarative, objective acquittal of sinners through Christ's obedient righteousness imputed to them - a doctrine that must not be absorbed into a primarily monocovenantal, participatory account of covenant life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Reasserts **forensic declaration** as the heart of the gospel while simultaneously retaining a robust doctrine of **union with Christ** - showing they are complementary, not competing, categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects Federal Vision monocovenantal tendencies by preserving the distinction between **covenantal membership/participation** and **justificatory status**; warns against reducing justification to visible covenantal signs or performance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Re-articulates classical terms (e.g., imputation) in conversation with covenantal language so that covenant continuity does not eclipse forensic assurance; emphasizes proclamation as the locus of gospel effectuation.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed responses to the Federal Vision controversies; used by pastors, seminary professors, and confessional committees defending Westminster orthodoxy. Strengthened emphasis on preaching forensic gospel in confessional Reformed circles.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models how to hold covenant theology and forensic justification together; serves as a clarifying corrective against theological moves that collapse justification into sacramental or covenantal incorporation. Valuable for homiletics, confessional instruction, and polemical boundaries.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification (forensic):** God's declarative acquittal of sinners on the basis of Christ's obedience imputed to them; not identical to covenantal standing or sanctification. 
- **Imputation:** The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; central to Westminster and defended against "impartation-only" readings. 
- **Union with Christ:** Real, organic union that grounds sanctification and benefits, but does not replace the forensic act of justification. 
- **Covenant (of grace):** Maintained as the historical and theological framework for redemption, but distinguished from the immediate ground of forensic justification. 
- **Monocovenantalism / Federal Vision:** The debated position that emphasizes a single covenantal framework and tends to make covenantal participation the decisive gospel category - the principal target of Gaffin's critique. 
- **Active and passive obedience of Christ:** Christ's fulfilled law-keeping (active) and atoning suffering (passive) together constitute the righteousness imputed in justification. 
- **Sacraments (signs and seals):** Means of grace that confirm and seal the promise but do not automatically confer justificatory status; caution against reading them as ontological conferrers of covenant righteousness. 
- **Objective reality (of redemption):** The view that gospel benefits are accomplished in Christ objectively and declared in justification, not merely constituted by ecclesial or covenantal participation. 
- **Assurance:** Grounded in objective acquittal and union with Christ mediated in preaching and sacraments, but not identical to visible covenantal marks. 
- **Proclamation (preaching) of the gospel:** The primary instrument by which the forensic gospel is declared and applied. 
- **Sanctification:** Progressive, covenantal life in union with Christ - to be distinguished from the one-time forensic act of acquittal.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulations of justification and imputation. 
- As a **polemic** against Federal Vision/monocovenantal reinterpretations of covenant and sacrament. 
- As an **exegetical-model** tying Westminster confessional texts to Scripture on justification and union with Christ. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching how covenant theology and forensic declaration coherently relate in Reformed orthodoxy.
