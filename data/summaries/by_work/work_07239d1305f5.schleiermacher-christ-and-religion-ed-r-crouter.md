### TITLE
Schleiermacher: Christ and Religion (ed. R. Crouter)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestantism (Romanticism and post-Enlightenment theology). Schleiermacher writes against both rationalist reduction of Christianity and orthodox scholasticism seeking to defend faith by propositional proofs.
 - Situated among debates with Kantian critical philosophy, German Idealism (Fichte, Hegel), and emerging historical-critical biblical scholarship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity is to be reinterpreted as a religion of **religious feeling (the "feeling of absolute dependence")** rather than primarily a system of metaphysical propositions. Christ's significance lies in his embodiment and perfecting of religious self-consciousness; redemption is restoration of that consciousness in the believer and community.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Religion is an immediate, affective consciousness oriented toward the infinite (God); doctrines and institutions are secondary expressions.
 - The figure of Christ is the paradigmatic, historical manifestation of perfected God-consciousness:
 - Jesus as one in whom the relation to God attains full self-awareness.
 - Christ as the **mediator** who discloses religious consciousness to others, enabling communal piety.
 - Redemption is not primarily juridical (penal substitution) but **transformative**: healing the alienation that obstructs genuine God-consciousness.
 - The church and Christian culture are the outworking of that restored consciousness in communal, ethical, liturgical life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophical interlocutors: Kant (critical reason), Fichte & Hegel (self-consciousness, Spirit), German Romantic thought on feeling and aesthetics.
 - Theological interlocutors: orthodox confessional theologians (on Christ's metaphysical status and atonement), Enlightenment rationalists (who reduced religion to morality or superstition).
 - Engages biblical texts but reads them through a philosophically critical and psychological lens.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation: as self-disclosure realized in religious consciousness rather than propositional communication.
 - Christology: Christ as exemplar and perfect God-consciousness; historical Jesus vs. the Christian Christ.
 - Atonement/redemption: ethical and existential restoration of religious feeling.
 - Ecclesiology: church as community where restored God-consciousness is formed and sustained.
 - Soteriology, anthropology, and epistemology integrated via the concept of religious feeling.

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's theological center of gravity: Christianity is the communal cultivation and transmission of perfected God-consciousness embodied supremely in Christ, with doctrine and sacraments serving that lived, affective self-understanding.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **feeling (Gefuhl)** as the core category of religion; places Christ's value in his perfect God-consciousness rather than metaphysical divinity or juridical work.
 - Moves theology toward **psychological and existential description** of faith communities rather than legal or purely doctrinal models.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Correction to Enlightenment reductionism: restores depth and transcendence to religion without reinstating dogmatic apologetics.
 - Challenge to orthodox scholasticism: opposes treating Christology chiefly as metaphysical proof; reframes doctrine as expressive of a lived relation to God.
 - Anticipates and is later critiqued by Barth: Barth rejects Schleiermacher's subjectivism and argues for revelation as divine Word independent of human feeling.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence" as foundational theological datum.
 - Distinction between the "historical Jesus" (particular human life) and the "Christ of faith" (religious revelation embodied).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for modern liberal Protestant theology, hermeneutical approaches that center experience, and theological aesthetics.
 - Provoked sharp reactions from conservative and neo-orthodox camps (notably Barth), leading to productive debates about the locus of revelation and authority.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust framework for correlating religious experience with doctrinal expression; useful for pastoral theology, liturgical studies, and constructive theology attentive to culture.
 - Serves as a corrective to overly propositional or juridical accounts of salvation by recovering the psychological and communal dimensions of faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence**
 - Primary datum of religion; consciousness of utter reliance on the infinite.
- **God-consciousness**
 - The form of self-awareness oriented to God; theological focal point for Christology and soteriology.
- **Religion as immediate consciousness**
 - Religion is primarily non-propositional, immediate relation rather than intellectual assent.
- **Christ as perfect God-consciousness**
 - Christology framed in existential/experiential terms: Jesus exemplifies perfected relation to God.
- **Historic Jesus vs. Christ of faith**
 - Methodological distinction: historical biography vs. theological significance/manifestation.
- **Redemption as restoration**
 - Soteriology emphasizing healing of estrangement and recovery of authentic piety.
- **Revelation as disclosure**
 - Revelation conceived as the disclosure of the religious (not primarily propositional revelation).
- **Mediator**
 - Christ functions as the reconciler and exemplar by which religious consciousness is transmitted to others.
- **Church as formative community**
 - Ecclesiology stresses communal cultivation of God-consciousness through worship, sacraments, and discipline.
- **Doctrine as expression**
 - Doctrines are second-order articulations of lived religious consciousness, not its foundation.
- **Culture and religion**
 - Culture is the milieu in which God-consciousness develops; Christianity transforms culture by shaping collective religious self-understanding.
- **Subjectivism (critique)**
 - Common criticism: reduces revelation to subjective feeling, prompting neo-orthodox corrective.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for religion-centered theology (what counts as "religion" and primary theological method).
 - As a **polemic** target or foil in debates over revelation, authority, and objectivity (notably in Barthian responses).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Christ's significance as experiential and communal rather than merely propositional.
