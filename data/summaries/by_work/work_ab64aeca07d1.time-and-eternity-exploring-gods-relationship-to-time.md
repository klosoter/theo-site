### TITLE
Time and Eternity: Exploring God's Relationship to Time - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th / early 21st century analytic-theology milieu; addresses a resurgence of interest in classical theism among evangelicals and analytic philosophers of religion. Positions Craig as a leading Anglo‑American apologist defending classical doctrines with analytic tools.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** defends the *classical* doctrine of divine timelessness (God exists outside of temporal succession) and argues this is compatible with creation, omniscience, providence, and biblical language about God acting in time.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of the classical (Boethian/Aquinian) notion of eternity as atemporality and divine immutability.
 - Critical evaluation of temporalist alternatives (process theology, open theism, theistic temporalism) and of objections that timelessness makes God inert, ignorant of temporal truths, or incompatible with creation.
 - Philosophical defenses showing how a timeless God can causally ground a temporal series (God timelessly sustaining a temporal sequence or timelessly causing temporal effects).
 - Treatment of divine knowledge: explicates how God can know temporal truths without undergoing temporal change (timeless knowledge of tenseless truths, relations to temporal propositions).
 - Exegetical engagement with biblical texts (including Days of Creation), arguing that biblical affirmation of God acting in time does not entail God is in time.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** classical sources (Boethius, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas); modern analytic and pastoral interlocutors including proponents of process thought and temporalist positions (e.g., Charles Hartshorne, William Hasker, proponents of open theism), and various analytic philosophers of religion (Plantinga, Swinburne appear in the conversation broadly).
- **Doctrines treated:** doctrine of God (omnipresence, immutability, simplicity, eternity), creation (ex nihilo, ordering of temporal sequence), providence, omniscience, and implications for biblical interpretation (notably Genesis' Days of Creation).
- **Closing line:** Craig locates the theological center of gravity in classical theism: God is properly understood as atemporal and immutable, yet fully able to create, know, and act in a temporally ordered world without Himself being subject to temporal becoming.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Clear, analytic articulation of Boethian timelessness tailored for contemporary debates among evangelicals and analytic philosophers.
 - Emphasizes a *two-level* conceptual move: God's mode of being (atemporal) vs. God's relations to temporal creatures (causal and knowledgably related).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals:**
 - Rejects process and open‑theist claims that temporal change is required for genuine divine relation, arguing such views sacrifice classical attributes (immutability, aseity).
 - Counters simple appeals to biblical temporality by distinguishing anthropomorphic scriptural language from metaphysical claims about divine mode of being.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of analytic distinctions (tensed vs. tenseless truths; causation from outside time) to rehabilitate classical theism for contemporary philosophical theology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Has become a central modern defense of divine timelessness; widely cited in analytic theology and among conservative/Reformed circles that uphold classical attributes.
 - Provoked sustained debate from temporalists and open‑theists; spurred further literature refining arguments for how a timeless God relates to temporal reality.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models rigorous cross‑disciplinary engagement (biblical exegesis, metaphysics, analytic argumentation); indispensable for students examining the doctrine of God and the theological implications of Genesis' Days of Creation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Timelessness / Atemporality:** God's mode of existence outside temporal succession; central thesis.
- **Boethian eternity:** Classical formula of "all time as an eternal present" that Craig adopts and clarifies.
- **Divine immutability:** God's non‑changeable nature; tied to atemporality and defended against charges of divine passivity.
- **Temporalism (theistic temporalism):** View that God exists in time; treated as primary rival and critiqued.
- **Process theology / Open theism:** Alternative models emphasizing divine change and temporal responsiveness; subject of Craig's critique.
- **Tensed vs. tenseless truths:** Analytic distinction used to explain how God can know temporal facts without temporal becoming.
- **Causation from outside time:** Conceptual device for explaining how a timeless agent can bring about a temporal sequence.
- **Omniscience of temporal truths:** How God knows truths about temporal occurrences while being atemporal.
- **Creation ex nihilo and temporal series:** How a timeless Creator can be the ground of a created sequence (relevant to Genesis' Days).
- **Anthropomorphic biblical language:** Craig's exegetical move distinguishing metaphorical/telic biblical description from metaphysical claims.
- **Divine simplicity & aseity:** Classical attributes preserved in Craig's account, often invoked in his argumentation.
- **Providence and human freedom:** Secondary topics where timelessness is tested against divine governance and contingent creaturely action.
- **Interpretation of Days of Creation:** Craig treats the Days as temporally ordered events that are compatible with a timeless Creator by way of causal ordering.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional and philosophical resource for the classical doctrine of divine eternity.
 - As a polemical text against process theology, open theism, and some contemporary temporalist readings of God.
 - As an exegetical/conceptual model for harmonizing Genesis' Days of Creation with classical attributes of God.
