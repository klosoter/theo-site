### TITLE
**The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It** - Peter Enns (2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st-century evangelical milieu post-inerrancy controversies (late 20th-early 21st c.).
 - Responds to a culture of defensive apologetics shaped by modernist challenges and the inerrancy movement; interacts with both conservative evangelical and academic biblical studies conversations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelical attempts to defend Scripture by answering modern demands for propositional, scientific, and historical certainty have distorted Christian reading of the Bible and impoverished theological imagination.
 - This defensive posture makes readers unable to hear the Bible on its own ancient-cultural and literary terms.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary evangelical reading habits prioritize apologetic proof over attentive exegesis.
 - Hermeneutical claim: Scripture should be read as an ancient library of diverse genres produced in particular cultures; modern questions should not be imposed as the primary grid.
 - Practical correction: recover historical-cultural sensitivity, genre awareness, canonical reading, and a theology of Scripture that embraces both divine authority and human contingency.
 - Application: reframe debates like the historicity of Adam and original sin so theology is not hostage to modern scientific paradigms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Critiques general trends associated with inerrancy proponents (disciplinary heirs of 19th-20th-century deferential biblical defense).
 - Dialogues implicitly with biblical critics, historical-critical scholarship, and conservative evangelical apologists; draws on ANE studies, canonical critics, and earlier Enns works (e.g., Inspiration and Incarnation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, inspiration, inerrancy as hermeneutical posture).
 - Creation, Adam, original sin - especially how historicity claims function in doctrine.
 - Ecclesial reading practices and theological method.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Enns urges a theological humility that honors Scripture's ancient situatedness and theological aims, resisting modern apologetic demands that reduce the Bible to a forensic proof-text.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Focus on the *reading posture* rather than only on propositional doctrines of inspiration; the problem is hermeneutical practice, not merely formulations of inerrancy.
 - Emphasizes the cost of apologetic success: a church literate in defense but illiterate in the Bible.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against inerrancy-driven approaches that force biblical texts into modern scientific/historical categories.
 - Contrasts with both naive literalism and dismissive liberal skepticism by advocating sustained engagement with ancient genres and contexts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "defense of Scripture" as sometimes counterproductive, advocating for an incarnational analogy (in Enns's wider corpus) whereby Scripture's human form is theologically significant.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked strong responses in conservative evangelical circles; became a touchstone in debates over Adam, evolution, and biblical authority.
 - Widely cited in evangelical academic and pastoral conversations as catalyzing reexamination of hermeneutics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a corrective for pastors and teachers to prioritize genre, context, and canonical theology over apologetic proof-texting.
 - Useful as a pedagogical tool to open conversations on Adam, creation, and how doctrine interfaces with science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy** - Enns critiques the posture that makes inerrancy the first litmus test for faithful reading rather than a theological formulation to be interpreted.
- **Defensive apologetics** - Evangelical strategies aimed at protecting Scripture from modern critique; Enns argues these strategies often reshape exegesis.
- **Hermeneutical posture** - The reader's stance or set of expectations; central to Enns's claim that posture shapes what Scripture is perceived to say.
- **Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context** - Insistence that Genesis and other texts be read in light of their ANE milieu, genres, and literary conventions.
- **Genre sensitivity** - Attention to different biblical literary forms (poetry, saga, law, prophecy) as determinative for reading and theological inference.
- **Historicity (of Adam)** - Enns treats the historicity question as entangled with modern scientific categories and urges restraint in making dogma depend on a specific modern historiography.
 - Relation to federal headship: Enns suggests theological affirmations about Adam's representative role can be maintained while rethinking how Genesis functions historically and literarily.
- **Authorial/human contingency** - Emphasizes Scripture's human authorship and cultural situatedness as theologically significant, not merely problems to be eliminated.
- **Canonical reading** - Reading individual books within the shape and purposes of the whole canon as corrective to piecemeal apologetics.
- **Incarnation analogy (background concept)** - Viewing Scripture analogically to the incarnation: divine message delivered in specific human forms.
- **Confessional humility** - Advocacy for modesty in claims about how Scripture must read in light of modern data.
- **Polemic uses** - Employed by critics of strict inerrantism to argue for alternative hermeneutics.
- **Exegetical model** - Used by pastors and teachers as a model for reading Genesis and handling Adam and original sin without immediate capitulation to modern scientific frameworks.
- **Conceptual pivot** - Functions as a pivot in discussions where doctrinal formulations (e.g., federal headship) meet historical/scientific questions: preserves theological claims while loosening unhelpful hermeneutical assumptions.
