### TITLE
Aquinas on Nature and Grace (ed. A. M. Fairweather) - Selections of Thomas Aquinas on the relation between human nature and supernatural grace, with emphasis on the metaphysical, moral and soteriological logic that undergirds Thomistic theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 13th-century Scholasticism; Dominican intellectual milieu; synthesis of Aristotelian metaphysics with Augustinian theological priorities.
 - Work reflects ongoing medieval debates over Pelagianism/semipelagianism, and later reception in Reformation and Counter-Reformation controversies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How does gratuitous supernatural grace relate to nature? Specifically: can nature reach its supernatural end by its own powers, and how does grace operate without destroying nature?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Moral-anthropological premise: human person has natural powers (intellect, will) ordered to a natural end (temporal goods, speculative truth).
 - Teleological and metaphysical move: there is a distinct *supernatural* end (beatific vision) beyond the horizon of natural capacities.
 - Gratia as a real, habitual gift: grace elevates (gratia elevans) and perfects nature, infusing new habitual powers (infused virtues, sanctifying grace) rather than merely external assistance.
 - Distinction of orders:
 - Order of nature: reachable by natural reason and acquired virtues.
 - Order of grace: gratuitous, gratuitously superadds a new end and new capacities.
 - Causal account: God as primary cause gives both sufficient and efficacious forms of grace; human freedom operates but is moved by divine causality in a way consistent with moral responsibility.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary: Augustine (authority on sin/grace), Aristotle (teleology, virtue ethics).
 - Interlocutors: Lombard, contemporary scholastics; later counters by Scotists and Molinists on grace/election.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (original sin, concupiscence), free will, virtues (natural vs infused), sanctifying vs actual grace, God as causal agent, beatific vision.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas's center of gravity: **grace is a gratuitous supernatural perfection that elevates and perfects nature without annihilating it, making possible a supernatural end that nature cannot attain by its own powers.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear teleological bifurcation: natural ends vs supernatural end; grace as real ontological elevation, not merely moral encouragement.
 - Precise metaphysical language (act/potency, habit, form) to explain infused virtues and sanctifying grace.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Pelagianism: insists on need of grace for supernatural end; nature cannot by unaided effort attain beatitude.
 - Against some Augustinian readings pushed in later Reformers: denies a notion of absolute inability (total depravity) that obliterates all natural capacity-human will and reason remain wounded but operative.
 - Offers a middle path between deterministic efficaciousism and purely synergistic accounts: God's causality is efficacious without violating moral freedom.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of "gratia elevans" and careful distinction of **sanctifying (habitual) vs actual grace**, and **sufficient vs efficacious grace** deployed within a hylomorphic framework.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundation for classical Roman Catholic doctrine on nature/grace; heavily cited in Counter-Reformation theological formulations and Vatican statements.
 - Critically engaged by Reformers (notably on original sin and inability) and later scholastics (Scotus, Molina, Jesuits), prompting refinements about causality and free will.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous integration of metaphysics, moral psychology, and pastoral concern; indispensable for ecclesial teaching on sacraments, justification, and human flourishing.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Nature (natura)** - the given powers and ends of a created being; in humans: intellect and will ordered to natural goods.
- **Grace (gratia)** - gratuitous supernatural gift; raises nature to supernatural end.
- **Sanctifying grace (gratia habitualis)** - habitual, stable disposition that makes the soul pleasing to God and capable of the beatific vision.
- **Actual grace (gratia actuosa)** - transient divine helps that move will/intellect to particular acts.
- **Infused virtues (virtutes infusae)** - virtues imparted by God, distinct from acquired (natural) virtues.
- **Order of nature / Order of grace** - distinction between ends and means proper to created capacities vs those supernaturally bestowed.
- **Gratia elevans** - grace that elevates and perfects the natural powers, not replacing them.
- **Sufficient vs efficacious grace** - distinction: grace that suffices to enable an act vs grace that effectively brings about the act (Aquinas' account integrates both with divine causality and human freedom).
- **Original sin / concupiscence** - nature wounded by sin; concupiscence inclines will but does not eliminate freedom.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - retained capacity for choice; requires grace for supernatural good, though not absolutely disabled for natural good.
- **Beatific vision (visio beatifica)** - the supernatural end; intrinsically beyond natural capacities.
- **Habit / form (habitus / forma)** - scholastic categories used to explain how grace abides and shapes powers.
- **Teleology (final causality)** - central methodological frame: acts and gifts are ordered toward ends.
- **Causality of God (primary/secondary causation)** - God as primary cause of grace who operates by fittingly ordering secondary causes, including human consent.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Catholic doctrine on nature/grace and sacramental theology.
 - As a **polemic pivot** against Pelagian and deterministic interpretations (and a touchstone in Protestant-Catholic debates about inability).
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating metaphysics with pastoral theology and moral formation.
