### TITLE
**The Westminster Assembly and Its Work** by B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century England and Scotland amid civil war, 1643-1653.
 - Convened by the English Parliament; bound by the Solemn League and Covenant.
 - Puritan-Reformed milieu; debates among Presbyterians, Independents, and Erastians; Scottish commissioners present.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Assembly produced the mature, catholic, and scripturally grounded statement of Reformed faith; its standards are the apex of Protestant creed-making and a norm for church doctrine and order.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical genesis: from projected revision of the Thirty-Nine Articles to crafting a distinct Reformed confession.
 - Method: exhaustive exegesis, committee drafts, plenary debates, and proof-texting disciplined by the sufficiency of Scripture.
 - Output surveyed: Confession of Faith; Larger and Shorter Catechisms; Directory for Public Worship; Form of Presbyterial Church Government; collected proof texts.
 - Theological architecture: God and Scripture; decrees, creation, providence; covenantal structuring (works and grace); Christ the Mediator; effectual calling and the ordo salutis; church, worship, sacraments; magistrate and conscience.
 - Ecclesial debates resolved: rejection of Erastian control of the keys; preference for Presbyterian polity over Independency, while maintaining catholic breadth on essentials.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Participants: William Twisse, Anthony Tuckney, Thomas Gataker; Independents like Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye; Scots George Gillespie, Samuel Rutherford, Alexander Henderson.
 - Sources: Scripture as supreme; antecedent confessions (Irish Articles 1615, Heidelberg, Second Helvetic, Dort).
 - Interlocutors: Roman Catholicism, Anglican episcopacy, Socinianism, Arminianism, Erastianism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (WCF 1): inspiration, sufficiency, clarity, authority.
 - **Theology proper and Trinity**: divine simplicity, immutability, triune consubstantiality.
 - **Anthropology and sin**: Adamic headship, original sin, total depravity.
 - **Covenant theology**: covenant of works and grace; implicit pactum salutis.
 - **Christology and soteriology**: active and passive obedience, imputation, effectual calling, faith alone, perseverance, assurance.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: Presbyterian government, keys and discipline, two sacraments, spiritual presence in the Supper, paedobaptism.
 - **Worship and ethics**: regulative principle, Sabbath/Lord's Day, liberty of conscience, civil magistrate in things indifferent.
- **Closing line**
 - Center of gravity: the sovereign, triune God administering redemption by covenant through Word and sacrament, under Scripture alone, unto the holiness and consolation of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - A comprehensive, integrated **system of doctrine** with covenantal architecture.
 - Detailed doctrine of **Scripture** as principium; pastoral doctrine of **assurance** grounded in promises, evidences, and the Spirit.
 - Clear affirmation of the **free and sincere offer** of the gospel within robust particularism.
 - Regulative **worship** with Sabbath sanctity; **means of grace** as ordinary instruments of salvation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **Erastianism**: spiritual independence of church courts.
 - Against **Independency**: necessity of graded Presbyterian assemblies and catholic unity.
 - Against **Arminianism/Socinianism**: unconditional election, penal substitution, Trinity, and inerrant Scripture.
 - Distinct from Lutheranism: explicit threefold use of law, covenant of works/grace, spiritual communion in the Supper.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Codified **covenant of works** and **grace** as structuring categories.
 - Mature account of **imputation** (Adam and Christ) and of the ordo salutis.
 - Articulation of **liberty of conscience** under Scripture and limits of the magistrate.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Normative in Scottish and American Presbyterianism; widely adapted by Congregationalists (Savoy) and Baptists (1677/1689).
 - At Princeton, Warfield treats Westminster as the classic, catholic expression of Reformed orthodoxy, fit for modern defense.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as doctrinal standard, catechetical backbone, and ecclesial blueprint.
 - A touchstone for debates on assurance, republication, worship, sacraments, and subscription.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Standards**: Confession, Larger Catechism, Shorter Catechism as an integrated doctrinal corpus.
- **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture as sufficient, clear, and final norm; confessions ministerial, not magisterial.
- **Decrees of God**: Eternal, wise, free, immutable plan grounding providence and redemption.
- **Covenant of Works**: Adamic probation with life promised upon perfect obedience; basis for imputation of guilt.
- **Covenant of Grace**: One gracious covenant administered diversely; Christ the substance; grounds unity of OT/NT.
 - Often read with an implicit **Covenant of Redemption** within the Trinity.
- **Divine Simplicity and Immutability**: Theological grammar anchoring providence and assurance.
- **Imputation**: Adam's sin and Christ's righteousness reckoned; forensic core of justification.
- **Effectual Calling**: Sovereign application of redemption by Word and Spirit; distinguishes external call from internal.

- **Regulative Principle of Worship**: God commands all elements of worship; excludes human inventions.
- **Means of Grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer as ordinary instruments of salvation.

- **Liberty of Conscience**: Freedom from human doctrines in God's worship; bounded by Scripture and charity.
- **Sabbath/Lord's Day**: Moral command perpetually binding; Christian transformation to the first day.
- **Magistrate**: Civil authority upholds justice but does not administer Word or Sacraments; councils subject to Scripture.
