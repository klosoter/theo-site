### TITLE
**A Discourse on the Omnipresence of God** - Stephen Charnock (Discourses upon the Existence and Attributes of God, 17th century Puritan/Reformed context)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th century English Puritan / nonconformist theological milieu; Charnock (1628-1680) writes within Reformed scholastic method combining biblical exegesis, philosophical argument, and pastoral application.
 - Work appears among his collected "Discourses upon the Existence and Attributes of God," a standard Puritan systematic treatment of divine attributes.

- **Central thesis**
 - God is truly and personally present throughout all creation; His omnipresence is an essential, infinite attribute that is immaterial, non-spatial, simple, and operative - not to be confused with physical extension or division into parts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Proofs of omnipresence
 - Scriptural testimony (e.g., Psalms, prophetic and apostolic assertions of God's universal presence).
 - Rational considerations from divine infinity and simplicity: what is infinite cannot be limited by place.
 - Clarificatory distinctions
 - Immaterial immensity versus corporeal extension; omnipresence as personal presence, not spatial ubiquity.
 - Absolute attribute (omnipresence as intrinsec to God's being) versus relative effects (preservation, concurrence, knowledge).
 - Polemical refutations
 - Rebuttal of corporeal or materialistic conceptions of God (God is not a body that occupies space).
 - Correction of views that reduce omnipresence to mere influence or absence of local limitation.
 - Practical consequences
 - Grounds for worship, assurance, providence, and the futility of idolatry; pastoral comfort that God is accessible in every condition.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primarily Scripture and patristic/scholastic categories; implicitly interacting with Cartesian/materialist tendencies of the age and with Reformed precedents (e.g., Calvinic affirmations of divine immensity).
 - Uses philosophical categories (simplicity, infinity) drawn from scholastic-Reformed vocabulary.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (focus on omnipresence, immensity, simplicity).
 - Providence (preservation, concurrence), omniscience and omnipotence as related attributes.
 - Practical theology: worship, assurance, idolatry, spiritual communion.

- **Closing line**
 - Charnock centers omnipresence as the manifestation of God's infinite, immaterial, and personal presence that undergirds providence, worship, and believerly consolation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on omnipresence as a **personal** and **operative** divine presence, not a merely metaphysical property or distant governor.
 - Detailed parsing of the attribute into its intrinsic (absolute) character and its extrinsic (relative) effects on creation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects crude spatial metaphors and any anthropomorphic spatialization of God; opposes corporealism and mechanistic models that treat divine presence like material extension.
 - Sets aside reductive interpretations that make omnipresence merely "omnipotence at a distance" - stresses immediate sustaining presence.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Clear deployment of the absolute/relative attributes schema: omnipresence is absolute in being, relative in operation (e.g., preservation, concurrence, agency).
 - Distinctive clarity between **immensity** (not-being-contained) and **ubiquity** (being-in-every-part) to avoid the paradox of God being divided.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and Puritan traditions for its pastoral application and for epitomizing Reformed metaphysical defenses of classical theism.
 - Frequently cited by subsequent systematicians and pastors as a clear, pastoral exposition of omnipresence; less influential in circles that adopted more modern philosophical vocabularies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of combining rigorous metaphysical defense with pastoral application.
 - Useful corrective to modern tendencies to spatialize or depersonalize divine presence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Omnipresence** - God's presence everywhere; treated as an essential, non-spatial, personal attribute.
- **Immensit y** - The divine not being contained by space; distinguishes God from created extension.
- **Infinity** - Unlimited being that precludes local limitation; central philosophical ground for omnipresence.
- **Simplicity** - Divine indivisibility; used to show God is not in parts though present to all parts.
- **Immateriality** - God is not corporeal; presence is not the presence of a body within space.
- **Ubiquity (rejected sense)** - The idea of God being in many places like a body; Charnock distinguishes and rejects this notion.
- **Absolute attributes** - Attributes intrinsic to God's essence (omnipresence here); not defined by God's relations.
- **Relative attributes / effects** - The operations or effects (preservation, concurrence, providential governance) that follow from absolute attributes.
- **Preservation** - God's sustaining presence in every creature; a chief relative effect of omnipresence.
- **Concurrence** - God's cooperative action in all creaturely events; linked to omnipresence as immediate action everywhere.
- **Personal presence** - Emphasis that presence implies relation and awareness, not mere spatial filling.
- **Idolatry (practical foil)** - Used to show the futility of images/places as containing God.
- **Scriptural locus examples** - Psalm 139, Jeremiah, New Testament attestations used as exegetical anchors.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical theistic omnipresence within Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against corporealism/materialism and against impersonal conceptions of divine presence.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for reading texts about God's presence (comfort, worship, providence) and connecting attribute-theory to spiritual practice.
