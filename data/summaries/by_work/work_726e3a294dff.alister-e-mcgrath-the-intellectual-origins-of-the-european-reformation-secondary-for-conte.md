### TITLE
Alister E. McGrath, *The Intellectual Origins of the European Reformation* (1987). 
Secondary historical study used here as contextual background for Emil Brunner's doctrine of man (not a primary theological source on Brunner).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published late 20th century (1987) by a scholar/theologian trained in Reformation studies; addresses the late medieval and Renaissance intellectual matrix that conditioned the 16th-century Reformation.
 - Method: intellectual history focused on ideas (scholasticism, humanism, Augustinianism, nominalism) rather than institutional or purely ecclesiastical narratives.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformation must be read as the product of specific late medieval and Renaissance intellectual currents; theological outcomes (including doctrines of sin, grace, human nature, and imputation) are intelligible only against that intellectual background.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Traces trajectories from medieval scholasticism and late medieval pastoral theology into humanist critique and the reformers' recoveries of Scripture.
 - Emphasizes the roles of key intellectual shifts:
 - **Nominalism vs. realism** and their consequences for God, law, and human knowledge.
 - **Renaissance humanism** and its return to classical and patristic sources (impacting biblical exegesis and anthropology).
 - **Augustinian revival** (as mediated by Luther and Calvin) in shaping doctrines of sin, will, and grace.
 - Shows how these shifts produced differing accounts of human nature, the fall, and the theological necessity of a federal/forensic structure (sin imputed, justification forensic).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Medieval and late-medieval thinkers (Thomas Aquinas, William of Ockham), Renaissance humanists (Erasmus), and core reformers (Luther, Calvin).
 - Engages historiography of Reformation studies and interprets primary theological texts in light of intellectual antecedents.

- **Doctrines treated (relevant to anthropology and Adam)**
 - Original sin; imputation (forensic vs. ontological accounts); human will and freedom; revelation vs. reason; covenantal/federal ideas implicitly traced through legal and forensic metaphors.
 - Reveals how Reformation emphases on Scripture, grace, and forensic justification shaped later Protestant thinking about Adam and human origins.

- **Closing line**
 - McGrath locates the theological center of gravity of the Reformation in complex intellectual movements-showing that debates over Adam, original sin, and federal headship are legible only when we recover the late medieval and humanist matrices that produced Reformation anthropology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses intellectual genealogy rather than confessional or purely ecclesiastical narratives; shows cross-influences between philosophy, pedagogy, philology, and theology.
 - Pays attention to how methodological moves (philological returns to sources, nominalist skepticism) shaped doctrinal formulations.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects simplistic portrayals that cast the Reformation as merely a return to Scripture; instead argues it is a contested synthesis of older and newer ideas.
 - Contrasts with older "heroes of faith" histories by emphasizing contingency, debate, and intellectual complexity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Brings sharper analytical categories (e.g., the specific influence of nominalism on conceptions of divine omnipotence and human knowledge) to bear on theological outcomes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in academic theology and church history as a reliable synthesis of intellectual backgrounds to Reformation doctrines.
 - Influential for theologians who want historical depth when addressing modern doctrinal controversies (including contemporary debates on Adam's historicity and federal headship).

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a contextualizing resource: helps theologians (like Brunner scholars) see how Reformation presuppositions shaped later confessional treatments of Adam, original sin, and imputation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Renaissance humanism** - philological return to classical and patristic texts; reshaped scriptural exegesis and anthropology.
- **Scholasticism** - medieval method and conceptual apparatus that the reformers both inherited and contested.
- **Nominalism** - philosophical stance diminishing abstract universals; McGrath links it to heightened divine voluntarism and legal imagery.
- **Realism (medieval)** - competing metaphysical view that influenced ontology of sin and personhood.
- **Augustinianism** - revival of Augustine's doctrine of sin and grace; crucial for Reformation anthropology.
- **Forensic/forensic language** - legal metaphors of guilt, imputation, justification; central to Protestant accounts of Adam's representative role.
- **Original sin** - historical and theological formulations traced from medieval theology into Reformation expositions.
- **Federal headship** - concept (Adam as representative) made intelligible by legal and covenantal frameworks emphasized in Reformation thought.
- **Covenant theology (rudiments)** - contractual motifs and legal frameworks that undergird later Protestant anthropology.
- **Sola scriptura / philological exegesis** - how methodological commitments affected doctrines about the Fall and Adam's historicity.
- **Human will / freedom** - contested terrain (Erasmus vs. Luther) with consequences for anthropology.
- **Intellectual genealogy** - McGrath's method: tracing ideas across disciplines to explain doctrinal outcomes.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **historical-contextual source** to situate Reformation formulations of original sin and federal headship that later theologians (e.g., Brunner) inherit or react against.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** when debating Adam's historicity: supplies the intellectual lineage (philology, legal metaphors, Augustinianism) that shapes confessional and modern positions.
 - As background in **exegetical and doctrinal polemics**: used to show how certain interpretive moves (humanist vs. scholastic) produce divergent readings of Genesis and Adam.
