### TITLE
**"The Incarnation" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.,** entry in The New Dictionary of Theology (article)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed theological milieu; Gaffin writes from conservative evangelical/Reformed commitments amid renewed academic debate over classical Christology vs. modern "kenotic" reinterpretations.
 - Situated within reassertion of confessional Christology (Chalcedonian and Reformed standards) against liberal and some constructive Protestant appropriations of kenosis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The incarnation must be understood in continuity with the Chalcedonian confession: the eternal Son assumed true humanity without diminution or alteration of the divine nature. Kenotic theories that posit an ontological loss or real divesting of divine attributes in the incarnate Son are theologically and biblically inadequate.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Brief exegetical grounding: New Testament witness portrays the Son as fully divine and fully human in personal unity.
 - Retrieval of Chalcedonian categories and classical patristic and Reformed insight to frame the hypostatic union.
 - Critical engagement with kenotic proposals:
 - Distinguishes between metaphorical/relational self-limitation and claims of divine attribute-loss.
 - Argues that biblical language of "emptying" (Phil 2) should be read in terms of functional humiliation and voluntary self-limitation, not ontological subtraction.
 - Soteriological consequence: preservation of divine perfections in the incarnate Son is necessary for substitutionary atonement, efficacious mediation, and the communicative effects of the covenantal union.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary classical witnesses: Chalcedon, Athanasius, Cyril (implicit), Reformed confessions (e.g., Westminster).
 - Modern interlocutors: advocates of kenotic Christology (19th-20th c. lines of thought) and constructive theologians who reframe divine immutability and impassibility.
 - Reformed theologians and biblical exegesis used to repurpose the patristic vocabulary within confessional theology (Gaffin's prior works on union with Christ inform his approach).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, two natures)
 - Attributes of God (immutability, impassibility, aseity)
 - Soteriology (atonement, substitution, mediation)
 - Implicitly, revelation and covenantal union with Christ

- **Closing line**
 - The entry centers on a robust Chalcedonian-Reformed Christology: the Son assumes true humanity while retaining unaltered deity, and any biblical kenosis must be read as voluntary mode-of-operation, not ontological subtraction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on preserving classical categories (two natures, personal unity) as normative hermeneutical lenses for Phil 2 and other kenosis texts.
 - Emphasizes the functional/relational sense of "emptying" over ontological interpretations.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects kenotic models that posit the Son's temporary relinquishment of divine attributes, arguing such moves undermine substitutionary efficacy and biblical testimony to the Son's ongoing deity.
 - Contrasts with liberal and some existential readings that domesticate divine immutability in favor of temporal change.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "kenosis" as compatible, properly understood, with Chalcedonian doctrine: self-limitation within the economy without loss of divine being or attributes.
 - Uses Reformed covenantal and soteriological categories to show practical necessity of non-kenotic deity for atoning work.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Respected within conservative Reformed circles as a clear corrective to kenotic excesses; used in teaching and confessional defense.
 - Cited in broader evangelical and academic contexts when defending classical Christology against revisionist accounts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Short, disciplined restatement of why Chalcedonian categories remain the best safeguard for biblical and soteriological coherence; valuable for students needing a concise polemical and doctrinal resource.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation** - The eternal Son assuming true human nature without loss of deity; central subject of the entry.
- **Hypostatic Union** - Personal union of two complete natures (divine and human) in the one person of the Son; the non-negotiable frame for reading Scripture.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - The doctrinal standard invoked to guard against confusion, change, division, or separation of natures.
- **Kenosis** - Pauline language of "emptying" (Phil 2); Gaffin reads this as voluntary self-limitation, not ontological subtraction.
 - Contrast: functional/relational kenosis vs. ontological kenosis (rejected).
- **Communication of Idioms / Properties** - How attributes and descriptors can be spoken of Christ; handled with care to avoid collapsing natures.
- **Divine Attributes** - Immutability, impassibility, omniscience, omnipotence; argued to remain in the Son even in incarnation (though exercised in condescension).
- **Atonement / Substitution** - Soteriological necessity requiring the full deity and full humanity of Christ; loss of divinity would undercut efficacy.
- **Economic Trinity** - The Son's role in redemption as prelapsarian and incarnational action; used to explain voluntary submission without ontological change.
- **Voluntary Self-limitation** - Gaffin's favored account of what "emptying" entails: a willful refraining from exercising certain divine prerogatives while remaining divine.
- **Patristic-Reformed Continuity** - The hermeneutical method of reading Scripture through Chalcedonian and Reformed confession.
- **Philippians 2** - Key exegetical locus; used to illustrate kenosis properly understood.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for the Reformed-Chalcedonian understanding of incarnation.
- As a **polemic** against kenotic theories that claim ontological divesting of divine attributes.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Phil 2 and related texts through historic Christological categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed classrooms to connect Christology with soteriology and covenantal union.
