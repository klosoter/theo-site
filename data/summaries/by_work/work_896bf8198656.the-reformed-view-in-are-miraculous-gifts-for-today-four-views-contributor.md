### TITLE
**Sinclair B. Ferguson - "The Reformed View" (in Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in a multi-view volume addressing late 20th-century controversies over charismatic renewal. Ferguson writes from a contemporary Reformed pastoral-theological perspective rooted in Calvinist confession and the reformational tradition.
 - The debate sits at the intersection of rising Pentecostal/charismatic movements and established Reformed churches seeking a doctrinally disciplined response.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ferguson argues a Reformed cessationist position: the extraordinary sign and revelatory gifts (especially those serving apostolic confirmation) were normative for the apostolic era and are not the continuing pattern for the church today.
 - He distinguishes legitimate present work of the Spirit from claims of ongoing revelatory authority that undermine Scripture and church order.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of key NT texts (1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Hebrews, pastoral epistles) to show the temporal, apostolic function of certain gifts.
 - Historical-theological appeal: appeal to early church development, Reformation theology, and the regulative principle to assess modern claims.
 - Theological synthesis: insistence on the sufficiency and finality of Scripture; differentiation between ordinary means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer) and extraordinary apostolic signs.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial application: procedures for discernment, warnings against disorder and doctrinal drift in charismatic practice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Conversant with Pentecostal/charismatic proponents (implicit interlocutors include modern continuationists), and engages Reformation authorities (Calvin), patristic evidence, and contemporary Reformed theologians.
 - Dialogues indirectly with continuationist contributors in the same volume (representing Grudem/Fee-style arguments).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (sufficiency, finality)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit's work: common vs extraordinary)
 - Ecclesiology (office, order, means of grace)
 - Sacramental theology and normative worship practice
 - Eschatology as it relates to "signs" and consummation

- **Site usage**
 - Pentecostalism And Reformed Response
 - Continuationism vs Cessationism

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson centers the Reformed case: the Spirit continues to work powerfully, but the extraordinary apostolic gifts were temporary, and the church must evaluate charismatic claims by Scripture, order, and pastoral prudence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight coupling of cessationist claims with the Reformed commitments to the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the **regulative principle of worship**.
 - Pastoral concern: treats misuse of gifts as not merely doctrinal error but ecclesial disorder that harms preaching, sacraments, and catechesis.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Balances blunt cessationism (which may deny current Spirit-work) and romantic continuationism (which treats charismatic phenomena as normative). He affirms ongoing Spirit activity but denies continuing revelatory/apostolic gifts.
 - Counters continuationists by focusing on the **office-function** of gifts (signs attesting apostolic revelation) rather than merely experiential criteria.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear functional distinction between **extraordinary (apostolic-sign) gifts** and **ordinary graces/ministries**; emphasizes teleology (purpose fulfilled) as hermeneutical key.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a measured, pastorally sensitive defense of cessationism.
 - Used by pastors and seminary instructors to shape policy and practice in Reformed congregations encountering charismatic movements.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined interplay of exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral application; valuable for teaching on pneumatology, worship, and ecclesial order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism** - The view that certain miraculous/revelatory gifts ceased with the apostolic age.
- **Continuationism** - Opposing view that charismatic gifts continue today.
- **Sign gifts** - Gifts (tongues, prophecy, miracles) serving to authenticate apostolic message; Ferguson treats these as temporal.
- **Apostolic office** - The foundational, revelatory authority of the apostles; primary context for extraordinary gifts.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - Scriptural finality that makes ongoing canonical revelation unnecessary and dangerous.
- **Ordinary means of grace** - Preaching, sacraments, prayer as normative channels of Spirit-work in the Reformed schema.
- **Extraordinary gifts** - Charismata with revelatory or authentication functions distinct from ordinary sanctifying gifts.
- **Regulative principle of worship** - Worship governed by what Scripture prescribes; used to critique uncontrolled charismatic worship.
- **Pneumatology** - Doctrine of the Spirit; Ferguson balances Spirit's present sanctifying work with critique of claimed revelatory continuance.
- **Discernment** - Ecclesial procedures for testing gifts against Scripture and order.
- **Revelatory gifts** - Gifts that purportedly add to scriptural revelation; rejected as normative.
- **Miraculous vs providential** - Distinction between rare, extraordinary acts for revelation and ordinary providential works of God.
- **Ecclesial order** - The structure and offices of the church as safeguards against disorderly charismatic claims.
- **Teleology of gifts** - The purpose-driven argument that gifts had a specific, completed role.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise **definition source** for Reformed cessationism and the gift/office distinction.
 - As a **polemic** against unregulated charismatic practice and claims of ongoing revelatory authority.
 - As an **exegetical model** for readings of 1 Corinthians and related passages that prioritize apostolic context and canonical sufficiency.
