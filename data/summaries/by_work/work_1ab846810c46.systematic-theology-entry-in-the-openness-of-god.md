### TITLE
Systematic Theology (entry) - in Clark Pinnock et al., The Openness of God

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th century evangelical conversation (The Openness of God, 1994). Emerged from the Open Theism movement-evangelical reaction against classical, timelessly exhaustive omniscience-shaped by renewed interest in relationality and pastoral concerns about prayer, suffering, and divine character.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reconfigure traditional systematic loci (God, providence, revelation, Trinity, Christology, prayer) on the thesis that God is essentially relational and interacts dynamically with a partly open future; divine knowledge and action are robust but not determinative of creaturely free choices.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scriptural warrant: readings of biblical narratives (Yahweh "repenting," negotiation with Abraham, responses to prayer) indicate a responsive God.
 - Philosophical framing: distinguishes exhaustive foreknowledge of future free acts from knowing all present possibilities and counterfactuals; rejects Molinist "middle knowledge" as necessary articulation.
 - Doctrinal reorientation: omniscience reframed to include exhaustive knowledge of past and present and all possibilities, but not fixed definitive knowledge of future free acts; providence envisioned as persuasive and risk-involving rather than meticulous determinism.
 - Pneumatological emphasis: the Holy Spirit is presented as primary agent of revelation and ongoing illumination, enabling human responsiveness and dynamic covenantal relationship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (narrative and prophetic corpus), Augustine and classical theists (as contrast), Molinists (e.g., Molinist middle knowledge), contemporary critics and proponents within evangelicalism (Pinnock, Sanders, Hasker, etc.); engages Reformed formulations of sovereignty, as well as Barthian and process-adjacent concerns.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, immutability), providence, prayer, revelation and inspiration, pneumatology (role of the Spirit in illumination), Trinity, Christology (incarnation as model of divine condescension), eschatology (open future).
- **Closing line:** The entry situates the God of Scripture as intimately relational and risk-taking-divine condescension and the Spirit's revelatory work make God's knowledge and action dynamically responsive rather than exhaustively foreknowing and coercive.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Relationality and risk** as core attributes of God's self-disclosure; God intentionally limits or withholds determinative control for genuine relationship.
 - **Pneumatological primacy** for revelation: the Spirit's ongoing illumination-not only propositional inspiration-is central to how Scripture and experience mediate divine knowledge.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges **classical theism** (immutable, timeless, exhaustively knowing God) and **Molinism** (middle knowledge) by arguing these frameworks distort biblical portrait of divine responsiveness.
 - Reframes divine sovereignty from unilateral control to **persuasive providence** that honors creaturely freedom.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Openness" as a technical descriptor of divine relation to the future.
 - Use of **divine condescension** beyond morale/kenosis metaphors to ground epistemic and volitional self-limitation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Provoked sustained debate in Reformed and wider evangelical theology: strong critique from classical theists (charges of incoherence or undermining divine aseity) and uptake among those seeking pastoral accounts of prayer, suffering, and scripture's narrative contours.
 - Stimulated cross-disciplinary dialogue (biblical studies, philosophy of religion, pastoral theology) and revisions in pneumatological emphases in some evangelical circles.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies stakes in debates about omniscience and human freedom; furnishes an exegetical model for narratively reading Scripture's depictions of God.
 - Offers a framework for integrating prayer theology and pastoral care with systematic claims about God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open theism:** theological position that the future contains genuine possibilities and that God knows future free acts as open rather than exhaustively settled.
 - contrasts: classical omniscience (future exhaustively known) vs. openness (future partly open).
- **Divine condescension:** God's self-limitation in power, knowledge, or will to enter genuine relationship; used to account for incarnation, suffering, and responsive providence.
- **Relationality:** emphasis that God's primary mode of being is in covenantal, responsive relation to creatures.
- **Risk-taking God:** the characterization that God permits genuine creaturely freedom and thus exposure to contingent outcomes.
- **Omniscience (reframed):** exhaustive knowledge of all realities that exist, including all present possibilities, but not necessarily settled future free choices.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism):** doctrine of divine knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; critiqued as unnecessary or theologically problematic in this entry.
- **Providence (persuasive):** God's governance exercised through influence and relationship rather than meticulous preemption of free decisions.
- **Pneumatology / Role of the Holy Spirit:** Spirit as agent of revelation, on-going illumination, and empowerment for response; emphasizes Spirit-mediated encounter over only propositional transmission.
 - relation to revelation: Spirit both inspires scripture and illumines readers for present understanding and action.
- **Revelation (dynamic):** revelation includes narrative instances of divine speech and responsive presence, not merely static propositional deposit.
- **Prayer theology:** prayer as genuinely efficacious because God responds within an open future.
- **Kenosis:** used analogically to describe divine self-emptying in relation to knowledge or control.
- **Contingent future:** theological category describing future events not yet determined.
- **Scriptural narrative hermeneutics:** method privileging biblical story-lines where God appears to change or respond.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for open theism and "openness" vocabulary in systematic treatments of God and providence.
- As a **polemic** against classical omniscience and Molinism in debates over divine knowledge and sovereignty.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical narratives that depict divine change and negotiation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for pneumatology and prayer theology-arguing the Spirit's revelatory work makes relationality and responsiveness doctrinally central.
