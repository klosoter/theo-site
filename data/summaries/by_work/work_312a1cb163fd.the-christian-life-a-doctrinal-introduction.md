### TITLE
The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction - Sinclair B. Ferguson (Banner of Truth, early 1980s), a confessional Reformed, pastorally oriented synthesis linking doctrine to devotion within the Westminster-Puritan retrieval movement.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed renewal (Banner of Truth), stressing retrieval of Calvin, the Westminster Standards, and Puritan piety.
 - Written for educated laity, students, and pastors seeking a doctrinal map of Christian existence.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life is participation in Christ through the Spirit, under the Word, within the church, ordered by the ordo salutis and nourished by the means of grace.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Triune foundation**: The Christian life flows from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit; Christology and Pneumatology are inseparable.
 - **Word and Spirit**: No Spirit without the Word; effectual calling grounds all subsequent graces.
 - **Union with Christ** as the fountainhead of every saving benefit; historia salutis applied in the ordo salutis.
 - **Conversion graces**: **Faith** (instrumental) and **repentance** (evangelical) as twin responses.
 - **Justification and adoption**: Forensic righteousness in Christ and filial status with privileges of sonship.
 - **Sanctification**: Definitive break with sin and progressive renewal; mortification and vivification through the means of grace.
 - **Assurance and perseverance**: Promise-grounded, Spirit-witnessed, fruit-confirmed; God preserves through warnings and means.
 - **Law and liberty**: Three uses of the law; obedience as freedom in the Spirit, not legalism.
 - **Church and sacraments**: Word, baptism, and the Supper as ordinary means; spiritual real presence and covenantal sealing.
 - **Guidance, conscience, providence**: Wisdom-shaped guidance under Scripture; liberty of conscience; ordinary providence over against technique or private revelations.
 - **Eschatological frame**: Already/not yet shapes hope, suffering, and holiness unto glory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: **Scripture**, **Calvin**, **Westminster Standards**, **John Owen**, **John Murray**, **Luther**, classic Reformed orthodox and Puritan divinity.
 - In dialogue or contrast: **Roman Catholic** soteriology, **Arminian/Wesleyan** and **Keswick** perfectionism, **antinomianism**, **legalism**, charismatic subjectivism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture**, **Trinity**, **Christology**, **Pneumatology**, **sin and grace**, **union with Christ**, **ordo salutis** (calling, regeneration, faith, repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, assurance), **ecclesiology**, **sacraments**, **providence**, **eschatology**.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: **Life in union with the crucified and risen Christ, by the Spirit, under the Word, in the church, unto holiness and glory**.
