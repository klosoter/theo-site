### TITLE
Calvin on the Imputation of Adam's Sin - John Murray, Westminster Theological Journal (1959)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed scholarship; Murray at Westminster Theological Seminary defending classical Protestant readings of Calvin against modern revisionist readings.
 - Post-war theological milieu emphasizing doctrinal clarity; reaction to liberal and analytic reinterpretations of original sin and justification.
- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin affirms a **forensic, federal imputation** of Adam's sin to his posterity; Murray argues Calvin taught legal guilt imputed through representative headship, not merely natural depravity or biological transmission.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of Calvin's Institutes and commentaries to demonstrate consistent employment of juridical language (guilt, imputation, condemnation).
 - Distinction between two elements in Calvin: (a) **propagation of corruption** (natural, biological aspect) and (b) **imputation of guilt** (forensic, representative aspect).
 - Demonstrates that Calvin regards Adam as covenant head whose sin is legally reckoned to all; this provides the parallel and necessary basis for Christ's imputation of righteousness.
 - Replies to readings that reduce Calvin to a merely naturalist or psychological account of sin transmission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries).
 - Interlocutors: Augustinian tradition, later Reformed theologians; implicitly counters modern critics who minimize forensic language (anticipates later New Perspective debates).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin (nature and guilt), imputation, federal headship/covenant, justification (forensic), Christology (imputation of Christ's righteousness), soteriological symmetry between Adam and Christ.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Calvin consistently maintains that through Adam's representative headship guilt is legally imputed to humanity, and this forensic imputation is the necessary correlate and foil to the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness in justification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Murray insists on Calvin's sustained use of *legal/juridical* categories; he reads Calvin as a theologian of **forensic realities**, not merely psychological or natural corruption.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Calvin to an account of natural heredity or existential depravity without legal imputation.
 - Contrasts Calvin with those who separate propagation of a corrupt nature from imputation of guilt; Murray insists both are present but distinct in Calvin.
- **Conceptual/terminological clarifications**
 - Sharp demarcation of **guilt vs. corruption**: guilt is imputed, corruption is propagated.
 - Emphasizes **representative causality** (federal headship) as Calvin's key explanatory category.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard mid-century Reformed defense of traditional imputation doctrines; frequently cited in systematic treatments of original sin and justification.
 - Influential in polemical engagements with later critiques (including programs associated with the New Perspective on Paul), even though Murray predates that movement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, textually anchored corrective to non-forensic readings of Calvin; remains a model for linking historical theology with systematic concerns in teaching and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation (imputatio)** - Legal reckoning of sin or righteousness to another; Murray stresses Calvin's use of this as forensic, not merely descriptive.
- **Federal headship / representative head** - Adam as the covenantal representative whose act is legally charged to his descendants.
- **Original sin** - Dual aspects in Calvin per Murray: (a) transmitted corruption (nature), (b) imputed guilt (forensic).
 - Corruption = inherited depravity and tendency to sin.
 - Guilt = legal liability and condemnation.
- **Forensic / juridical language** - Terms like guilt, condemnation, impute; central to Calvin and to Murray's reading.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace** - Framework for understanding the legal consequences of Adam's failure and the necessity of Christ's representative obedience and imputation.
- **Imputation of Christ's righteousness** - The positive analogue: if Adam's guilt is imputed, Christ's righteousness is imputed to the believer for justification.
- **Representative causality** - The causal model that explains how the one act of Adam results in many being judged.
- **Solidarity / federalism** - Corporate identity between head and members; explains moral-legal transfer.
- **Guilt vs. Corruption (contrast)** - Clarifies that Calvin, per Murray, attributes both but keeps the terms analytically distinct.
- **Seminal transmission (seminalia)** - Biological/ontological element often associated with corruption; Murray notes Calvin sometimes uses this biological language but not to deny imputation.
- **Juridical declaration** - God's legal pronouncement in judgment (and in justification) - central to forensic schema.
- **Justification (forensic)** - The doctrine that presupposes and parallels Adamic imputation; Murray connects Calvin's anthropology to his soteriology.
- **Representative solidarity** - The theological anthropology underlying both condemnation and redemption.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: Cited to define Calvin's doctrine of imputation and to differentiate guilt vs. inherited corruption.
 - Polemic: Used against non-forensic or NPP-related readings that downplay juridical imputation; serves as a historical-theological rebuttal.
 - Exegetical model: Offers a method for reading Calvin by attending to legal language across Institutes and commentaries.
 - Conceptual pivot: Employed in systematic theology to link original sin (anthropology) and justification (soteriology) within a federal framework.
