### TITLE
Canon and Creed (2010) - Robert W. Jenson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late modern constructive theology within a post-Barthian, ecumenical milieu (early 21st century). Jenson writes as a systematician concerned with recovery of classical doctrine in conversation with modern historical consciousness and ecumenical creedal tradition.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The authoritative life of Christian doctrine is constituted by the interplay of the biblical canon and the creedal confession; sound theology is ecclesial, historically ordered, and Trinitarian. Creed is not an afterthought to Scripture nor merely propositional summary but the church's canonical articulation that orders interpretation and doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - The church's canon (Scripture as canonical narrative) supplies the historical events and identity-shaping story; the creed constitutes an interpretive, ecclesial norm that makes those events doctrinally intelligible.
 - The Trinity is the hermeneutical center: doctrines (Christology, salvation, ecclesiology) are to be read through the canonical-creedal Trinitarian ordering.
 - Doctrine should resist reduction to private metaphysics or modern abstract theology; it must remain public, narratively intelligible, and faithfully ordered by the ancient creeds.
 - Jenson reads and recasts modern loci (revelation, God, Christ, Spirit, church) through the canon-creed axis, showing how creedal formulations secure the canon's doctrinal force.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Karl Rahner (notably "Rahner's Rule") and Karl Barth (his reformulation of Rahner's insight) are explicitly engaged on the economy/immanent Trinity problem.
 - Patristic creedal sources, ecumenical councils, Scripture, and contemporary theologians in the Barthian and post-Barthian tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Trinity, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, Scripture and canon, creedal theology, the relation of history and dogma.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Theology must be reconceived as the church's canonical-creedal practice: a Trinitarian, historically ordered confession that preserves the identity and intelligibility of Christian faith against privatizing and metaphysical reductions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The canonical-creedal dyad as the primary theological epistemic framework - creed is normative interpretive form for the canon rather than secondary gloss.
 - Theology as ecclesial and liturgical practice, not merely academic system-building.
 - A narrative-ontological account of doctrine: persons and acts of God are constitutive events in history that the creed names and orders.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - To Rahner: Jenson accepts the import of Rahner's concern for relating economy and immanent Trinity but resists a metaphysical subsumption that abstracts the Trinity from narrative history.
 - To Barth: Jenson largely affirms Barth's reformulation of Rahner's rule (the economy is the immanent Trinity) but presses for a creedal-historical framing that keeps confession ecclesial and canonical rather than purely dialectical.
 - Against liberal theological reductions: insists on confession's public normativity, resisting private religiosity or mere ethical readings.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Canon-creed axis" as a concise heuristic for theological method.
 - Emphasis on "person-as-event" and doctrine as historically constituted naming.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among constructive ecumenical theologians and those reclaiming classical Trinitarian theology for systematic renewal.
 - Used in Reformed and Lutheran circles for recovery of confessional norms; also provoked debate about the balance between scriptural exegesis and creedal imposition.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a disciplined, church-centered corrective to fragmentary modern theology and a practical method for bringing Scripture and tradition into fruitful theological dialog.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon:** The Scriptures as the church's normative, narrative locus; supplies events and story that theology must interpret.
- **Creed:** Ecclesial, concise confession that interprets and orders the canon for doctrine and worship.
- **Canon-creed axis:** Jenson's shorthand for the mutual shaping relation that secures doctrinal identity.
- **Trinity (hermeneutical center):** The interpretive grid by which all doctrines are coherently read and confessed.
- **Rahner's Rule:** The theological principle linking the economic Trinity to the immanent Trinity; Jenson engages it as a problem to be ecclesially framed.
 - **Barth's reformulation:** Barth's affirmation that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity; Jenson endorses the move but insists on creedal-historical safeguards.
- **Person-as-event:** The claim that persons of the Trinity are known in redemptive acts/events; doctrine names these acts historically.
- **Historical normativity:** The insistence that doctrine's authority derives from historically situated canonical events as confessed by the church.
- **Ecclesial hermeneutic:** Interpretation governed by the church's creedal confession and communal practice.
- **Dogmatic continuity:** The creedal continuity that preserves identity across historical reinterpretations.
- **Confession vs. private speculation:** Distinction insisting on public normativity and church-liturgical embedding.
- **Narrative ontology:** Ontology shaped by salvific history rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Catechetical/communal use:** Creeds as formative texts for church identity and catechesis.
- **Canon as interpretive primer:** Scripture provides the material; creed provides the doctrinal lens.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the method relating Scripture and creed (methodological anchor).
- As a **polemic** against liberal, privatizing, or reductive metaphysical theologies.
- As an **exegetical model** that insists biblical narrative be read through creedal Trinitarian categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary Trinitarian and ecumenical dogmatics, guiding curriculum and constructive projects.
