### TITLE
A Redemptive-Historical Perspective on the New Testament Canon - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., Westminster Theological Journal (1982)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1980s Reformed academic milieu (Westminster Seminary/Westminster Theological Journal).
 - Reaction to mid-20th-century historical-critical tendencies and concurrent rise of canonical criticism (e.g., Brevard S. Childs).
 - Working within and developing the Reformed redemptive-historical (heilsgeschichte) tradition associated with Geerhardus Vos and later evangelical biblical theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament canon is best understood and defended theologically when viewed through a redemptive-historical lens: the canon's authority is grounded in the concrete, covenantal, Christ‑centred events witnessed by the apostles rather than merely in ecclesiastical proclamation or abstract canonical function.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scripture's unity and authority must be read Christocentrically: the decisive event is the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Christ which climaxes redemptive history.
 - The apostolic testimony has a unique normative role because it testifies to this historical redemptive event; the canon embodies and preserves that testimony.
 - Critiques both historicist reductions (which detach the text from redemptive center) and purely ecclesial constructions of canon (which make the church solely constitutive rather than custodian of apostolic witness).
 - Proposes a model where canonical status is explained by the conjunction of historical apostolicity and theological redemptive-historical intelligibility.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit conversation with canonical criticism (Brevard Childs), historical-critical scholarship, and the Reformed Vosian tradition.
 - Draws on patristic and confessional appeals to apostolic authority while reinterpreting them within biblical-theological categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (as covenant-historical, event-centered).
 - Canon and tradition (relation of apostolic testimony to church reception).
 - Christology (central, governing all exegesis and canonical interpretation).
 - Covenant theology (framework for progressive revelation and unity of Scripture).
 - Ecclesiology only insofar as it receives and preserves the apostolic witness.

- **Closing line**
 - The New Testament canon's authority is best located in the historical, covenantal, Christ‑centred apostolic testimony that the canon both records and preserves - a canonical theology anchored in redemptive history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Canon defined by **redemptive-historical apostolicity**: canonical normativity flows from apostolic witness to Christ as the decisive redemptive event.
 - Prioritizes historical event (incarnation and resurrection) as the hermeneutical center for canonical interpretation rather than purely literary or ecclesiastical constructs.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against approaches that either:
 - Reduce Scripture to mere historical documents (historicism), or
 - Treat the canon as primarily an ecclesial-linguistic formation detached from apostolic historicity (extreme versions of canonical criticism).
 - Seeks a mediating position: canonical authority is both historically anchored and theologically formative.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes terms such as **canon-as-apostolic-testimony** and **redemptive-historical normativity** to reconceive how canonical status confers theological authority.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded within Reformed and evangelical circles as a rigorous attempt to marry Vosian biblical theology with concerns about canon and authority.
 - Frequently cited in debates on inspiration, biblical theology, and how the church should read Scripture; influenced later work on canon, covenant, and Christocentric hermeneutics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact template for integrating biblical theology, doctrine of revelation, and canonical theology.
 - Useful corrective to both liberal historicism and non-historical readings of the canon; remains a staple in Reformed teaching on Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-historical (heilsgeschichte)** - Reading Scripture as unified progress of God's saving acts culminating in Christ.
- **Apostolic testimony** - The witness of the apostles to Christ's redemptive work; basis for NT authority.
- **Canon** - The closed corpus that both records and preserves apostolic testimony; authoritative because of its relation to redemptive events.
- **Normativity** - The theological authority by which Scripture governs faith and life; rooted in apostolic witness to Christ.
- **Covenant theology** - Framework for understanding progressive revelation and unity of OT/NT.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic** - Interpreting all Scripture in light of the person and work of Christ.
- **Inspiration as covenantal event** - Inspiration tied to God's historical self‑disclosure rather than abstract verbal formulas.
- **Tradition vs. canon** - Distinguishes ecclesial reception (tradition) from the canonical grounding in apostolic witness.
 - Tradition is receptive and interpretive; canon is the conserving locus of apostolic testimony.
- **Canonical formation** - Process by which apostolic writings were received and recognized as normative.
- **Historical apostolicity** - Emphasis on apostolic origins and connection to the historical events they proclaim.
- **Theological unity of Scripture** - Unity grounded in the single redemptive act and covenantal plan.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for canonical authority in Reformed doctrine of Scripture (shows how apostolic witness grounds normativity).
- As a **polemic resource** against both liberal historical-critical reductions and purely ecclesiological claims about canon formation.
- As an **exegetical model** advocating Christocentric, redemptive-historical reading across biblical-theological and homiletical contexts.
