### TITLE
**The Divine and Human in the Person of Christ** - B. B. Warfield (Princeton theological essay; late 19th / early 20th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written within the Princeton/Reformed conservative milieu reacting to 19th-century German speculative and "kenotic" Christologies and to liberal attempts to naturalize the incarnation.
 - Method combines patristic and confessional appeals with rigorous analytic theology and exegesis.

- **Central thesis**
 - Affirmation of the Chalcedonian **hypostatic union**: Christ is truly God and truly man in one person without division, confusion, or real subtraction of divine attributes. Apparent self-emptying (kenosis) is voluntary humbling, not actual loss of deity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clear distinction between *nature* and *person*: the Son assumes human nature but does not cease to be the divine subject.
 - Defense of the immutability and impassibility of the divine nature; any change is in the mode of manifestation, not in the divine essence.
 - Exegetical treatment of Philippians 2:6-7: "emptying" = voluntary renunciation of divine prerogatives in action/position, not ontological divestment.
 - Use of communicatio idiomatum: properties of both natures are ascribed to the one person without confusing the natures.
 - Polemic against kenotic theories that posit real subtraction or alteration of divine attributes to make room for genuine humanity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical authorities (Chalcedon, Athanasius, Augustine) and contemporary European kenotic theologians; aligns with Reformed scholastic precision rather than speculative revisionism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), Trinity (immanent vs. economic), attributes of God (immutability, omniscience, omnipotence), revelation, incarnation, communicatio idiomatum, and soteriology insofar as the person and natures ground atonement.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the theological center of gravity in a robust Chalcedonian realism: the Son's full deity and full humanity coexist in one personal subject by union, with voluntary self-limitation accounting for the incarnate economy without compromising divine immutability.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing *relative* limitation (in action/economy) from *ontological* change in the divine nature.
 - Emphasizes that divine attributes are not things that can be shed; rather, the Son refrains from exercising certain prerogatives within the incarnate economy.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to kenotic proposals that make the incarnation consist in the Son's relinquishing attributes such as omniscience or omnipotence.
 - Contrasts with theological trajectories that submerge classical dogma into psychological or ethical readings of Philippians 2.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Systematic insistence on person-nature distinction and on using communicatio idiomatum responsibly to avoid confusion or separation.
 - Uses language of "self-limitation" and "voluntary non-exercise" rather than positive subtraction.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a model of defensive classical Christology.
 - Continues to be cited in contemporary debates on kenosis, the attributes of the incarnate Son, and the theological limits of Christological revisionism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, compact refutation of kenotic reductivism and as an exemplar of integrating exegesis, dogmatic history, and analytic clarity in Christological theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - One person (hypostasis) with two distinct natures, divine and human; central explanatory category (see Hypostatic Union).

- **Kenosis**
 - The Pauline motif of "emptying" construed as voluntary self-humbling in economy, not ontological divestment (see Kenosis Theories And Critiques).

- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - The ascription of properties of both natures to the single person without confusion; used to explain scriptural ascriptions of both divine and human predicates to Christ.

- **Person vs. Nature**
 - Person = subjecthood (who); Nature = what is possessed. Warfield insists on this distinction to preserve both fullnesses.

- **Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Divine attributes that are not subject to real change; Warfield defends these against kenotic alteration.

- **Voluntary Self-limitation**
 - Key explanatory phrase: the Son refrains from exercising certain divine prerogatives in the incarnation while remaining ontologically divine.

- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity**
 - Distinguishes actions/relations in salvation history (economic) from inner divine being (immanent); kenotic claims often confuse the two.

- **Philippians 2:6-7 exegesis**
 - Interpreted christologically as moral and positional "emptying," not metaphysical subtraction.

- **Two Natures, One Person**
 - Chalcedonian formula reiterated and operationalized against reductionist readings.

- **Divine Attributes (omniscience, omnipotence)**
 - Treated as communicable in exercise but not removable from the divine nature; apparent limitations are vocational/economic.

- **Chalcedonian Definition**
 - Foundational standard; Warfield reads modern proposals through its categories.

- **Incarnation / Atonement**
 - Incarnation real and full; atonement presupposes the integrity of both natures in the one person.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for conservative, Chalcedonian Christology articulating person-nature relations.
- As a **polemic** and reference point in rebuttals to kenotic and modernist Christologies.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 within classical dogma.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of divine attributes in the incarnation.
