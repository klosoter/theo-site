### TITLE
**John M. Frame, The Doctrine of the Word of God** (2010). Fourth volume in Frame's Theology of Lordship series; a Reformed, Van Tilian, evangelical account of revelation and Scripture using tri-perspectival method and speech-act analysis.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical theology; Westminster/Van Til tradition.
 - Engages modern hermeneutics, analytic philosophy of language, and inerrancy debates post-Chicago Statement.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **God's lordship is exercised by his Word**; the Word is God himself speaking with **authority, control, and presence**. Christ, Scripture, and proclamation are united as modes of that one divine address.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **The Lord and his Word:** God's lordship attributes map onto the nature of the Word (authority, control, presence).
 - **Media of the Word:** God speaks in **events**, **words**, and **persons**; climactically in **Christ the Word**, normatively in **Scripture**, and contemporaneously in **proclamation** by the Spirit.
 - **Properties of the written Word:** inspiration, inerrancy, clarity, necessity, sufficiency; canon as covenant document; Scripture's self-attestation and Spirit's testimony.
 - **Epistemology and method:** tri-perspectival knowing (normative, situational, existential); warranted circularity in ultimate authority claims; meaning and application are inseparable.
 - **Hermeneutics and speech-acts:** locution/illocution/perlocution integrated to show Scripture's commanding, promising, and effecting power.
 - **Church and means:** preaching as God's present speech; sacraments linked to the Word; pastoral use and ethical application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed: Calvin, Turretin, Warfield, Kuyper, Bavinck, Van Til, Kline.
 - Philosophical/linguistic: Austin, Searle; Plantinga on warrant.
 - Dialogues/contrasts: Barth, Brunner, Bultmann, postconservative evangelicals; modern critical scholarship; Chicago Statement on Inerrancy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), Trinity and lordship, Christology (Christ the Word), Pneumatology (inspiration/illumination), bibliology (canon, inerrancy, clarity, sufficiency), ecclesiology (preaching, sacraments), soteriology (Word as means of grace), eschatology (Word of judgment/promise), covenant theology.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **The living Lord rules and redeems by speaking; the church's confidence rests in the self-attesting, Spirit-empowered Word in Christ, Scripture, and proclamation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Tri-perspectivalism:** normative (God's standards), situational (facts/history), existential (persons/response) as mutually interpreting lenses.
 - **Lordship attributes** applied to the Word: authority (obligation), control (efficacy), presence (God himself addresses).
 - **Multi-media Word:** events, words, persons; integrates Christology, Scripture, and preaching without collapsing distinctions.
 - **Meaning-as-application:** the Bible's illocutions obligate hearers; ethics is intrinsic to exegesis.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against neo-orthodox reduction of the Word to Christ-event or proclamation; maintains Scripture itself is God's Word.
 - Against limited inerrancy and purely phenomenological truth-claims; affirms plenary, organic inspiration and full inerrancy.
 - Against impersonal propositionalism and against subjectivist hermeneutics; emphasizes personal address grounded in divine lordship.
 - Justifies **warranted circularity** in ultimate authority appeals; critiques neutralist evidentialism.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Lordship triad** (authority, control, presence) and **perspectival triad** (normative, situational, existential).
 - **Speech-act framing** of biblical authority (locution/illocution/perlocution).
 - **Canon as covenant document**, aligning with ANE treaty forms and covenant lordship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries; paired with Poythress and Van Til; influential in Acts 29/Westminster circles.
 - Appreciated for integrating exegesis, doctrine, and pastoral practice; critiqued by some for possible category flattening among forms of the Word.
- **Enduring value**
 - A comprehensive, pastorally tuned bibliology that supplies a theological rationale for inerrancy, hermeneutics, and proclamation across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God:** God himself addressing; includes Christ, Scripture, proclamation, creation/order, redemptive events.
- **Lordship attributes:** **Authority** (obligation to believe/obey), **Control** (Word accomplishes), **Presence** (God is present in his speech).
- **Triperspectivalism:** **Normative** (Scripture's standards), **Situational** (facts/history), **Existential** (knower and response) cohere in knowledge.
- **Media of the Word:** **Events, words, persons**; Scripture normatively interprets events; Christ is personal Word.
- **Self-attestation (autopistia):** Scripture bears its own divine authority; recognized through the Spirit's **internal testimony**.
- **Inspiration:** **Plenary, verbal, organic**; the Spirit superintends human authors without erasing agency.
- **Inerrancy:** Scripture is wholly true in all it affirms in the autographs; tied to God's truthfulness and covenant faithfulness.
- **Canon:** Covenant document of the Lord; the church **recognizes**, not constitutes, the canon.
- **Clarity (perspicuity):** What is necessary for salvation is clear, though not all equally so.
- **Sufficiency:** Scripture contains all God's words needed for faith and life; does not preclude subordinate authorities.
- **Speech-act theory:** Distinguishes **locution** (content), **illocution** (act, e.g., command/promise), **perlocution** (effects); Scripture performs divine acts.
- **Illumination:** The Spirit enables right understanding and faithful response; inseparable from sanctification.
- **Meaning and application:** No sharp divide; application belongs to the illocutionary force of texts.
- **Preaching as Word of God:** When faithful to Scripture, preaching is God's present address; a means of grace.
- **Covenant:** The structuring relation in which God speaks; Scripture is the treaty text governing worship and life.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Bibliology anchor:** Definitions and defenses of authority, canon, inerrancy, clarity, sufficiency.
 - **Hermeneutical model:** Triperspectival exegesis and speech-act framing for theology and preaching.
 - **Polemic resource:** Responses to neo-orthodoxy, postconservative hermeneutics, and limited inerrancy.
 - **Doctrinal integrator:** Links Christology, Pneumatology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, and Eschatology through a unified doctrine of the Word.
