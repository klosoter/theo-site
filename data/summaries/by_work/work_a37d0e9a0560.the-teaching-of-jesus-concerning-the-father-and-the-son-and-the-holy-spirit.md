### TITLE
The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Reformed milieu; part of Vos's project of biblical theology that grounds doctrine in the historical revelation of God in Scripture. Written against Enlightenment reductionism, modernist skepticism, and speculative metaphysics that divorced doctrine from redemptive history.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jesus' own teaching supplies the proper starting point for Trinitarian doctrine: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct personal realities disclosed in the economy of redemption, and creedal formulations (and later technical terms) should be measured by that revelatory pattern rather than by abstract metaphysics.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of passages in the Synoptic Gospels, John, and Jesus' prayer-life that reveal intra-Trinitarian relations (e.g., Father-Son language, sending and sending-back, Spirit as promised gift).
 - Argument that the economic disclosures (missions, sendings, obedience, mutual indwelling) show both **personal distinction** and **ontological unity** without succumbing to modalism or subordinationalism.
 - Assessment of patristic and creedal language as attempts to summarize the apostolic witness; technical vocabulary (procession, person, hypostasis) is useful when kept subordinate to Scripture's redemptive-historical data.
 - Short engagement with controversies such as the Filioque and the role of the ecumenical creeds: these are judged by fidelity to the Gospel testimony rather than by later metaphysical elaboration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Primary: the Gospels and Johannine theology; secondary: Church Fathers and ecumenical creeds (as witnesses), contemporary German theology (Hegelianism, rationalism), and polemical forms of Unitarianism/Modalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (economic), Trinity (distinction and unity), Christology (Sonship and sending), Pneumatology (Spirit as gift and agent), creedal theology (role/authority of creeds).
- **Closing line:** Vos centers Trinitarian doctrine on Jesus' revelatory acts and words: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are personally distinct and mutually relate within one divine being as disclosed in redemptive history; theology's task is faithful exposition of that revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes Jesus' own speech and mission as the normative datum for Trinitarian doctrine (a distinctly biblical-theological priority).
 - Treats intra-divine relations in terms of economic relations (missions, sending, obedience) that remain indicative of ontology without speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects Enlightenment reductionism that treats the Trinity as mere ethical monotheism or philosophical triad.
 - Pushes back on scholastic over-systematization: technical metaphysics is permitted only insofar as it explicates, not replaces, redemptive-historical data.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reorients traditional terms (procession, personal relations, paternity/filiality) into the idiom of Jesus' ministry and Johannine revelation-language of sending, abiding, and mission becomes theological categories.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely respected in Reformed academic circles for model integration of biblical theology and dogmatics.
 - Influenced 20th-century Reformed and evangelical approaches that insist doctrine follow Scripture's historical revelation rather than abstract philosophical schema.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise exemplar of how to derive systematic Trinitarian claims from the teaching of Jesus; helpful corrective to both liberal reductions and hyper-scholastic formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity:** The way God reveals himself in redemptive acts; Vos emphasizes this as primary for doctrine.
- **Ontological Trinity:** The divine being as such; affirmed but subordinated methodologically to the economic revelation.
- **Person / Hypostasis:** Distinct centers of personal life within the Godhead; treated as real persons revealed in Scripture.
- **Procession / Relations of Origin:** Terms (e.g., Fatherhood, Sonship, procession of the Spirit) are explained in light of Jesus' self-revelation and creedal language.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling):** Implied in Jesus' teaching of unity (e.g., abiding) - used to account for unity without ontological collapse.
- **Sending (missio):** Key economic category: Father sends Son, Father and Son send Spirit - central to Vos's exposition.
- **Filioque:** Discussed as a later theological formulation; Vos treats it as a creedal attempt to capture biblical witness and insists its acceptability depends on fidelity to Gospel testimony rather than novelty.
- **Ecumenical Creeds:** Valued as faithful summaries of apostolic revelation when read under Scripture's authority; technicalities clarified but not superseding the Gospel.
- **Subordination (functional vs ontological):** Vos distinguishes functional subordination in mission from any ontological inferiority of the Son or Spirit.
- **Revelation (economic vs. speculative):** Vos's recurring methodological distinction: doctrine must begin with revealed acts and words.
- **Christological Sonship:** Central-Sonship is both ontological and revealed in mission, obedience, and relational language of Jesus.
- **Pneumatological gift:** Spirit portrayed chiefly as promised, sent, and operative in redemption - not an abstract force.
- **Creedal language as hermeneutical tool:** Creeds guide interpretation but must be yoked to Gospel exegesis.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for grounding Trinitarian categories in Scripture-first methodology.
 - As an **exegetical model** showing how to derive Trinitarian claims from Jesus' teaching rather than from later metaphysical systems.
 - As a **polemic resource** against modalism, rationalist reductions, and misapplied scholasticism while accommodating creedal integrity.
