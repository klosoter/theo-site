### TITLE
**The New Testament and Intellectual Humility (Grant Macaskill, 2018)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published in the late 2010s amid renewed interest in virtue epistemology and Christian epistemology. Addresses contemporary concerns about polarization, epistemic arrogance, and the relation of doctrinal knowledge to character in Protestant (especially Reformed) academic and ecclesial contexts.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The New Testament cultivates and presupposes an **epistemic virtue of intellectual humility**, rooted not merely in moral exhortation but in Christian identity-principally in the Spirit-enabled union with Christ-so that knowing God and neighbour is formed by pneumatological and soteriological realities.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Exegetical survey: close readings of Pauline, Lucan, and Johannine texts showing recurring language and praxis that instantiate humility in belief, speech, and community life. 
 - Theological synthesis: locates intellectual humility within doctrines of the Spirit and **union with Christ**, arguing these doctrines reconfigure how knowledge functions (relationally and participatorily rather than only propositional). 
 - Philosophical engagement: dialogues with contemporary epistemology (virtue epistemology, testimonial theory) to frame humility as an epistemic virtue with implications for testimony, disagreement, and doctrinal formation. 
 - Practical implication: ecclesial practices (worship, confession, teaching, mutual accountability) are the crucible in which humility is cultivated and epistemic vices corrected.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary biblical interlocutors: Paul as central (union language, Spirit), with attention to Luke-Acts and Johannine emphases on abiding and relational knowledge. 
 - Contemporary interlocutors: virtue epistemologists and theologians of knowledge, critics of both fideism and secular epistemic triumphalism. Occasional patristic and Reformation echoes in deployment of union/pneumatology.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit as educator and knower-maker) 
 - **Union with Christ** (ontological/relational ground for transformed knowing) 
 - Soteriology (knowledge as fruit of salvation) 
 - Ecclesiology (community-formed epistemic practices) 
 - Christology and revelation (Christ as revelation and exemplar of humble knowing)

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Intellectual humility in the New Testament is not an optional ethic but an epistemic fruit grounded in the Spirit-wrought union with Christ that re-orients how Christians know, speak, and learn within the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Prioritizes **pneumatological union** as the theological ground for epistemic virtue rather than treating humility as a generic moral trait. 
 - Treats knowledge as **participatory and relational**, not merely propositional assent; knowing is located in communion with Christ and the Spirit.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on readings that separate cognitive virtue from sanctification (i.e., secular epistemology that abstracts knowledge from spiritual formation). 
 - Opposes both **fideism** (detaching epistemic virtue from reason) and **intellectual triumphalism** (privileging certainty and argumentative dominance), arguing the NT cultivates humble conviction, not epistemic resignation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes common theological terms (e.g., "union with Christ") as having concrete epistemic consequence - an **epistemic union** that shapes attention, testimony, and trust. 
 - Adopts and adapts virtue-epistemology vocabulary into a biblical-theological register.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Has become a reference point for conversations at intersection of biblical theology and Christian epistemology, especially for Reformed and evangelical scholars interested in virtues and pastoral formation. 
 - Cited in seminars on pastoral epistemics, worship formation, and in work addressing polarization in Christian public discourse.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a robust model linking exegesis, doctrine, and epistemic practice; useful for seminary courses on pastoral theology, spiritual formation, and Christian intellectual life. 
 - Serves as a corrective to reductionist accounts of knowledge that ignore sanctifying and communal dimensions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Intellectual Humility:** disposition to hold beliefs with proper epistemic modesty; receptive to correction and aware of epistemic limitations. 
- **Pneumatology / Spirit-as-Educator:** Spirit who forms believers' faculties for truth and humility; enables participation in Christ's knowledge. 
- **Union with Christ:** relational/ontological union that grounds identity and thus reorients how believers know and testify. 
 - Emphasizes epistemic consequences: assurance coupled with teachability. 
- **Participatory Knowledge:** knowing that is lived, communal, and shaped by relationship with Christ and the church. 
- **Epistemic Virtue:** character traits that conduce to truth and trustworthiness (humility, attentiveness, patience). 
- **Testimony and Trust:** how community-level practices regulate knowledge-sharing and correction; humility enhances credible testimony. 
- **Doctrinal Formation:** process by which teaching, liturgy, and discipline shape both belief content and intellectual character. 
- **Christian Epistemology:** theological frame integrating revelation, Spirit, and community practices into account of knowledge. 
- **Anti-triumphalism:** stance against victory-oriented modes of argument; prefers patient witnessing. 
- **Wisdom Language:** NT wisdom motifs reframed as communal, Spirit-enabled discernment rather than merely cognitive acumen. 
- **Pastoral Epistemics:** practical outworking for pastors: how to teach with humility, handle disagreement, and cultivate learnability.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline/Johnine texts with attention to epistemic formation. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Christian epistemology, integrating pneumatology and union with Christ into virtue epistemology. 
 - As a **praxeological resource** in pastoral and congregational formation, informing pedagogy, preaching, and conflict practices.
