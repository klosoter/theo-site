### TITLE
**G. C. Berkouwer - Studies in Dogmatics: The Doctrine of God**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed Dutch theology (1950s-60s). Berkouwer writes within the postwar Groen van Prinsterer/Scholastic-Reformed milieu while engaging contemporary continental theology (Karl Barth, Karl Rahner), Anglo‑American apologetics (Van Til) and modern biblical scholarship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To articulate a biblically faithful, theologically coherent doctrine of God that preserves classical divine attributes while resisting speculative metaphysics that severs God from revealed, covenantal relation. Emphasis on knowing God through revelation (economic) without collapsing the distinction between God's immanent being and his self‑disclosure.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Starts with **revelation as the locus** for speaking rightly of God: Old and New Testament witness grounds doctrine.
 - Treats classical attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) but interprets them in light of **divine self‑revelation** and relational life (Trinity, covenant).
 - Explores the **Trinity** by balancing ontological claims with economic disclosure; careful critique of speculative ontologizing and of reducing the Trinity to mere functions.
 - Interaction with modern proposals (Rahner, Barth, Van Til) to refine how the theological vocabulary functions.
- **Figures / sources engaged:** Karl Barth, Karl Rahner, Cornelius Van Til, classical scholastic sources, Scripture (OT/NT), patristic emphases on relations within the Godhead.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (OT and NT), Theology Proper (attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Doctrine of the Trinity (ontological vs economic), divine relations, and implications for Christology and soteriology.
- **Closing line:** Berkouwer's doctrine of God centers on a biblical, relational theism that safeguards God's transcendence and sovereign being while insisting that true knowledge of God is bound to his self‑enacted revelation in covenant and in the economy of the Trinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Relational reading of attributes:** Reframes absolute attributes (aseity, simplicity) in continuity with God's revealed activity, allowing for genuine relationality in the economy without capitulating to mere modalism or functionism.
- **Balance between ontological and economic:** Rejects both a purely speculative immanent‑Trinity ontology divorced from Scripture and a purely economic account that denies eternal relations; affirms a disciplined correlation: what God is in himself is disclosed in what God does.
- **Constructive critique of Barth and Rahner:** Uses Barth's insistence on revelation to resist ontotheological speculation yet resists Rahnerian collapses (and some Barthian emphases) that either make immanent and economic Trinity identical in an uncritical way.
- **Critical engagement with Van Til:** Questions one‑person language and certain presuppositional moves that obscure the Trinitarian personal relations by overemphasizing unity at the expense of personal plurality.
- **Terminological moderation:** Avoids abstruse scholastic metaphysics; prefers biblical categories and pastoral clarity while retaining rigorous systematic structure.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely read in Reformed seminaries as a careful middle way between Barthian neo‑orthodoxy and traditional scholasticism; valued by pastors and scholars for exegetical sensitivity and theological restraint.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a pedagogical model for writing doctrine that is biblically anchored, historically aware, and critically engaged with contemporary theology; useful for teaching the Trinity and divine attributes without reducing mystery.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity:** God as revealed in redemptive action; primary locus for theological assertions about God's persons and works.
- **Immanent (Ontological) Trinity:** God as God in himself; Berkouwer insists on distinction but ties claims to what is disclosed economically.
- **Rahner's Rule:** The heuristic that the economic Trinity corresponds to the immanent Trinity; Berkouwer affirms its cautionary value but resists reductionist readings.
- **Barth's reformulation:** Use of revelation as controlling category; Berkouwer appreciates Barth's corrective to natural theology while pressing for more lexical balance about divine attributes.
- **Van Til - One‑Person Language (critique):** Berkouwer critiques formulations that overemphasize unity to the point of obscuring genuine Trinitarian personhood.
- **Absolute attributes:** Attributes claimed as intrinsic and non‑relational (e.g., aseity, simplicity); Berkouwer reframes them in relation to revelation.
- **Relative attributes:** Attributes that are manifest primarily in relation (e.g., love, will, covenantal faithfulness).
- **Divine simplicity:** Treated critically; upheld in principle but not as an abstract metaphysical barrier to God's relationality.
- **Aseity:** God's self‑existence; affirmed but interpreted in light of God's gracious self‑communication.
- **Immutability:** Classical claim of God's unchangeable being; distinguished from dynamism in economic relations (God's purposes remain steadfast though God acts within history).
- **Impassibility:** Reassessed - Berkouwer resists cold stoicism about God while defending that God's suffering is not like creaturely passive suffering.
- **Ontological vs Economic distinction:** Central heuristic for Trinitarian theology; Berkouwer insists on disciplined correlation.
- **Biblical basis (OT & NT revelation):** Scripture is decisive for attributing names and actions to God; OT revelation prepares NT Trinitarian disclosure.
- **Perichoresis / Relations of origin:** Used cautiously to describe intra‑Trinitarian relations without speculative metaphysics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for reinterpreting divine attributes in light of revelation.
- As a **polemic resource** against both speculative scholasticism and reductive readings of Barth/Rahner/Van Til.
- As an **exegetical model** linking OT and NT witness to systematic claims about God.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for teaching a balanced Reformed Trinity that honors both transcendence and relational economy.
