### TITLE
A Father Who Keeps His Promises: God's Covenant Love in Scripture - Scott Hahn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Catholic biblical-theological work by a convert from Protestantism; emerges in the post-Vatican II renewal of Scripture study and renewed Catholic interest in covenantal readings.
 - Written for both lay and scholarly audiences: accessible yet grounded in canonical and historical-theological exposition; intended to correct misunderstandings between Catholic and Protestant readings of covenant.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible's central organizing reality is **God's covenantal, fatherly love**: God acts as a faithful Father who initiates, promises, and preserves a covenantal household that culminates in Christ and is embodied in the Church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of the major biblical covenants as a contiguous drama: **Adamic** (creational bond), **Noahic** (preservation of creation), **Abrahamic** (promise and election), **Mosaic** (law and covenantal form), **Davidic** (kingship and dynasty), and the **New Covenant** (fulfillment in Christ).
 - Emphasizes continuity: covenants are **promissory, familial, and gift-based**, not merely contractual or legal.
 - Argues for a typological fulfillment: Old Testament rites and institutions point forward to Christ and the sacramental life of the Church (e.g., Passover->Eucharist, circumcision->baptism).
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: the Church as the covenantal household and sacramental sign of God's faithfulness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Uses canonical exegesis and patristic/scholastic categories; engages implicitly with Protestant covenant traditions and contractarian models; dialogues with modern biblical theology that treats covenant as central.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, **covenant**, divine **fatherhood**, Christology (fulfillment of covenants), ecclesiology (Church as household), sacramental theology (baptism, Eucharist), law and grace, eschatology (consummation of promise).
- **Closing line**
 - The book's center of gravity: **God's covenantal fidelity - a Father who promises and accomplishes salvation in Christ, forming a household enacted sacramentally in the Church.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on **promissory** rather than contractual shape of biblical covenants; uses family-household language to reframe covenant as filial, corporate, and personal.
 - Marries canonical biblical theology with pastoral-sacramental application: covenants interpreted not only historically but as operative in the Church's sacraments and life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that reduce covenant to juridical contract or purely legal exchange; counters sharp discontinuity readings between Old and New Testaments by showing theological and typological continuity.
 - Contrasts with some Reformed formulations by emphasizing sacramental and ecclesial continuities (while often affirming covenantal themes that Reformed theology also upholds).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the phrase **"Father who keeps his promises"** as a theological shorthand: covenant = promise + fatherhood.
 - Uses household imagery systematically to bridge family, covenant, and Church.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Catholic catechesis and by evangelicals interested in covenantal readings; contributed to cross-confessional conversations about covenant and sacrament.
 - Popularized covenantal vocabulary in lay Catholic circles and influenced catechetical presentations of salvation history.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a teaching resource: clear organization of covenants, strong canonical sensitivity, helpful for linking biblical narrative to sacramental theology and ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - central relational structure in Scripture: divine initiative forming a people.
- **Promise (promissory covenant)** - covenant understood primarily as God's pledge; stresses unilateral divine fidelity.
- **Father / Divine fatherhood** - God's identity as covenant-making parent who founds a household.
- **Household / oikos** - the social image for covenant community and ecclesial structure.
- **Typology / fulfillment** - Old Testament rites/institutions prefigure Christ and the Church's sacraments.
- **New Covenant** - culmination of covenant promises in Christ's paschal work.
- **Law (Mosaic)** - covenantal norm that shapes the people; interpreted in light of promise and fulfillment, not as mere legalism.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist)** - visible signs in which the covenant is enacted and received; baptism parallels circumcision, Eucharist parallels Passover.
- **Davidic kingship** - promise of a messianic and enduring dynasty fulfilled in Christ.
- **Covenant vs. Contract** - contrast stressed: relational, promissory, familial vs. exchange-based, legalistic model.
- **Election / promise to Abraham** - foundation for covenantal continuity and mission.
- **Covenantal faithfulness (hesed)** - God's steadfast love and loyalty that grounds promise-keeping.
- **Canonical reading** - interpretive method that reads covenants across the Bible as a unified drama.
- **Eschatological consummation** - covenantal promises reach their telos in the Kingdom and the Church's consummation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Catholic, promissory model of covenant theology in teaching and catechesis.
 - As a **polemic/tool** against contractarian or sharp discontinuity readings of Scripture.
 - As an **exegetical model** for canonical, typological readings that connect Scripture to sacramental and ecclesial doctrine.
