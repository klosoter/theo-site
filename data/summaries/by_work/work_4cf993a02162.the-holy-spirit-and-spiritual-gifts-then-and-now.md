### TITLE
The Holy Spirit and Spiritual Gifts: Then and Now - Max Turner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century engagement (1990s) amid renewed scholarly attention to Pentecostal/charismatic movements and debates over continuity vs cessation.
 - Situated within evangelical and charismatic scholarship seeking historical-theological grounding for contemporary gifts.
 - Dialogue with patristic, Reformation, and modern theological traditions; close exegetical focus on Luke-Acts.

- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament pattern of the Spirit's activity and spiritual gifts displays substantial continuity with contemporary charismatic phenomena, but must be understood historically and theologically rather than simply replicated; neither uncritical affirmation nor wholesale cessationism is adequate.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological foundation: careful exegesis of Luke-Acts as the primary narrative-theological locus for understanding Spirit and gifts.
 - Historical theology: survey of early church, medieval, and Reformation treatments to show varied receptions and misreadings of NT practice.
 - Theological synthesis: develop a pneumatology that balances the normative, ongoing presence of gifts with the unique role of apostolic ministry and authoritative Scripture.
 - Practical corollaries: propose principles for discerning, regulating, and integrating gifts in contemporary church life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - New Testament authors (especially Luke and Paul) as primary interlocutors.
 - Patristic witnesses (selective use to show continuities and discontinuities).
 - Modern interlocutors across the spectrum: proponents of classical Pentecostal/charismatic renewal and representative cessationists (broadly including post-Reformation interpreters and some conservative evangelicals).
 - Scholarly peers in Pentecostal studies and evangelical NT scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (central): nature, personhood, and activity of the Holy Spirit.
 - Revelation and prophecy: normative limits and ecclesial function.
 - Ecclesiology: role of gifts in mission, order, and edification of the church.
 - Authority of Scripture: Scripture as normative while also accounting for noncanonical charismatic witness.
 - Trinity (implications for Spirit's role) and Christology insofar as gifts serve mission to bear witness to Christ.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Turner insists on a historically informed, theologically disciplined pneumatology that affirms ongoing charismatic life while subordinating gifts to apostolic Scripture and ecclesial order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong exegetical prioritization of Luke-Acts as the hermeneutical key to NT pneumatology.
 - Balanced mediating position: affirms continuation of gifts but argues against naive replication of first-century forms without critical discernment.
 - Attention to function (mission and edification) over mere phenomenology of spiritual experiences.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges strict cessationism that confines signs to apostolic age by arguing for theological continuity of Spirit-gifts.
 - Critiques uncritical charismatic claims that equate every contemporary phenomenon with first-century signs without contextual and canonical checks.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced distinction between "apostolic signs" (linked particularly to foundational witness and authority) and "charismatic gifts" more widely operative in the church.
 - Emphasis on "contextualized continuity": same Spirit, diverse historical expressions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Pentecostal/charismatic scholarship for rigorous exegetical defense of continuation.
 - Received by evangelical scholars as a temperate, scholarly corrective to extremes; used in debates on cessationism and ecclesial practice.
 - Influenced subsequent work that integrates historical theology with contemporary pneumatological concerns.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for combining careful NT exegesis with historical-theological reflection and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Useful for pastors and scholars navigating gift regulation, theological teaching, and ecumenical conversation about the Spirit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneumatology**
 - Comprehensive study of the Spirit; Turner anchors practical theology of gifts within robust doctrine of the Spirit's person and work.

- **Luke-Acts hermeneutic**
 - Prioritizing Luke's narrative for interpretive decisions about gifts, mission, and the role of signs.

- **Continuationism**
 - The position Turner defends in qualified form: gifts continue but within scriptural and ecclesial limits.

- **Cessationism (critique)**
 - The view Turner opposes when it denies ongoing charismatic phenomena; he critiques its historical and exegetical foundations.

- **Apostolic signs**
 - Miracles and signs connected to apostolic authority and foundational witness; treated as distinct in function from general gifts.

- **Charismatic gifts**
 - Gifts given for edification, mission, and unity of the church; intelligible beyond first-century novelties.

- **Prophecy (ecclesial function)**
 - Understood as subject to discernment and canonical testing; not equated with Scripture but as subordinate, edifying word.

- **Glossolalia vs. tongues as prayer/mission**
 - Distinguishes forms and functions; avoids simplistic equivalence of modern glossolalia with NT tongues.

- **Missional context**
 - Gifts are fundamentally missionary and communal, not merely private experiences.

- **Canonical normativity**
 - Scripture remains the controlling norm; charismatic data must be tested against apostolic witness.

- **Discernment and order**
 - Institutional and pastoral mechanisms required for healthy use of gifts.

- **Historical theology**
 - Uses church history to check present practice, showing both continuity and change.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for continuity models of pneumatology and refined vocabularies distinguishing types of gifts.
- As a **polemic** against strict cessationism and against uncritical charismatic excess.
- As an **exegetical model** that privileges Luke-Acts for theological reconstruction of Spirit and gifts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: integrates NT exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral practice for ecclesial guidance.
