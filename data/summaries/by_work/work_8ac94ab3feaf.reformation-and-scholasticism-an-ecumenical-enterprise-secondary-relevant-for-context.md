### TITLE
Reformation and Scholasticism: An Ecumenical Enterprise - Francis Turretin (Institutes; representative of 17th‑century Reformed scholasticism) 
Focus: **Self‑Attestation and Authority of Scripture**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑17th century Reformed scholastic milieu; Turretin (1623-1687) writes within the theological academy of Geneva and the broader post‑Reformation confessional debates.
 - Intellectual horizon: synthesis of Calvinian confessions with scholastic method; polemics against Roman Catholic magisterial claims, Remonstrant/Arminian nuance, and Socinian denial of supernatural revelation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How does Scripture establish its own divine authority in a world of competing authorities (church, reason, tradition)? Turretin argues for Scripture's **inherent certitude**, grounded in divine origin and internally witnessed by the Spirit, while not denying legitimate external marks.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture possesses **infallible authority** because it is God's revelation; this authority is known both by:
 - **Internal testimony** - the Holy Spirit, working in the believer's heart, grants a convincing inward certitude that Scripture is God's word (this is not mere subjective feeling but a real divine attestation).
 - **External evidences** - miracles, fulfilled prophecy, unity and holiness of message, and historical continuity support the claim but are secondary to the internal attestation.
 - Major moves:
 - Distinguish authority (that Scripture must be obeyed) from canonicity (what books belong) and perspicuity (sufficient clarity for salvation).
 - Defend the self‑attesting nature of Scripture against claims that ecclesial magisterium or natural reason confers final authority.
 - Affirm the necessity of the Spirit for true assent while maintaining that Scripture's words themselves carry objective divine authority accessible to ordinary believers.
 - Method: scholastic distinctions and syllogistic proofs; heavy use of patristic and Reformation sources with engagement of contemporary Jesuit and Arminian objections.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on **Calvinian** epistemology and magisterial Reformed confessions; converses indirectly with **Bellarmine** and Jesuit defenses of ecclesiastical authority, with Remonstrants (Arminians) on assurance and with Socinians on revelation.
 - Uses Scripture, Augustine, and Reformation polemical literature as primary supports.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special), inspiration, canonicity, infallibility, perspicuity, sufficiency of Scripture, role of the Holy Spirit in certifying truth, and the relation of reason and faith.

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin centers theology on a **Scripture that is objectively divine and subjectively witnessed**: its authority is both self‑grounded in divine origin and efficaciously attested by the Spirit, not reducible to ecclesiastical pronouncement or unaided reason.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear linking of scholastic rigor with Reformed pastoral assurance: careful technical distinctions aimed to secure practical assurance of Scripture's authority for believers.
 - Persistent stress that internal testimony of the Spirit provides certitude needed for assent without making Scripture's authority private or arbitrary.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Roman Catholicism: rejects the claim that the Church's magisterium is the ultimate authorizing interpreter; places final authority in the written Word with the Spirit's witness.
 - Against purely rationalist or evidentialist approaches: external proofs are helpful but insufficient - require the Spirit for true conviction.
 - Against subjectivist fideism: maintains objective propositional content and public norms for doctrine.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic articulation of the interplay between **self‑attestation** (Scripture as its own authority) and **internal testimony** (Spirit's work) within a scholastic theological framework.
 - Precise terminological separation of certitude (assensus) from mere probability.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential within later Reformed scholastic and Princetonian circles; used as a standard for orthodox Reformed teaching on Scripture.
 - Provided a bridge between Reformation sola scriptura and subsequent confessional apologetics; referenced in debates about authority and the role of the Spirit.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for defending Scripture's authority that is simultaneously doctrinal, pastoral, and apologetic; still valuable for teaching on assurance and the epistemology of revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self‑attestation (testimonium scripturae)** - The claim that Scripture carries within itself the mark of divine origin, requiring the Spirit to make that mark efficacious for faith.
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit (testimonium Spiritus internum)** - The Spirit's inward witness that generates certitude and assent in the believer.
- **External evidences** - Miracles, fulfilled prophecy, historical consistency; supportive but subordinate to internal attestation.
- **Infallibility** - Scripture cannot err in its teaching on faith and practice; connected to divine authorship.
- **Perspicuity (clarity)** - Scripture's sufficiency and clarity for salvation and obedient life; not every passage equally clear but sufficient for core doctrine.
- **Canonicity** - How books are recognized as Scripture; argued from apostolicity, antiquity, and divine effects.
- **Authority (auctoritas)** - Normative, binding force of Scripture over church and conscience; opposed to magisterial supremacy.
- **Certitude (certitudo)** - The assured conviction produced by the Spirit; distinguished from mere moral persuasion or probability.
- **Revelation (revelatio specialis)** - God's disclosed truths in Scripture, distinct from general revelation.
- **Sufficiency** - Scripture contains all necessary truth for salvation and godly living.
- **Magisterium (ecclesiastical authority)** - Church teaching authority; Turretin denies finality of magisterium over Scripture.
- **Assent (assensus)** - The believer's intellectual and volitional acceptance of Scripture's truth as mediated by the Spirit.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed positions on self‑attestation and the Spirit's role in certifying Scripture.
- As a **polemic** against Roman Catholic appeals to magisterial authority and against rationalist reductions.
- As an **exegetical/epistemological model** in teaching assurance, canonicity, and the relation of internal and external evidences.
