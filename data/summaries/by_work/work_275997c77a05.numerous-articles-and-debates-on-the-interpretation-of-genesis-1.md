### TITLE
Numerous articles and debates on the interpretation of Genesis 1 - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th - early 21st century analytic-evangelical milieu; Craig is an analytic philosopher and Christian apologist engaging both scholarly and popular audiences (journals, edited volumes, debates, public lectures).
 - Conversation occurs against rising tension between historicist readings of Genesis and scientific accounts (big bang cosmology, evolutionary biology), and amid competing hermeneutical proposals (literal/24-hour, day-age, framework, functional/temple reading).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How should the "days" of Genesis 1 be understood theologically and exegetically in light of biblical revelation and modern science? Underlying this is the doctrinal commitment to God as Creator (creatio ex nihilo), the temporal beginning of the universe, and the authority of Scripture.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Philosophical foundation: Craig's Kalam cosmological argument argues for a temporal beginning of the universe; a beginning grounds the plausibility of divine creation ex nihilo and underwrites the theological plausibility of a historical creative act as narrated in Genesis 1.
 - Exegetical moves:
 - Insists Genesis 1 presents a sequence of creative acts demarcated by "evening and morning," which prima facie reads as successive, ordinary days.
 - Argues that alternative readings (framework, day-age, analogical) often either downplay the text's grammatical-historical cues or import extra-biblical assumptions.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Stresses God as agent causa prima and sustainer; divine action is compatible with scientific descriptions but not reducible to them.
 - Positions biblical description as testimonial to God's sovereign temporally-bounded creative activity, even when precise mechanism and chronology remain philosophically and scientifically informed.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts with contemporary interpreters and scientists: John H. Walton (functional/temple reading), day-age proponents (e.g., Hugh Ross), young-earth creationists (e.g., Henry Morris), theistic evolutionists, and scientific interlocutors (cosmologists regarding the universe's beginning).
 - Draws on Augustine, patristic and medieval discussions of creation, and modern analytic metaphysics on time and causation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical authority; creation ex nihilo; divine timelessness/temporality and providence; the interface of theology and natural science; teleology and the imago Dei implicitly implicated in creation order discussions.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig's contribution: an analytically disciplined defense that Genesis 1 testifies to a real, temporal divine creation (grounded in theism and Kalam) and that debates about the "days" must be resolved by careful biblical exegesis informed, but not governed, by natural science.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses the Kalam cosmological argument as a theological-exegetical foundation: the philosophical claim that the universe began bolsters the plausibility of a historical reading of Genesis.
 - Emphasizes metaphysical notions of divine causation and sustaining action to bridge scripture and science without assimilating theological doctrine to scientific models.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Walton-style functional/temple readings by insisting on the grammatical-historical force of "evening and morning" and the narrative sequence.
 - Distinguishes his approach from both young-earth literalists (by allowing careful engagement with cosmological data) and from theistic evolutionists (by resisting reducing Genesis to mere theological reflection only).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrates analytic metaphysical tools (arguments about causation, modality, temporal beginnings) into exegetical debate; reframes "days" discussion as not merely exegetical but metaphysical-theological.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical apologetics and philosophy of religion; serves as a model for integrating philosophical argumentation with scriptural interpretation.
 - Less catalytic in mainstream academic Old Testament scholarship, where historical-critical and literary approaches (e.g., Walton) are often dominant.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear, philosophically rigorous template for students who wish to defend a historically grounded theistic reading of Genesis while taking scientific claims seriously.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kalam cosmological argument** - philosophical argument for a beginning of the universe (used to ground plausibility of creation as a temporal event).
- **Creation ex nihilo** - God as creator from nothing; central theological presupposition in Craig's synthesis.
- **Temporal beginning** - the claim that the universe had a beginning in time; used to connect cosmology to Genesis' historical claims.
- **Evening and morning formula** - grammatical marker in Genesis 1 Craig treats as prima facie evidence of successive days.
- **Literal/24-hour day view** - reading that days are ordinary solar days; Craig often defends this as the straightforward sense unless strong exegetical reasons exist otherwise.
- **Framework hypothesis** - non-sequential, literary reading; Craig critiques it for understating narrative indicators of sequence.
- **Analogical/functional readings** - approaches that interpret "day" analogically or functionally; Craig allows theological legibility but warns against abandoning historical referentiality.
- **Divine causation/sustaining action** - metaphysical categories Craig uses to relate God's creative acts to ongoing natural processes.
- **Authority of Scripture** - methodological constraint: exegesis must respect historical-grammatical cues, not be reshaped primarily to fit scientific paradigms.
- **Compatibility vs. Conflation** - principle that theological claims and scientific theories may be compatible without conflation; used to caution against reducing Genesis to scientific report.
- **Teleology** - purposive ordering inherent in creation narrative; underwrites theological readings of the "days."
- **Imago Dei implications** - implicit anthropological consequences of creation order that Craig remarks upon in broader works.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: appeals to Craig for a philosophically grounded definition of "creation" and "beginning."
 - Polemic: deployed against naturalistic and some theistic-evolution readings as a philosophical-exegetical challenge.
 - Exegetical model: used by analytic theologians and pastors as a disciplined method combining grammatical-historical exegesis with metaphysical argumentation.
