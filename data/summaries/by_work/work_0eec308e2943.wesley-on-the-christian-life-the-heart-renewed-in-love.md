### TITLE
**Wesley on the Christian Life: The Heart Renewed in Love** - Fred Sanders

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 18th-century Anglican Evangelical Revival; Methodist societies within English church life.
 - Wesleyan Arminian soteriology; practical divinity shaped by Scripture, liturgy, and mission.
 - Crossway, Theologians on the Christian Life series; Sanders writes as a trinitarian theologian interpreting Wesley pastorally.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life is the Spirit-wrought renewal of the heart in holy love, grounded in the triune God, ordered by the means of grace, and aimed at Christian perfection understood as perfect love.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Wesley s evangelical conversion and assurance as pattern for life in Christ.
 - Grace in its modalities: **prevenient**, **convincing**, **justifying**, **sanctifying**.
 - **New birth** and the reordering of the affections.
 - **Christian perfection**: purity of love, not sinless omniscience or impeccability.
 - **Means of grace**: Word, sacrament, prayer, fellowship; methodical discipleship.
 - **Community practices**: societies, class meetings, bands; accountability and mission.
 - Trinitarian frame: the Father s purpose, the Son s redemption, the Spirit s indwelling and perfecting.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - John and Charles Wesley; Anglican Articles and Homilies; Moravian influence; earlier Arminian debates; Eastern sapiential themes (love and participation) without speculative metaphysics.
 - Calvinist interlocutors (e.g., Whitefield) and antinomian/quietist rivals; modern interpreters of Wesley.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Scripture and authority; Trinity and inseparable operations; Christology and atonement; Pneumatology and assurance; ordo salutis; ecclesial discipline; sacraments as means of grace; ethics of mercy and piety.
- **Closing line**
 - The heart renewed in love is the Spirit s gift through Christ from the Father, forming a holy people whose life is ordered by grace toward perfect love.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Holiness as love: teleological and affective, not merely behavioral.
 - Assurance as the Spirit s witness, anchoring both repentance and confident obedience.
 - Methodical practices as evangelical, not legalistic: means of grace as God s appointed channels.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against quietism: sanctification is active cooperation post-justification, not passivity.
 - Against moralism: the initiative is divine; the means serve grace, they do not generate it.
 - Against caricatures of perfectionism: perfection is mature charity, not sinlessness or freedom from creaturely limitation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Sanders s trinitarian re-framing: Wesley as a theologian whose practical divinity is implicitly trinitarian in structure and aim.
 - Clarifies the distinction and sequence of justification and sanctification without separating them.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Bridges Wesleyan holiness with broader evangelical and Reformed readership by careful doctrinal mapping.
 - Used in seminary curricula for spirituality, sanctification, and pastoral theology; rehabilitates Wesley in doctrinally cautious contexts.
- **Enduring value**
 - A lucid map for teaching holiness; a constructive retrieval of means of grace; a model of integrating doctrine, devotion, and discipline under a trinitarian horizon.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prevenient grace**: Universal divine initiative enabling repentance and faith; guards against Pelagianism.
- **Convincing grace**: Spirit s work of awakening and repentance preceding justifying faith.
- **Justification**: Forgiveness and acceptance for Christ s sake; distinct from yet inseparable from renewal.
- **New birth (regeneration)**: Transformation of affections and habits; entrance into holy living.
- **Sanctification**: Progressive and sometimes crisis-deepened growth in holiness post-justification.
- **Christian perfection (entire sanctification)**: Perfect love to God and neighbor; purity of intention; not freedom from creaturely weakness or error.
 - Instantaneous reception and gradual maturation are held together.
- **Assurance**: The Spirit s direct and indirect witness giving confidence of adoption.
- **Means of grace**: Word, sacrament, prayer, fasting, fellowship; instituted instruments by which God conveys grace.
- **Works of piety and works of mercy**: Twin disciplines forming the holy life inwardly and outwardly.
- **Class meetings and bands**: Structured accountability fostering repentance, growth, and mission.
- **Triune economy**: The Father purposes salvation, the Son accomplishes redemption, the Spirit applies and perfects; inseparable yet personally appropriated operations.
- **Participation/communion**: Sharing, by grace, in the love and life of God; analogical participation that preserves Creator-creature distinction.
- **Anglican anchorage**: Articles, liturgy, and homilies as a doctrinal and devotional substrate for Methodist practice.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique**: Sanders s portrayal of distinct missions of Son and Spirit in sanctification provides a concrete, pastoral counterweight to monadic one person formulations, highlighting three-personal agency in the economy.
 - **Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation**: Wesley s practical trinitarianism, as presented here, exemplifies that the economic missions reveal the triune God while Sanders maintains taxis and Creator-creature distinction, echoing Barth s caution against collapse.
 - **Biblical Basis Ot And Nt Revelation Of The Trinity**: Draws on Wesley s sermons and hymns to trace OT holiness-love fulfilled in NT Father-Son-Spirit missions, serving as an accessible exegetical model.
 - **Ontological vs Economic Trinity**: Clarifies that economic sanctification presupposes, but does not exhaust, God s immanent triune life; Christian perfection is participatory, not identificatory.
