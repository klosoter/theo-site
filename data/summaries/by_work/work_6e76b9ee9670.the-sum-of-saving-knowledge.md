### TITLE
**The Sum of Saving Knowledge** (often appended to the Westminster Standards; commonly attributed to David Dickson and James Durham, Scotland, c. 1650)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-17th-century Scottish Presbyterianism, immediately post-Westminster Assembly. Printed with the Confession and Catechisms as a concise, pastoral digest of Reformed orthodoxy. Aimed at catechesis and assurance amid controversies with Roman Catholicism, Arminianism, Socinianism, and antinomian tendencies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To set forth, from Scripture, the covenantal way of salvation in Christ and its practical application to conscience, including warrant to believe and marks of true grace, so that the troubled or presumptuous soul might be guided safely to Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **1) Our ruin in Adam:** Fall, total inability, guilt and corruption under the covenant of works.
 - **2) Remedy in Christ:** The covenant of redemption planned by the Trinity, executed by Christ the Mediator; the covenant of grace revealed and offered.
 - **3) Application by the Spirit:** Effectual calling, union with Christ, justification by imputed righteousness, adoption, sanctification, perseverance; the role of Word and sacraments.
 - **4) Evidences and use:** Warrant to believe the gospel; rules to discern a saving interest; encouragements to assurance; exhortations to new obedience and preparation for judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Deeply scriptural; harmonized with the Westminster Confession and Catechisms. Resonates with British federal divinity (e.g., Rollock, Rutherford; English Puritan casuistry such as Perkins). Opposes Arminian synergism, Socinian denials of Trinity/atonement, Roman sacramentalism, and antinomian lawlessness.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Bibliology** (sufficiency of Scripture), **Theology Proper** (decree, covenant of redemption), **Anthropology/Hamartiology** (original sin), **Christology** (mediatorship, threefold office, satisfaction), **Soteriology** (ordo salutis, faith/repentance, assurance), **Covenant Theology** (works and grace), **Eschatology** (judgment, two estates), and pastoral casuistry.
- **Closing line:** Its center of gravity is the free, covenantal offer of Christ to sinners with a sure Scriptural warrant and the Spirit's application, producing assured, obedient holiness unto glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Fourfold movement:** ruin, remedy, application, evidences.
 - **Warrants to believe:** divine command, promise, invitation, and testimony concerning the Son; designed to quell unbelieving scruples.
 - **Marks of saving interest:** experiential diagnostics balancing comfort and caution.
 - **Covenantal spine:** works, redemption, and grace coherently coordinated.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **legalism/neonomianism:** insists on justification by imputed righteousness, not works.
 - Against **antinomianism:** asserts abiding use of the moral law for gratitude and guidance.
 - Against **Arminianism:** affirms effectual calling and perseverance.
 - Against **Socinianism:** upholds Trinity and penal satisfaction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Consolidates and popularizes **warrant to believe** language within a confessional frame.
 - Clear practical taxonomy of **marks** for self-examination without eclipsing Christ's sufficiency.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely printed with the Westminster Standards in Scotland; formative for Presbyterian catechesis and piety.
 - Shaped later Reformed pastoral literature on assurance and the free offer; echoed in Guthrie's and Boston's emphases.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A compact bridge between doctrinal system and pastoral application.
 - A classroom-ready map of Reformed federal soteriology and experiential religion.
