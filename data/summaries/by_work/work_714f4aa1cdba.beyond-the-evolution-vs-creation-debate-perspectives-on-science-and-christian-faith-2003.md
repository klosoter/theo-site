### TITLE
Beyond the "Evolution" vs. "Creation" Debate (Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, 2003) 
Author: Denis O. Lamoureux

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical engagement with mainstream biology, rising Intelligent Design movement, and persistent Young Earth Creationism. Published in a professional journal aimed at Christian scientists and pastors seeking integration of faith and science.
- **Central thesis**
 - The opposition framed as "Evolution vs. Creation" is a false dichotomy. A coherent Christian position accepts mainstream evolutionary science while upholding biblical faith - what Lamoureux terms **evolutionary creation**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary conflict stems from literalistic readings of Genesis and category confusions between methodological naturalism (a science rule) and philosophical naturalism (a worldview).
 - Hermeneutical move: Genesis must be read according to its genre and ancient Near Eastern context; Scripture speaks theological truth using various literary forms rather than modern scientific categories.
 - Scientific move: Evolutionary theory (common descent, natural selection, deep time) is well-attested by multiple independent lines of evidence and should be accepted as the best scientific account of biological origins.
 - Theological synthesis: Core doctrines (creation ex nihilo, providence, imago Dei, fall, redemption) can and should be preserved within an evolutionary framework by distinguishing theological meaning from scientific mechanism.
 - Pastoral/practical move: Christians should avoid apologetics that make faith hostage to specific scientific claims and instead cultivate doctrines of accommodation, analogy, and theological humility.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Targets: Young Earth Creationists and some Intelligent Design proponents (as movements), who promote literalistic Genesis concordism or invoke supernatural gaps.
 - Resources: Patristic and medieval models of non-literal interpretation (e.g., Augustine), contemporary scientists and theologians advocating integration.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical interpretation (genre, inerrancy, accommodation)
 - Creation (ex nihilo, providence, teleology)
 - Anthropology (imago Dei)
 - Sin and the Fall (problem of death and suffering)
 - Implicitly touches covenantal/pastoral theology by reframing apologetics
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Faithful Christian theology does not require rejection of evolutionary science; rather, a theologically informed hermeneutic that reads Genesis non-concordantly preserves core Christian convictions while accepting scientific description of biological origins.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong promotion of the label **evolutionary creation** to signal a theologically centered acceptance of evolution (as opposed to secular "evolutionism").
 - Clear separation of methodological naturalism as a legitimate scientific method from philosophical naturalism as a philosophical alternative, defending the use of methodological naturalism in Christian science.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects literalist/concordist readings of Genesis that force Scripture into modern scientific categories.
 - Contrasts with both Young Earth Creationism (on chronology/empirical claims) and some ID rhetoric (on invoking supernatural intervention as scientific explanation).
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasting the debate from "who wins empirically" to "how do we properly read Scripture and do science together" - shifts the locus from empirical refutation to hermeneutical and theological integration.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking reconciliation of faith and mainstream science; cited in pastoral and academic curricula as a clear model for evolutionary creation.
 - Criticized by literalist and ID-aligned communities; treated cautiously in conservative Reformed circles but adopted by many moderate/mainline evangelicals.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, pastorally sensitive framework for teaching, preaching, and apologetics that preserves doctrinal essentials while accepting scientific consensus.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evolutionary creation**
 - Lamoureux's preferred term: God as creator working through evolution; preserves divine agency while affirming scientific mechanisms.
- **Theistic evolution**
 - Synonymous in broad use but Lamoureux prefers evolutionary creation to avoid secular connotations.
- **Methodological naturalism**
 - Science's disciplined recourse to natural explanations; defended as compatible with Christian theism.
- **Philosophical naturalism**
 - Metaphysical claim that nature is all there is; rejected by Lamoureux as a worldview distinct from scientific method.
- **Concordism**
 - Attempt to make Scripture and modern science match point-for-point; criticized as a hermeneutical error.
- **Non-concordist / genre-aware hermeneutic**
 - Reading Genesis according to ancient literary forms and theological intent rather than as modern scientific reportage.
- **Accommodation (of revelation)**
 - Divine condescension in Scripture's use of human categories; used to justify non-literal elements in Genesis.
- **Origin science vs. operation science**
 - Distinction often used to separate historical/unique events (origins) from repeatable laboratory science (operations); Lamoureux acknowledges the limits of historical inference but affirms strong evidential support for evolution.
- **Death before the Fall**
 - Addressed as a theological tension: Lamoureux argues biological death predates humans historically while the theological meaning of death as consequence of sin remains intact.
- **Imago Dei in evolutionary framework**
 - Maintains human uniqueness and vocation without requiring a discontinuity in biological ancestry.
- **Inerrancy reinterpreted**
 - Advocates a view of biblical truth that allows for non-literal forms while retaining doctrinal reliability.
- **Two-books metaphor**
 - Creation (Book of Works) and Scripture (Book of Word) as complementary sources of truth; used to argue for mutual correction and integration.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for the evolutionary creation position in evangelical scholarship.
 - As a **polemic** against literalist/concordist creationism and certain strands of Intelligent Design.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis non-concordantly in theological education.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of doctrine of revelation, creation, and the relationship between science and theology.
