### TITLE
Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton Seminary milieu; conservative Reformed response to German higher criticism and American theological liberalism.
 - Warfield writing as an academic apologist: rigorous historical-exegetical work married to scholastic systematic reflection; published across The Princeton Theological Review.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A sustained defense and articulation of classical Reformed orthodoxy: the authority and inerrancy of Scripture, historicity of key biblical events (notably Adam), federal covenant structure (Covenant of Works/Grace), and a scientifically rigorous method for theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Empirical-exegetical claims to defend biblical historicity (e.g., Adam) against allegorizing or critical reduction.
 - Systematic articulation of covenant theology: federal headship and the legal-ethical logic of Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace.
 - Methodological essaying on theology as a disciplined science (principia): theology has rules, data (Scripture, tradition), and legitimate methods.
 - Doctrinal applications: Christology (treatment of personhood language), pneumatology (Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection), bibliology (canon and tradition), and eschatology (new heavens/new earth).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicitly addressed German critical scholars and American liberals; converses with Reformed confessional tradition and post-Reformation scholastics; engages contemporary methodological debates (e.g., formulations later associated with Van Til).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and bibliology (inspiration, canon, tradition)
 - Covenant theology (Covenant of Works, federal headship)
 - Christology (person and natures language; critique of imprecise "one person" locutions)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit in Christ's resurrection and mediatorial work)
 - Eschatology (new heavens and new earth)
 - Theological method (theology as principled science; relation of biblical and systematic theology)
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's articles aim to integrate rigorous exegesis and confessional systematicism so that biblical authority, covenantal structure, and disciplined theological method form the governing center of Reformed apologetics and doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that theology is a disciplined, scientific enterprise grounded in Scripture and qualified by historical theology - not mere speculation or subjective piety.
 - Firm defense of the historicity of Adam as necessary to the coherence of original sin and federal headship.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal tendencies to reduce doctrines to moral lessons or myth; opposes excessive relativizing of Scripture by higher criticism.
 - Pushes back on vague person-language in Christology; insists precise locus-classical categories (person/nature) are crucial for orthodox Christology.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasting of covenantal categories with legal and representative clarity for polemical use against modern exegetical trends.
 - Emphasis on "theology as science" (principia) to legitimize systematic theology's epistemic claims in academic debate.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in 20th-century conservative Reformed circles; foundational for later defenses of inerrancy, covenant theology, and the Princeton approach.
 - Informs subsequent debates (mid-20th century) over method and language in Reformed apologetics (including later critiques and developments in Van Tilian and neo-Calvinist schools).
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for combining tight exegesis with systematic clarity; durable resource for bibliology, covenantal formulations, and methodology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy / Inspiration** - Scripture as divinely authoritative and reliable in its claims; basis for theological method.
- **Covenant of Works** - Prelapsarian legal covenant between God and Adam; central to Warfield's account of sin and federal theology.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam as representative; explains original sin and guilt distribution.
- **Historicity of Adam** - Defense of Adam's real, historical personhood as non-negotiable for orthodox soteriology.
- **Theology as Science (Principia)** - Theology governed by principles, data, and method; legitimizes systematic theology academically.
- **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology** - Distinction and interplay: biblical theology supplies historical data; systematic theology orders and defends doctrine.
- **Canon and Tradition** - Canon's normative role upheld; tradition occupies a subordinate, interpretive role without supplanting Scripture.
- **Christological Person-language** - Caution against imprecise "one person" locutions; insistence on orthodox formulations preserving both unity and distinction.
- **Pneumatology: Spirit in Resurrection** - Role of the Spirit in Christ's life, death, and resurrection emphasized for soteriological coherence.
- **New Heavens and New Earth** - Eschatological continuity and consummation; not purely spiritualized but bodily and cosmic.
- **Exegetical model** - Close historical-grammatical exegesis informing doctrinal construction.
- **Polemic orientation** - Use of articles to counter modernist critiques and to supply apologetic benchmarks.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for conservative **bibliology** and the doctrine of Scripture.
 - As a polemical and conceptual pivot in **soteriology/covenant theology** (Covenant of Works; federal headship).
 - As an exegetical-model resource in **pneumatology** and **Christology**, demonstrating integration of exegesis and systematic precision.
