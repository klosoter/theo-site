### TITLE
**An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology - Thomas McCall**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary (early 21st century) revival of analytic theology within Anglo-American theology and philosophy of religion; aimed especially at evangelical and Reformed audiences who seek rigorous engagement between systematic theology and analytic philosophy. Positioned as an introductory but constructive text for students and pastors as well as philosophers.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Analytic methods (clarity, logical argumentation, conceptual modeling) are legitimate and indispensable tools for doing Christian theology well; they can and should be integrated with confessional fidelity to produce clearer, more defensible doctrines.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Articulates what "analytic Christian theology" is and defends its legitimacy against caricatures (reduction to apologetics or cold armchair philosophy). 
 - Establishes methodological principles: charity to tradition, attention to biblical witness, precision in conceptual claims, and willingness to revise non-essential formulations. 
 - Demonstrates the method by addressing central loci (God, Trinity, Christology, atonement, providence, human nature, sin, salvation, revelation, eschatology) using analytic tools to clarify, diagnose problems, and propose constructive formulations. 
 - Argues for a conversational posture: analytic theology converses with biblical studies, historical theology, and pastoral concerns without replacing them.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Draws on the analytic philosophy of religion (broadly: Plantinga, Swinburne, Lewisian-style clarity) and engages systematic theology representatives from the Reformed / evangelical tradition. 
 - Dialogues with contemporary defenders and critics of analytic theology, and with historical doctrinal commitments (creeds, classical Christology, classical theism).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Revelation, doctrine of God (including attributes and divine simplicity), Trinity, Christology (incarnation, two natures), atonement, providence and divine action, human nature and sin, salvation (soteriology), prayer and religious language, and eschatology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 Analytic Christian theology is an integrated, disciplined method that preserves confessional commitments while employing philosophical clarity to make Christian doctrine intelligible, defensible, and pastorally useful.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Stresses constructive application of analytic tools to traditional doctrines rather than merely critiquing or apologizing for them. 
 - Prioritizes a balance of *fidelity* (to Scripture and tradition) and *clarity* (philosophical rigor).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against caricatures that present analytic theology as coldly rationalistic or as an apologetic stunt; insists it can be theologically robust and pastorally sensitive. 
 - Contrasts with purely historical or exegetical theology by foregrounding systematic conceptual analysis; contrasts with continental or postmodern approaches by favoring propositional clarity and argumentation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Advocates for modular doctrinal modeling: treat doctrines as interacting but analytically separable systems amenable to precision and revision. 
 - Emphasizes methodological criteria (e.g., coherence, biblical fidelity, explanatory power, pastoral fruitfulness) as evaluative tools for doctrinal proposals.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used as an accessible introduction to analytic theology in evangelical seminaries; respected for bridging academic philosophy and confessional concerns. 
 - Influential among students entering analytic theology and among pastors seeking philosophically informed doctrinal resources.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a clear methodological primer and a catalog of worked examples showing how analytic tools clarify and defend doctrines. 
 - Useful as a syllabus anchor for courses on philosophical theology, systematic theology method, and interdisciplinary theological work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analytic theology:** Use of analytic-philosophical methods (conceptual clarity, formal argument, model construction) in systematic Christian theology. 
- **Constructive theology:** Positive formulation of doctrines using tools of philosophy, not merely critique or historical description. 
- **Methodological fidelity:** Principle requiring proposals to be accountable to Scripture and historic Christian commitments. 
- **Doctrinal modeling:** Treating doctrines as models or systems that can be precisely articulated and tested for coherence. 
- **Philosophical theology:** The overlap of metaphysics, epistemology, and theological claims concerning God, action, and attributes. 
- **Divine action / providence:** Analytic approaches to how God acts in the world (concurrence, secondary causation, miracles) with attention to metaphysical constraints. 
- **Revelation (epistemic role):** Analysis of propositional content, witness, and epistemic warrant for belief; integration of revelation with apologetic reasoning. 
- **Trinity (conceptual clarity):** Use of analytic distinctions to preserve monotheism and genuineness of three-person relata without modalist collapse. 
- **Christology (two natures):** Analytic resources for resolving puzzles about identity, union, and action in the incarnate Christ. 
- **Atonement (models):** Evaluation of substitutionary, moral influence, and Christus Victor motifs with attention to explanatory virtues. 
- **Theological criteria:** Coherence, biblical fidelity, explanatory scope, parsimony, pastoral fruitfulness as measures of adequacy. 
- **Modularity:** Treating doctrinal loci as interdependent but isolable for analytic work. 
- **Confessional constraints:** How creeds and historic formulations guide acceptable revision and innovation.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **methodological definition source** for courses introducing analytic theology and its aims. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about how philosophy should inform systematic theology (used to justify analytic engagement). 
 - As a **pedagogical exemplar** offering worked analytic treatments of core doctrines for classroom and sermon-shaping contexts.
