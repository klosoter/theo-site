### TITLE
Heaven: Not Just an Eternal Day Off - Anthony Hoekema (Christianity Today, 1980)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in Christianity Today during the late-20th-century evangelical resurgence. Hoekema writes as a Reformed evangelical scholar addressing a popular audience amid pietistic and dispensational views of the afterlife prevalent in US evangelicalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Heaven is not merely an escape or perpetual leisure; biblical eschatology centers on the **new heavens and new earth** - a renewed, embodied creation where God dwells with redeemed humans. Hoekema corrects tendencies that privatize or spiritualize the afterlife.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critique of common popular imaginings of heaven as purely nonmaterial rest or unending worship detached from creation.
 - Exegetical appeal to key biblical texts (Revelation 21-22; Romans 8; 1 Corinthians 15) to show continuity between present creation and eschatological consummation.
 - Theological construction: bodily resurrection + cosmic renewal = eternal life in a restored creation rather than disembodied souls in a purely spiritual heaven.
 - Practical implications: eschatological hope reorients Christian ethics, mission, and stewardship of creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture is primary; implicitly engages Platonic dualism, pietistic otherworldliness, and dispensational rapture-escapism. Draws on Reformed tradition and contemporary evangelical scholarship on eschatology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (new heavens/new earth), Christology (consummation in Christ), anthropology (resurrection and corporeality), creation and providence, sanctification and covenantal continuity.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Heaven is not an otherworldly vacation but the final inauguration of God's reign in a renewed, embodied cosmos where redeemed humanity lives under Christ - a hope that grounds mission and re-frames ethics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **creation continuity**: the eschaton repairs and fulfills creation rather than obliterating it.
 - Rejection of disembodied immortality in favor of **bodily resurrection** as normative Christian hope.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects pietistic and popular escapism that removes ethical urgency from this life.
 - Counters Platonic dualism that denigrates material creation; contrasts with dispensational schemes that separate heaven and earth temporally and spatially.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popular reframing of "heaven" to mean the consummated **new earth** - shifting the locus of eternal life from ethereal skies to renewed creation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical popular circles as a corrective, reinforcing Reformed eschatology in pulpits and classrooms.
 - Appreciated for pastoral clarity rather than for novel academic claim; contributed to broader late-20th-century evangelical recovery of creation-oriented eschatology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, concise corrective to common misconceptions; reliable introductory exposition linking biblical exegesis to practical Christian living.
 - Valuable as a pastoral and pedagogical tool to reorient congregations toward embodied hope and ecological responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New heavens and new earth:** The biblically promised renewal of creation where God dwells with humanity; the proper focus of Christian hope.
- **Heaven (reframed):** Not merely a disembodied realm of rest, but the consummated renewed creation.
- **Resurrection body:** Continuity and transformation of embodied life; denies pure immaterial survival.
- **Consummation:** The final fulfillment of God's redemptive purposes in Christ that transforms creation.
- **Intermediate state:** Distinct from the final state; Hoekema implies temporary presence with Christ pending bodily resurrection.
- **Continuity of creation:** Theological claim that God's redemptive plan culminates in renewal, not annihilation or mere replacement.
- **Anti-escapism:** Ethical and pastoral polemic against treating heaven as an escape from social/creation responsibilities.
- **Cosmic redemption:** Redemption applied to whole creation, not only individual souls.
- **Eschatological hope:** Future-oriented assurance that shapes present ethics and mission.
- **Kingdom of God (eschatological sense):** God's reign consummated in the renewed creation rather than exclusively a spiritual domain.
- **Bodily ontology:** Anthropological stance that human personhood is embodied and destined for embodied renewal.
- **Pastoral application:** Practical exhortation to live missionally and steward creation in light of future renewal.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for the evangelical reframe of "heaven" toward new earth theology.
 - As a **polemic** against escapist and Platonic conceptions of the afterlife in popular Christian teaching.
 - As a compact **exegetical model** pointing readers to Romans 8, 1 Corinthians 15, and Revelation 21-22 for embodied eschatology.
