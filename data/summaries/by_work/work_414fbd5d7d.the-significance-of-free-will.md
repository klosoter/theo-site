### TITLE
The Significance of Free Will - Robert Kane

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of action and moral responsibility; Kane writes within the resurgence of libertarianism against dominant compatibilist accounts (1970s-1990s).
 - Engages contemporary debates about agency, moral praise/blame, and implications of indeterminism for responsibility.

- **Central thesis**
 - Human moral responsibility requires **libertarian free will**: genuine alternative possibilities grounded in the agent as ultimate source. Determinism undermines ultimate responsibility (UR); indeterminism, properly located in decision-making, can secure UR.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of compatibilism: compatibilist analyses (ability-to-do-other-things under same causal history; hierarchical models) fail to secure **ultimate sourcehood** - they make the agent's actions products of prior states, not the agent as originator.
 - Introduces **Ultimate Responsibility (UR)** as the desideratum: the agent must be the ultimate originator of actions in a non-trivial sense.
 - Develops **Self-Forming Actions (SFAs)**: indeterministic, often difficult or "torn" decisions in which agents exercise effort to form character. SFAs:
 - Occur in formative conflicts among competing motivations.
 - Are causally indeterminate in particular ways, yet are attributable to the agent.
 - Create the agent's settled character dispositions; later actions can be determined by those dispositions while still tracing responsibility back to SFAs.
 - Responds to the luck objection: Kane argues that indeterminacy in SFAs is not mere luck because the agent's effortful contribution in the formative moment makes the outcome appropriately attributable.
 - Considers psychological plausibility and varieties of indeterminism compatible with moral responsibility.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages compatibilists (e.g., Frankfurt-style hierarchical models, Dennett-type naturalism), incompatibilists (van Inwagen), and reasons-responsiveness theorists (Fischer & Ravizza).
 - Dialogues with broader literature on moral psychology, action theory, and metaphysics of causation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primarily philosophical: agency, moral responsibility, freedom, moral psychology. Indirect implications for theological doctrines of sin, grace, and accountability, but theology is not Kane's direct focus.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The book defends a view of human freedom where moral accountability requires real, self-shaping choices (SFAs) - indeterministic acts that make the agent the ultimate source of her deeds.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Self-Forming Actions (SFAs)** as the pivotal mechanism: not every indeterminism suffices; only indeterminism in formative, effortful choice-sequences secures UR.
 - Emphasis on **temporal extension**: responsibility can be a piecemeal achievement across formative moments, not a one-off metaphysical miracle.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Against compatibilists: shows that syntactic or hierarchical accounts leave agenthood derivative, failing to capture UR.
 - Against simplistic libertarianism: denies that random indeterminacy alone yields responsibility; requires agentive contribution (effort, choice in conflict).

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Sharp articulation of **Ultimate Responsibility (UR)** as distinct from mere alternative possibilities.
 - Operationalized **SFA** as a middle theory bridging indeterminism and responsibility.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in analytic debates on free will and moral responsibility; forced compatibilists to address agency-source concerns and luck objections more directly.
 - Stimulated empirical and philosophical work on decision-making, and engagement from incompatibilists and revisionists (e.g., hard incompatibilists) who either adopt or counterpose Kane's moves.
 - Mixed traction in theological circles: useful for theologians sympathetic to libertarian readings of moral responsibility; tensions remain with Reformed compatibilist doctrines of providence and divine sovereignty.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a richly textured, psychologically informed libertarian account that is pedagogically useful for courses on free will and for theological treatments of human culpability.
 - Serves as a durable foil to both reductive compatibilism and naive indeterminism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ultimate Responsibility (UR)**
 - The agent must be the ultimate originator of actions; not explanatorily traceable solely to prior events or states.

- **Self-Forming Actions (SFAs)**
 - Indeterministic, effortful choices in which agents form their characters; central causal nodes linking agents to later actions.

- **Libertarian Free Will**
 - View that authentic freedom requires indeterminism such that agents have genuine alternative possibilities grounded in their agency.

- **Indeterminism (agent-located)**
 - Not mere randomness: indeterminacy located at choice-points where agentive effort matters.

- **Luck Objection**
 - The challenge that indeterminism makes actions a matter of luck; Kane responds by showing agentive contribution in SFAs mitigates this.

- **Sourcehood**
 - The notion that agents must be the originating source of their actions for genuine moral responsibility.

- **Effort of Will**
 - The exertion or psychological struggle in SFAs that constitutes the agent's contribution.

- **Torn Decision**
 - Decision situations characterized by irresolvable competing motives, prime contexts for SFAs.

- **Reasons-Responsiveness (contrast)**
 - Fischer & Ravizza's compatibilist-style account emphasizing responsiveness to reasons; Kane argues this may not secure UR.

- **Hierarchical Models (contrast)**
 - Frankfurt-style accounts that locate freedom in higher-order attitudes; Kane contends they can leave the agent derivative.

- **Moral Psychology (methodological emphasis)**
 - Kane integrates empirical plausibility about decision processes into metaphysical theorizing.

- **Agent-Causation (relation)**
 - Kane's view is sympathetic to agent-source intuitions but frames them via SFAs rather than traditional agent-causal metaphysics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for libertarian free will and the concept of Ultimate Responsibility.
- As a **polemic** against compatibilist accounts and as a rejoinder to luck-based critiques of indeterminism.
- As a **conceptual model** for integrating moral psychology into metaphysical accounts of agency, used in both philosophy of religion and ethical theology to articulate human responsibility.
