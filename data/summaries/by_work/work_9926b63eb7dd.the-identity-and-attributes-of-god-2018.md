### TITLE
The Identity and Attributes of God (Michael Allen, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2018 amid renewed Reformed interest in classical theism and engagement with postliberal/Barthian theology. Positioned at the intersection of systematic theology, historical retrieval (Augustine/Aquinas/Calvin), and contemporary analytic and continental conversations (Barth, Rahner, selected Anglo-American analytic theologians).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Allen argues that talk of God's attributes must be disciplined by a doctrine of divine identity grounded in self‑revelation: attributes do not merely enumerate perfections but disclose who God is as Triune Lord. The problem addressed is how to speak coherently about divine properties without violating the priority of revelation or collapsing God into a bundle of metaphysical predicates.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnostic sweep of historical approaches to attributes (classical theism, medieval scholasticism, Reformation formulations, modern critiques).
 - Methodological move: place **revelation (theologia revelata)** as determinative for metaphysical categories while allowing disciplined metaphysical reflection.
 - Engagement with Rahner and Barth: use **Rahner's rule** (that statements about God have implications for human self‑understanding) and **Barth's reformulation** (priority of God's self‑speech in Scripture) to mediate between experiential and revelatory claims.
 - Constructive proposal: conceive attributes as **relational markers of divine identity** (Trinitarian relations and aseity shape attribute language); defend coherence against open theism, process theology, and reductive metaphysics.
 - Practical implications: implications for worship, doxology, and pastoral theology; attributes as formative for Christian confession and life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Karl Barth, Karl Rahner, with interlocution from contemporary analytic and Reformed theologians (for issues like divine simplicity, omniscience).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity, divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, aseity, omniscience, omnipotence), revelation, providence, creation, soteriology in light of divine identity.
- **Closing line:** God's attributes must be read through the lens of biblical self‑revelation: they are signs of the Triune identity that both ground orthodox confession and reshape human knowledge of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Attributes are framed primarily as **identity‑marking relations** (they indicate who God is, not merely what God has).
 - A strong mediating posture: metaphysical reflection is permitted but always under the lordship of revealed speech.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects both an overly speculative classical metaphysics (which risks abstracting God from revelation) and a strictly anti‑metaphysical Barthianism (which can elide coherent talk of divine properties) by synthesizing a revelatory‑first metaphysics.
 - Responds to Rahnerian transcendental moves by insisting that human implications of theology (Rahner's insight) must be re‑shaped by the God who speaks, not by autonomous anthropological criteria.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts talk of attributes in language of **"attributes as identity markers"** and emphasizes **ontological relationality** (Trinitarian relations as constitutive of attribute‑speech).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Received as a careful bridge between Reformed confession and contemporary systematic concerns; useful in academic Reformed curricula and as corrective reading for Barthian and analytic camps.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Pedagogically clear treatment of how revelation and metaphysics interact; durable as a course text or seminar prompt on classical attributes in modern contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine identity:** The primary referent for theological predication; attributes disclose this identity.
- **Attributes as identity markers:** Term Allen uses to stress that attributes signify who God is relationally.
- **Revelation (theologia revelata):** God's self‑speech in Scripture - the hermeneutical controlling principle for talking about attributes.
- **Rahner's Rule:** The heuristic that claims about God carry correlative claims about human beings; Allen affirms the insight but reorients it under divine self‑revelation.
- **Barth's reformulation:** Barth's insistence on the priority of God's self‑encounter in revelation; Allen appropriates Barth to counter speculative abstraction while supplementing with disciplined metaphysics.
- **Divine simplicity:** Treated as an interpretive principle-simplicity must be read relationally, not as a static reduction of diversity in God.
- **Aseity:** God's self‑existence; used to ground the distinction between Creator and creature in attribute talk.
- **Immutability & Impassibility:** Rearticulated as faithful expressions of God's reliable being in relation to creatures, mediated by revelation.
- **Trinitarian relations:** Central locus for locating attributes; relationality within the Godhead structures attribute language.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis):** Employed cautiously; analogy is affirmed but restrained by revelatory precedence.
- **Omniscience/Omnipotence:** Defended against reductionist critiques by showing how they serve to articulate divine identity in Scripture.
- **Theological method (revelation + metaphysics):** Allen's methodological balance: revelation governs, metaphysics interprets.
- **Theological grammar:** Implicit concern: how grammar of divine speech shapes doctrinal formulations.
- **Practical doxology:** The use of attribute talk to form worship and piety.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for rearticulating divine attributes in Reformed seminaries (clarifies terms and presuppositions).
- As a **polemic pivot** when mediating between Barthian anti‑metaphysics and classical metaphysics, useful in debates over method.
- As an **exegetical‑theological model** for reading biblical attribute language through Trinitarian revelation rather than abstract metaphysical schemas.
