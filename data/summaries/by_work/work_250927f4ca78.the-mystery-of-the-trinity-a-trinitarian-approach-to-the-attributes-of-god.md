### TITLE
The Mystery of the Trinity: A Trinitarian Approach to the Attributes of God - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical milieu; Poythress writes as a Reformed theologian and analytic-minded philosopher, addressing contemporaries in systematic theology, philosophical theology, and biblical studies.
 - Engages current controversies (open theism, kenotic Christology, eternal functional subordination) while drawing on classical patristic and Reformation resources.

- **Central thesis**
 - **God's attributes must be interpreted trinitarianly:** divine properties are not abstract monadic predicates but expressions of the triune God's life-his shared being and inter-personal relations. Attributes refer both to the divine essence (shared) and to the persons (relationally distinguished).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Traditional treatments that treat attributes as isolated properties or as wholly reducible to the divine essence produce theological and exegetical problems (e.g., misapprehensions in Christology, problems for foreknowledge/providence).
 - Proposal: A relational ontology of attributes grounded in intra-Trinitarian relations (begetting, procession, perichoresis) preserves both unity and persons.
 - Show how predication of attributes functions both analogically and personally.
 - Apply framework to contested loci: eternal sonship & incarnation, kenosis debates, communicatio idiomatum, foreknowledge/providence, and language about God's condescension.
 - Defense: Use biblical exegesis (esp. Johannine and Pauline texts), patristic theology (Cappadocians, Augustine), and analytic clarifications to resist distortions (e.g., one-person language, ontological subordination).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical: Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine.
 - Reformed: Calvinic tradition for Scripture authority; Van Til (as a target for some one-person linguistic moves).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of open theism, kenotic theologians, defenders of eternal functional subordination.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of the Trinity, Theology Proper (attributes, simplicity, immutability), Christology (incarnation, eternal sonship, kenosis), Pneumatology (divine activity), doctrines of providence and foreknowledge, communicatio idiomatum, creedal formulations (including Filioque concerns).

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically and exegetically, the attributes of God make most sense when read through the life of the Trinity: God is known and described in the economy because he is subsisting as Father, Son, and Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Relational ontology of attributes**
 - Moves beyond static property language to locate attributes in interpersonal Trinitarian life; attributes are manifestations of the shared divine nature lived in distinct relations.

- **Balanced critique of extremes**
 - Opposes both reductionist one-person language (which effaces persons) and crude three-person tritheism; likewise resists kenotic readings that sacrifice divine attributes and EFS claims that imply ontological inequality.

- **Integrative method**
 - Tight integration of biblical exegesis, historical theology (Cappadocians), and analytic philosophical clarity. Poythress demonstrates how creedal categories illumine contemporary debates.

- **Terminological clarity**
 - Emphasizes careful use of "essence/nature" versus "person/relations" and insists on the distinction between immanent and economic Trinity without allowing them to become isolated.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well regarded in conservative Reformed circles for providing a Trinitarian corrective to modern distortions; used as a resource against open theism and problematic EFS proposals; cited in discussions of communicatio idiomatum and Christ's attributes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable conceptual toolkit for teaching doctrine of God that connects Trinitarian theology to practical loci (Christology, providence), useful for pastors, seminarians, and systematicians seeking coherence across doctrinal loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Attributes (divine)** - Predications true of God; Poythress insists these are both metaphysical (shared nature) and relational (ascribed to persons).
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inward life; must be described in terms of persons and relations, not only abstracted essence.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's outward works; these reveal the immanent relations without exhausting them.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling; key to explaining unity-in-distinction without confusion or separation.
- **Relations of origin** - Begetting (Father-Son) and procession (Spirit); ground distinctions of persons and help locate certain attributes personally.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - How properties (divine/human) are ascribed in Christ; Poythress uses a Trinitarian account to preserve genuine divine/human unity without confusion.
- **Eternal Sonship** - Affirmed as scaffolding for understanding Christ's personhood and his role in the economy; used against ad hoc temporalizations.
- **Kenosis** - Self-emptying; Poythress rejects readings that imply loss of divine attributes, proposing instead self-limitation in role.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - Critiqued when read as ontological hierarchy; Poythress allows role distinctions but defends equality of being.
- **Divine simplicity** - Reinterpreted cautiously; Poythress warns against collapsing personhood into simplicity while preserving God's unity.
- **Foreknowledge & Providence** - Recast trinitarianly to avoid omitting personal relations from discussions of God's knowledge and action.
- **Divine condescension** - Understood as relational self-giving rooted in Trinitarian life, not merely unilateral divine accommodation.
- **One-person language (Van Til critique)** - Poythress objects to language that effaces intra-Trinitarian personal distinctions while acknowledging the practical use of "God" for worship and doctrine.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for trinitarianly-informed talk about attributes (doctrine of God).
 - As a **polemic resource** against open theism, ontological EFS, and reductionist kenotic models.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Johannine and Pauline material on Son and Spirit in systematic theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Theology Proper, Christology, and Providence into a coherent Trinitarian framework.
