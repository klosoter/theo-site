### TITLE
On the Free Choice of the Will (De Libero Arbitrio) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in three books c. 388-395 CE in North Africa, early in Augustine's theological career after his conversion.
 - Written against the **Manichaean** doctrine that attributes evil to a substantive cosmic principle; also engages Stoic determinism and later provided resources against Pelagianism.
 - Part of a broader project of integrating Christian revelation with classical philosophical categories.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human moral responsibility depends on genuine free will; evil is not a positive substance made by God but a **privation of the good** arising from disorder in the will.
 - The work addresses theodicy (Nature And Origin Of Sin) and the compatibility of divine foreknowledge and human freedom (Sin And Free Will).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Book 1: Assault on dualistic explanations of evil; defense of God's goodness; introduction of free will as the root of moral evil.
 - Book 2: Analysis of moral psychology - faculties of mind (will, reason, memory) and how voluntary turning of the will produces sin.
 - Book 3: Extended theodicy about divine foreknowledge and providence; argues foreknowledge does not coerce the will and God is not the author of sin.
 - Major moves:
 - Distinguish types of necessity: logical, causal, moral; show that choice is possible within providential order.
 - Formulate evil as privatio boni - a lack or distortion, not an ontological positive.
 - Reaffirm human culpability and the need for divine remedy without imputing evil to God.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Evodius (literary conversation).
 - Opponents: Manichaeans, implicit engagement with Stoics, Platonists, and later read against Pelagians.
 - Uses Scripture critically but philosophically (Genesis discussions, God's justice and providence).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theodicy, moral anthropology (will, reason, passions), sin and its origin, divine providence and foreknowledge, preliminary remarks on grace and responsibility.

- **Closing line capturing center**
 - Augustine centers the problem of evil in the morally constituted human will: evil arises when creatures with free will degrade their orientation to the good, not from any deficiency or agency in God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic articulation of **evil as privation (privatio boni)** applied to moral evil.
 - Nuanced taxonomy of necessity to protect freedom from theological determinism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Overthrows Manichaean dualism by denying evil a substantive metaphysical status.
 - Anticipates later tensions with Pelagianism: strongly defends free will while leaving open Augustine's later deepened emphasis on grace and original sin.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight linkage of moral evil to **disoriented will** rather than material conditions.
 - Early treatment of freedom that differentiates coercion, constraint, and interior compulsion.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Medieval scholastics (e.g., Aquinas) adopted the privation model; served as a major medieval and Reformation-era source on freedom, sin, and theodicy.
 - Reformation and post-Reformation theologians repeatedly mined the work: used both to defend human responsibility and as a foil for predestinarian readings of Augustine's later corpus.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a paradigmatic **philosophical-theological model** for treating the problem of evil, moral responsibility, and the metaphysics of sin; indispensable for courses on Augustinian anthropology and classical theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Libero arbitrio (free choice / free will)** - central faculty enabling moral responsibility; not mere ability to do otherwise but an interior power to choose in deliberation.
- **Voluntas (will)** - the seat of moral orientation; its disorder produces sin.
- **Privatio boni (privation of the good)** - Augustine's core metaphysical claim: evil = lack or corruption of good, not a created substance.
- **Peccatum (sin)** - a turning-away of the will; located in moral agency, not in God's causal agency.
- **Providentia / praescientia (providence / foreknowledge)** - God's ordering and knowing of events; Augustine argues foreknowledge does not necessitate sin.
- **Necessity (necessitas) vs. compulsion vs. contingency** - distinctions used to defend freedom within providential order.
 - Logical necessity: truth relations (unchangeable).
 - Causal/compulsive necessity: excludes freedom.
 - Moral necessity: habitual inclinations that still admit responsibility.
- **Manichaeism** - the foil; Augustine refutes its cosmological explanation for evil.
- **Moral psychology (memory, understanding, will; passions)** - analytic apparatus for how choices emerge.
- **Grace (gratia)** - present but not exhaustively developed here; work leaves open the necessity of divine aid without denying free choice.
- **Origin of sin** - traced to willful disorder rather than material constitution or divine causation.
- **Foreknowledge and freedom** - Augustine's early attempt to reconcile God's knowledge with human contingency.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the metaphysical nature of evil (privatio boni) and for conceptualizing the will in moral theology.
 - As a **polemic and exegetical model** against dualism and determinism; later employed in debates on original sin, grace, and predestination.
