### TITLE
By Faith Alone: Answering the Challenges to the Doctrine of Justification - T. David Gordon

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed response to late 20th-early 21st century debates over justification.
 - Written amid the emergence of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) and renewed Catholic-Protestant dialogue post-Vatican II and the Joint Declaration (1999).
 - Aimed at pastors, students, and conservative Protestant readers concerned to defend classical Protestant soteriology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defends **sola fide** (justification by faith alone) as the historic Protestant doctrine: a forensic declaration of righteousness grounded in the imputed righteousness of Christ.
 - Opposes modern reinterpretations that reduce justification to covenant membership, moral standing, or progressive transformation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical chapters revisiting key Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians) to establish justification language as legal/forensic.
 - Historical-theological survey of Reformers (Luther, Calvin) and Roman Catholic formulations (Council of Trent) to recover terminological precision.
 - Systematic critique of the New Perspective on Paul and recent Roman Catholic apologetics:
 - Argues NPP misreads Second Temple Judaism and collapses justification into works-based covenantal inclusion.
 - Counters Roman Catholic claims about justification as initial sanctification or infused righteousness.
 - Practical pastoral implications: assurance, the place of good works, and the preacher's handling of grace and holiness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Martin Luther, John Calvin, Council of Trent formulations.
 - Contemporary critics engaged: E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright (NPP proponents) and recent Roman Catholic theologians defending non-forensic accounts.
 - Uses Scripture, patristic and Reformation sources, and modern scholarly critiques.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (central), imputation vs infusion, union with Christ, sanctification, penal substitution, faith as instrument, works and law, assurance, covenant theology implications.

- **Closing line**
 - A forceful, Reformed reiteration that justification is a forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness received by faith alone, indispensable to gospel assurance and evangelical identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Resolute reassertion of the **forensic/legal** category as essential to understanding justification.
 - Tight coupling of imputation and union with Christ as the means whereby believers receive Christ's righteousness.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to the New Perspective: restores classical contrasts between covenantal membership and legal acquittal.
 - Pushes back on Roman Catholic emphasis on infused righteousness by distinguishing initial declarative righteousness from progressive sanctification.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much innovation as terminological insistence: insists on recovered precision for terms like **imputation**, **forensic**, and **faith-as-instrument** to prevent category confusion.
 - Clarifies the relation of justification language to covenant language without reducing one to the other.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Favorably received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise, accessible polemic and textbook resource.
 - Limited influence among those sympathetic to NPP or in broader academic Pauline studies; used more as apologetic and pastoral resource than cutting-edge scholarship.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a clear, compact defense of classical Protestant soteriology for teaching, pastoral formation, and polemical engagement.
 - Useful model for combining exegetical, historical, and pastoral argumentation in defense of doctrinal orthodoxy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola fide** - Justification by faith alone; the central Protestant claim the book defends.
- **Justification (forensic)** - A judicial declaration of righteousness by God, distinct from sanctification.
- **Imputation** - Christ's righteousness accounted to believers; contrasted with infusion.
- **Infusion** - Roman Catholic notion of righteousness infused into the soul; rejected by Gordon as conflating justification and sanctification.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - Modern scholarly proposal Gordon critiques for redefining justification in covenantal terms.
 - Emphasis: NPP sees "justified" more as "declared in" or "shown to be part of covenant" than as a legal acquittal.
- **Union with Christ** - The union that grounds imputation; used to explain how believers receive Christ's righteousness.
- **Faith as instrument** - Faith is the receiving instrument (not a meritorious work) by which justification is received.
- **Penal substitution** - The doctrine that Christ bore penalty for sin; used to support forensic and legal aspects of justification.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive transformation distinct from the declarative act of justification.
- **Assurance** - Pastoral implication: assurance rests on forensic imputation, not on subjective progress.
- **Works** - Good works are fruits and evidences of justification, not contributing causes to justification.
- **Covenant language** - Discussed and distinguished from forensic categories; Gordon preserves their relation without collapse.
- **Righteousness of Christ** - Objective righteousness imputed to believers; centerpiece of the doctrine.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: concise summary of classical Protestant definitions of justification for courses and briefs.
 - As a **polemic**: deployed against the NPP and Roman Catholic reinterpretations in sermons, debates, and ecclesial statements.
 - As an **exegetical-model**: example of reading Pauline forensic language within a Reformed theological framework.
