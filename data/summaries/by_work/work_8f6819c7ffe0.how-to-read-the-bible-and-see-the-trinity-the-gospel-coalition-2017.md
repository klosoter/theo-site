### TITLE
**How to Read the Bible and See the Trinity** - Fred Sanders, The Gospel Coalition (2017). 
Site usage: 1 reference; topic cited: **Biblical Basis OT and NT Revelation of the Trinity**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Short-form popular-evangelical theological essay arising in the TGC milieu (2017), addressing pastors, students, and lay readers within conservative Reformed/evangelical networks.
 - Situated amid renewed evangelical interest in classical Trinitarianism and canonical reading practices; interacts implicitly with both pietistic non-Trinitarian tendencies and analytic/unilateral Christologies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible itself invites and warrants reading Scripture as fundamentally Trinitarian: the Father, Son, and Spirit are present and operative across both Testaments such that seeing the Trinity is both exegetically justified and theologically necessary.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Quick survey of biblical data showing Trinitarian action and revelation in OT and NT (divine speech, angel of the LORD, Wisdom, Son motifs, Christ's pre-existence, Spirit in creation and revelation).
 - Hermeneutical claim: readers need a Trinitarian interpretive lens - not to impose later doctrine onto the text, but to recognize the Bible's own grammar and narrative that point to triune reality.
 - Practical application: consequences for preaching, worship, pastoral care - Scripture read aright leads to doxology and right piety toward three-personal God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit conversation with patristic and creedal categories (e.g., classical distinctions between immanent/economic Trinity), with modern evangelical commentators who either underemphasize the Spirit or treat the Old Testament as largely untrinitarian.
 - Draws on canonical readings and select biblical-theological motifs rather than heavy engagement with systematic treatises.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (central), **Christology** (pre-existence, divine agent), **Pneumatology** (creative and revelatory Spirit), **revelation** (how God discloses himself in history), **canonical hermeneutics**.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Reading Scripture through a Trinitarian lens is not an add-on but the Bible's own way of telling who God is; to read otherwise is to misread the story and undercut worshipful response.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes the *immanence* of the Trinity in biblical narratives: triune action is visible, not merely deduced from later dogma.
 - Links Trinitarian reading directly to pastoral and doxological practice - exegesis has immediate ecclesial consequences.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both:
 - reductive unitary readings that locate divine action solely in God without persons, and
 - abstract scholastic accounts that sever the doctrine from Scripture's narrative and liturgical life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Strategic use of canonical grammar: treating Old Testament theophanies, Wisdom, and divine speech as legitimately pointing forward to the Son and Spirit - advocating a continuity of personhood language across Testaments.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in evangelical and Reformed circles for clarity and pastoral utility; used in preaching seminars and Bible studies as a compact corrective toward classical Trinitarian reading.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a succinct bridge between biblical exegesis and Trinitarian dogmatics; durable as an introductory model for pastors and seminarians wanting a theology-informed reading practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity**
 - The persons (Father, Son, Spirit) disclosed as the single God who acts in redemptive history; the primary hermeneutical lens Sanders advocates.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God's actions in history (how the three persons operate in revelation and redemption); Sanders emphasizes perceiving this economy in Scripture.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - The internal life of God; Sanders argues Scripture gives legitimate glimpses of this life via economic disclosure.
- **Theophany / Angel of the LORD**
 - OT appearances of God that Sanders reads as early witness to personal plurality or Christophanies pointing forward to the Son.
- **Wisdom (Personified)**
 - OT motif (Proverbs, Wisdom literature) read as a foreshadowing of the Son's role in creation and revelation.
- **Christological pre-existence**
 - NT claims that the Son was active in creation and revelation; used to knit OT motifs to NT fulfillment.
- **Pneumatology / Spirit as divine agent**
 - Spirit's presence in creation, prophecy, and new covenant life demonstrates triune action across the canon.
- **Canonical grammar**
 - The set of recurring scriptural patterns and categories that recommend a Trinitarian reading without imposing foreign categories.
- **Revelation (biblical)**
 - God's self-disclosure that is inherently tri-personal; revelation is the primary warrant for Trinitarian reading.
- **Doxology / Worshipal reading**
 - Reading that leads to praise; Sanders insists correct Trinitarian reading results in transformed worship.
- **Typology**
 - OT persons/events that signify fuller NT fulfillment in the Son and Spirit.
- **Creedal categories**
 - Historical doctrinal terms used as interpretive aids, not imposed foreign frameworks.
- **Pastoral hermeneutic**
 - Applying Trinitarian reading to preaching, catechesis, and spiritual formation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what it means to read Scripture Trinitarianly (concise, pastorally oriented).
- As an **exegetical model**: practical guide for tracing OT-to-NT continuity regarding persons of God.
- As a **polemic** against non-Trinitarian or impoverished readings that marginalize the Spirit or the Son.
