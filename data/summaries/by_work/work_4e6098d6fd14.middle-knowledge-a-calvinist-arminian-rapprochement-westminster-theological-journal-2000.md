### TITLE
Middle Knowledge: A Calvinist-Arminian Rapprochement? - William Lane Craig (Westminster Theological Journal, 2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical scholasticism; rising interest in philosophical theology and analytic treatments of providence and freedom. Craig writes within the Molinist tradition to address ongoing Reformed/Arminian disputes.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Middle knowledge (scientia media)**-God's knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom-can serve as a plausible bridge between Calvinist concerns for divine sovereignty and Arminian insistence on genuine libertarian freedom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define and locate threefold divine knowledge: natural (what God could know), **middle** (what free creatures would do in various circumstances), and free/foreknowledge (what God will bring about).
 - Show how God, by actualizing a world in light of middle knowledge, exercises sovereign choice while leaving actual human choices libertarianly free.
 - Respond to principal objections:
 - **Dependency objection** (middle knowledge makes God's knowledge dependent on creatures): argue for a metaphysically non-reductive account whereby counterfactuals are true independently of God's causal ordering.
 - **Grounding objection** (what grounds truth of counterfactuals?): defend truth-makers as non-actual but truth-bearing propositions or properties of possible persons/situations.
 - **Threat-to-sovereignty objection**: show that God retains sovereignty by selecting which possible world to create on the basis of middle knowledge.
 - Survey implications for doctrines of election, providence, and foreordination-reinterpreting election as divine choice of a world in which chosen persons freely respond.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Historical: Luis de Molina and the Jesuit Molinist tradition; Suarez; medieval scholastics.
 - Contemporary: debates with Reformed compatibilists and critics of Molinism; interaction with analytic philosophers (e.g., Plantinga's modal resources and critique of determinism).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine knowledge (threefold distinction), providence, predestination/election, human freedom (libertarian), foreknowledge/foreordination, divine sovereignty.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig proposes that Molinist middle knowledge offers a **philosophically robust, theologically significant** route for reconciling God's providential sovereignty with genuine libertarian human freedom, thereby opening a possible rapprochement between Calvinist and Arminian camps.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses **philosophical precision** (modal logic, counterfactual analysis) as service to systematic theology rather than mere polemic.
 - Frames God's sovereignty as exercised via **world-selection** on the basis of middle knowledge, preserving both divine freedom and creaturely indeterminacy.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Calvinist compatibilist accounts that equate divine decree with deterministic causation of all willings; offers an alternative that preserves libertarian choice without diminishing God's providential governance.
 - Distinguishes modern Molinism from caricatures (e.g., it is not a mere abdication of divine control).
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Rearticulates the **threefold knowledge schema** in contemporary analytic terms and engages the grounding objection head-on.
 - Emphasizes middle knowledge as explanatory-not merely epistemic-ground for providential decisions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked renewed evangelical interest in Molinism; intensified debate with Reformed scholars who defend compatibilism.
 - Served as a focal reference in dialogues seeking constructive overlap between Reformed and Arminian theological commitments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model case-study of applying analytic philosophy to classical theological claims; valuable for courses on providence, freedom, and theodicy as a clarifying, contestable alternative to strict Calvinism or classical Arminianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle knowledge (scientia media)**: God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance.
- **Natural knowledge**: God's knowledge of necessary truths and possibilities (what could be).
- **Free/foreknowledge**: God's knowledge of what will actually occur in the world chosen.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**: Propositions of the form "If S were in circumstance C, S would freely do D"; central to middle knowledge.
- **Molinism**: The theological system that locates middle knowledge at the heart of divine providence and choice of the actual world.
- **World-selection / actualization**: The doctrine that God actualizes one possible world; sovereignty exercised by choosing which possibility to create.
- **Libertarian free will**: The metaphysical view that human choices are not deterministic or causally necessitated; preserved under Molinism.
- **Grounding objection**: The challenge of what metaphysically grounds the truth of counterfactuals about free actions.
 - Craig answers by defending non-actual truth-makers or robust modal facts about persons in possible worlds.
- **Dependency objection**: The claim that middle knowledge makes God's knowledge dependent on creatures; Craig distinguishes epistemic dependence from ontological undermining of sovereignty.
- **Transworld depravity**: Plantinga's concept used in modal discussions of free will; relevant contrast on whether any possible world yields morally significant freedom.
- **Divine simplicity**: A theological constraint some Reformed critics invoke against Molinism; Craig addresses tension but argues compatibility is possible if carefully formulated.
- **Providence vs. foreordination**: Molinist re-describes election as divine selection amid known counterfactuals rather than micro-deterministic decree.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition and defense** of middle knowledge for advanced theological and philosophical curricula.
- As a **polemic and interlocutory resource** in debates between compatibilist Calvinists and libertarian Arminians/Molinists.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for reinterpreting election, providence, and foreknowledge without collapsing freedom into determinism.
