### TITLE
Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy et al.) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Rooted in 13th-century Dominican scholasticism (University of Paris; Thomas as student of Albert the Great).
 - Modern editorial framing by Weinandy et al. presents Aquinas's commentaries for contemporary theological and exegetical use; engages historical, philological, and doctrinal questions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Aquinas aims to read Scripture as the authoritative Word of God by harmonizing the literal sense with the legitimate spiritual senses, integrating philosophical reason and patristic authority to ground theology, sacraments, and moral teaching.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodic principle: the **literal sense** is primary and normative; spiritual senses (allegorical/typological, tropological/moral, anagogical) are subordinate but necessary for theological richness.
 - Scriptural interpretation is governed by *auctoritas* (Fathers, Councils), rational principles, and the analogy of faith (coherence of revelation).
 - Major exegetical moves:
 - Exposition of the text (glosses, distinctions, questions).
 - Typological linking of Old Testament events to Christ and the sacraments.
 - Application to doctrine: Trinity, Christology, sacraments (esp. Eucharist), law/grace, and ethics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy reliance on Augustine, Gregory, the Sentences (Peter Lombard), Aristotle (logic/metaphysics), Moses and the canonical text; dialog with Jewish exegesis is indirect via patristic use.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (God as principal author; human authors ministerial).
 - Hermeneutics: senses of Scripture, typology, analogy of faith.
 - Trinity and Christology (Christ as interpretive center).
 - Sacraments (signs and instruments of grace), law (moral/ceremonial distinctions), grace, and ecclesiology.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas's commentaries place Christ as the hermeneutical center and Scripture as a sacramental, doctrinally integrated resource-literal-first but spiritually rich, philosophically disciplined, and ecclesially authoritative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic integration of Aristotelian metaphysics into exegesis (causality, act/potency, analogia entis) to clarify theological predicates applied to God and Scripture.
 - Hierarchical yet harmonizing hermeneutic: literal sense secures historical reference; spiritual senses reveal Christic and sacramental fulfillment.
 - Strong sacramental ontology: biblical signs point to and effect sacramental realities (wider than mere memorialism).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - More philosophically rigorous than many patristic exegetes; refines Augustine by giving clearer account of senses and the role of reason.
 - Differs from many Reformation positions by preserving a robust role for ecclesial mediation, sacramental efficacy, and continuity between Testaments while acknowledging typological fulfillment.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of *sensus litteralis* and subordinate spiritual senses as operative rules rather than free allegory.
 - Operational use of *auctoritas* + *ratio* (authority and reason) as joint interpretive warrants.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to medieval scholastic and later Catholic exegetical practice; contested by Reformers but recovered in Tridentine and modern Catholic theology.
 - Modern Protestant and Reformed scholars both criticize and occasionally mine Aquinas for typological resources; some advocates of continuity (e.g., monocovenantal tendencies in the Federal Vision milieu) selectively appeal to his emphasis on unity, though substantive differences remain.
- **Enduring value**
 - A model for disciplined, Christocentric exegesis that resists either purely historical-critical reduction or unchecked allegory; indispensable for sacramental theology and debates on covenant continuity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sensus litteralis (literal sense)** - the primary, historical-grammatical meaning; basis for further senses.
- **Allegorical / typological sense** - reads persons/events as prefigurations of Christ and mysteries of the Church.
- **Tropological (moral) sense** - instructs the believer in ethical transformation.
- **Anagogical sense** - points to eternal realities and consummation.
- **Auctoritas** - patristic and conciliar authority as interpretive norm alongside reason.
- **Analogia fidei / analogy of faith** - coherence of Scripture and doctrine used to resolve tensions.
- **Sacramentum (sacrament)** - sign that both signifies and effects grace; scriptural types prefigure sacramental signs.
- **Principal author / ministerial author** - God as true author of Scripture, human writers as instrumental.
- **Typology** - ordered correspondence between Old Testament figures/events and New Testament fulfillment.
- **Lex (law) vs. Ius / foedus / testamentum (covenant/testament)** - distinctions between moral law (permanent) and ceremonial law (preparatory); covenants point forward to Christ's covenantal fulfillment.
- **Ratio (reason) / philosophia ancilla theologiae** - reason disciplines interpretation but remains subordinate to revelation.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)** - metaphysical principle securing predication of God in Scripture.
- **Regula fidei (rule of faith)** - doctrinal matrix used to test readings.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an exegetical model: instructs literal-first, multi-sense reading used in sacramental theology and homiletics.
 - As a polemical and interpretive resource in covenant debates: cited by those arguing for strong continuity between Testaments (e.g., some monocovenantal appeals) and critiqued by Reformed covenant theologians who emphasize federal distinctions.
 - As a definitional source for sacramental and typological claims in systematic theology and liturgical renewal.
