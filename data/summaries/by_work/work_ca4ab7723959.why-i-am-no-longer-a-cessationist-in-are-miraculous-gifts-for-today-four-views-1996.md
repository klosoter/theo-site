### TITLE
Why I Am No Longer a Cessationist - Jack Deere (essay in Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views, 1996)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1990s evangelical debate over spiritual gifts; anthology presenting multiple positions. Deere writes as a conservative evangelical who became convinced of continuationism after pastoral experience and study.
 - Deere is best known for Surprised by the Power of the Spirit (1993), which frames his conversion from academic cessationism to charismatic practice; this essay summarizes and sharpens that turn in a dialogical volume aimed at evangelicals and Reformed interlocutors.

- **Central thesis**
 - The charismatic gifts did not cease with the apostolic age; Scripture and responsible experience warrant affirmation of present-day prophecy, healing, tongues, and revelatory activity, properly tested and regulated by biblical standards.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis of classical cessationist arguments: Deere critiques extra-biblical historical claims (e.g., that early church immediately abandoned gifts) and hermeneutical moves that read "sign gifts" as uniquely apostolic.
 - Exegetical rebuttal: close readings of 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Acts, and normative Pauline material to show ongoing presence and purpose of gifts (edification, confirmation, mission).
 - Epistemic and pastoral case: integrates personal pastoral experience and case studies of healed/prophetic ministries as warrant for theological reconsideration, while insisting on tests and order (1 Cor 14, Deut 18 criteria).
 - Practical safeguards: proposes normative tests for prophecy, limits on disorder, and subordination of charismatic phenomena to Scripture and church order.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Engages broadly with evangelical and Reformed cessationist literature and popular charismatic testimonies; leans on biblical exegesis, historical survey data, and firsthand pastoral anecdotes (Deere's ministry experience).
 - Dialogues with the anthology's other contributors and with mainstream evangelical scholarly objections.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority (ongoing revelatory phenomena vs. sufficiency of Scripture)
 - Pneumatology (present work and gifts of the Spirit)
 - Ecclesiology and pastoral order (testing prophecy, public worship)
 - Soteriological and missiological implications of sign gifts

- **Closing line**
 - Deere's theological center: responsible continuationism - affirmation of charismatic gifts grounded in Scripture, disciplined by tests and order, and justified by pastoral experience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates conservative evangelical commitments (Scriptural sufficiency, doctrinal sobriety) with strong affirmation of contemporary gifts; insists experience alone is inadequate but combined with exegesis forms warrant.
 - Stresses pastoral and pastoral-theological evidence (real-world ministry effects) alongside argumentation.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges the historical-empirical claims of cessationists that charisma quickly died out; disputes interpretive norms that isolate sign gifts to apostolic authentication only.
 - Unlike some charismatic advocates, Deere emphasizes strict biblical tests for prophecy and restraints against excess.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Frames his position as a disciplined or "responsible" continuationism - a middle posture avoiding both cavalier credulity and categorical rejection.
 - Reframes "sign gifts" debate: questions sharp apostolic-only boundary and reframes gifts as ongoing instruments for edification and mission.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among evangelicals seeking a theologically conservative bridge to charismatic practice; influential in equipping conservative pastors to evaluate gifts without default rejection.
 - Criticized by staunch cessationists for relying on experience; welcomed by many in Reformed-evangelical circles as a credible, cautious pro-charismatic resource.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating pastoral testimony with exegesis; helpful for teaching on how to test alleged prophecy and maintain order in charismatic contexts.
 - Useful as a pragmatic-theological handbook for pastors navigating gifts in conservative churches.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism** - The view that charismatic gifts continue; Deere's position affirms present-day prophetic, healing, and revelatory activity.
- **Cessationism** - Opposing position that revelatory gifts ceased with apostolic era; Deere critiques its historical and exegetical bases.
- **Sign gifts** - Gifts (miracles, tongues, signs) often claimed to authenticate apostleship; Deere argues these are not limited purely to apostolic authentication.
- **Prophecy (contemporary)** - Deer's careful acceptance of non-canonical prophetic utterances subject to biblical tests (fit with Scripture, community testing, fruit).
- **Testing prophecies** - Uses Deut 18, 1 Cor 14, and pastoral criteria to evaluate authenticity and humility of prophets.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture vs. ongoing revelation** - Deere affirms Scripture's ultimate authority while allowing non-canonical, subordinate prophetic activity that must be tested.
- **Pneumatology (operative)** - Emphasizes Spirit's present work in equipping, sign-working, and guiding the church.
- **Ecclesial order** - Insists gifts function within disciplined worship and leadership structures; rejects disorderly manifestations.
- **Experience as warrant** - Elevates pastoral experience as corroborating evidence when combined with exegesis and norms.
- **Responsible continuationism** - Deere's label for a cautious, Scripture-governed charismatic affirmation.
- **Historical evidence critique** - Challenges common cessationist readings of patristic silence or suppression of gifts.
- **Pastoral prudence** - Practical safeguards for churches: accountability, humility, and scriptural conformity.
- **Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? (1996)** - The volume in which Deere's concise case appears, often cited in debates on continuationism vs cessationism.
- **Surprised by the Power of the Spirit (1993)** - Deere's fuller autobiographical/theological account; frequently paired with the essay in evangelical reading lists.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a conservative, tested form of continuationism in surveys of spiritual gifts.
- As a **polemic and bridge** in discussions between Pentecostal/charismatic movements and Reformed/evangelical critics - models pastoral engagement and exegetical accommodation.
