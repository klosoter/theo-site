### TITLE
The Glory of God and Paul's Soteriology - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (essay in The Glory of God)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th/early-21st-century Reformed theological milieu; written as part of a volume devoted to the theological centrality of divine glory. Addresses contemporary Pauline scholarship and modern theological trends from a confessional Reformed vantage.
- **Central thesis:** Paul's soteriology must be read through the lens of the glory of God: salvation is God's act to vindicate and display his glory in and through the redemption and full restoration of human beings in union with Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes **doxa** (glory) as Pauline theological center and telos of redemptive action.
 - Develops **union with Christ** as the structural principle of Pauline soteriology: participation in Christ's death, resurrection, and exaltation explains justification, sanctification, and glorification.
 - Argues for an integrated reading of forensic and participatory language - justification is not isolated from the believer's real participation in Christ's righteous life; sanctification and glorification are the progressive and consummate dimensions of that union.
 - Places soteriology within **eschatological**already/not-yet framework: believers share now in the benefits of Christ's exaltation and await consummation in bodily resurrection and full participation in God's glory.
 - Applies a **psychosomatic** anthropology: human nature is a unified soul-body creature; salvation intends the restoration of the whole person to reflect God's glory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Primary interlocutor is Paul (exegetical focus on Romans, Philippians, 2 Corinthians). Engages with Reformed tradition (notably Calvinist emphases on divine purpose and forensic justification) and contemporary Pauline critics (New Perspective proponents and some existential/Barthian reads), as well as theologians who stress participation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (justification, sanctification, glorification), Christology (exaltation and mediatorial glory), eschatology (resurrection, already/not-yet), anthropology (psychosomatic unity, imago Dei), doctrine of God (glory as God's purpose).
- **Closing line:** The goal of Paul's soteriology is the display and vindication of God's glory through the real, psychosomatic participation of believers in the death, resurrection, and exaltation of Christ - a salvation that is both forensic and transformative, now enacted in union and consummated in future glorification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Glory as organizing category:** Gaffin insists that doxa is not ornamental language but the controlling teleology for Pauline theology and for articulating the shape of salvation.
- **Integration of forensic and participatory motifs:** Rather than choosing between justification-as-declarative and participation-in-Christ models, he argues they cohere within union with Christ, preserving the Reformed emphasis on divine imputation without denying real relational/ontological participation.
- **Psychosomatic anthropology applied to soteriology:** Emphasizes that salvation targets the whole human person (body and soul), so glorification is bodily and personal, not merely spiritualized.
- **Corrective to dualisms and reductionisms:** Pushes back on readings that bifurcate "legal" and "spiritual" aspects of salvation or reduce glorification to a purely future spiritual state.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely read in conservative Reformed and confessional circles; valued as a robust bridge between classical Reformed doctrine and responsible engagement with modern Pauline studies. Used in seminaries for clarifying the relation of justification and sanctification.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a concise, exegetically sensitive framework that preserves Reformed theological commitments while accommodating participatory language in Paul; helpful for preaching, doctrine, and pastoral assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Doxa (glory):** Central telos of God's redemptive action; God's own display and vindication in Christ.
- **Union with Christ:** The determinative relational reality by which believers participate in Christ's death, resurrection, and exaltation.
- **Participation / koinonia:** Real sharing in Christ's life and benefits - not mere metaphor but relational and grounded in Scripture.
- **Justification (dikaioo):** Forensic declaration rooted in union; explained and sustained by participation in Christ's righteousness.
 - Contrast: neither purely juridical nor purely existential - reconciled within union theology.
- **Sanctification (hagiasmos):** Progressive growth in conformity to Christ, operating in the believer's psychosomatic unity.
- **Glorification (doxosis):** Final consummation - bodily resurrection and full sharing in Christ's glory.
- **Already / Not-yet:** Eschatological frame holding present participation and future consummation in tension.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** Human person as integrated body-soul unity; salvation aims at whole-person restoration.
- **Imago Dei restoration:** Salvation as recovery of the God-reflecting shape of human life, culminating in glorification.
- **Exaltation of Christ:** Central Christological reality that secures believers' participation in divine glory.
- **Forensic/representative language:** Retained and reinterpreted in light of union - imputation is real but not abstracted from participation.
- **Pauline corpus (Romans, Philippians, 2 Cor):** Primary exegetical loci used to ground the argument.
- **Theological telos:** God's glory as the normative end for all doctrinal loci.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a glory-centered Reformed soteriology that unites forensic and participatory themes.
- As a **polemic**/corrective against dualistic anthropology and readings that sever justification from sanctification.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul's soteriology through union with Christ.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and pastoral theology emphasizing whole-person hope and assurance.
