### TITLE
Introducing Biblical Hermeneutics - Craig Bartholomew

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** contemporary evangelical/Reformed academic milieu (late 20th-early 21st century). Engages both classical Protestant hermeneutical concerns and recent continental/postmodern critiques; aimed at seminarians and advanced undergraduates as a usable, theologically committed introduction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** hermeneutics must be both critically competent and theologically faithful: interpretation of Scripture requires attention to historical-linguistic questions and to Scripture's canonical, creational, covenantal, and Christ-centred shape so that reading yields formed vocation for the church in culture.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - historical survey of interpretive methods (from patristic & doctrinal readings through Protestant grammatical-historical method to modern critical and postmodern approaches);
 - philosophical foundations (objectivity, authorial intent, reader-response, Gadamerian fusion of horizons);
 - biblical-theological and canonical strategies (narrative, typological, covenantal readings; Christ as hermeneutical key);
 - methodological integration: how to read exegetically while framing application within vocation/culture mandate;
 - practical application: hermeneutics for preaching, ethics, mission, and cultural engagement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** classical Reformers (implicitly as heirs), historical-critical scholars, philosophical hermeneuticians (e.g., Gadamer, Ricoeur in typal engagement), and contemporary evangelical interlocutors; frequent appeal to biblical texts as primary interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and Scripture (authority and interpretation), creation and the cultural/dominion mandate, covenant theology and narrative covenant, Christology as interpretive center, ecclesiology and vocation, implicit ethics and cultural theology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** interpretation is a theologically charged, communal practice that reads the Bible canonically and Christocentrically so as to form faithful Christian vocation in the world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Vocation and culture mandate as hermeneutical lenses:** reads biblical texts with the creational and covenantal mandate in view so interpretation bears on human calling, stewardship, and cultural work.
 - **Canonical-narrative integration:** insists on reading individual texts within the redemptive-historical flow of Scripture rather than only as isolated historical artifacts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - pushes back against a narrow, purely historical-critical method that evacuates theological purpose; conversely, resists purely subjective reader-response approaches that detach meaning from authorial and canonical constraints.
 - offers a middle path that integrates historical exegesis with theological reading and ecclesial application.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - stresses terms like **"vocational hermeneutics"** (interpretation oriented to discipleship and cultural engagement) and **"canonically located reading"** (priority of canonical context in determining meaning).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - adopted in evangelical and Reformed classrooms as a balanced introductory textbook; praised for accessible integration of theory and practice; influential for pastors and scholars seeking a theologically robust hermeneutic.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - strong pedagogical framework that connects exegetical technique to theological commitment and public practice; useful as a bridge between critical scholarship and ecclesial application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics:** disciplined practice of interpretation; both method and ecclesial practice.
- **Grammatical-historical method:** foundation for author-intent exegesis; not abandoned but reinterpreted within a theological frame.
- **Canonical reading / canonical hermeneutic:** interpreting texts in light of the whole Bible's shape and storyline.
- **Theological interpretation of Scripture:** reading with explicit attention to doctrine (esp. Christocentric focus).
- **Narrative and typological interpretation:** story-shape of Scripture and patterns (types/antitypes) as keys for meaning.
- **Vocation / Cultural (Dominion) Mandate:** creational calling (Gen 1-2) used as a hermeneutical horizon for ethical and cultural application; stresses stewardship and transformative cultural engagement grounded in Scripture.
 - relation to covenant: vocation is enacted within covenantal life of God's people.
- **Interpretive community:** the church as locus where interpretation is formed, critiqued, and enacted.
- **Fusion of horizons:** philosophical insight about reader and text meeting; used to temper both relativism and naive objectivism.
- **Authorial intent vs. reader-response:** maintained as a balance-authorial intentionality is primary, but community and context inform application.
- **Christ as hermeneutical key:** New Testament reading interprets the Old in light of Christ's person and work.
- **Application / performative reading:** hermeneutics moves toward vocation-how texts form practice, ethics, mission.
- **Contextualization:** responsible engagement with contemporary culture without capitulation to its presuppositions.
- **Covenantal framework:** Scripture read as covenant-history shaping identity and task.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source:** establishes working definitions of hermeneutical terms for courses and syllabi.
 - **Exegetical model:** supplies an integrated method for preaching and biblical-theological exegesis (especially on Genesis/culture mandate).
 - **Polemic / conceptual pivot:** functions as a corrective to both reductive historical-critical and unmoored reader-response trends, orienting students toward vocationally-minded, canonical interpretation.
