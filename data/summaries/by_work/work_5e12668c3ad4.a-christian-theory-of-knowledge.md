### TITLE
A Christian Theory of Knowledge - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed apologetic and theological method emerging from Westminster Theological Seminary milieu; reaction to liberalism, autonomy of reason, and evidentialist apologetics. Van Til frames epistemology within Covenant/Reformed theology and engages contemporary philosophy and theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - All knowledge is rooted in a priori religious commitments; the Christian faith supplies the only coherent ultimate presupposition (God as the ground of intelligibility). Neutral, autonomous reason is impossible; Scripture is self-attesting under the Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Epistemic starting point: every rational argument presupposes ultimate commitments; these commitments are religious in character.
 - Transcendental move: the Christian God is the necessary precondition for the intelligibility of logic, morals, and uniformity of nature.
 - Antithesis: a categorical, total opposition exists between Christian and non-Christian thought; unbelieving systems cannot account consistently for rationality.
 - Scripture and Spirit: Scripture is authoritative because it is self-attesting through the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit; this avoids appeal to neutral foundations.
 - Noetic considerations: sin affects the whole person (psychosomatic unity), so unbelieving reason is corrupt and must be judged rather than merely supplemented.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Opposes classical/evidential apologetics and natural theology (representatives in the evangelical world); dialog with Gordon Clark (notably the Clark-Van Til controversy), engagements with Kuyperian insights, critique of analogia entis frameworks.
 - Philosophical interlocutors: epistemological trends emphasizing subjectivity/relativism and attempts to secure neutral, non-religious foundations for knowledge.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and general), authority and self-attestation of Scripture, doctrine of God as epistemic ground, Trinity implicitly informing knowability, anthropology (image of God, psychosomatic unity), sin and noetic effects, apologetics and theological method, some extended critique of natural theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til locates the theory of knowledge inside covenantal, Trinitarian theism: only the Christian God furnishes the presuppositions required for rational, moral, and scientific intelligibility.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Epistemology treated as inherently theological: presuppositions are religious commitments rather than neutral background beliefs.
 - Transcendental apologetic: shows that unbelief cannot account for the preconditions of intelligibility.
 - Strong antithesis: not merely a contrast of conclusions but a pervasive, structural opposition between worldviews.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects evidentialist strategies that seek neutral proofs as starting points; opposes analogia entis (ontological analogy) that grants creaturely knowledge independent of revelation.
 - Differentiates from Gordon Clark by emphasizing the necessity of Scripture's self-attestation and the living work of the Spirit; differs from fideism by offering a rational, albeit theological, account of justification.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of "presuppositionalism" as a method and "antithesis" as comprehensive epistemic division.
 - Rearticulation of the self-attestation doctrine in epistemic terms (Scripture as internally authoritative under Spirit-witness).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in conservative Reformed apologetics (notably through students and followers like Greg Bahnsen and John Frame-Frame taking sympathetic but critical directions).
 - Polarizing: praised for theological coherence and critiqued for rhetorical sharpness and alleged epistemic circularity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to attempts at neutral reason; durable framework for integrating doctrine and epistemology; essential reading for Reformed theological method and presuppositional apologetics courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - Method that begins with ultimate commitments; arguments test consistency and coherence of presuppositions.
- **Antithesis** - Fundamental, pervasive opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought.
- **Transcendental argument** - Showing Christianity as the necessary precondition for intelligibility (laws of logic, ethics, uniformity).
- **Self-attestation of Scripture** - Scripture's authority is internally witnessed by the Spirit, not proven by neutral criteria.
- **Analogia fidei vs. analogia entis** - Preference for analogia fidei (knowledge shaped by faith and revelation) and rejection of analogia entis (creaturely, unaided knowledge of God).
- **Noetic effects of sin** - Sin corrupts the whole person's knowing, not merely isolated propositions.
- **Autonomy of reason** - The rejected idea that reason can stand as a neutral foundation apart from God.
- **Psychosomatic unity** - Human nature as integrated body-soul unity; implications for epistemology and sin's reach.
- **Munus triplex (as related)** - Uses classical Reformed categories (e.g., ministerial roles) to show theology's practical and epistemic functions (less a focus than biblical authority but present in systematizing).
- **Principia / theology as science** - Theology as a principled, orderly discipline grounded in revelation rather than "scientific" neutrality.
- **Common grace** - Acknowledged but limited: accounts for genuine non-Christian achievements without dissolving the antithesis.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for presuppositional epistemology and method in apologetics and epistemology courses.
- As polemic against evidentialism and natural theology in bibliology and theology of revelation.
- As a conceptual pivot for integrating doctrine (revelation, sin, God's sovereignty) with practical apologetic strategy and theological method.
