### TITLE
**On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers** (1799; rev. 1806, 1821) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late Enlightenment and early German Romanticism (Berlin salons; Schlegel circle). Post-Kantian critique of metaphysics; Pietist upbringing. A rhetorical-apologetic address to urbane skeptics who reduced religion to ethics or metaphysics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Religion is neither knowing (metaphysics) nor doing (morality) but **intuition and feeling** of the Infinite; piety is the **immediate self-consciousness** of dependence upon the whole. He defends the irreducible essence and social form of religion.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - First Speech: **Apologia** to cultured despisers; rejects moralism and rationalism.
 - Second: **Nature of religion** as intuition (Anschauung) and feeling (Gefuhl); religion has its own sphere.
 - Third: **Cultus and art**; symbol, poetry, and ritual as media of piety.
 - Fourth: **Church/community** as the communicative organism of piety; religion is essentially social.
 - Fifth: **The religions**; historical plurality; Christianity as the highest expression uniting universal dependence and personal communion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Kant and post-Kantian moral religion; Spinoza (praised for piety of the Infinite); Lessing; Romantic aesthetics; polemical distance from Protestant scholasticism and deism.
- **Doctrines treated:**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology:** Revelation is immediate God-relatedness; Scripture witnesses the original Christian piety, not a deposit of metaphysical propositions.
 - **Theology Proper:** God known in the feeling of absolute dependence (explicitly developed later), not by speculative predicates.
 - **Christology/Soteriology:** Christ as the supreme bearer and mediator of God-consciousness; salvation as participation in this consciousness.
 - **Pneumatology/Ecclesiology:** The Spirit is the living power of communal piety; the church as organism of communication.
 - **Eschatology:** Eternity as a quality of participation in the Infinite now; skepticism toward crude afterlife speculation.
 - **Covenant/history:** Reframing redemptive history as the historical development of piety rather than juridical covenants.
- **Closing line:** The theological center is **religion as lived God-consciousness**: immediate, experiential, and communal, irreducible to cognition or ethics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Religion as taste for the Infinite**; essence is **feeling/intuition**, not doctrine or duty.
 - **Immediate self-consciousness** as the locus of revelation.
 - **Church as organism** of shared piety; worship and art mediate, not replace, piety.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against Enlightenment moralism (Kant): religion is not morality in other dress.
 - Against rationalist and scholastic metaphysics: doctrine expresses piety but is not its essence.
 - Against deism: affirms immanence of the Infinite in experience; praises Spinoza against caricatures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Gefuhl** (feeling) and **Anschauung** (intuition) as theological categories.
 - Proto-formulation of **absolute dependence** and **God-consciousness** (systematized in The Christian Faith).
 - **Cultus** as symbolic-poetic mediation of piety.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for modern Protestant liberalism (Ritschl, Harnack), religion-of-experience traditions, and phenomenology of religion.
 - Critiqued by Barth and neo-orthodoxy as collapsing revelation into human religiosity; engaged by mediating and Reformed theologians as a foil and occasional resource (ecclesial communal emphasis; hermeneutics of experience).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Persuasive apologetic for religion's irreducible domain.
 - Stimulates theological method attentive to experience, community, and history.
 - Heuristic for reading Scripture as witness and church life as communicative practice, even where one rejects his reductions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religion (Religion):** Irreducible sphere distinct from ethics and metaphysics; a mode of consciousness.
- **Feeling (Gefuhl):** Pre-reflective immediacy of God-relatedness; not mere emotion but existential receptivity.
- **Intuition (Anschauung):** Immediate awareness of the universe/Infinite that grounds religious utterance.
- **Taste for the Infinite:** Aptness for perceiving the Infinite within the finite.
- **Absolute dependence:** Later term naming the core content of piety; already anticipated in the Speeches.
- **God-consciousness:** Lived awareness of God that structures all other consciousness.
- **Revelation:** Immediate givenness of God in consciousness; Scripture and doctrine are secondary expressions.
- **Cultus (worship):** Symbolic, poetic enactments that communicate and shape piety.
- **Church as organism:** Historical community where piety is shared, corrected, and amplified.
- **The Religions (plurality):** Historical forms of piety; Christianity as the consummate form.
- **Christ the Redeemer:** Paradigmatic bearer/mediator of God-consciousness to the community.
- **Spirit:** The communal power enlivening and unifying piety; more experiential than ontological in emphasis.
- **Eternity/Immortality:** Quality of participation in the Infinite now, not primarily endless duration.
- **Scripture as witness:** Normative insofar as it mediates original Christian piety; not a metaphysical manual.
- **History of piety:** Recasting redemptive history as development and communication of God-consciousness.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology/Theology Proper:** As a foil and partial resource for defining revelation, Scripture-as-witness, and God-consciousness.
 - **Soteriology/Pneumatology:** For notions of redemption as communicated piety and the Spirit's communal operation.
 - **Eschatology:** For qualitative eternity and presence-of-the-eternal motifs.
 - **Covenant/Ecclesiology:** As contrast to covenantal-historical models, highlighting church as organism over legal-historical schema.
