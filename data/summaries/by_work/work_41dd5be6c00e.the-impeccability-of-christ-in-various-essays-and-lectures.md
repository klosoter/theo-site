### TITLE
"The Impeccability of Christ" (essays & lectures) - Donald Macleod

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th century Reformed context (Donald Macleod, Scottish Free Church background; active from 1960s onward).
 - Reaction against liberal, existential, and some kenotic/Barthian re-readings of Christ's human freedom; participates in renewed confessional Christology and pastoral assurance literature.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The incarnate Son was **impeccable**: he could not sin (non posse peccare), while nonetheless being genuinely tempted and morally responsible. This affirms both Christ's full humanity (real temptation) and the uniqueness of his sinlessness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical exegesis: Hebrews 4:15; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:22; Luke 4; Gospels on temptation are read to show genuine trial without ontological susceptibility to sin.
 - Christology: situates impeccability within the **hypostatic union** - the divine person, united to a true human nature, possesses freedom from sin by virtue of union with the divine will and the sanctified human nature.
 - Theological distinction: distinguishes **temptability** (posse tentari - could be tempted) from **possibility of sinning** (posse peccare). Christ could be tempted but not actually capable of sinning.
 - Philosophical/anthropological grounding: analyzes freedom and moral agency so that impeccability does not entail coercion or the loss of genuine volition.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences: upholds the efficacy and exemplary character of Christ's obedience and the integrity of penal substitution.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed fathers and orthodoxy (Augustine, Calvin, Westminster divines) for historical precedent.
 - Modern interlocutors: critics from kenotic theology, some readings of Barth, existentialist or liberal theologies that relativize Christ's moral uniqueness.
 - Scriptural exegesis is primary resource; secondary engagement with philosophical accounts of freedom and contemporary systematicians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two natures, two wills)
 - Hamartiology (nature and possibility of sin)
 - Soteriology (atonement - penal substitution and representative obedience)
 - Anthropology (freedom, temptation, moral agency)
 - Revelation and pastoral theology (assurance based on Christ's perfect obedience)
- **Closing line**
 - Macleod locates the doctrine of Christ's impeccability at the intersection of orthodox Christology and soteriology: the Son's real but non-culpable temptation secures both the authenticity of his humanity and the perfection of his mediatorial work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful conceptual separation of temptation and peccability: insists on real temptation without ontological susceptibility to sin.
 - Emphasizes the role of the hypostatic union in grounding impeccability - not a separate divine override but the moral consequence of personal union with the divine Logos.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects kenotic models that imply Christ's moral vulnerability as like ours (posse peccare) and thereby weaken the ground for substitutionary atonement.
 - Challenges readings that reduce Hebrews 4:15 to mere exemplary sinlessness rather than an ontological impossibility to sin for the incarnate Son.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of classical latin technicalities (non posse peccare vs. posse non peccare) reframed within late-20th-century analytic-theological language about freedom and agency.
 - Reframes "impeccability" as compatible with genuine agency, avoiding caricatures of mechanical inerrancy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Respected in conservative Reformed seminaries and in pastoral literature as a clear contemporary defense of classical impeccability.
 - Cited in polemics against liberal/modernist and kenotic tendencies; used to defend traditional confessional Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students needing a disciplined, pastorally sensitive account that preserves both Christ's true humanity and the necessity of his sinlessness for redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability** - doctrine that Christ did not and could not sin.
- **Non posse peccare** - classical formula: incapacity to sin; Macleod defends this for the incarnate Son.
- **Posse tentari / tempted** - Christ could be genuinely tempted; distinguishes tempted-from-sin from able-to-sin.
- **Hypostatic union** - union of divine Person and human nature; locus for grounding impeccability.
- **Dyothelitism / two wills** - discussion of human will in Christ and its alignment with the divine will, securing non-culpable temptation.
- **Kenosis** - Christ's self-emptying; Macleod resists kenotic readings that imply moral or volitional deficiency.
- **Freedom / moral agency** - analyzed to show non-coercive, authentic volition compatible with impeccability.
- **Temptation texts (Hebrews 4:15; Luke 4)** - exegetical focal points demonstrating genuine temptation without sin.
- **Penal substitution** - atonement view that requires Christ's sinlessness; impeccability safeguards its coherence.
- **Representative obedience** - Christ's perfect obedience as legal and moral ground for justification; relies on his inability to sin.
- **Exemplar vs. vicarious obedience** - Macleod stresses vicarious/legal primacy while not denying exemplary value.
- **Assurance** - pastoral implication: Christ's impeccability secures believers' confidence in perfect substitute.
- **Hamartiology** - recurrent interplay with doctrine of sin and human liability.
- **Ontology vs. psychology** - distinguishes ontological incapacity to sin from psychological dispositions or motives.
- How this work is used:
 - As a concise **doctrine-definition source** for seminars on Christology and soteriology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against kenotic and liberal reinterpretations of Christ's freedom.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading temptation texts in pastoral and systematic contexts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking hypostatic union, freedom, and the logic of substitution.
