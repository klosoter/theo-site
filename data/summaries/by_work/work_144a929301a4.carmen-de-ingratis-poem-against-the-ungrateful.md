### TITLE
Carmen de Ingratis (Poem Against the Ungrateful) - Prosper of Aquitaine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-5th century Gaul (Prosper c. 390-455), in the immediate aftermath of the Pelagian controversy and the Council of Carthage (418).
 - Part of Prosper's broader Augustinian apologetical corpus: polemical prose and verse defending Augustine against Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian tendencies among Gallic clergy and laity.
 - Literary choice: a didactic polemical poem intended for wide clerical and monastic circulation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - A sharp literary denunciation of those "ungrateful" who reject Augustine's teaching on sin, grace, and predestination-i.e., opponents who deny the necessity or efficacy of divine grace for salvation.
 - The moral-polemical linkage: rejecting Augustine = ingratitude toward God and the truth that God revealed in Augustine's doctrine.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Opening invective against ingratitude: moral failure tied to doctrinal error.
 - Exposition of human inability: affirmation of radical need for divine aid (original sin, will weakened).
 - Defense of efficacious/prevenient grace and predestination: grace as decisive, not merely assisting.
 - Rebuke of Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian positions: human boasting in free will and merit is condemned.
 - Final warning: rejection of true doctrine leads to spiritual ruin and ecclesial disorder.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal figure: Augustine of Hippo (obedient defender).
 - Opponents named or obliquely targeted: Pelagius, Celestius, and their Gallic sympathizers; local semi‑Pelagian tendencies (e.g., monks and bishops minimizing Augustine's emphasis on grace).
 - Scriptural and Augustinian citations woven into poetic rhetoric.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin (original sin), human will and its impairment, grace (prevenient and/or efficacious), predestination/election, merit, ecclesial fidelity to doctrinal truth.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The poem centers on the claim that true gratitude to God is realized in accepting Augustine's teaching: salvation is an effect of sovereign, efficacious grace rather than human sufficiency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses moral vocabulary of "gratitude/ingratitude" to make theological rejection a moral and spiritual fault, not only an intellectual error.
 - Polemical vigor in verse-sharper moral condemnation than many prose treatises; literary form amplifies rhetorical pressure.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts directly with Pelagian optimism about free will and merit; opposes semi‑Pelagian compromises that presuppose an initiating human will.
 - Moves beyond abstract disputation by tying doctrinal dissent to pastoral and communal corruption.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the use of distinctly Augustinian vocabulary in Gaul; helped entrench the narrative that acceptance of Augustine equals doctrinal fidelity.
 - Reinforced the binary framing of Pelagianism vs. Augustinianism in later theological memory.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited by later medieval and Reformation defenders of predestination as patristic backing for Augustinian doctrines.
 - Used by opponents as an example of Augustinian severity; fuel for debates about pastoral temper and ecclesial unity.
 - Contributed to Prosper's reputation as Augustine's chief Latin champion in the West.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, rhetorical summary of the Augustinian case against Pelagianism and semi‑Pelagianism.
 - Useful for studying the intersection of rhetoric, pastoral judgment, and doctrinal formation in the post‑Augustinian church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gratia (Grace)** - central, efficacious, and necessary for any salvific movement; not merely enabling but decisive.
- **Ingratitudo (Ingratitude)** - moral category used to stigmatize rejection of Augustinian doctrine.
- **Libertus arbitrium (Free will)** - affirmed as real but profoundly impaired by sin; cannot initiate salvation without grace.
- **Peccatum originale (Original sin)** - human condition of deprivation that necessitates divine aid.
- **Praedestinatio (Predestination)** - affirmation of divine election; used to criticize any doctrine that makes salvation contingent on unaided human choice.
- **Meritum (Merit)** - denied as an adequate basis for salvation apart from grace.
- **Pelagianism** - the target: doctrine minimizing original sin and elevating human autonomy.
- **Semi‑Pelagianism** - the intermediate error Prosper combats: human initiation of salvation followed by divine assistance.
- **Augustinianism** - the programmatic stance: sovereignty of grace, primacy of divine causation in conversion.
- **Efficacious/prevenient grace** - concept stressed to counter claims of merely permissive or assistive grace.
- **Polemical poetry** - medium: verse used to shape memory and mobilize sentiment for doctrinal conformity.
- **Pastoral polemic** - combines pastoral concern (unity, holiness) with doctrinal urgency.
- **Ecclesial fidelity** - loyalty to Augustine presented as fidelity to truth and the church.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic**: exemplar of anti‑Pelagian vigor and moralizing rhetoric in doctrinal disputes.
 - As a **patristic warrant**: cited in debates over grace and predestination as evidence of early Western support for Augustine.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model**: demonstrates how doctrinal claims can be framed as pastoral necessities for church health and moral responsibility.
