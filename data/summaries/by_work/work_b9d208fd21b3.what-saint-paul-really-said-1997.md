### TITLE
**What Saint Paul Really Said** - N. T. Wright (1997)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical scholarship; part of the British "New Perspective on Paul" conversation sparked by E. P. Sanders and James D. G. Dunn.
 - Wright wrote as a historically informed Anglican NT scholar pushing against popular Reformation-era readings prevalent in evangelicalism and conservative Reformed circles.
 - Aimed at informed lay and academic readers during heated debates over justification, covenant, and first-century Judaism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's language of "justification" and "righteousness" primarily addresses **covenant membership and God's eschatological vindication** of his people, not the modern Protestant caricature of a forensic exchange (guilt imputation) focused on individual salvation apart from corporate covenant identity.
 - The question Paul answers: Who are God's people in the new age, Jews or Gentiles? Justification language functions to mark covenant inclusion and God's faithfulness.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-reconstructive method: locate Paul within first-century Judaism and Greco-Roman thought.
 - Recast key Pauline categories:
 - "Works of the law" = boundary markers (circumcision, food laws, calendar) that define belonging, not meritorious works earning salvation.
 - "Justification" = divine declaration of covenant status and vindication at the eschaton.
 - "Faith" = faithfulness/loyalty that signifies entry into the people of God.
 - Emphasizes narrative/eschatological reading: God's covenant story culminating in Christ, resurrection, and new creation.
 - Argues for a corporate, story-shaped Pauline theology rather than atomized forensic soteriology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and the broader New Perspective cohort.
 - Contrasts with classical Reformation interpreters (Luther, Calvin) and modern defenders of forensic imputation (e.g., John Piper, Douglas Moo, Tom Schreiner).
 - Draws on Second Temple Jewish studies, Greco-Roman social identity theory, and Pauline exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, righteousness of God, covenant, law and works, faith, ecclesiology (peoplehood), eschatology, union with Christ (implicit).

- **Closing line**
 - Wright reframes Paul as proclaiming the arrival of God's covenant people - vindicated and reconstituted in Christ - rather than primarily teaching a forensic, individualistic scheme of imputed righteousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats justification as primarily **covenantal/eschatological vindication** and marker of communal inclusion.
 - Heavy use of social-identity and narrative approaches to Paul; reads Pauline theology as corporate and story-driven.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges the common Protestant picture that Paul's main problem was individual guilt and forensic justification; seeks to correct what he sees as anachronistic readings.
 - Differs from Federal Vision proponents who emphasize covenantal objectivity and sacramental efficacy; Wright shares the covenantal stress but resists Federal Vision's sacramental/ontological claims and some participatory notions of justification.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "works of the law" as boundary markers rather than meritorious efforts.
 - Promotes reading "faith" as faithfulness and "justification" as vindication/status within covenant narrative.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in reshaping scholarly and some ecclesial conversations about Paul and justification.
 - Generated sustained pushback from conservative Reformed scholars who defend forensic imputation and classical Reformation categories.
 - Adopted selectively by some within Reformed and evangelical circles; also used critically by Federal Vision advocates, though Wright remains distinct from them.

- **Enduring value**
 - Forces renewed exegetical attention to Second Temple Judaism, first-century context, and narrative theology.
 - Serves as a locus classicus for debates over justification and for bridging historical scholarship with pastoral concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - Wright: divine declaration of covenant status and eschatological vindication; communal as well as individual implications.

- **Righteousness / righteousness of God**
 - Not merely forensic imputation; primary sense tied to God's covenant faithfulness and the vindication of his people.

- **Faith / faithfulness (pistis)**
 - Emphasis on loyalty and covenant fidelity rather than mere intellectual assent.

- **Works of the law**
 - Boundary markers (circumcision, dietary rules, calendar) that regulate ethnic/religious belonging, not meritorious works to earn salvation.

- **Covenant / peoplehood**
 - Central category: Paul's argument concerns who constitutes God's covenant people in the new creation.

- **Eschatological vindication**
 - Justification as future-oriented vindication by God at the parousia, already anticipated in Christ's work.

- **Imputation / forensic language**
 - Wright critiques reduction of Pauline language to forensic legal mechanics; sees imputation language downstream of larger covenantal story.

- **New Perspective on Paul**
 - Wright is a leading articulate voice; shares some commitments but advances distinct narrative and eschatological emphases.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Present in Wright's schema as the means of participation in the new covenant people, but framed corporately.

- **Law (nomos)**
 - Social boundary and identity function; not simply moral code vs. grace polemic.

- **Boundary markers**
 - Practical practices signifying who belongs to the covenant community.

- **Eschatology / new creation**
 - Framework in which Paul's language of justification and righteousness operates.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for the New Perspective and covenantal readings of Paul.
- As a **polemic** against classical Reformation-forensic readings of justification.
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing historical context, narrative, and social-identity analysis for Pauline studies.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates that include Federal Vision conversations, where it is cited for covenant emphases but also critiqued for where it diverges from sacramental/forensic positions.
