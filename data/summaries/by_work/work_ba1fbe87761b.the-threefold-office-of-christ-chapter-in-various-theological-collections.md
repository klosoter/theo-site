### TITLE
The Threefold Office of Christ (Munus Triplex) - Donald Macleod

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed theological milieu; chapter in collections dealing with Christology and practical doctrine. Macleod writes within Scottish evangelical/Reformed scholarship, engaging both confessional tradition (Westminster, Reformed scholasticism) and contemporary theological conversation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ's threefold office (prophet, priest, king) is a single, indivisible mediatorial ministry expressed in distinct but interrelated functions. Properly construed, the munus triplex preserves Christ's unity of person while clarifying distinct roles for understanding revelation, atonement, and rule.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation of the historical threefold schema as theologically useful and biblically grounded.
 - Exposition of each office:
 - **Prophet:** Christ as ultimate revealer - fulfillment of Mosaic prophecy, inaugurator of final revelation through Word and Spirit.
 - **Priest:** Christ as sacrificer and intercessor - once-for-all atonement, high-priestly intercession, and the continuity/contrast with Aaronic priesthood.
 - **King:** Christ as sovereign ruler - present mediatorial rule and future consummation in the kingdom.
 - Integration: show functional distinctions without implying ontological division; each office illuminates aspects of redemption in covenantal context.
 - Practical implications: pastoral identity, worship, sacraments, mission and eschatology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformation and Puritan sources (Calvin, Westminster standards), Reformed systematicians (Bavinck, Murray), engagement with modern critics and constructive voices (Barthian concerns about over-formalization; Torrance on mediatorship).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and work), covenant theology, revelation, atonement, priesthood, kingship, ecclesiology (ministry and sacraments), eschatology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The munus triplex, rightly understood, secures Christ's single mediatorial person as the source of revelation, redemption, and rule - a unity of offices that grounds doctrine and devotion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **functional unity**: offices are roles of one person rather than separable natures or successive careers.
 - Emphasis on covenantal and pastoral implications - offices are not merely abstract categories but shape worship, sacraments, and mission.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects overly schematic or compartmentalized readings that treat offices as independent or sequential (e.g., purely chronological "prophet then priest then king").
 - Pushes back against neo-Barthian tendencies to abandon traditional categories, arguing they remain the best grammar for biblical Christology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies **functional/ontological distinction** in practical terms: offices as relational roles in history and eschatology.
 - Nuanced treatment of **priesthood** that integrates substitutionary atonement with ongoing intercession.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles for exegetical clarity and pastoral applicability.
 - Cited in discussions on ministry formation, preaching, and sacramental theology; used as corrective to reductionist Christologies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, balanced model for teaching Christ's work across systematic loci and practical ministry formation.
 - Useful bridge between confessional tradition and contemporary theological concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus triplex:** Latin term for the threefold office - prophet, priest, king; organizing principle of Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Prophet (office):** Christ as final revealer - fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, Word incarnate, and normative interpreter of God's covenant.
- **Priest (office):** Christ as sacrificer and intercessor - once-for-all atonement, continuous high-priestly advocacy before the Father.
- **King (office):** Christ as sovereign ruler - present mediatorial reign and future consummation over the kingdom.
- **Functional vs. ontological distinction:** Offices denote roles/relations in redemption without dividing Christ's person or nature.
- **Mediatorship:** Christ's single role as mediator between God and humans, the integrative category for all three offices.
- **Typology:** Use of Old Testament types (Moses, Aaron, David) to illumine the offices without collapsing correspondence into identity.
- **Covenantal frame:** The three offices are interpreted within covenant history - promise, fulfillment, consummation.
- **Atonement language:** Substitutionary, representative, and intercessory motifs are balanced in the priestly account.
- **Revelation / Word and Spirit:** Prophetic office emphasizes objective Word incarnate and subjective work of the Spirit.
- **Regal rule and eschatology:** Kingly office connects present governance of the church to future consummation.
- **Confessional grounding:** Appeals to Westminster and Reformed confessions for doctrinal anchors.
- **Pastoral application:** Offices inform preaching, sacramental theology, and pastoral identity.
- **Unity of person / distinction of office:** Repeated theological hinge to avoid modalism or Nestorian division.
- **Typological continuity vs. discontinuity:** Affirmed continuity with Israel's offices but stresses Christ's qualitative uniqueness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for teaching the threefold office in systematic theology and confessional instruction.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Christ in Old Testament types and New Testament fulfillment.
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductionist or fragmented Christologies that separate offices or deny their pastoral import.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and sacramental theology to integrate Christ's revelation, atonement, and reign.
