### TITLE
The New Testament and the People of God - N. T. Wright (Christian Origins and the Question of God, Vol. 1; SPCK/Fortress, 1992)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 1990s academic evangelical milieu; part of Wright's multi-volume program to retell Christian origins in the light of Jewish Second Temple context and narrative biblical theology.
 - Reaction to liberal historical-critical reductionism and to both classical Protestant dogmatics and certain strands of historical Jesus research.

- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament must be read as the climactic chapter of Israel's covenant-history: Jesus and the early church are best understood as the fulfillment of Israel's story, calling Israel (and the nations) into covenantal peoplehood under the promised king and covenantal blessings.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Reconstructs Jewish Second Temple background and expectations for Israel's future.
 - Re-reads Jesus as the eschatological agent who embodies and advances Israel's vocation (true Israel/true David).
 - Interprets earliest Christian writings as corporate, covenantal responses that constitute a renewed people of God rather than merely individual conversions.
 - Develops a program of biblical theology that privileges narrative shape over systematized propositions.
 - Argues for an "already/not yet" eschatology: kingdom inaugurated in Jesus, consummated at parousia.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Sanders and the "New Perspective on Paul" (NPP), Bultmannian and form-critical traditions, Käsemann and eschatological theologians, traditional Reformed interpreters on justification.
 - Uses Second Temple Jewish literature, OT narrative, synoptic Gospels, Pauline and Johannine corpora.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (narrative self-disclosure), covenant and election (corporate, covenantal identity), Christology (Jesus as covenant-fulfilling king), ecclesiology (people of God), eschatology (inaugurated eschatology; parousia), justification (reinterpreted in covenantal terms).

- **Site usage: five focused references (topics)**
 - **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology:** opening methodological chapters arguing for narrative biblical theology as primary.
 - **Justification / Forensic Imputation / NPP Critiques:** sustained critique and reworking of justification language in light of covenant and Pauline context.
 - **Christ in OT and NT:** chapters showing Jesus as fulfillment of Israel's hopes, typological reading of Davidic kingship.
 - **Typology and Fulfillment:** treatment of how OT types find their story-shaped fulfillment in Jesus and the church.
 - **Delay of the Parousia:** discussion of "already/not yet" and early Christian expectations about the delayed parousia and its theological adjustments.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Wright re-centers Christian doctrine on covenant-historical narrative: the New Testament narrates how Israel's God fulfills his promises in Jesus, thereby constituting a renewed corporate people called to embody God's eschatological kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of biblical narrative and corporate identity over abstract doctrinal formulations.
 - Christ as the climax of Israel's story - Jesus as corporate "true Israel" and sovereign Davidic agent.
 - Recasting justification within covenantal membership and covenant faithfulness rather than primarily forensic categories.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Challenges both liberal form-critical reductionism and atomistic individualistic readings of salvation typical in some Protestant traditions.
 - Modifies aspects of Sanders' NPP by insisting on continuity between Judaism and early Christianity while also reasserting the distinctiveness of Christian claims about Jesus.
 - Critiques traditional Protestant emphasis on forensic imputation as the exclusive frame for Pauline soteriology.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulation of "people of God" as corporate, covenantal status central to New Testament theology.
 - Emphasis on typology as narrative coherence rather than allegorical proof-texting.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed renewed interest in biblical theology and the New Perspective debates; foundational for later Wright volumes.
 - Widely influential in evangelical scholarship and contested in confessional Reformed circles over justification and forensic language.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating Second Temple context with NT theology; indispensable for courses on biblical theology, Paul and Jesus studies, and for rethinking ecclesiology and eschatology in narrative terms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **People of God**
 - Corporate, covenantal identity constituting the Church as continuation and expansion of Israel.
- **Biblical theology**
 - Methodological priority: scripture's own storyline governs doctrinal reflection.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Wright as a major proponent/mediator; reframes Paul's language of works, law, and covenant membership.
- **Justification**
 - Reinterpreted toward covenantal verdict or declaration of who belongs to God's covenant family; critiques exclusive forensic readings.
 - Contrast: Wright's "covenantal" emphasis vs traditional "forensic imputation" models.
- **Forensic imputation**
 - Classical Protestant term Wright critiques as insufficient alone to capture Pauline usage.
- **Typology / Fulfillment**
 - OT persons/events (Israel, David, temple) function as types fulfilled in Christ and the church's vocation.
- **Christ in OT and NT**
 - Jesus as fulfillment of Israel's hopes - both continuity with and climax of the OT story.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Kingdom "already" inaugurated by Jesus (resurrection) and "not yet" consummated at parousia.
- **Parousia / Delay of the Parousia**
 - Treatment of early Christian adjustment to delayed expectation; theological implications for mission and endurance.
- **Covenant**
 - Central interpretive key: God's relational, narrative commitments to Israel and the nations.
- **Corporate election / election**
 - Election as call to covenant peoplehood rather than merely individual predestination.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for biblical-theological methods and "people of God" frameworks.
 - As a **polemic** and resource in debates over justification and the New Perspective on Paul.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Jesus, Paul, and the Gospels in Second Temple Jewish narrative context.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for courses rethinking ecclesiology and inaugurated eschatology.
