### TITLE
Eccentric Existence: A Theological Anthropology - David Kelsey

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the late 20th century (1970s-1980s era of renewed doctrinal retrieval), Kelsey writes from a Reformed theological horizon reacting to modern secularizing anthropology, existentialist self-centered accounts of personhood, and reductionist social-scientific models. The work participates in a broader retrieval of doctrinally rooted systematic theology attentive to pastoral and ethical consequences.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Human persons are not self-centered subjects but creatures whose existence is **eccentrically** oriented toward God; theological anthropology must begin with the divine act and address (God's initiative) rather than with autonomous human subjectivity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Critique of competing anthropologies:** denounces accounts that locate the person's center within the self (psychological autonomy, existentialist inwardness) or that explain persons purely functionally or sociologically.
 - **Positive proposal - 'eccentric existence':** persons are constituted by a relation to God in which their ontological center lies beyond themselves; this is not merely normative advice but the ontological shape of creatureliness.
 - **God's initiative and human response:** theological anthropology is transactional - God addresses, creates, calls; humans are called to responsive existence (vocation, obedience, faith).
 - **Doctrine integrated:** sin distorts eccentricity (making the self center); Christ and the Spirit restore and reorient personal existence toward God, realized in vocation, ecclesial life, and eschatological consummation.
 - **Methodological move:** argues for an anthropology derived from Christian doctrinal commitments (Trinity, creation, redemption), not from independent philosophical anthropology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages the Reformed tradition broadly and doctrinal theologians (explicitly drawing on and critiquing Barthian emphases on divine initiative while also resisting purely existentialist appropriations); interacts with modern philosophical currents (existentialism, analytic trends) and with pastoral-theological concerns.
- **Doctrines treated:** primary focus on **anthropology**; also draws on **doctrine of God (divine initiative and relation), Christology (reorientation in Christ), pneumatology (life and response), sin and grace, vocation, ecclesiology, and eschatology** as consequences for personal existence and communal life.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Theologically speaking, to be human is to exist eccentrically - to be a creature whose true center is constituted by God's initiative and call, and whose flourishing consists in answering that call in covenantal, Christ-shaped community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Eccentricity as ontological category:** reframes personhood not as centered selfhood but as a creaturely orientation whose center is elsewhere (God).
 - **Doctrine-first anthropology:** insists doctrines (Trinity, creation, redemption) are constitutive resources for correctly framing human existence.
 - **Ethical and vocational traction:** links ontological claim to practical life - vocation, moral responsibility, and ecclesial participation become the locus where eccentric existence is lived out.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - **Against existentialist inwardness:** rejects the move to make subjectivity the starting point for theology of the person.
 - **Against reductionist social/psychological accounts:** resists treating persons as mere outcomes of social functions or psychological states.
 - **Reshapes Barthian emphases:** takes Barth's stress on divine initiative further into constructive anthropology while pressing for clearer ethical and communal implications.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The core term **"eccentric existence"** becomes an organizing concept for connecting ontology, ethics, and ecclesiology.
 - Emphasizes **address-response** model as the shaping grammar of human existence.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely respected among Reformed and mainline theologians as a robust, doctrinally rooted anthropology.
 - Influenced subsequent work on vocation, ecclesial identity, and theological ethics; used in seminary curricula for systematic and pastoral theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, doctrinally integrated corrective to secular anthropologies.
 - Serves as a bridge between systematic doctrine and moral/pastoral praxis - valuable for courses on anthropology, ethics, and ministry formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eccentric existence:** central term; human persons are constituted by a center that lies outside themselves - namely God.
- **Address-response:** theological grammar: God's initiative (address) and human reply (response) define personal life.
- **Creatureliness:** emphasis on finitude and dependence; human identity is derivative, not self-grounding.
- **Vocation:** the concrete mode of living out eccentric existence - calling defines ethical roles and community life.
- **Divine initiative:** God's action is ontologically prior to human being; grounding for human orientation.
- **Sin as centration:** sin re-centers the self, subverting eccentricity and producing idolatrous personhood.
- **Restoration in Christ:** Christ reconstitutes human eccentricity, enabling right relation to God and others.
- **Pneumatological appropriation:** the Spirit effectuates the response and communal life necessary for eccentric existence.
- **Normative doctrinal method:** theology begins with creedal/doctrinal loci rather than autonomous philosophical anthropology.
- **Relational ontology:** persons are essentially relational, not atomistic subjects.
- **Ecclesial embodiment:** the church is the primary context where eccentric existence is formed and practiced.
- **Eschatological consummation:** final fulfillment of eccentric existence in redeemed community before God.
- **Critique of autonomy:** polemical stance toward modern notions of self-sufficiency.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for theological anthropology - supplies core categories for curricula and research.
- As a **polemic** against secular and existentialist anthropologies - used to reframe debates about personhood.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine (Trinity, redemption) to ethics, vocation, and ecclesiology in teaching and pastoral formation.
