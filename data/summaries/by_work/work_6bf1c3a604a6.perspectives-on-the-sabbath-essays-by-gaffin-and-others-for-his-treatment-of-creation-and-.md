### TITLE
Perspectives on the Sabbath: Essays by Richard B. Gaffin Jr. - treatment of **Creation and Rest** (focus on Genesis 1-2; relation to Science & Scripture debate, Genesis 1-11)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed evangelical conversation. Roots in confessional Reformed theology (Westminster tradition) and in contemporary debates over Sabbath observance, hermeneutics of Genesis, and the relation of creation theology to Christian worship.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** The Sabbath is grounded in the Creator's work (Genesis 1-2) and finds its consummation in Christ and the eschatological rest promised in Scripture; therefore Sabbath theology must be read both creationally and christologically, not merely as Mosaic civil ritual or optional piety.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reclaims **Genesis 1-2** as the theological locus for Sabbath (a creation ordinance), not purely a Mosaic institution.
 - Interprets Sabbath typologically: the seventh-day rest anticipates and is fulfilled in Christ (cf. Hebrews 3-4), linking creation, redemption, and consummation.
 - Distinguishes descriptive cosmology from theological function: Genesis' creation account supplies covenantal and worship-shaping truth even where modern science/Scripture debates press on chronological or methodological questions.
 - Applies the doctrine to ecclesial practice: Sabbath observance is shaped by covenant identity under Christ, avoiding both legalistic formalism and antinomian dismissal.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Genesis 1-2; Exodus 20; Hebrews 3-4); Reformed confessions (Westminster standards); contemporary sabbatarian and anti-sabbatarian voices; broader science/scripture interlocutors insofar as Genesis 1-11 interpretation affects Sabbath grounding.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, covenant, typology, Christology (fulfillment of rest), eschatology (final rest), law and gospel, ecclesiology (worship practice), hermeneutics of Genesis.
- **Closing line:** Gaffin situates Sabbath as a creation-ordained, christologically fulfilled sign of covenantal rest that integrates Genesis' theological horizon with New Testament consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong emphasis on **creational origin** of Sabbath as constitutive for covenant identity, not merely a Sinai regulation.
 - Stress on **typological continuity**: Sabbath as a creational sign that finds its true meaning in Christ's person and work and in the eschaton.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on treatments that reduce Sabbath to Mosaic civil law or to purely moral-ethical categories; resists pietistic formalism that separates Sabbath practice from Christ-centered theology.
 - Contrasts with antinomian tendencies that detach worship practice from creational and covenantal grounding.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Frames Sabbath primarily as a **covenantal-typological institution** rather than merely a legal command; highlights the interplay of "creation ordinance" and "eschatological fulfillment."
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed circles for re-anchoring Sabbath theology in creation and Hebrews-centered typology.
 - Used as a corrective in wider evangelical debates that pit scientific readings of Genesis against theological readings; offers a model for integrating theological exegesis with respect for scientific questions without losing doctrinal commitments.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Supplies a durable hermeneutic for teaching Sabbath doctrine across pulpits and classrooms: read Genesis theologically, locate Sabbath in creation and covenant, and interpret fulfillment christologically.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation ordinance**
 - Sabbath originates in the Creator's rest (Genesis 1-2) and shapes humanity's covenantal ordering.
- **Sabbath-rest**
 - The present practice and future eschatological reality; both a sign and a promise.
- **Typology**
 - Sabbath as a type pointing forward to Christ and final rest (Hebrews 3-4).
- **Covenant sign**
 - The Sabbath functions analogously to other covenant signs (e.g., circumcision) as identity-marker for God's people.
- **Christological fulfillment**
 - The true realization of Sabbath-rest in the person and work of Christ.
- **Eschatological consummation**
 - Sabbath anticipates the final Sabbath-rest of God's people in the new creation.
- **Hermeneutics of Genesis**
 - Emphasizes Genesis' theological intent over modern methodological claims; reads Genesis 1-11 as foundational for worship and covenant theology.
- **Law and Gospel relation**
 - Sabbath interpreted within the law/gospel framework: binding as covenant sign but intelligible and fulfilled in gospel realities.
- **Sabbatarianism (Reformed)**
 - Distinguishes confessional Reformed views that see normative Sabbath obligations from stricter pietistic forms.
- **Antinomianism (critique)**
 - Identifies the danger of dismissing Sabbath practice by appeal to freedom that severs worship from creational roots.
- **Hebrews 3-4 usage**
 - Central New Testament locus for arguing continuity between creation-rest and Christ's rest.
- **Genesis 1-2 focus**
 - Primary scriptural ground for the claim that Sabbath is creational and covenantal.
- **Science & Scripture (Genesis 1-11) relation**
 - Treats scientific questions as secondary to Genesis' covenantal and theological claims about Sabbath, allowing theological reading to shape ecclesial practice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-2 theologically and integrating Hebrews' rest motif.
- As a **definition source** in Reformed teaching on the Sabbath (creational origin + Christological fulfillment).
- As a **polemic resource** against both legalistic sabbatarianism and antinomian neglect of Sabbath practice.
