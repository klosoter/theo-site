### TITLE
Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church: The Search for Definition (ed. Craig A. Blaising)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate over the relation of Israel and the church; reaction to classic dispensationalism and rise of revisionist forms (notably *progressive dispensationalism*).
 - Milieu: broad evangelical academic conversation involving conservative Protestants, dispensationalists, and covenantal critics; intersects with contemporaneous debates over eschatology and ecclesiology (see: *Progressive Covenantalism*; *Millennial Views*).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The book seeks to clarify and define what "dispensationalism" means for the relation between Israel and the church and to test whether revised dispensational formulations can account for biblical continuity without collapsing into covenant theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: identifies core commitments of classical dispensationalism (distinction of peoples/programs, future prophetic fulfillment) and perceived weaknesses (sharp discontinuities, hermeneutical claims).
 - Proposals: presents revisionist positions that maintain dispensational distinctives but allow greater theological continuity (partial fulfillment, ethical/typological continuity).
 - Assessment: evaluates exegetical and theological viability of these revisions, comparing them with covenantal alternatives and addressing implications for eschatology (millennium, kingdom promises).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Internal evangelical interlocutors: classical dispensational proponents, progressive dispensationalists, and revisionists.
 - External interlocutors: covenant theologians and proponents of progressive covenantalism; conservative Reformed critics on ecclesiology and covenant continuity.
 - Sources: biblical exegesis across Old and New Testaments, historical patterns of interpretation, theological-systematic reflection.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant), ecclesiology (people of God; nature of the church), eschatology (millennium and kingdom promises), hermeneutics of prophecy, Christology in fulfillment motifs, soteriology as related to covenant membership.
- **Closing line**
 - The volume's theological center of gravity: to preserve dispensational distinctives while rethinking continuity and fulfillment so as to offer a defensible evangelical account of Israel, the church, and the kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Moves beyond rigid classical partitions by insisting on *qualified continuity*: biblical promises can have programmatic, typological, and future literal fulfillment without erasing theological links between Israel and the church.
 - Emphasizes nuanced hermeneutics that combine historical-grammatical literalism with redemptive-historical sensibilities.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects classical dispensationalism's tendency toward absolute disjunction by allowing corporate and typological continuity.
 - Contrasts with covenant theology and *progressive covenantalism* by retaining distinctive future hopes for ethnic Israel and particular promise-fulfillment patterns.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines distinctions such as *programmatic promises* vs *redemptive-historical fulfillment*, and clarifies "people of God" as a category that can be both continuity-bearing and eschatologically differentiated.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within evangelical scholarship as a moderating voice; contributed to the wider acceptance of progressive dispensational formulations.
 - Provoked sustained critique from covenant theologians and spurred further refinement of both dispensational and covenantal positions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a benchmark for intra-evangelical definitions of dispensationalism and a teaching resource for demonstrating how hermeneutics, covenant thinking, and eschatology interrelate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dispensationalism**
 - System distinguishing God's programs/administrations for Israel and the church; emphasis on prophetic fulfillment.
- **Progressive Dispensationalism**
 - Revisionist form that affirms continuity in promise fulfillment while retaining a distinct future for ethnic Israel.
- **Progressive Covenantalism**
 - Cited as a contrasting approach that emphasizes unified covenantal development and minimizes future ethnic promises to Israel.
- **Israel / Church distinction**
 - Central category: how corporate identity, promises, and roles differ or overlap between the two.
- **People of God**
 - Used to negotiate ecclesiological continuity: corporate identity can include typological inclusion without erasing national promises.
- **Covenants (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)**
 - Treated as loci of promise and fulfillment; distinction between unconditional promises (e.g., land, seed) and covenantal enactments.
- **Programmatic promises vs. Fulfillment**
 - Programmatic: promises setting out God's plan; Fulfillment: stages (partial, typological, final).
- **Already / Not-Yet**
 - Employed to describe partial realizations of kingdom promises in Christ and the church, awaiting consummation for ethnic/national elements.
- **Kingdom**
 - Explored as both present spiritual reign and future promised earthly reign tied to Israel.
- **Millennium / Millennial Views**
 - Engages eschatological permutations (premillennial emphases most prominent), and contrasts with amill/postmill positions in implications for Israel-church relations.
- **Hermeneutics (literal vs. typological)**
 - Advocates calibrated literalism that allows typological senses without allegorizing.
- **Redemptive-historical**
 - Framework used to trace progressive fulfillment across Israel to church to consummation.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional resource for revised dispensational categories within evangelical studies.
 - As a polemical and exegetical model vis-a-vis both classical dispensationalism and progressive covenantal critiques.
 - As a conceptual pivot in teaching eschatology and ecclesiology where keeping promise continuity and future ethnic Israel are in tension.
