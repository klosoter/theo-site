### TITLE
Confession Concerning Christ's Supper (1528) - Martin Luther

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1528 during early Lutheran Reformation controversies over the Lord's Supper; follows contentious exchanges with Swiss reformers (notably Zwingli) and Roman Catholic sacramental theology.
 - Theological milieu: urgent pastoral and polemical need to fix a Reformation eucharistic doctrine for Lutheran congregations; formative for later Lutheran orthodoxy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defend **the real, true presence of Christ in the Eucharist** while rejecting Roman transubstantiation and Zwinglian memorialism. Christ's body and blood are truly present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine by virtue of Christ's person.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical insistence on the words of institution: "This is my body" must be taken literally and authoritatively.
 - Christological resolution: appeal to the **Hypostatic Union** and the **Communicatio Idiomatum** to show how the human nature of Christ can be present beyond normal spatial limitations.
 - Distinction from Roman scholastic accounts: denies Aristotelian substantial change; affirms a sacramental or "sacramental union" (later vocabulary) by which the body and blood are present through the Word.
 - Pastoral application: rules for who may receive (fencing the table) and admonitions to faith as the means that receives the gift.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Polemic against Huldrych Zwingli (memorialism) and against Roman theologians who defended transubstantiation.
 - Uses Scripture (institution narratives, Pauline passages) and patristic/medieval Christological categories; presupposes debates on communication of attributes.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (Hypostatic Union; communicatio idiomatum)
 - **Sacramentology** (Lord's Supper; real presence; means of grace)
 - Ecclesiology/pastoral practice (fencing the table; admission)
 - Soteriology and faith as instrument to receive sacramental benefits

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on a Christologically grounded eucharistic realism: because the human nature of the Word is united to the divine person, Christ's body and blood are truly present and distributed in the Supper by the Word, to be received by faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Moves the debate from metaphysical categories of "substance" to a **Christological solution**: presence is accounted for by the person of Christ rather than by Aristotelian transubstantiation.
 - Strong pastoral concern for **fencing the table**-Luther links doctrinal clarity to disciplined admission to the Sacrament.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Rome: rejects scholastic transubstantiation and metaphysical change of substance.
 - Against Zwingli: rejects pure memorialism and spiritual-only presence; insists on objective, real presence grounded in the person of Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Implicit development of what later Lutheranism terms **sacramental union** (bread remains bread while Christ's body is truly present).
 - Prominent use of **communicatio idiomatum** to explain the communicable attributes (e.g., ubiquity) conveyed through the hypostatic union.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate formation of Lutheran eucharistic identity; provoked sustained debate with Reformed theologians (Calvin developed a different spiritual presence account).
 - Influenced Lutheran orthodoxy to develop doctrines of ubiquity, communicatio idiomatum, and precise liturgical admission rules.
 - Remains a primary primary-source locus for Lutheran sacramental theology and polemic.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise model of how Christology can determine sacramental ontology; valuable in teaching the intersection of doctrine and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; used to justify how Christ's human nature can participate in divine attributes relevant to sacramental presence.

- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - The "communication of properties" between Christ's natures; Luther uses it to argue that certain attributes (e.g., ubiquity) can be spoken of Christ's human nature because they are ascribed to the one person.

- **Sacramental Union**
 - (Lutheran technicalization of Luther's claim) The mode by which Christ's body and blood are truly present "with" the bread and wine without change of substance.

- **Real Presence**
 - The doctrine that Christ's body and blood are really (not merely symbolically) present in the Lord's Supper.

- **Ubiquity (omnipresence) of Christ's human nature**
 - A controversial inference: because of the hypostatic union, Christ's human nature can be truly present beyond its earthly localization; used to secure presence at the Supper.

- **Fencing the Table / Admission**
 - Ecclesial practice of restricting the Sacrament to those properly instructed and professing faith; Luther ties doctrinal fidelity to pastoral gatekeeping.

- **"This is my body" - literalist Eucharistic hermeneutic**
 - Luther treats the words of institution as normative and decisive against symbolic reinterpretation.

- **Memorialism**
 - The view (associated with Zwingli) that the Supper is purely symbolic; explicitly rejected.

- **Transubstantiation**
 - Roman Catholic claim of substantial change; rejected as unnecessary and philosophically dependent on Aristotelian categories.

- **Means of grace**
 - The Lord's Supper as an objective instrument through which Christ offers forgiveness and life to believers when received by faith.

- **Faith as receiver**
 - Faith is the necessary instrument that appropriates the sacramental gift despite its objective presence.

- **Word and sacrament**
 - Luther stresses the inseparable role of the spoken Word of institution in effecting presence.

How this work is used across loci:
- Definition source for **Lutheran sacramental theology** (real presence, sacramental union).
- Polemic and historical source in debates on **Communicatio Idiomatum** and **Hypostatic Union** applications to sacrament.
- Exegetical and pastoral model for **fencing the table** and linking doctrine to admission practice.
