### TITLE
**Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology (2011) - John H. Walton**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 2011 within contemporary evangelical scholarship engaging ANE studies and science-theology dialogue.
 - Part of a broader shift away from materialist readings of Genesis toward functionally oriented hermeneutics influenced by comparative Near Eastern texts and cognitive linguistics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1 is best understood as **ancient cosmology**: a description of the assigning of functions and roles to the cosmos (a functional ontology), not a scientific account of material origins.
 - The text communicates Israelite theological concerns (e.g., order, divine sovereignty, temple motifs) in categories native to its ancient audience.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of ANE cosmological thought and language to establish genre expectations.
 - Lexical and syntactic exegesis of Genesis 1 emphasizing verbs of assignment and inauguration rather than material creation verbs.
 - Thematic reading: parallels between temple rites/installation and the seven-day structure (day 7 as cosmic Sabbath/temple consecration).
 - Implications for the doctrine of creation, image-bearing, and the relationship between Scripture and modern science.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Extensive engagement with ANE texts (Enuma Elish, Mesopotamian temple literature), contemporary OT scholars, and debates in evangelicalism (young-earth creationists, old-earth views, concordism).
 - Dialogues implicitly with traditional doctrinal expositions that read Genesis 1 as material origins narrative.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: genre and accommodation in divine speech.
 - **Creation theology**: redefines "creation" emphasis from material origin to function and purpose; implications for creation ex nihilo are treated cautiously.
 - **Anthropology**: image of God reframed as functional/relational office.
 - Indirect implications for ecclesiology and Sabbath theology via temple/ritual motifs.

- **Closing line**
 - Genesis 1 primarily inaugurates the ordered, functioning cosmos as God's temple-work; its theological center is divine sovereignty over roles and purpose rather than technical material origins.

- **Applied/used in site topics**
 - Days Of Creation
 - Science And Scripture (Genesis 1-11)

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on **functional ontology**: being as functioning, not primarily as material constitution.
 - Reading the seven-day structure as **ritual/temple inauguration** with significance for Sabbath theology.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Challenges concordist and literal-materialist readings (both young-earth and some old-earth frameworks that seek material sequencing).
 - Distances itself from attempts to force Genesis into modern scientific categories; argues for category distinction between ancient narrative intention and modern empirical explanation.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - "Functional ontology" as a hermeneutical key.
 - Recast of "image of God" as an office/function rather than merely an ontological attribute.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical circles for providing a non-concordist model reconciling trust in Scripture with acceptance of mainstream science.
 - Provoked critique from conservative literalists who contend Walton minimizes material creation and historical claims; also engaged by biblical scholars refining genre analysis.
 - Adopted in seminary classrooms as a leading exegetical model for Genesis 1.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable hermeneutical pivot for theology-and-science conversations.
 - Useful corrective to anachronistic readings; stimulates rethinking of biblical genres and ancient cognitive categories for biblical theology and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Functional ontology**
 - Primary hermeneutical lens: "what something is" defined by its function/role rather than material composition.

- **Cosmic temple / temple inauguration**
 - Genesis 1 as account of God installing functions in the cosmos, akin to consecrating a temple; Day 7 = cosmic Sabbath consecration.

- **Days as functional ordering**
 - The "days" are organizational/functional phases, not necessarily material-temporal manufacturing stages.

- **Tohu wabohu**
 - "Formless and void" interpreted as lack of ordered function, not total nonexistence of matter.

- **Raqia (firmament)**
 - Read as functional structure in ANE thought (an ordering device), not modern physical sky mechanics.

- **Image of God (imago Dei)**
 - Emphasized as office/role (representative function) - humans given tasks within the ordered system.

- **Divine fiat vs. assignment language**
 - Focus on verbs that assign roles and populate functions, rather than metaphysical creation-from-nothing claims.

- **Genre: ancient cosmology**
 - Distinguishes from modern scientific or metaphysical genres; anchors interpretation in ANE literary conventions.

- **Accommodation**
 - Scripture accommodates ancient cognitive frameworks without endorsing their empirical models.

- **Science-scripture category distinction**
 - Argues for non-overlapping but complementary domains: Genesis 1 answers "Why order and roles?" not "How material processes occurred."

- **Sabbath theology**
 - Day 7 as theological climax: establishes divine rest and liturgical-ritual significance for creation.

- **Reception term: non-concordism**
 - Walton's approach is often characterized as non-concordist - resisting direct correlation of days to scientific chronology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** in OT studies and preaching to reframe Genesis 1's aim (hermeneutical exemplar).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in science-and-religion dialogue to defuse conflict by separating ancient cosmological intent from modern scientific questions.
- As a **polemic resource** against literal-materialist readings (frequently cited in debates on Days Of Creation and Science And Scripture, Genesis 1-11).
