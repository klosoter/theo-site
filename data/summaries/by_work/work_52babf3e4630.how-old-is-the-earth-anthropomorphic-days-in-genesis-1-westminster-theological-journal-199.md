### TITLE
How Old Is the Earth? Anthropomorphic Days in Genesis 1 - C. John Collins, Westminster Theological Journal (1994)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical scholarship grappling with conflicts between young-earth creationism, day-age and concordist readings, and increasingly sophisticated geological/astronomical data.
 - Westminster Theological Journal audience: conservative Reformed scholars concerned with inerrancy and faithful exegesis.
- **Central thesis**
 - The "days" of Genesis 1 are best understood as **anthropomorphic temporal descriptions**-God's creative actions described in human temporal categories-so Genesis 1 is not primarily a scientific chronology and does not unambiguously fix the earth's age.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: survey of Hebrew term **yom** and its semantic range; context-driven meaning when used in divine-account contexts.
 - Literary/genre moves: Genesis 1 as theological narrative using human-oriented categories (phenomenological language), not scientific reportage.
 - Theological hermeneutics: appeal to **accommodation**-God condescends to human modes of speech-so literalist chronologizing reads the text beyond its communicative intent.
 - Polemical critique: rejects both strict young-earth literalism that reads days as strict solar 24-hour periods and simplistic concordism that forces modern scientific epochs into the biblical days.
 - Practical implication: the question "How old is the earth?" is not decisively answered by Genesis 1; proper exegesis frees theology from unnecessary conflict with well-established natural science while retaining doctrinal commitments.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit critique of young-earth authors (creationist movement) and certain concordists; engages with Hebrew linguistic precedents and reformational hermeneutical concerns rather than a single named rival.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and divine accommodation, biblical authority/inerrancy (methodological implications), doctrine of creation (creatio ex nihilo, temporal ordering), hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - Genesis 1 communicates theological truth about God as Creator using **human temporal language**; it is exegetically unwarranted to use it as a scientific chronometer for the earth's age.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Coines textual-linguistic caution with doctrinal fidelity: insists on honoring biblical genre and authorial intent while protecting inerrancy from concordist distortions.
 - Centers **anthropomorphic language** as a hermeneutical key rather than defaulting to literalist chronology or purely literary/analogical models.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Young Earth readings that treat yom as invariably 24-hour when used in the creation week; shows flexibility in semantic range given context and divine perspective.
 - Opposes naive concordism that shoehorns scientific epoch into biblical days without attention to genre or accommodation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames creation "days" explicitly as a class of anthropomorphic temporal descriptors-this term clarifies debates by moving focus from semantics of yom alone to the communicative strategy (anthropomorphism).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by many evangelicals seeking a middle way between Young Earth literalism and wholesale demythologizing readings.
 - Influential in discussions of hermeneutics between conservative exegetes and scientifically informed theologians; cited as a careful example of defending Scripture while acknowledging scientific data.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for integrating linguistic exegesis, theological doctrine (accommodation), and epistemic humility; remains a staple citation in evangelical treatments of Genesis 1.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anthropomorphic days**
 - Days described from a human viewpoint; not necessarily identical to solar 24-hour periods when applied to divine acts.
- **Yom**
 - Hebrew "day"; semantic range includes 24-hour day, daylight portion, era/age, and metaphorical uses-context determines sense.
- **Accommodation**
 - Doctrine that God communicates truth in human modes of understanding; central to Collins's hermeneutic.
- **Phenomenological / human-oriented language**
 - Speech that reflects how things appear to humans (e.g., "sunrise") rather than technical cosmology.
- **Concordism**
 - The attempt to align biblical text point-by-point with modern scientific findings; critiqued as exegetically risky.
- **Young-Earth literalism**
 - Read Genesis 1 as sequential solar days that fix a young earth; Collins argues this reads beyond genre and accommodation.
- **Authorial intent**
 - Exegetical priority: what did the biblical author aim to communicate to the original audience?
- **Genre / literary form**
 - Attention to narrative/poetic features of Genesis 1 that shape temporal language and theological emphasis.
- **Inerrancy / authority**
 - Treated as preserved by correct hermeneutics; Collins aims to defend inerrancy without forcing modern science into the text.
- **Hermeneutical humility**
 - Epistemic posture toward unresolved intersections of Scripture and natural science.
- **Divine work / creative ordering**
 - Creation presented as purposeful divine acts; Collins emphasizes theological teleology over chronological precision.
- **Exegetical model**
 - Use: supplies a methodological template for reading ancient cosmological language in Scripture with care.
- **Polemic**
 - Use: frequently cited in critiques of young-earth apologetics that rely on strict 24-hour day readings.
- **Conceptual pivot**
 - Use: employed in theological curricula as a pivot point between doctrines of revelation and engagement with science.
