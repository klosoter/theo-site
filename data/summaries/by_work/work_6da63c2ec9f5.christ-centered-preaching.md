### TITLE
Christ-Centered Preaching - Bryan Chapell

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2005 (expanded 2011 editions), emerging from late-20th/early-21st-century evangelical-Reformed homiletical renewal. Addresses pastoral churches seeking exegetical rigor plus gospel application amid widespread critiques of moralistic or merely topical preaching.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Every sermon must identify and proclaim the saving work of Christ as the interpretive center of Scripture and as the necessary content of application; sermons that stop at moral exhortation or historical description fail the text and the congregation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scripture is progressive revelation culminating in Christ; thus every text must be interpreted in light of redemptive history.
 - Preaching requires careful exegesis to discover the text's **controlling idea** (Big Idea) and its place in salvation history.
 - Sermons should move listeners from recognition of their problem (sin/alienation) to awareness of the gospel (Christ's solution) and to concrete response (faith and obedience).
 - Methodologically: analyze text (original meaning), synthesize theological message (what it affirms about God/Christ/redemption), then apply gospel-centeredly to contemporary life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on Reformed homiletical tradition and evangelical expository models; interacts implicitly with Haddon Robinson (Big Idea), John Calvin (Christocentric exegesis), and redemptive-historical interpreters. Engages contemporary pastoral practice more than systematic theological polemics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture/revelation (hermeneutics), Christology (center of preaching), atonement and redemption, covenant and redemptive history, sanctification and application, implicit Trinitarian assumptions in Christ-centered proclamation.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Preaching succeeds only when faithful exegesis is harnessed to proclaim Christ as God's saving answer to human need, producing gospel-shaped heart change and obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the **gospel must be the logic of application** - application is not merely moralizing but showing how Christ addresses the audience's condition revealed by the text.
 - Systematic use of a **problem-solution-response** template across genres of Scripture.
 - Emphasis on a single **controlling idea** for each sermon to preserve clarity and theological unity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects moralistic or purely topical preaching by demanding redemptive-historical orientation and explicit gospel content in application.
 - Moves beyond mechanical proof-texting of Christ by requiring textual exegesis that shows how the specific text fits into Christ's work.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized accessible homiletical vocabulary for pastors: **controlling idea**, **problem-solution sermon pattern**, and an operationalized **Christocentric hermeneutic** for all biblical genres.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries and churches as a primary homiletics text; influential for pastors seeking practical, gospel-focused preaching tools.
 - Praised for pastoral clarity and applicability; critiqued by some scholars for potential overextension of Christocentrism (risk of imposing Christological reading on texts that serve other canonical functions).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Durable as a training manual for integrating exegesis and pastoral application.
 - Valuable corrective to sermons that lack gospel content or fail to demonstrate how texts point to redemption in Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ-centered/Christocentric hermeneutic:** Reading all Scripture in light of Christ's person and work; not necessarily allegorical but seeking canonical fulfillment.
- **Controlling idea (Big Idea):** The single theological sentence that the sermon sets out to prove and apply.
- **Problem-Solution-Response pattern:** Homiletical template-identify the audience's problem revealed in the text, present Christ/the gospel as the solution, call for specific response.
- **Progressive revelation/redemptive-historical:** The Bible unfolds God's saving purposes culminating in Christ; sermons must locate the text within that progress.
- **Expository preaching:** Methodological commitment to letting the text dictate the sermon's content and shape rather than starting with topical aims.
- **Gospel application:** Application that centers on Christ's work, distinguishing between objective (what Christ accomplished) and subjective (personal response/obedience) dimensions.
- **Typology and fulfillment:** Use of OT types, promises, and symbols that find their full meaning in Christ; must be grounded in textual and canonical relationships.
- **Original meaning vs. contemporary relevance:** Commitment to discover authorial intent while translating theological truth into present-life implications.
- **Moralism critique:** Rejection of sermons that stop at ethical instruction without situating moral change in gospel-mediated grace.
- **Contemporary pastoral praxis:** Tools for sermon design, illustrations, and pastoral counseling aimed at conversion and sanctification.
- **Sermon movement:** The logical flow from text → theological claim → Christological fulfillment → concrete life change.
- **Objective/subjective balance:** Attention to doctrinal truth (objective gospel) and personal transformation (subjective appropriation).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a practical homiletics textbook and seminar syllabus for pastoral formation.
 - As an exegetical-to-applicatory model: taught for structuring expository sermons with gospel-centered application.
 - As a corrective polemic against moralistic or non-redemptive preaching; used to reorient preaching curricula toward Christ and salvation.
