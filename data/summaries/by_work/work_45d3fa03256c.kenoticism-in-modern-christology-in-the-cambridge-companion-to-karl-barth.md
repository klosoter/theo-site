### TITLE
Kenoticism in Modern Christology (essay by Bruce McCormack, in The Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated within a Cambridge Companion on Karl Barth; addresses a perennial modern question in 19th-20th century Christology.
 - Engages the liberal and dialectical theologies that attempted to rethink the incarnation after Enlightenment pressures on divine attributes and human knowledge.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Kenotic proposals try to account for Jesus' genuine human limitation by positing divine self-emptying (kenosis) that affects the divine person or attributes. McCormack maps and evaluates these proposals and argues that canonical kenoticism, properly understood in Barthian terms, must be distinguished from the ontological surrender of divine attributes that classical theology rejects.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey of modern kenotic formulations:
 - Traces 19th-century antecedents and the varieties in which kenosis is framed (ontological vs. functional).
 - Critical analysis of the theological costs of ontological kenosis:
 - Shows how certain kenoticisms compromise classical doctrines (immutability, impassibility, the unity of the divine person).
 - Barthian corrective and constructive re-framing:
 - Argues Barth refuses the ontological divestment model but affirms a notion of divine self-limitation in the economy - a relational, revelatory kenosis that preserves God's being while explaining genuine human contingency in the incarnate Word.
 - Concluding assessment:
 - Advocates for a disciplined appropriation of kenotic language that respects Chalcedonian and Trinitarian categories while taking seriously the existential and apologetic pressures that gave rise to modern kenotic thinking.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Representatives of modern kenotic thought (19th-20th c.) and their critics.
 - Barth as primary interlocutor; also contrasts with liberal theologians and classical dogmaticians.
 - Scriptural locus: Philippians 2:5-11 as the keystone text; patristic and Chalcedonian formulations as theological constraints.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, person-union), Trinity (immanent vs. economic), divine attributes (immutability, omniscience, omnipotence), communicatio idiomatum, revelation.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - McCormack situates kenotic language as the modern church's attempt to explain Christ's human limitation, endorsing a Barthian-style relational self-limitation rather than an ontological divestment of divinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between **ontological kenosis** (divine attributes altered or surrendered) and **functional/economic kenosis** (divine self-limitation in action or relation).
 - Emphasizes the primacy of Chalcedonian and Trinitarian grammar in adjudicating legitimate kenotic claims.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Critical of liberal or speculative kenoticisms that redefine divine being to secure a more "human" Jesus.
 - Positions Barth not as an opponent of kenotic motifs per se, but as resisting the metaphysical reconfiguration of God's nature; Barth supplies a disciplined kenotic motif anchored in election and revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and rehabilitates a nuanced vocabulary: "Barthian self-limitation" vs. classical "kenoticism," enabling more precise debate.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Serves as a touchstone in Barth studies and modern Christology debates for distinguishing legitimate theological usage of kenosis from categories that threaten classical theism.
 - Frequently cited in subsequent work on divine attributes in the incarnation and on how to read Philippians 2 in dogmatic contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a compact, historically informed framework for teaching the kenosis controversy; helps students navigate theological and biblical constraints without collapsing into either naïve literalism or metaphysical capitulation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis / kenoticism**
 - Self-emptying language from Phil 2; used variously to denote ontological loss or voluntary self-limitation.
- **Ontological kenosis**
 - The claim that the Son divested some divine attributes in the incarnation - McCormack critiques as theologically problematic.
- **Functional (economic) kenosis**
 - The Son's self-limitation in the economy of redemption without alteration of divine being - favored in Barthian reading.
- **Barthian self-limitation**
 - McCormack's preferred construal: relational, revelatory limitation that preserves divine immutability.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The communication of properties between divine and human natures in one person; central constraint on kenotic moves.
- **Chalcedonian grammar**
 - The two-nature, one-person formulation that limits legitimate ways of speaking about divine change or limitation.
- **Divine attributes (immutability, omniscience, omnipotence)**
 - The classical attributes that kenotic proposals risk reconfiguring if read ontologically.
- **Philippians 2:5-11**
 - The primary biblical text anchoring kenotic language; exegetical models vary between moral, functional, and ontological readings.
- **Immanent vs. economic Trinity**
 - Distinction used to caution that kenotic claims about the economy do not automatically translate into claims about God's inner being.
- **Revelation / election**
 - Barthian loci where self-limitation is properly lodged; kenosis is read through God's revealing action.
- **Modern Christology**
 - The broader matrix of 19th-20th-century attempts to reconcile historical-critical insights with dogmatic claims.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: clarifies difference between ontological and economic kenosis.
 - As a **polemic tool**: defends Chalcedonian constraints against modern ontological kenoticisms.
 - As an **exegetical model**: frames reading of Philippians and Synoptic/Johnian data within doctrinal limits.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: mobilized in Barth scholarship to articulate how God can voluntarily self-limit without ceasing to be God.
