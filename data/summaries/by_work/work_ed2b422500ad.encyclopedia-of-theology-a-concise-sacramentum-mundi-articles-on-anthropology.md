### TITLE
**Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi - Anthropology (selected articles by/edited by Karl Rahner)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Roman Catholic theological renewal; Rahner as editor/contributor to the concise English edition of Sacramentum Mundi. Post-Vatican II intellectual milieu: ressourcement, existential and transcendental methods, engagement with modern philosophy and ecumenical theology.
 - Site usage: 15 referenced entries across 15 distinct anthropology-related topics; categories used most often - Eschatology (5), Anthropology & Doctrine of Creation (3), Pneumatology (2), Christology (2), Doctrine of Sin (1). Most common topics flagged in the entries: Trichotomy vs Dichotomy; Traducianism vs Creationism; Original Sin and Imputation; Continuationism vs Cessationism; Pentecostalism and Reformed Response; Impeccability of Christ; Final Judgment and Eternal States; Human Psychosomatic Unity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human beings understood as created, psychosomatic unities whose fundamental orientation is transcendence toward God; anthropology must integrate creation, sin, grace, Christology and eschatology. Core problem: avoid dualisms (spiritual/material, nature/grace) while accounting for human freedom, sin, and ultimate destiny.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: transcendental-Thomistic reading of Scripture and patristic tradition, mediated by phenomenology and existential analysis.
 - Major moves:
 - Ground anthropology in the imago Dei: structural capacities (reason, freedom, self-transcendence) oriented to communion with God.
 - Defend psychosomatic unity against trichotomous or reductionist dualistic models.
 - Reconcile nature and grace via the notion of a constitutive openness to the supernatural (not merely a reward added externally).
 - Treat sin as existential estrangement with both relational and structural consequences; nuanced treatment of imputation vs personal guilt.
 - Place final states (judgment, heaven/hell) as fulfillment (or rejection) of human orientation to God - eschatology integral to anthropology.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Aquinas, later medievals; modern theologians across confessional lines; Protestant systematicians (for discussions on traducianism/creationism and imputation); contemporary philosophers (phenomenology, existentialism).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (as horizon for personal relations), creation, incarnation (Christology and the human exemplar), grace (supernatural existential), original sin, eschatology, pneumatology (Spirit's role in human constitution).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: anthropology as an account of the human person as a created, embodied subject whose intrinsic openness to God (a "supernatural existential") makes grace, Christ and eschatological destiny constitutive, not incidental, to what it means to be human.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **psychosomatic unity** and rejection of reductionist dualisms; anthropology framed by the subject's **self-transcendence** and personal openness to ultimate reality.
 - Introduction and repeated use of the **"supernatural existential"** vocabulary to describe an innate orientation to grace - nature already ordered toward supernatural communion.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both Pelagian naturalism (nature sufficient for destiny) and certain Protestant forensic reductions (sin as merely legal imputation) by combining existential-ontological and relational analyses of sin and grace.
 - Counters trichotomy (body, soul, spirit) by arguing for a unified person whose spiritual capacities are bodily grounded.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes **transcendental method** in anthropology: human subjectivity as the locus for encountering God.
 - Reframes traditional debates (traducianism vs creationism, imputation) within existential categories, reducing polemical deadlock and emphasizing pastoral-theological implications.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Catholic and ecumenical circles; adopted by some Reformed interlocutors for methodical insights, critiqued by others for alleged vagueness on forensic soteriology.
 - Stimulated renewed attention to unity of nature and grace in systematic and pastoral theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, cross-disciplinary model for teaching anthropology that integrates biblical, historical, philosophical and pastoral concerns; valuable as a conceptual pivot in ecumenical dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity** - human person as an integrated body-soul unity; rejects simple dualism and trichotomy.
- **Imago Dei** - structural and relational capacities (reason, freedom, relationality) oriented to communion with God.
- **Supernatural existential** - Rahner's key term: an ontological openness in human nature to grace; nature is intrinsically ordered to the supernatural.
- **Self-transcendence** - capacity of person to exceed given immanence toward the absolute (God); the core anthropological datum.
- **Original sin (existential/relational)** - treated as fundamental estrangement from God with structural consequences, not reducible to only legal imputation.
 - Contrast: engages but reframes traditional **imputation** debates in existential terms.
- **Traducianism vs Creationism** - discusses transmission of soul and principle of personhood; Rahner favors accounts that safeguard personal unity and divine creation of the soul while avoiding reductionism.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy** - critiques three-part models, defends a twofold but integrated understanding (material and personal spirit) without fragmentation.
- **Final judgment and eternal states** - anthropology culminates eschatologically: destiny as relational fulfillment or definitive rejection; existential character emphasized over schematic descriptions.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit & human constitution)** - Spirit as constitutive of personal life, mediating grace and sanctification; relevant for debates on charisms.
 - Links to **Continuationism vs Cessationism** and **Pentecostal/Reformed** responses via Rahnerian openness to ongoing Spirit activity, but within sacramental and ecclesial order.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - Christology used anthropologically to reveal human vocation; Rahner's discussion stresses unity of human and divine without fault.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Thomistic-transcendental anthropology (imago Dei, supernatural existential).
- As a **polemic model** to critique dualisms and simplistic forensic readings of sin.
- As an **exegetical-methodological model** for integrating biblical, historical and phenomenological data in anthropology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical dialogues about nature/grace, the Spirit's role, and eschatological anthropology.
