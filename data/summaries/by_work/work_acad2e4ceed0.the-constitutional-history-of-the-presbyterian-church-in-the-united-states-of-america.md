### TITLE
The Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America - Charles Hodge (mid-19th century American Princetonian; Old School Presbyterian context)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Presbyterianism dominated by Princeton Calvinism and the Old School/New School controversy; era marked by denominational constitutional crises (discipline, theology, slavery, and the 1861 sectional divisions).
 - Hodge writes as a confessionalist and institutionalist intent on recovering the church's constitutional (i.e., polity + confessional) foundations grounded in Scripture and the Reformation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Presbyterian Church's constitution must be rooted in Scripture and the Reformation confessions (chiefly the Westminster standards); faithful church order, discipline, and sacramental practice preserve the church's identity as the one holy catholic and apostolic Church in its visible form.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological tracing from the Reformation and the Westminster Assembly to American practice.
 - Analysis of constitutional documents (confessions, acts of assemblies, rules of discipline) to show continuity and legitimate development.
 - Defense of representative Presbyterian courts (session, presbytery, synod, general assembly) against congregational and Erastian encroachments.
 - Practical application: admission to the Lord's Supper, fencing the table, and implementation of discipline as expressions of constitutional fidelity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary authorities: Scripture, Westminster Confession and Catechisms, Reformation divines (Calvin, Knox), Westminster Assembly.
 - American interlocutors: early American Presbyterian framers (e.g., Witherspoon tradition), Princeton theologians (Archibald Alexander, Samuel Miller), Old School opponents of New School innovations and Erastian tendencies.
 - Historical assemblies and civil law materials where relevant.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (nature, marks, visible/invisible distinction), church government and discipline, sacraments (Lord's Supper: presence, admission, fencing), covenant theology as it shapes membership and sacraments, relationship of church and civil kingdom.

- **Closing line**
 - Hodge centrally argues that a disciplined, confessionally-grounded Presbyterian constitution-ordered by Scripture and Reformation principle-is the necessary safeguard of the church's catholicity, purity, and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats constitutional documents as theological instruments: the constitution is not merely polity but doctrinal safeguard.
 - Strong insistence on **discipline** and **fencing the table** as means of covenantal and pastoral fidelity.
 - Clear delineation of visible versus invisible church with practical consequences for membership and sacramental access.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors and rivals**
 - Pushes back on New School tendencies toward voluntarism, lax sacramental admission, and minimization of ecclesiastical courts.
 - Opposes Erastian conceptions that subordinate ecclesiastical courts to civil magistrates; affirms church autonomy within its spiritual sphere.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses "constitutional" in the double sense of written confessional law and operational polity-bridging legal history and dogmatics.
 - Emphasizes the procedural theology of courts (how doctrine is preserved by ordered process).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Old School Presbyterians and Princeton-influenced seminaries; used as both historical resource and polemical defense of confessional Presbyterianism.
 - Shaped later Presbyterian constitutional practice and debates over admission and discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a model for integrating historical-critical constitutional history with confessional theology and practical ecclesiology; indispensable for students of Presbyterian polity and sacramental discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Constitution** - the combination of Scripture, confessions, and rules that govern Presbyterian life; treated as normative law for church order.
- **Westminster Standards** - primary confessional touchstone; Hodge treats them as the authoritative doctrinal-linguistic constitution.
- **Visible Church** - local, instituted body with officers and sacraments; contrasted with the invisible church of the elect.
- **Invisible Church** - the elect known only to God; used to justify discipline and limits of ecclesial jurisdiction.
- **Marks of the Church** - preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and exercise of discipline (central criteria for identifying the true church).
- **Presbyterian Polity** - session, presbytery, synod, general assembly; representative and connectional court structure defended against congregationalism and Erastianism.
 - Session: local oversight and discipline.
 - Higher courts: appellate and doctrinal adjudication.
- **Fencing the Table** - practice of restricting sacramental participation through examination and discipline; linked to covenantal integrity.
- **Admission to the Lord's Supper** - theological and procedural norms for who may partake (profession of faith, catechetical examination, and communion discipline).
- **Covenant** - the federal structure governing membership and sacramental promises; shapes admission, nurture, and discipline.
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church** - universal catholicity preserved through confessional and constitutional continuity, not institutional uniformity.
- **Church and Kingdom** - relation between ecclesiastical authority and civil magistrate; Hodge defends distinct spheres and ecclesial autonomy.
- **Discipline** - pastoral and juridical means of preserving purity; central constitutional mechanism.
- **Reformation Ecclesiology** - the interpretive frame: sola Scriptura, covenantal sacraments, and representative government.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Presbyterian polity and confessional norms.
 - As a **polemic** against New School laxity and Erastian intrusion.
 - As a **procedural model** for sacramental discipline and admission practices in Reformed churches.
