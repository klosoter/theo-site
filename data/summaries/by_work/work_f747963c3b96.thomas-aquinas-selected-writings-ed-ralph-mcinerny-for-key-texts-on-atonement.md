### TITLE
Thomas Aquinas: Selected Writings, ed. Ralph McInerny - key texts on atonement (Atonement Necessity, Extent, and Theories)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 13th-century Scholasticism; Dominican theological method combining Aristotelian metaphysics with Augustinian theology.
 - Selections (McInerny) gather Aquinas's chief texts bearing on Christology, merit, and satisfaction (notably Summa Theologiae, IaIIae & IIIa, and related quaestiones).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How does Christ's passion accomplish human salvation in relation to divine justice, grace, and human merit? Aquinas aims to show that Christ's life, death, and resurrection constitute a *superabundant* satisfaction that restores order, merits grace for humanity, and is applied sacramentally.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Original sin and human disorder create a deficit with respect to divine justice and the restoration of the image of God.
 - Mechanism: Christ, by virtue of the hypostatic union, performs both passive (suffering) and active (obedience) works that are of infinite worth and thus can satisfy divine justice.
 - Mediatory logic:
 - Christ's merits are *sufficient for all* (universal sufficiency).
 - They are *efficiently applied* in particular by sacramental economy and the will/merit of recipients (no automatic universal salvation).
 - Telos: Restoration of charity, right relation with God, and final beatitude.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Augustine (sin, grace), Anselm (satisfaction theory), the Sentences tradition (Peter Lombard), Scripture and Church Fathers.
 - Scholastic interlocutors: contemporaries and successors who debated merit, justice, and the application of merits.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, active/passive obedience), soteriology (satisfaction, merit, redemption), grace, justice (retributive/restorative), sacraments/mediation, original sin.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas reframes Anselmian satisfaction within a metaphysical and sacramental economy: Christ's superabundant merit restores divine order, is universally sufficient, and is applied in particular through grace and the Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Integration of **Anselmian satisfaction** with Aristotelian notions of *merit* and *proportionality*; emphasis on Christ's merits as objectively superabundant but subjectively applied.
 - Careful metaphysical grounding: the hypostatic union as the basis for Christ's unique meritorious status.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - To Anselm: preserves satisfaction but situates it in Thomistic categories of justice/merit and divine ordering rather than purely legalistic substitution.
 - To late medieval voluntarists: insists on rational structure and order in God's will - Christ's work is fitting and ordained, not arbitrary.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinctions: **condign** vs **congruent** merit; **universal sufficiency** vs **particular efficacy**; nuanced account of necessity (God could but willed to redeem in Christ).
 - Uses treasury of merits and juridical language reframed in metaphysical-final causality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Roman Catholic scholastic formulations of atonement, sacramental theology, and doctrine of merit (post-Trent theology builds on Thomistic categories).
 - Reformed critique: Reformers rejected Thomistic merit/infused-grace model, but engaged Aquinas on sufficiency/extent and on the coherence of substitution.
 - Modern specialists (ecumenical theology) revisit Aquinas for a non-legalistic, metaphysically rich account of satisfaction and mediation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a structurally rigorous, philosophically integrated model of atonement useful for debates on extent, necessity, and the interplay of objective redemption and subjective reception.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Satisfaction** - Christ makes reparation to divine justice for sin; rooted in Anselm but thomistically reinterpreted.
- **Merit**
 - **Condign merit** - owed in justice because of union with Christ (strictly proportionate).
 - **Congruent merit** - fitting, customary reward not strictly due.
- **Hypostatic union** - the union of divine and human natures in Christ that confers infinite worth on his acts.
- **Active obedience / Passive obedience** - Christ's life of perfect obedience (active) and his suffering/death (passive) both contribute to redemption.
- **Universal sufficiency / Particular efficacy**
 - **Universal sufficiency** - Christ's merit can suffice for all humanity.
 - **Particular efficacy** - salvation is applied to particular persons through grace, faith, and sacraments.
- **Necessity (fitting vs. absolute)** - Aquinas distinguishes being necessary by divine ordination (fitting and willed) from metaphysical compulsion; Christ's work is ordained as necessary for our salvation.
- **Justice (restorative)** - Not merely punitive; Christ restores the moral and relational order between God and humans.
- **Treasure of merits** - repository of Christ's superabundant merit, administered by the Church (basis for communal application).
- **Vicarious satisfaction** - Christ acts in the place of sinners, so his obedience/suffering is credited to them.
- **Sacramental economy** - the means by which Christ's objective merits are communicated to believers.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for medieval satisfaction theory and scholastic categories of merit.
- As a **polemic target and foil** in Protestant critiques of merit, infused grace, and the role of the Church.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating Christology, sacramentality, and soteriology in systematic theology.
