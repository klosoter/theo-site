### TITLE
Mark Jones, "The Mosaic Covenant: A 'Republication' of the Covenant of Works?" (secondary treatment of Francis Turretin)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed scholarship engaging classical Reformed scholasticism; Jones writes from a Westminster/Reformed perspective concerned with the history of covenant theology and the law/grace distinction.
 - The essay situates Francis Turretin (17th-century Reformed scholastic) within the post-Reformation debate over whether the Mosaic covenant is a "republication" of the covenant of works.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Can the Mosaic covenant legitimately be described as a republication of the covenant of works "as to substance"? Jones examines Turretin's answer: Turretin repudiates substantive republication while acknowledging lawlike, pedagogical, or forensic aspects to the Mosaic legislation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical and historical reconstruction of Turretin's treatment of Mosaic law across his Institutes.
 - Distinguishes senses of "republication":
 - **Formal/ceremonial republication** (use of law to show sin and point to Christ) - more defensible.
 - **Substantive republication** (actual reoffering of covenant of works, i.e., salvation by strict works) - rejected by Turretin.
 - Jones traces Turretin's key moves:
 - Clarify covenant categories (works vs grace) and prevent conflation.
 - Show Mosaic covenant contains civil/judicial and ceremonial administrations that presuppose grace-history but include law's condemning role.
 - Argue that Turretin insists on continuity of moral law but denies that Mosaic constituted a salvific reoffer of works-principle.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary subject: Francis Turretin (Reformed scholastic).
 - Interlocutors in the background: proponents of republication in Reformed tradition (e.g., some post-WCF interpreters, later antinomian controversies), and earlier figures who influenced Turretin (e.g., Witsius, Westminster standards).
 - Secondary conversation: modern Reformed theologians revisiting covenantal taxonomy and the purpose of the Mosaic law.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works vs grace; administrations of one covenant).
 - Theology of the law (moral/ceremonial/judicial distinctions).
 - Justification and the role of law in conviction/condemnation.
 - Typology and pedagogical use of the law leading to Christ.
- **Closing line**
 - Jones presents Turretin as a careful corrective: the Mosaic law has a lawly, condemning, and pedagogical function without becoming a substantive reoffer of the covenant of works.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp differentiation between republication "in form" (pedagogical/condemning) and "in substance" (reoffering merit-based salvation); Turretin affirms the former but denies the latter.
 - Emphasis on the Mosaic covenant as an administrative mixture: legal/judicial and sacramental elements that presuppose progressive revelation of grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects readings that collapse Mosaic legislation into a straight re-imposition of Adamic covenantal terms; opposes any construal that makes Mosaic covenant an alternative soteriological path.
 - Counters antinomian and hyper-republication tendencies by preserving moral law continuity without sacrificing sola gratia.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of scholastic categories (substance vs form; administration vs essence) applied to covenantal taxonomy.
 - Reinscribes the pedagogical role of the law as compatible with covenantal grace.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed scholars seeking to preserve both law's condemning role and the primacy of covenant of grace; used as a historical anchor against overstated republication theses.
 - Serves as a resource in debates over the proper characterization of the Mosaic covenant in Reformed systematic theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models careful exegesis-historical method for treating contested doctrinal categories.
 - Provides a stable template for teaching the law/grace relation without collapsing distinctions vital to Reformed orthodoxy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Republication / republication of the covenant of works**
 - The claim that Mosaic legislation re-offered the covenant of works; Jones/Turretin distinguish forms of republication and reject substantive republication.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The prelapsarian covenant with Adam stipulating life for obedience; not substantively renewed at Sinai, per Turretin as read by Jones.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The redemptive covenant fulfilled in Christ; Turretin insists Mosaic administration belongs within the economy of grace, not as a rival.
- **Substance vs Form**
 - **Substance**: the essential soteriological terms (rejected as republished at Sinai).
 - **Form**: legal shape, pedagogical use, and civil/judicial modalities (acknowledged).
- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - Complex administration combining moral law continuity with ceremonial and civil prescriptions; contains a condemning legal function for pedagogy.
- **Law - Moral / Ceremonial / Judicial**
 - Moral: enduring duties reflecting God's character.
 - Ceremonial: sacramental/typological elements pointing to Christ.
 - Judicial (civil): national ordering and sanctions.
- **Pedagogical use of the law**
 - Law as tutor to show sin and drive to Christ; where republication language is most defensible.
- **Condemnation and typology**
 - Law condemns transgressions and typologically anticipates Christ's righteousness and obedience.
- **Administration (of covenant)**
 - The outward, temporal economy (Sinai) that administers covenantal elements differently from the covenant's essence.
- **Works principle vs grace principle**
 - Distinction preserved: Mosaic law requires obedience but does not supplant grace as ground of salvation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Turretin's nuanced distinction between substantive and formal republication.
- As a **polemic tool** in debates against those who interpret Sinai as reoffering salvation by works.
- As an **exegetical-historical model** for treating the law/grace relation and the administrations of the covenant.
