### TITLE
The Parables of the Kingdom (C. H. Dodd, 1935)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Published 1935 in the midst of interwar historical-Jesus and form-critical scholarship. Dodd wrote from the Cambridge school, engaging contemporary debates over Jesus' eschatology (Schweitzerian imminence vs. liberal reinterpretations). The book consolidates a scholarly turn toward the parables as primary windows into Jesus' message.
- **Central thesis:** The parables present the Kingdom of God as a present, dynamic reality inaugurated in Jesus' ministry but unfolding and not yet consummated; their form and content explain the apparent *delay of the Parousia* by depicting growth, hiddenness, and coexistence until the final harvest.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical close readings of major kingdom-parables (Sower, Mustard Seed, Leaven, Tares, Hidden Treasure, etc.).
 - Synthesis: parables emphasize three features of the kingdom - **presence**, **mystery/hiddenness**, and **progressive growth** - which reconcile Jesus' proclamation with the postponed eschatological consummation.
 - Application to the problem of the delayed Parousia: parables portray why judgment is postponed (coexistence of good and evil, hidden working of God, gradual harvest) and indicate both present moral/faith implications and future consummation.
- **Figures and sources engaged:** Implicit and explicit contrast with Albert Schweitzer (eschatological imminence) and with preparatory German form-critical scholarship; uses Synoptic parables, parallel tradition criticism, and early patristic echoes where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (inaugurated/realized emphasis), Christology (Kingdom as activity of Jesus), revelation (mystery/mysterion motif), judgment, hermeneutics of parable.
- **Closing line:** Dodd's theological center of gravity: **the Kingdom is already present in Jesus' ministry yet eschatologically incomplete - the parables explain both its present power and the postponement of its final consummation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Strong advocacy of **realized (inaugurated) eschatology** framed through parable-typology rather than abstract doctrine.
 - Parables treated as primary theological testimony to Jesus' own self-understanding and program - not mere moral tales or later church allegorizing.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Rejects Schweitzer's total futurism that sees Jesus as mistaken about imminence; instead reads Jesus as expecting a Kingdom that breaks in now but awaits completion.
 - Moves beyond purely moralizing or allegorizing readings dominant in earlier church exegesis; insists on historical and theological import of parabolic form.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasis on **mystery** and **growth** as explanatory categories for the Kingdom's hidden operations and delayed consummation.
 - Use of parable typology (seed, leaven, treasure, tares) to map the "already/not-yet" dynamics before that label became common.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in mid-20th-century New Testament and theological scholarship; foundational for later inaugurated-eschatology schools (e.g., scholars like J. D. G. Dunn built on similar contours).
 - Provoked sustained critique from readers who insisted on stronger future/final-judgment emphasis; shaped debate between "realized" and "consistent futurist" readings.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a compact, exemplar-driven model for reading parables as theological anthropology of the Kingdom; indispensable for courses on Jesus' eschatology and parable interpretation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parables of the Kingdom:** Narrative units in the Synoptics treated as primary revelation about what the Kingdom is and how it unfolds.
- **Realized eschatology / Inaugurated eschatology:** Kingdom is present in Jesus' work though not yet consummate; Dodd's central hermeneutical posture.
- **Delay of the Parousia:** Problem addressed - why the final coming is postponed; answered by parable motifs of growth, hiddenness, and coexistence.
 - Tares/harvest motif explains coexistence until the appointed time.
 - Seed/yeast motifs explain gradual internal growth rather than instant transformation.
- **Mystery (mysterion):** The Kingdom's hiddenness; parables institutionalize the notion that the Kingdom is perceptible only to receptive hearers.
- **Growth-kingdom imagery:** Mustard seed, leaven, and seed - stress internal, expansive, often unseen development.
- **Harvest/judgment motif:** Future consummation; parables preserve a judicial eschatology that will culminate despite present delay.
- **Parable typology:** Dodd's practice of grouping parables by imagery/functions to derive theological claims rather than treating them individually.
- **Hermeneutical move:** Parables function both as revelation (what the Kingdom is) and as interpretive keys to Jesus' overall message.
- **Historical-Jesus method:** Use of parables to access Jesus' own proclamation rather than later ecclesial theology.
- **Resistance to moralizing/allegorizing:** Insistence that parables are neither simple moral anecdotes nor later church allegories.
- **Already/not-yet tension:** Implicit framework showing present reality vs. future fulfillment (Dodd helped formulate its contours before the phrase became standard).
- **Coexistence motif:** Good and evil coexist until divine adjudication; explains apparent delay.

How this work is used:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading parables as theological statements about the Kingdom.
- As a **definition source** for inaugurated/realized eschatology in systematic and historical theology.
- As a **polemic** against purely futurist or purely moralizing interpretations of Jesus' eschatology.
