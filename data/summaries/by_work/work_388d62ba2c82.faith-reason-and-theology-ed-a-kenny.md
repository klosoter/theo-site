### TITLE
Faith, Reason, and Theology (ed. A. Kenny) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 13th-century scholastic synthesis: Aquinas writes within the Aristotelian revival in Latin Christendom, responding to Augustine, Islamic and Jewish philosophers (Avicenna, Averroes), and contemporary Latin Averroists.
 - Major texts cited: Summa Theologiae, Summa Contra Gentiles, De Veritate; material commonly anthologized in modern collections (e.g., Kenny).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How do human reason and supernatural faith relate in knowledge of God and salvific truths? Can philosophy and revealed theology coexist without contradiction?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes two orders of knowledge:
 - **Natural knowledge (general revelation):** reason apprehends God indirectly via creatures (effects to cause), yielding demonstrable truths (e.g., God exists, immateriality of intellect, some divine attributes).
 - **Supernatural knowledge (special revelation):** Scripture and Christ disclose truths inaccessible to natural reason (Trinity, Incarnation, mysteries of grace).
 - Faith is an **infused intellectual virtue** (fides) - assent to divine truth based on God as trustworthy authority; not mere opinion, but not identical to demonstrative knowledge.
 - Theology (sacra doctrina) uses reason but is ordered to revealed truth; philosophy has autonomy within its proper scope but is subordinated in authority where revelation speaks.
 - Methodological devices: analogical predication of divine names, via negativa (privative talk), careful use of metaphysical categories to avoid equivocation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Aristotle (metaphysics, causality), Augustine (grace, reading of Scripture), Averroes/Avicenna (scientific and metaphysical rivals), contemporary Latin Averroists and skeptics.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs special), epistemology of faith, analogy and divine nomenclature, natural theology (Five Ways), relationship of grace and nature, authority of Scripture, limits of demonstrative proof.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas locates theology at the intersection of reason and revelation: reason prepares and supports faith, revelation completes and perfects it; true theology harmonizes both without collapsing the distinctive claims of either.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Faith as an infused habit that yields assent distinct from scientific demonstration; theology as a rational discipline but ultimately reliant on divine authority.
 - Clear taxonomy of orders of knowledge: what reason can attain vs what requires revelation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rejects both rationalist reduction (that all divine truths are demonstrable) and voluntarist/fideist extremes (that faith is mere subjective assent independent of reason).
 - Corrects reading of Aristotle by integrating teleology and Christian doctrines (e.g., ordering of creation to final end in God).
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Robust use of **analogia entis** (analogy of being) to talk about God while avoiding equivocation and univocity.
 - Precise juxtaposition of **auctoritas** (revelatory authority) and **ratio** (demonstrative reason) within a single epistemic economy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Catholic theology and Thomistic revival; provides the classical model of natural theology still used in Roman Catholic apologetics.
 - Influential but contested in Reformed circles: many Reformed theologians adopt the basic general/special revelation distinction but dispute Thomistic metaphysics and the account of infused virtues.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for thinking about the limits of philosophical theology, the role of Scripture, and the method of systematic theology; indispensable for apologetics, philosophical theology, and curricular formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (fides)** - an infused intellectual virtue; assent to truths proposed by God because of divine authority; involves both intellect and will.
- **Reason (ratio)** - discursive intellective power; capable of demonstrative knowledge about causality and some divine attributes via effects.
- **General revelation** - knowledge of God available in creation and natural reason (effects to first cause); basis for natural theology.
- **Special revelation** - truths disclosed in Scripture and Christ (mysteries) that surpass natural cognition.
- **Sacred doctrine (sacra doctrina)** - theological science: uses philosophical principles but rests on revelation and ecclesial authority.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - linguistic/metaphysical tool permitting true but non-equivalent predication about God.
- **Via negativa / privation** - method to deny inapplicable predicates and thus protect divine simplicity and transcendence.
- **Infused virtue / grace** - supernatural gifts that elevate the intellect and will, enabling knowledge and assent to revealed truths.
- **Demonstration** - Aristotelian causal syllogism applied to God (e.g., Five Ways); valid within limits of natural knowledge.
- **Authority (auctoritas divina)** - the founding epistemic warrant for faith; revelation trumps purely speculative claims on supernatural matters.
- **Mystery** - a truth revealed by God that cannot be attained by natural reason alone (e.g., Trinity).
- **Natural law / moral knowledge** - moral truths derivable from human nature and reason, yet perfected by revelation and grace.
- **Philosophy vs Theology** - distinct disciplines: philosophy independent in its proximate object but subordinate in authority when theology addresses the supernatural.
- **Analogy vs Univocity** - Aquinas rejects strict univocity of divine terms; affirmation of analogical predication.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the faith/reason and general/special revelation distinction in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both fideism and reductive rationalism in apologetics.
 - As an **exegetical-method model** for reading Scripture with philosophical categories (analogy, negative theology) and for integrating metaphysics into dogmatic formulation.
