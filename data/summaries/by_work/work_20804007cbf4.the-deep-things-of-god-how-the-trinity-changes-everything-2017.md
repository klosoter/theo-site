### TITLE
The Deep Things of God: How the Trinity Changes Everything (Fred Sanders, 2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2017 within contemporary evangelical and broadly Protestant conversations recovering classical Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Sanders writes as a Reformation-informed evangelical theologian with strong patristic interests; aimed at pastors, students, and lay theologians dissatisfied with thin or practicalized treatments of God.
 - Responds to modern tendencies to make theology utilitarian, privatized, or non-Trinitarian in practice.

- **Central thesis**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity is not an abstract dogma but the deepest, formative reality that reshapes worship, life, and theology: knowing God truly means encountering the Father, Son, and Spirit as the living, perichoretic communion that is the source and pattern of all Christian being and doing.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Retrieval - shows biblical and historical grounding for a robust, classical Trinitarianism (Scripture, Cappadocians, Augustine).
 - Part 2: Reorientation - argues that nearly every locus of theology (revelation, salvation, sanctification, church, sacraments, mission) must be read through Trinitarian categories.
 - Emphasizes the **economy** of revelation as the self-giving life of the triune God.
 - Replaces individualistic and moralistic frameworks with a **participatory** account of union with God.
 - Part 3: Application - practical implications for worship, preaching, spiritual formation, and Christian community; shows how Trinitarian life produces doxology and love.
 - Concludes by insisting that to neglect the Trinity is to truncate Christianity at its shallowest ethical or therapeutic edges.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive interlocutors: Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Augustine, classical Reformed theologians, contemporary Trinitarian scholars.
 - Critiques gestures toward modern evangelicalism that marginalizes doctrine, and to social-Trinity skeptics who fear tritheism.
 - Uses Scripture as primary witness; engages historical theology to correct modern distortions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation, Christology (incarnation and mediation), pneumatology (presence and sanctifying work), soteriology (union with Christ), ecclesiology (church as participation), worship and sacramentology (as participation in Trinitarian life), theology proper (divine being and relations).

- **Closing line**
 - The deepest theological move is to treat the Triune God not as an object to be analyzed but as the living, relational reality into which Christians are summoned and transformed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral integration: doctrine is presented as formative of prayer, worship, and spiritual formation rather than mere abstraction.
 - Emphasis on **participation**: salvation and sanctification are understood as entry into the triune life rather than primarily legal pardon or moral improvement.
 - Trinitarianism as the lens for all loci of theology rather than a discrete or marginal dogma.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects evangelical reductionism that treats the Trinity as optional or purely speculative.
 - Challenges moral exemplar models of the Trinity (which reduce persons to ethical roles) and simplistic "social Trinity" caricatures that risk tritheism.
 - Pushes back on strict economy/immanent bifurcation by reading the economic revelation as constitutive of the immanent life.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts classic terms (perichoresis, immanent/economic) in service of pastoral spiritual formation language.
 - Reinforces language of "participation" and "doxological ontology" - being as primarily oriented toward praise and mutual indwelling.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely welcomed in evangelical and academic circles for accessible retrieval of patristic insights.
 - Used by pastors and teachers to reintroduce Trinitarian worship and spirituality.
 - Critically noted by some analytic theologians for not fully resolving philosophical tensions around divine simplicity and personhood.

- **Enduring value**
 - A concise, readable bridge between patristic/early-modern theology and contemporary evangelical practice.
 - Valuable corrective to the domestication of doctrine and a sustained model for integrating dogma with discipleship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (Triune God)** - central category: God as Father, Son, Spirit in mutual love and communion.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling of the divine persons; used to ground relational ontology without collapsing persons.
- **Economic / Immanent Trinity** - stresses that God's revealed actions (economic) are not secondary but disclose the inner life (immanent).
- **Participation (koinonia-style)** - Christian life conceived as real sharing in the triune life rather than mere assent or obedience.
- **Doxological ontology** - the idea that being and existence are fundamentally oriented to praise; theology should lead to worship.
- **Social ontology (of God)** - relationality as constitutive of divine life; Sanders avoids naïve social-Trinity extremes.
- **Union with Christ** - fleshed out as entry into Trinitarian communion, the heart of sanctification.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit's presence)** - Spirit as the agent who brings believers into participation and worship.
- **Christology (incarnation & mediation)** - the Son as the revelatory and reconciling person who makes participation possible.
- **Ecclesiology** - church as a community shaped by and revealing the triune life.
- **Sacramentality** - sacraments as signs and means of participating in Trinitarian life.
- **Revelation as self-giving** - God communicates by sharing the divine life; revelation is not primarily information but communion.
- **Anti-reductionism** - insistence that doctrine must resist practical or therapeutic-only reductions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary evangelical teaching on Trinity and participation.
 - As a **polemic** against the practical-only or privatized theologies that minimize God's triune life.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for re-shaping worship, preaching, and spiritual formation around Trinitarian categories.
