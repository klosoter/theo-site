### TITLE
Entsprechungen: Gott, Wahrheit, Mensch (Correspondences: God, Truth, Human) - Eberhard Jüngel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Continental Protestant theology; rooted in post-war German Lutheran dogmatics and in ongoing dialogue with Karl Barth, dialectical theology, and continental philosophy (questions of truth and subjectivity).
 - Responds to modern epistemology and ontotheology by rearticulating theological claims about God and human knowing.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must reconceive the relation between God, truth, and human beings in terms of *Entsprechung* (correspondence): truth is not an abstract property but the relational correspondence established by God in revelation (primarily in Christ).
 - This requires rejecting or revising the traditional reliance on the analogia entis (analogy of being) in favor of an analogia fidei (analogy of faith) that grounds knowledge of God in divine self‑communication.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary diagnosis: modernity's fragmentation of truth and subjectivity arises from treating truth as adequation between thought and being apart from God's self‑disclosure.
 - Reinterpretation of truth: truth as correspondence is theological and evental - God corresponds to human reality by addressing and bearing responsibility for it in revelation.
 - Christological and Trinitarian anchoring: the correspondence becomes concrete in Christ who is God's forgiving and answering presence; the Trinitarian life provides the ontological and communicative ground for correspondence.
 - Epistemological consequence: human knowledge of God is trustful, responsive, and existentially oriented - theology proceeds from God's act, not human speculative ascent.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Explicitly and implicitly engages Karl Barth and Luther on revelation and analogia fidei; opposes classical scholastic formulations of analogia entis.
 - Dialogues with continental philosophy (analysis of truth, Heideggerian and post-Kantian trajectories) and with modern theological criticism of metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of God (theology proper), revelation (Offenbarung), Christology, Trinitarian theology, theological epistemology (truth and knowledge), anthropology (human reception and responsibility).

- **Closing line**
 - Jüngel reframes theology: God is the correspondent of human truth - a dynamic, Christ‑centered correspondence that grounds knowledge, ethics, and existence in divine self‑giving rather than in ontological resemblance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers the theological category of *Entsprechung* as a middle term that preserves divine initiative while accounting for human epistemic openness.
 - Treats truth primarily as event and relation, not as static property or metaphysical adequation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to **analogia entis**: resists making God knowable by mere structural resemblance between creature and Creator; warns against ontotheological presumptions.
 - Affirms and refines **analogia fidei**: knowledge of God proceeds from God's revealed correspondence and is mediated by faith and the proclamation of Christ.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts theological epistemology in juridical/relational terms (responsibility, answering) rather than primarily metaphysical terms.
 - Integrates Trinitarian life into the logic of correspondence (the intra‑divine relations as the ground for divine address).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in late 20th-century Protestant dogmatics, especially within European Lutheran circles; used in debates over natural theology, revelation, and the nature of theological truth.
 - Stimulated renewed attention to the language of correspondence in contemporary systematic theology and in dialogues with philosophy of language and hermeneutics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a usable alternative to ontological analogies for teaching doctrine of God and revelation.
 - Provides a concise bridge between Christology, epistemology, and ethical responsibility - valuable for pastoral theology and contemporary apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Entsprechung (Correspondence)** - central category: relational, evental correspondence established by God toward human beings; replaces static adequation models.
- **Analogia fidei (Analogy of faith)** - privileged epistemic principle: knowing God arises from God's revealed act and the faith that receives it.
- **Analogia entis (Analogy of being)** - critiqued locus: reliance on creature‑Creator resemblance is insufficient and prone to ontotheological error.
- **Wahrheit (Truth)** - redefined as theological correspondence: truth is faithful divine response rather than mere propositional coherence or ontic match.
- **Offenbarung (Revelation)** - the decisive mode of correspondence; revelation is God taking responsibility and making truth available.
- **Christology (Christ as correspondence)** - Christ is the concrete instance of God's correspondence, who answers human estrangement and establishes truth.
- **Trinitarian grounding** - intra‑divine relations supply the ontological basis for God's communicative correspondence.
- **Anthropology (human receptivity)** - humans are defined by their capacity to receive and respond to divine correspondence; faith is a participatory reception.
- **Ontotheology** - the target of critique; theological formulations that reduce God to a being among beings or that derive knowledge of God from creaturely ontology.
- **Theological epistemology** - faith‑shaped knowing; epistemic trust in divine correspondence replaces speculative ascent.
- **Proclamation / Verkündigung** - the ecclesial form in which correspondence is communicated and received.
- **Responsibility / Answering** - juridical and relational terms used to describe God's initiative and human resultant response.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "correspondence" in dogmatic treatments of revelation and truth.
 - As a **polemic** against classical analogia entis and ontotheological tendencies in natural theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in linking Trinitarian doctrine, Christology, and theological epistemology for systematic and pastoral applications.
