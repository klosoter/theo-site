### TITLE
The Rest of the Second Replie (1577) - Thomas Cartwright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late Elizabethan England (1577). Cartwright writes from the Puritan/Reformed perspective in the immediate aftermath of the Elizabethan Settlement. The pamphlet sits in the pamphlet wars over ecclesiastical polity between Puritans and Anglican apologists (bishops, cathedral clergy, and their defenders).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A sustained defense of presbyterian church government and discipline against the claims of episcopal (prelatical) polity; the central claim is that Scripture prescribes parity of ministers and a court system of elders and presbyteries, and that episcopacy is an unscriptural innovation corrupting the church.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Assertion of the **Scripture as the sole authoritative rule** for church government; appeals to biblical precedents (Acts, Pauline practice) to ground eldership and plural oversight.
 - Denial that historical antiquity or royal/legislative enactments can legitimize prelacy if it contradicts Scripture.
 - Detailed exposition of **offices** (ministers/elders/teachers/deacons): their qualifications, mutual relations, and the principle of parity among presbyters.
 - Defence of **discipline** exercised by presbyterial courts: congregational accountability, admonition, excommunication, and appeal procedures.
 - Polemical engagement with Anglican claims about hierarchy, apostolic succession, and the necessity of bishops for sacramental validity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Anglican episcopal defenders (implicit and explicit replies to clergy and polemicists supporting the Elizabethan ecclesiastical settlement).
 - Scriptural witnesses (New Testament practice, Pauline rules) are primary sources; occasional use of early church fathers to support presbyterial readings.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (church government, visible church), ministry and ordination, ecclesiastical discipline; auxiliarily touches on authority (Scripture vs. ecclesiastical/royal authority) and the nature of the church as a covenant community.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The church must be governed according to Scripture by a plurality of elders and accountable courts; episcopacy is an unscriptural usurpation that undermines true pastoral care and discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **parity of ministers**: ministers share equal authority within presbyteries rather than a hierarchical rank.
 - Prioritizing **collective pastoral oversight** (presbytery/synod) over single-person diocesan control.
 - Methodical linking of ecclesiastical discipline to the health of congregational sanctification.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Anglican appeals to tradition and order by reasserting sola scriptura for polity; rejects appeals to medieval canon law and royal prerogative as decisive.
 - Contrasts with Episcopal claims that bishops are necessary for apostolic succession and sacramental validity; Cartwright reframes ordination and sacraments as governed by the church of believers and elders.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and popularizes the English-language vocabulary of **presbytery, eldership, parity, and presbyterial discipline** in a polemical context.
 - Emphasizes procedural forms (appeals, synodal procedure) that later shape English and Scottish Presbyterian practice.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential among **English Puritans** and later advocates of presbyterian polity; contributed to the theoretical foundation for organized Presbyterianism in Britain.
 - Provoked counter-arguments from Anglican apologists (e.g., Whitgift, Hooker) and became part of the corpus that fed continental and British Reformed polity debates.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A primary-source exemplar of Elizabethan Puritan ecclesiology and polemics.
 - Useful for tracing how presbyterian polity was argued from Scripture and adapted to an English context prior to the 17th-century polity conflicts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbytery:** A court of elders exercising collegial oversight of several congregations; central governing unit in Cartwright's scheme.
- **Eldership/Presbyter:** Ordained ministers and ruling elders who share authority in pastoral governance.
 - Contrast: **parity** (equal voting authority among presbyters) vs. episcopal hierarchy.
- **Parity:** The principle that ministers are of equal rank/function in governance; rejects diocesan superiority.
- **Prelacy/Prelatic government:** Term for episcopal/episcopalian hierarchical system that Cartwright condemns as unscriptural.
- **Discipline:** Ecclesiastical corrective measures (admonition, suspension, excommunication) administered by elders and presbyteries.
- **Ordination:** Corporate act by elders/presbytery; legitimacy rests on congregational and presbyterial recognition rather than apostolic succession as claimed by bishops.
- **Scripture as rule (regulative principle for polity):** The claim that only what Scripture prescribes should govern church order and offices.
- **Visible church:** The assembled, governed community subject to discipline and covenant obligations (distinct from the invisible church of elect).
- **Synod:** Broader assembly of presbyteries for doctrinal and disciplinary adjudication; mechanism for collective unity.
- **Magistrate/Church relation:** Cartwright delineates limits of civil authority in church matters, arguing against civil imposition of prelacy contrary to Scripture.
- **Appeal procedure:** Right of congregations and ministers to appeal to higher presbyterial courts rather than being subject solely to a bishop.
- **Ordinary vs. extraordinary ministers:** Distinctions concerning function and calling within the presbyterial system.
- **Apostolic practice:** Cartwright's reading of New Testament patterns for church government.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed/Presbyterian ecclesiology and the vocabulary of eldership and presbytery.
- As a **polemic** against episcopacy in studies of Elizabethan church controversies and Puritan resistance.
- As a **procedural model** in examining historical arguments for discipline, ordination, and synodal governance within Reformed traditions.
