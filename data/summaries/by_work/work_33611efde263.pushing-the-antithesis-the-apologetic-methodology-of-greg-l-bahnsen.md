### TITLE
Pushing the Antithesis: The Apologetic Methodology of Greg L. Bahnsen
Author: Greg L. Bahnsen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th century Reformed apologetic renewal (1960s-1990s). Bahnsen writes as a student/adjunct of Van Tilian presuppositionalism but sharpens it for debates with evidentialists and classical apologists.
 - Movement context: reaction against evidentialist neutrality and so-called "common ground" approaches; rising emphasis on worldview coherence within conservative Presbyterian and Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Apologetics must "push the antithesis": start with Christian presuppositions (Scripture as ultimate authority) and show that non-Christian worldviews are internally inconsistent and incapable of grounding intelligibility, morality, or science.
 - General revelation is true but insufficient; special revelation (Scripture) supplies the necessary presuppositions for rationality and saving knowledge.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Start: all reasoning presupposes ultimate commitments (presuppositions) that lie behind facts and arguments.
 - Internal critique: show that non-Christian presuppositions cannot account for the preconditions of intelligible experience (laws of logic, uniformity of nature, moral absolutes).
 - Transcendental demonstration (TAG): demonstrate that the truth of the Christian God is the necessary precondition for the possibility of logic, science, and ethics.
 - Application: expose equivocations and autonomy-of-reason claims by evidentialists; insist on the no-neutral-fact axiom.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Cornelius Van Til (methodological progenitor), contrasted with Gordon H. Clark and classical/evidential apologists (e.g., Norman Geisler trends).
 - Engages broader modern epistemology on reason, facts, and theistic credentials.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **General revelation** (role, limits, witness to providence)
 - **Special revelation** (Scripture as ultimate epistemic authority)
 - Epistemology (presuppositions, warrant, coherence)
 - Sin and its effect on reason (antithesis and depravity as cognitive)
- **Closing line**
 - Bahnsen's apologetic centers on the priority of Scripture-shaped presuppositions: only in the Christian revelation do the preconditions of intelligible thought and moral knowledge cohere.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Methodological priority of presuppositions**
 - Not merely an alternative tactic; Bahnsen insists presuppositions determine what counts as evidence.
- **Transcendental demonstration as hallmark**
 - Moves apologetics from probabilistic proofs to a claim that non-Christian systems fail the test of rational coherence.
- **Pushing the antithesis rhetorically & epistemically**
 - He advances the polemical posture that Christian and unbelieving thought are fundamentally opposed; the job of the apologist is to extend that opposition until non-Christian thought collapses.
- **Clarification / correction of predecessors**
 - Refines Van Til by systematizing rhetorical and logical moves; criticizes Clarkian rationalism for insufficient attention to biblical authority and the antithesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence in conservative Reformed seminaries and among presuppositional apologists; inspired numerous debates, textbooks, and apologetic curricula.
 - Critiques: charged with question-begging, overstating incoherence of non-Christian systems, and underestimating evidential common ground.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a rigorous model for internal critique and worldview apologetics; indispensable for courses on presuppositionalism and for understanding the Reformed challenge to evidentialism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Apologetic strategy asserting that theological commitments undergird all reasoning; faith-based starting points are unavoidable.
- **Antithesis**
 - The moral/intellectual divide between Christian and non-Christian worldviews; to be "pushed" to show incompatibility.
- **Transcendental Argument for God (TAG)**
 - Claim that the existence of the Christian God is the necessary precondition for logic, morality, and science.
- **General revelation**
 - God's revelation in nature and providence; valid as witness but epistemically insufficient for saving knowledge without Scripture.
 - Relation: testifies to God but requires interpretive categories furnished by special revelation.
- **Special revelation**
 - Scripture as propositional, ultimate authority that provides the presuppositions for coherent thought and faith.
- **No-neutral-facts thesis**
 - Rejection of an epistemic realm free from worldview commitments; all facts are interpreted within presuppositional frameworks.
- **Internal critique**
 - Method of exposing an unbelieving worldview's inability to account for its own presuppositions.
- **Incoherence charge**
 - The rhetorical/logical claim that non-Christian systems contradict necessary preconditions of rationality or morality.
- **Ultimate authority / epistemic foundation**
 - The idea that Scripture supplies the foundational categories that render knowledge possible.
- **Common grace (implicit tension)**
 - Acknowledged explanatory role for non-Christian success, but not a rival epistemic foundation.
- **Worldview epistemology**
 - Emphasis on holistic coherency among belief sets rather than isolated evidences.
- **Question-begging critique**
 - Common objection: presuppositional method assumes what it seeks to prove by starting from Scripture.
- **Debate model**
 - Bahnsen's live debates and examples are used as a pedagogical template for applied apologetics.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for presuppositional apologetics and TAG in systematic and apologetic syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialist/classical methodologies in apologetics and epistemology.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for relating general and special revelation: general revelation as witness, special revelation as interpretive key.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theology courses on sin, knowledge, and the authority of Scripture.
