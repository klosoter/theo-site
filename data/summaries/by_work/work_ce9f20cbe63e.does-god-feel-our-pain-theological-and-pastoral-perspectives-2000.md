### TITLE
Does God Feel Our Pain? Theological and Pastoral Perspectives (2000) - Thomas Weinandy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2000 during renewed debate over divine passibility and process/open theism. Situated within late 20th-century classical-theist resurgence in Roman Catholic and ecumenical circles responding to Moltmann, process theology (Whitehead/Hartshorne), and emergent Open Theism advocates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God does not suffer or change in his divine nature; classical attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) must be preserved. Yet God genuinely cares for and responds to human suffering without undergoing ontological alteration.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical-pastoral opening: pastoral anxieties about a God "who suffers with us" and the need to console sufferers.
 - Historical-theological survey: patristic and scholastic witnesses affirming divine immutability and impassibility (Augustine, Aquinas); contrast with modern dissenting voices (Moltmann, process theology).
 - Philosophical-theological defense: metaphysical grounds for simplicity and aseity; argument that divine impassibility secures God's transcendence and trustworthiness.
 - Christological clarification: distinction between the suffering of the incarnate Son in his human nature and the immutability of the divine nature; theodramatic account of God's compassionate action without divine alteration.
 - Pastoral consequences: how to speak of divine compassion, prayer, and providence while retaining classical theism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Aquinas, Anselm, selected medieval and scholastic sources; contemporary interlocutors including J. Moltmann, process theologians (Whitehead/Hartshorne), and proponents of Open Theism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity, Christology (hypostatic union), providence, prayer, pastoral theology of suffering and consolation.
- **Closing line:** Weinandy locates his theological center of gravity in classical theism: God is unchangeable and impassible in his being, yet in revelation and the Incarnation he enters genuine, salvific relation to human suffering without ontological alteration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that **impassibility is not moral indifference**; it secures divine faithfulness and freedom from creaturely limitation.
 - Clear separation of **ontological change** (disallowed for God) from **relational/emotional language** used analogically in Scripture and prayer.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct critique of Moltmannian and process accounts that make God metaphysically vulnerable or changeable; argues such views compromise divine sovereignty and aseity.
 - Challenges Open Theism's appeal to divine responsiveness by insisting responsiveness need not involve metaphysical change.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines pastoral vocabulary: recommends distinguishing anthropopathic language (ascribed feelings) from univocal claims about divine affect.
 - Emphasizes a two-level approach: **intra-divine simplicity** vs. **economic/relational revelation** (how God acts and is perceived).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in classical-theist and conservative Catholic circles as a clear statement defending traditional divine attributes.
 - Used as a corrective resource by pastors and systematic theologians arguing against affective readings of divine being.
 - Criticized by proponents of divine passibility for downplaying ontological realism of God's relational suffering.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to bring metaphysical theology into pastoral conversation without abandoning doctrinal rigour.
 - Useful primer for courses on divine attributes, Christology, and pastoral theology of suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God has no composition; attributes are identical to his essence. Used to argue against any metaphysical change or parts in God.
- **Aseity:** God is self-existent and dependent on nothing. Grounds aseity as incompatible with creature-inflicted suffering.
- **Immutability:** God does not change in being, knowledge, will; change would imply imperfection. Employed to secure God's trustworthiness amid suffering.
- **Impassibility:** God cannot suffer as creatures do. Central defended category; distinguished from God's compassionate action.
- **Passibility (as opposed):** The claim that God can suffer; Weinandy critiques contemporary proponents as metaphysically problematic.
- **Divine Compassion:** Real, efficacious care of God for creatures; explained analogically-genuine but not constitutive change in God's being.
- **Analogy / Anthropopathy:** Use of human emotional language for God; Weinandy stresses analogical, not univocal, predication.
- **Incarnation / Theanthropic Union:** The Son truly suffers in his human nature; this is the ground for God's saving solidarity without compromising divine impassibility.
- **Relationality (Economic Trinity):** How God relates in history; Weinandy uses the economic perspective to explain perceived responsiveness without altering divine essence.
- **Providence:** God's governance that accompanies suffering; defended as consistent with immutability and impassibility.
- **Emotional Language in Scripture:** Treated as analogical reportage of God's actions and dispositions, not literal metaphysical change.
- **Pastoral Consolation:** Practical application-assuring sufferers of God's faithful presence while upholding classical attributes.
- **Suffering (theodicy context):** Explored both existentially and doctrinally; Christ's passion is the decisive theological locus for divine solidarity.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition/reference** for classical attributes (simplicity/impassibility) in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against process theology, Moltmann, and Open Theism.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for interpreting anthropopathic Scripture and ministering to sufferers.
