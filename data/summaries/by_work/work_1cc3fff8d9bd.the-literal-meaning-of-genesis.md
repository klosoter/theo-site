### TITLE
The Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 4th-early 5th century; North African Latin patristic theology in post-Nicene, anti-Manichaean context.
 - Augustine writes as a bishop-scholar defending Christian orthodoxy and a careful exegetical method against both literalist and overly allegorical readings, and against dualistic cosmologies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture teaches truth but its mode of expression adapts to human capacity; the Genesis narrative must be read so as to safeguard divine immutability, creation ex nihilo, and the moral/Christological ends of Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory method: establish rules for reading Genesis with grammatical, historical and spiritual senses.
 - Exegetical moves:
 - Rejects naive literalism where it conflicts with reason or greater doctrine.
 - Argues that God, who is eternal, did not create temporal sequence in the same way creatures experience time; the "days" are pedagogical for human readers.
 - Harmonizes apparent difficulties (light before sun, order of creation) by positing different senses (literal/figurative; sensible vs intelligible creation).
 - Concludes with pastoral-catechetical aims: Genesis serves salvation-history and moral formation, not primitive natural science.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical text (Hebrew/Septuagint differences implicitly), Platonic-Augustinian philosophical categories (eternal forms, time), and polemically answers Manichaeans, literalists, and certain allegorists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation ex nihilo, divine eternity and immutability, providence and foreknowledge, interpretation of Scripture (literal vs spiritual senses), origin of the soul, original sin/concupiscence, typology and Christology in Genesis.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine centers Genesis interpretation on the convergence of Scripture, right reason, and pastoral ends: God's eternal action is revealed in forms suited to human understanding without compromising divine immutability or salvific purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Pedagogical condescension:** Genesis language is accommodated to human weakness; theological priority is meaning, not surface chronology.
 - **Philosophical precision about time:** "Time was made with creation" - time is a creaturely dimension, not a property of God; God stands outside temporal succession.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters naive literalist readings that force Scripture into scientific claims.
 - Pushes back against purely allegorical readings that evacuate historical and moral content.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Distinction between *sensible* (things as perceived) and *intelligible* creation (forms/ideas), used to explain Genesis order and the pre-solar "light."
 - A robust fourfold sense of Scripture in practice: literal/historical and multiple spiritual senses subordinated to apostolic faith.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply formative for medieval exegesis and the Latin tradition; heavily invoked in debates over scripture and science, days of creation, and the origin of souls.
 - Reformed theologians draw selectively: Augustine's anti-Manichaean theology and view of sin are central; his non-literal options inform later concordist and allegorizing approaches.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined hermeneutic balancing reason, doctrine, and pastoral sensitivity; indispensable for debates about Genesis, time, and Scripture's epistemic status.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation ex nihilo** - affirmation that God created the world out of nothing; foundational to Augustine's cosmology.
- **Divine eternity / immutability** - God's knowledge and will are outside temporal sequence; informs rejection of open-theist moves.
 - Use: polemic against any doctrine that limits divine foreknowledge.
- **Condescensio divina (divine condescension)** - God speaks in human terms for pedagogy; explains non-literal features.
- **Days of Creation** - Augustine treats "days" as a framework intelligible to humans; not necessarily successive 24-hour periods.
 - Use: resource for non-literal or analogical readings of Gen 1.
- **Time as creaturely** - time begins with creation; "before" creation there is no temporal before.
- **Sensible vs intelligible creation** - distinction to resolve how light can precede the luminaries and how forms relate to matter.
- **Literal / spiritual senses** - hermeneutical hierarchy that preserves historical sense but permits allegory for moral and spiritual meaning.
- **Origin of the soul** - Augustine argues for direct divine creation of the soul (creationism), not transmission by parents.
 - Use: key text in Traducianism vs Creationism debates.
- **Original sin / concupiscence** - Augustine locates transmission of sin in the disordered will and bodily concupiscence; Genesis used to ground doctrine of inherited sin.
- **Book of Nature / Scripture concord** - Augustine insists no real contradiction exists between rightly interpreted Scripture and true natural knowledge.
 - Use: precedent for concordist approaches that seek harmony with science.
- **Typology** - Genesis events interpreted as foreshadowing Christ and soteriology.
- **Hermeneutical rule of charity** - interpret unclear texts in light of established doctrine and reason.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative exegetical principles (literal sense qualified by spiritual sense).
- As **polemic** against Open Theism (affirming divine eternity/foreknowledge) and against naive literalism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-11 in conversation with natural philosophy (science and Scripture dialogue).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on the origin of the soul (creationism) and theological accounts of original sin.
