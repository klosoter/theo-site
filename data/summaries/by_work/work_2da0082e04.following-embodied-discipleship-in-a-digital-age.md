### TITLE
Following: Embodied Discipleship in a Digital Age - Jason Byassee

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary early-21st-century pastoral and theological response to pervasive digital media and social networking.
 - Situated within practical theology, pastoral ministry training, and conversations in digital religion and liturgical formation.
 - Engages a church anxious about screens, attention, presence, and the shape of Christian formation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** Authentic Christian following (discipleship) requires embodied practices and communal formation that resist reduction to purely digital interaction; technology shapes discipleship but cannot substitute for sacramental, liturgical, and incarnational practices.
 - **Problem addressed:** How to remain faithful to the incarnational, communal nature of the gospel when social life and attention are mediated increasingly by digital platforms.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Digital media reorder attention, presence, identity, and relational rhythms in ways that threaten classical Christian practices.
 - Theological resource: Retrieval of incarnational, sacramental, and liturgical traditions (e.g., table, confession, embodied worship) as corrective and formative.
 - Practical proposal: Foster hybrid patterns of life - disciplined practices that integrate technology without allowing it to displace embodied formation.
 - Pastoral implications: Ministries must cultivate habits of attention, hospitality, bodily presence, and embodied teaching (apprenticeship models) in congregational life.
 - Ends with concrete pastoral suggestions for worship, small groups, teaching, pastoral care, and life rhythms that prioritize incarnation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and modern Christian sources on discipleship and incarnation (Pauline texts, liturgical tradition, Bonhoeffer implicitly or explicitly via discipleship motifs).
 - Contemporary interlocutors in formation theory such as James K. A. Smith (liturgical/embodied formation) and scholars of digital culture (Sherry Turkle, Nicholas Carr-type critiques on attention).
 - Pastoral-theological conversations about technology in church life; draws on case studies and parish practice.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology/Incarnation:** centrality of embodied Christ as model and basis for embodied discipleship.
 - **Ecclesiology:** church as embodied community and site of formation; sacraments and embodied practices as constitutive.
 - **Anthropology:** human beings as embodied creatures whose attention and habits are formed by practices and media.
 - **Ethics / Spiritual formation:** habits, virtues, and practices shaping moral discipleship.
 - Secondary treatments: liturgy, sacraments, pastoral care, and social theology (effects of media on communal life).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Following Christ in a digital age is ultimately about cultivating embodied, communal habits of attention, presence, and sacramental life that shape discipleship more than any particular technology can.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses *embodiment* as the decisive corrective to digital disembodiment; not technophobic but formation-centered.
 - Moves quickly from diagnosis to parish-level praxis - concrete habits, liturgical rhythms, and apprenticeship models rather than abstract policy.
 - Reads digital culture through the lens of liturgical theology: media change what we worship, and worship forms the worshiper.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both technological determinism (tech will save/transform church) and simple nostalgia (return to pre-digital purity) by advocating disciplined hybridity.
 - Contrasts with purely cognitive or information-centric discipleship models; emphasizes practice and habit over information transfer.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframing "following" as apprenticeship grounded in bodily practices rather than as a networked, follower-count metric.
 - Uses "embodied discipleship" as a diagnostic and prescriptive category linking liturgical theology to digital media critique.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in pastoral theology and ministry training for practical guidance; cited in discussions about church digital strategy that want theological depth.
 - Influences conversations in liturgical formation, digital ministry, and seminary curricula emphasizing practice over platform.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resources for pastors and teachers seeking theologically grounded, practical responses to digital life.
 - Serves as a bridge between academic digital-theology reflection and parish praxis; useful for curriculum on formation, ecclesiology, and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Following**
 - Apprenticeship to Christ; not a social-media metric but embodied, communal discipleship.
- **Embodied discipleship**
 - Praxis-centered formation that integrates body, place, ritual, and community.
- **Incarnation**
 - Theological grounding for why bodily practices and presence matter for faith formation.
- **Liturgy / liturgical formation**
 - Practices that form desires and attention; primary means of shaping disciples.
- **Sacramentality**
 - Material means of grace; counters purely virtual or symbolic conceptions of Christian life.
- **Attention**
 - A theological-psychological category; screens reconfigure attention and thus spiritual formation.
- **Habits / practices**
 - Repeated embodied acts (Sabbath, table, confession) that cultivate disposition and character.
- **Hybrid church / hybrid practices**
 - Integration of digital tools with embodied communal life without allowing substitution.
- **Presence / hospitality**
 - Physical presence and welcoming practices as central to Christian community.
- **Apprenticeship**
 - Mentorship-based learning in embodied contexts, contrasted with information delivery models.
- **Digital mediation**
 - How technology mediates relationships and worship; diagnostic category for formation.
- **Ecclesial formation**
 - The church's responsibility to shape persons through communal practices.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "embodied discipleship" in courses on spiritual formation and pastoral theology.
 - As a **polemic** against both technophilia and nostalgic rejection of technology - advocating disciplined hybridity.
 - As a **practical/exegetical model** for designing parish practices and curricula that integrate digital tools without displacing sacramental, embodied formation.
