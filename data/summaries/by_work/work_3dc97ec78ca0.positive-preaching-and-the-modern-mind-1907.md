### TITLE
Positive Preaching and the Modern Mind (1907) - P. T. Forsyth 
Short bibliographic note: Published amid Edwardian-era theological ferment; representative of Forsyth's pulpit-theology program that fuses pastoral rhetoric, Christocentric dogmatics, and critique of liberal reductionism.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Britain; reaction against liberal, Ritschlian, and Harnackian tendencies that sought to domesticate Christianity to modern rationalism and ethicalism.
 - Movement: pastoral renewal, evangelical and neo-orthodox antecedents; speaking to clergy and public intellectuals about the nature and method of preaching.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Preaching must be positively Christocentric: an assertive proclamation of the living Christ and the gospel as an event of divine revelation, not merely defensive apologetics or moral instruction shaped to the "modern mind."
 - Theological corollary: Christ's person and work must be confessed in their paradox - divine agency that suffers and acts in redemption - resisting theories that dilute deity (including reductive kenotic readings).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modernity has two chief dangers for preaching - skeptical criticism that neutralizes miracles and dogma, and sentimental moralism that reduces the gospel to ethics.
 - Prescription: a "positive" pulpit that presupposes God's self-revelation in Christ and proclaims the concrete facts of redemption (incarnation, cross, resurrection) as authoritative realities.
 - Theological defense: insists on the possibility of a suffering, acting God whose self-manifestation in Christ is both supernatural and intelligible to faith; rejects purely metaphysical or abstract reconciliations that diminish the paradox.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages implicitly and explicitly with liberal critics (Harnack, Ritschl), the Kantian-critical tradition shaping the "modern mind," and contemporary pastoral educators.
 - Resonances with and influence on later neo-orthodox critics (e.g., Barth) though Forsyth retains distinct emphases.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (personal and eventful), Christology (person and work; suffering God), atonement (vicarious, paradoxical), preaching theory, authority of Scripture and miracle, faith and certainty.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: preaching must positively proclaim a paradoxical, suffering, and acting Christ whose redeemed revelation resists both modern skepticism and reductive kenoticizations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Positive proclamation** as method: preaching as an ontological encounter with Christ, not merely intellectual assent or moral persuasion.
 - **Paradox of divine action**: God can suffer and be truly engaged in the finite without ontological diminution.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal reductions that transform Christianity into ethics or myth; contrasts with kenotic tendencies that explain away the deity of Christ by positing an ontological loss.
 - Opposes apologetic timidness: confidence in the historical, miraculous, and costly character of the gospel.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces language of "positive" (affirmative) versus "negative" (defensive) preaching; frames the cross as revelation rather than merely moral example or metaphysical transaction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among preachers and pastoral theologians; recognized as a bridge to later 20th-century recoveries of dogmatic seriousness (neo-orthodoxy).
 - Criticized by proponents of scientific apologetics and by more radical kenotic theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how doctrinal conviction shapes homiletics; offers a sustained pastoral-theological critique of theological modernism and kenotic reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Positive Preaching** - Affirmative proclamation centered on Christ as historical, revelatory event; opposes apologetic retrenchment and moralism.
- **Modern Mind** - The intellectual climate shaped by historical criticism, scientism, and ethical liberalism that pressures theology to naturalize the miraculous.
- **Revelation (personal/evental)** - Revelation happens in the person and acts of Christ, not merely in propositions or moral impressions.
- **Paradox** - The central theological category for reconciling divine transcendence and immanence: God acts and suffers in Christ without loss of deity.
- **Suffering God** - The claim that God enters genuine suffering in the cross; Forsyth defends this without accepting ontological kenosis.
- **Kenosis (critique)** - Forsyth rejects kenotic accounts that construe the Son as having divested divine attributes; prefers a paradoxical model of divine self-donation.
 - Contrast: kenoticism explains self-emptying as diminution; Forsyth explains it as relational, volitional self-giving within divine being.
- **Atonement (vicarious, revelatory)** - Cross is both substitutionary and disclosure of God's redeeming love; not reducible to moral influence or mere example.
- **Authority of Christ / Scripture** - Proclamation rests on Christ's authoritative presence; Scripture attests this revelatory act and warrants preaching.
- **Supernaturalism vs Naturalism** - Firm rejection of naturalistic reductions; affirmation of miracle and divine intervention as intelligible in faith.
- **Certainty / Faith** - Faith is a warranted response to the living revelation; certainty is practical and existential, not merely epistemic neutrality.
- **Preaching as Encounter** - Sermon defined as event that summons listeners into the revelatory act, not merely instruction.
- **Homiletic method** - Start from Christ's facts; let doctrine shape rhetoric.
- **Pastoral theology** - Integration of doctrinal robustness with pastoral sensitivity and rhetorical boldness.

How this work is used
- As a definitional source for "positive preaching" and its homiletical program.
- As a polemic against kenotic reductionism and liberal domestication of Christology.
- As an exegetical-model exemplar: preaching that reads doctrine (cross, resurrection) as existential revelation.
- As a conceptual pivot in debates about the possibility of a suffering yet fully divine Christ.
