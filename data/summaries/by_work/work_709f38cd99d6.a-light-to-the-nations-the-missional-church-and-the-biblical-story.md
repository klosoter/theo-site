### TITLE
A Light to the Nations: The Missional Church and the Biblical Story - Michael W. Goheen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century contribution (Baker Academic, 2011) rooted in the global *missional church* conversation. Situated in Reformed-evangelical academic circles (Goheen at Calvin Theological Seminary) and in dialogue with the Missio Dei emphasis revived by Lesslie Newbigin, the work responds to secularization, church decline in the West, and the need to reclaim a biblically shaped public Christian vocation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The church's mission is not an add-on program but the church's very identity; mission must be reclaimed within the full biblical storyline so that vocation, dominion (cultural mandate), covenant, and kingdom hang together coherently.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Retells the grand biblical narrative in six movements: creation (vocation/cultural mandate), fall, Israel (covenant and electing purpose), Jesus (fulfillment and kingdom inauguration), church (missional community called to be a light to the nations), consummation (eschatological hope).
 - Shows how the cultural mandate (vocation/dominion) is not abrogated by redemption but redirected and renewed in Christ; mission flows from God's covenantal purpose to bless the nations.
 - Develops ecclesiology: the church exists as a missionary people whose identity and practices form witnesses in cultural contexts.
 - Proposes practical corollaries for discipleship, worship, church life, and public engagement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Lesslie Newbigin, contemporary missiologists (e.g., David Bosch), Reformed covenant theologians, biblical-theological resources across OT and NT. Uses patristic and Reformation insights selectively to inform ecclesial identity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (narrative reading of Scripture), covenant theology (central), Trinity (implicit in mission of God), Christology (Jesus as fulfillment and inaugurator of kingdom), ecclesiology (church as missionary), eschatology (consummation grounds mission), cultural mandate/vocation and dominion.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The church's identity is mission-shaped: as covenant people summoned to renewed vocation under Christ's reign, it bears witness to the nations by embodying the kingdom in word, worship, and cultural life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Integrates the *cultural mandate* (vocation/dominion) with missional ecclesiology rather than treating social/cultural engagement as secondary.
 - Frames mission primarily as participation in the Trinitarian mission of God through covenant-history rather than as an activity the church commissions.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects pietistic privatization of faith that separates personal piety from public vocation.
 - Counters reductionist mission models that privilege either proclamation alone (evangelism-only) or social action without proclamation; argues for an integrated witness.
 - Revises triumphalist or imperial understandings of church power by re-centering humility and servant witness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes "vocation" and "dominion" as rehabilitated theological categories reinterpreted through Christ's redeeming rule.
 - Uses the biblical storyline as a hermeneutical lens to align ecclesial practice with redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a foundational text in missiology and ecclesiology courses.
 - Influenced congregational leaders seeking theological grounding for cultural engagement and holistic mission strategies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise, teachable synthesis linking biblical theology and practical church life.
 - Functions as a corrective bridge between academic biblical theology and congregational praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missional Church:** Church defined by its participation in God's mission, not merely by programs.
- **Missio Dei:** God's sending; mission originates in the triune God and shapes the church's identity.
- **Biblical Story / Grand Narrative:** Creation, fall, Israel, Christ, church, consummation as the hermeneutical frame for mission.
- **Creation Mandate (Cultural Mandate):** God's original commission for human vocation and ordered dominion; redeemed, not revoked.
- **Vocation:** Ordinary cultural work and calling as spheres for Christian witness and stewardship.
- **Dominion:** Responsible cultural stewardship under God's reign, redeemed in Christ.
- **Covenant:** The structure through which God's promise to bless the nations unfolds and grounds the church's mission.
- **Kingdom of God:** Inaugurated in Christ; the telos that reorients vocation and mission.
- **Church as Light to the Nations:** The church's identity and task-to embody and witness God's covenantal blessing to diverse peoples.
- **Participation (in God's mission):** The church participates in, not merely carries out, God's mission.
- **Witness/Testimony:** Word and life integrated-evangelism plus cultural formation.
- **Formation / Discipleship:** Practices that form people to live vocations under Christ's reign.
- **Contextualization:** Doing mission that respects cultural particularity while remaining rooted in the biblical story.
- **Esoteric vs. Public Faith (contrast):** Rehabilitates public, cultural engagement against privatizing tendencies.
- How the work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed missional ecclesiology and for clarifying the relationship of vocation and mission.
 - As a **polemic** against inward-focused congregationalism and mission models that divorce cultural mandate from redemption.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture narratively to derive ecclesial practice and a **conceptual pivot** connecting covenant theology, the cultural mandate, and missional discipleship.
