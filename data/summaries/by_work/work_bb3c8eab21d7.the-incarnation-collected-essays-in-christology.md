### TITLE
The Incarnation: Collected Essays in Christology - edited by Peter G. Bolt and Mark D. Thompson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** contemporary evangelical-academic conversation aiming to retrieve and reformulate classical Christology for late modern theological, exegetical, and pastoral challenges. Situated within renewed interest (late 20th-21st century) in connecting biblical studies, historical theology, and systematic doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the incarnation is the pivotal doctrine for Christian theology: how the Word became flesh must be understood in ways that are biblically faithful, historically orthodox (especially Chalcedonian), and able to bear the weight of soteriology, revelation, and worship in a postmodern context.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - biblical foundations: New Testament Christology and incarnation motifs (Synoptics, Johannine Logos, Pauline soteriology);
 - historical retrieval: patristic and Chalcedonian formulations as guardrails for contemporary formulations of person and natures;
 - doctrinal tensions: treatment of kenosis, communicatio idiomatum, divine impassibility/mutability, and twofold volition/operation debates;
 - systematic implications: incarnation's relation to atonement, resurrection, the Trinity, revelation, and ecclesial life;
 - pastoral and missional applications: how a robust incarnation theology shapes preaching, sacraments, and Christian formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** sustained appeal to patristic authors (Athanasius, Augustine) and Chalcedonian terminology; dialogue with Reformation (Calvin) and moderns (Barth, contemporary evangelical and analytic theologians); engagement with recent kenotic proposals and radical critiques from liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and natures), Trinity, revelation, soteriology/atonement, resurrection, incarnation ethics and ecclesiology, christological language and preaching.
- **Closing line:** the collection reaffirms that faithful theology must root doctrine, worship, and mission in the concrete reality of the Incarnate Word, using classical formulations reinterpreted to meet contemporary exegetical and pastoral questions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - insistence on the inseparability of historical-narrative exegesis and doctrinal formulation - incarnational claims are anchored in gospel narrative and apostolic witness.
 - careful defence of Chalcedonian grammar as both confessional boundary and heuristically helpful, not merely antiquarian jargon.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - measured critique of liberal reductions that domesticate or demythologize the incarnation into purely moral example or symbolic presence.
 - cautious distancing from radical kenotic models that undermine classical attributes of divinity while also avoiding sterile metaphysical abstractions that divorce Christology from Scripture and salvation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - re-articulation of the communicatio idiomatum in ways that preserve divine impassibility and genuine human suffering without collapsing natures.
 - nuanced treatment of kenosis as functional self-limitation grounded in the person of the Son rather than ontological diminution of divinity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - widely used in evangelical academic contexts as a corrective and resource for re-centering Christology in curricula; appreciated for integrating exegesis, history, and systematics.
 - influential among pastors and seminary teachers seeking balanced, orthodox alternatives to both liberal and speculative recent trends.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - pedagogically strong: clear expository essays that model how to do historically responsible, biblically attentive, and pastorally sensitive Christology.
 - serves as a bridge text for students moving from New Testament studies into systematic theology and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation:** the Word become flesh; treated as nexus of revelation, atonement, and divine presence.
- **Hypostatic union:** personal union of two natures in the one person of Christ; Chalcedonian matrix for essays.
- **Kenosis:** discussed as Christ's self-limitation in mission and mode of divine action, interpreted so as not to imply loss of deity.
 - contrasted with ontological kenoticism that the volume generally rejects.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** exchange or attribution of properties between divine and human in Christ; re-articulated to protect both natures.
- **Chalcedonian definition:** invoked as normative grammar for contemporary formulations.
- **Two natures / one person:** careful distinction maintained to secure both full deity and full humanity without confusion or separation.
- **Divine impassibility / mutability:** addressed to reconcile classical divine attributes with the reality of Christ's suffering and change in human experience.
- **Atonement (Christological focus):** incarnation framed as necessary context for penal, substitutionary, and participatory aspects of salvation.
- **Revelation:** incarnation as God's self-disclosure; Christ as hermeneutical key for Scripture and doctrine.
- **Narrative-historical model:** emphasis on gospel narrative as formative for doctrinal claims.
- **Pastoral christology:** implications for preaching, sacraments, and pastoral care emphasized throughout.
- **Soteriology-ecclesiology link:** incarnation grounds the church's identity and mission.
- **Use across loci:**
 - used as a **definitional source** for seminaries teaching orthodox Christology that integrates exegesis and doctrine.
 - used polemically against demythologizing liberal Christologies and unbounded speculative kenoticism.
 - serves as an **exegetical-model** resource demonstrating how New Testament texts inform historical formulations.
 - functions as a **conceptual pivot** for courses linking Christology with soteriology, worship, and pastoral practice.
