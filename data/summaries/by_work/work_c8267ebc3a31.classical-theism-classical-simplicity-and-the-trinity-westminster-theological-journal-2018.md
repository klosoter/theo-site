### TITLE
**Classical Theism, Classical Simplicity, and the Trinity** - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2018 in a conservative Reformed journal; engages contemporary analytic and historical theistic literature from a Reformed/evangelical vantage.
 - Part of ongoing debates between defenders of classical theism (Thomistic-Aquinian line) and Trinitarian theologians worried about the implications of absolute simplicity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Classical formulations of divine simplicity (DS) as advanced in classical theism create tensions for a robust, Biblical Trinitarianism; Poythress argues for a reframing that preserves Trinitarian personal distinctions while retaining core divine unity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostics: Explains what classical simplicity claims (no real composition, attributes identical with the divine essence, ultimate metaphysical unity) and shows how taken strictly it threatens meaningful intra-Trinitarian relations.
 - Taxonomy: Distinguishes **absolute attributes** (inherent, non-relational aspects of God) from **relative attributes** (intra-divine and creature-related relations).
 - Theological corrective: Proposes that a careful acceptance of simplicity must allow for real relations (e.g., begetting/spirating) that are not reducible to mere linguistic or conceptual distinctions.
 - Rescue moves:
 - Argues classical simplicity must be nuanced to avoid modal collapse and the erosion of personal distinctions.
 - Offers a model where divine attributes can be affirmed as truly identical with the divine being while relational distinctions are nevertheless real and personal.
 - Conclusion: Classical theism's resources can be retained, but classical simplicity needs reformulation so that Trinitarian relations are neither collapsed nor treated as mere epistemic/methodological devices.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit interlocutors: Augustine, Aquinas (classical simplicity heritage); modern classical theists and analytic metaphysicians (representative debates); Reformed/evangelical Trinitarian critics.
 - Engages philosophical concepts (identity, relations, composition) to test theological claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (primary), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability), revelation (how Scripture informs attribute talk), and the metaphysics of relations.

- **Closing line**
 - Poythress situates himself as urging a mediated classical theism: preserve divine unity and simplicity, but re-conceptualize simplicity so real, irreducible Trinitarian relations and personal distinctions remain doctrinally central.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear analytic distinction between **absolute** and **relative** attributes as theological-technical categories to protect Trinitarian personal relations while conserving classical talk about unity.
 - Emphasizes biblical Trinitarian commitments as the normative corrective to abstract metaphysical moves.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on ultra-Thomistic readings of DS that identify all attributes exhaustively with essence and thereby neutralize relationality.
 - Contrasts with critics who abandon simplicity entirely; Poythress seeks reform rather than rejection.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes the absolute/relative attribute distinction as a hermeneutical tool for attribute talk and for adjudicating metaphysical claims about relations in God.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Relevant to Reformed and evangelical theologians skeptical of Thomistic simplism; used in intra-evangelical debates about how to integrate analytic metaphysics with biblical Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Cited in subsequent literature as a constructive attempt to mediate between classical theism and Trinitarian fidelity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, teachable framework for students and teachers wanting to preserve core features of classical theism while avoiding Trinitarian distortion.
 - Serves as a bridge for dialogue between analytic philosophers of religion and confessional Trinitarian theologians.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical Theism**
 - Theological tradition emphasizing divine simplicity, immutability, timelessness, and impassibility; Poythress accepts many commitments but revises extremes.

- **Divine Simplicity (classical simplicity)**
 - Thesis that God has no metaphysical composition; attributes are identical to the divine essence. Poythress argues for a qualified simplicity that allows real relations.

- **Trinity / Trinitarian relations**
 - Persons distinguished by relations of origin (begetting/spirating); central locus where simplicity tensions surface.

- **Absolute attributes**
 - Attributes internal to God not essentially constituting relations (e.g., aseity, immutability as inward properties).

- **Relative attributes**
 - Attributes that are relational by nature (e.g., Fatherhood, Sonship, procession), crucial for protecting personal distinctions.

- **Intra-divine relations**
 - Real relations among the persons of the Trinity that must not be reduced to mere conceptual distinctions without ontological status.

- **Modal collapse**
 - Risk that an overly rigid simplicity makes all contingent truths necessary; Poythress identifies this as a danger to be avoided.

- **Identity of attributes and essence**
 - Classical claim that attributes are identical with God's essence; Poythress allows identity but insists relationality requires real distinction of personal relations.

- **Analytic metaphysics (relations, composition)**
 - Philosophical tools used to test theological claims about simplicity and personhood.

- **Biblical Trinitarianism**
 - Scriptural portrait of the Father, Son, Spirit as distinct persons in real relation; normative corrective for metaphysical formulations.

- **Relational ontology**
 - Emphasized to show how persons can be distinct without implying composition in God.

- **Aseity / Immutability**
 - Treated as absolute attributes that remain compatible with reconfigured simplicity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the absolute vs relative attributes distinction in systematic treatments of divine attributes.
- As a **polemic** against uncompromising versions of classical simplicity that threaten Trinitarian personalism.
- As an **exegetical-modeling** aid for reading Trinitarian passages with attentiveness to ontological rather than merely linguistic relations.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula seeking a middle path between Thomistic metaphysics and confessional Trinitarianism.
