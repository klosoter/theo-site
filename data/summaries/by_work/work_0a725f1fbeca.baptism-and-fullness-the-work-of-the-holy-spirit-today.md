### TITLE
Baptism and Fullness: The Work of the Holy Spirit Today - John R. W. Stott

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published amid the mid-20th-century **charismatic renewal** (1960s-1970s) and its spread into mainline and evangelical churches.
 - Stott writes as a conservative evangelical Anglican seeking a careful, biblically-grounded mediation between uncritical charismatic enthusiasm and hardline cessationism.
 - Audience: pastors, evangelicals concerned about both doctrine and pastoral practice.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Holy Spirit works in distinctive but complementary ways: believers are **regenerated** and "baptized" by the Spirit; some experience a distinct subsequent empowerment or "fullness" for witness and ministry. Scripture must govern the evaluation of contemporary charismatic phenomena.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: sustained readings of **Luke-Acts** and Pauline texts to define "baptism in the Spirit," "filling/fullness," and the purpose of spiritual gifts.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Distinguishes **regeneration (indwelling)** from **Spirit baptism** as empowerment for mission (while avoiding rigid temporal schemata).
 - Defines **fullness** as a recurring, progressive state of yieldedness and empowerment, not a single sensational event.
 - Pastoral application:
 - Encourages openness to Spirit-given experiences when consonant with Scripture.
 - Prescribes safeguards: doctrinal discernment, church order, moral holiness, pastoral oversight.
 - Evaluative critique:
 - Rules out excesses (lawlessness, disorder, ecstatic triumphalism) and rejects simplistic denial of spirit-given gifts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: **charismatic movement** (Pentecostal praxis and emerging charismatic leaders).
 - Conversational partners: conservative evangelicals/cessationists and Anglican sacramental theology.
 - Scriptural exegesis is dominant; Stott also appeals to historic evangelical theology and pastoral experience.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central)
 - Soteriology (regeneration, sanctification)
 - Ecclesiology and mission (Spirit-empowered witness)
 - Sacramentology (relation of Spirit-baptism to water baptism)
 - Gifts (charismata), tongues, prophecy, and church order

- **Closing line**
 - Stott centers a **Scripture-governed, balanced pneumatology**: the Spirit regenerates and empowers the church; Christians must pursue fullness with biblical discernment, holiness, and order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A sustained mediating posture: neither wholesale rejection nor uncritical acceptance of charismatic practices.
 - Emphasis on **"fullness" as ongoing yieldedness** rather than a one-off emotional datum.
 - Pastoral concern: spiritual experiences must promote **mission, holiness, and unity**.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters charismatic excesses (disorder, triumphalism, anti-intellectualism) with calls to scriptural boundaries and church order.
 - Counters rigid cessationism by affirming the contemporary presence and operation of spiritual gifts, albeit regulated.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Pairs and differentiates **"baptism"** and **"fullness"** to capture both initiation and sustained empowerment.
 - Reframes charismatic phenomena in pastoral categories (discerning fruit, role in mission) rather than solely experiential categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among evangelicals who sought a theologically responsible openness to the Spirit.
 - Influential in bridging some Anglican and evangelical communities with the charismatic renewal.
 - Used in pastoral training as a model for integrating pneumatology with congregational order.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of **biblical exegesis married to pastoral prudence**.
 - Useful as a temperate template for churches negotiating charismatic renewal without abandoning doctrinal integrity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism in the Spirit**
 - Distinct from regeneration; linked to empowerment for witness; may be experienced subsequent to conversion though not necessarily chronologically separate in all cases.
- **Fullness of the Spirit**
 - Ongoing state of empowerment and surrender; repeatable and progressive rather than a single climax.
- **Regeneration / indwelling**
 - The Spirit's work at conversion; assures union with Christ and new life.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive work of the Spirit producing holiness and conformity to Christ.
- **Charismata (spiritual gifts)**
 - Real and operative today; require discernment and ordering within the church.
 - Distinguishes normative gifts (teaching, leadership) from sign gifts (tongues, healings) with contextual evaluation.
- **Tongues**
 - Treated cautiously: scriptural validity but not normative proof of spirituality; require interpretation and pastoral regulation.
- **Empowerment for mission**
 - Key purpose of Spirit baptism and fullness: bold, fruitful witness and effective ministry.
- **Yieldedness / surrender**
 - Practical disposition necessary for experiencing fullness; moral and spiritual readiness matters.
- **Order and discernment**
 - Ecclesial safeguards for spiritual phenomena; emphasis on Scripture, apostles' teaching, and pastoral oversight.
- **Cessationism vs. Continuationism**
 - Stott rejects rigid cessationism; affirms continuity but insists on biblical testing of claims.
- **Scriptural authority**
 - Ultimate criterion for evaluating experiences and teachings about the Spirit.
- **Fruit of the Spirit**
 - Primary test for authenticity of charismatic expressions (Galatians 5).
- **Water baptism**
 - Related to but not identical with Spirit baptism; sacrament and Spirit-act must be theologically distinguished.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies evangelical definitions of Spirit-baptism and fullness.
 - Polemic: measured critique of charismatic excesses and of absolutist cessationism.
 - Exegetical model: demonstrates how to read Luke-Acts and Paul for pneumatology and mission.
