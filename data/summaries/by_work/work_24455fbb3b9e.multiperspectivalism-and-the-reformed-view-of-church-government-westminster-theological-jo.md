### TITLE
Multiperspectivalism and the Reformed View of Church Government - Vern Poythress (articles in Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed theological conversation; Westminster Theological Journal as venue within conservative Reformed/Presbyterian academic milieu.
 - Poythress writes as a systematic theologian influenced by Reformed confessionalism and Van Tilian apologetic method, applying a multiperspectival epistemology to ecclesiology and polity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ecclesial order (offices, courts, discipline) must be understood multiperspectivally: no single category (biblical text, historical practice, pastoral need, confessional norm) suffices to settle church government.
 - Proper Presbyterian polity emerges when **normative doctrine, situational ordering, and pastoral/existential care** are held together under covenantal and confessional constraints.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Explicate the multiperspectival method (typically triperspectival: normative, situational, existential) and defend its application to questions of church order.
 - Apply each perspective to key loci:
 - **Normative**: biblical warrant for elders, office definitions, authority in the church, and confessional doctrine (Westminster standards).
 - **Situational**: historical developments, institutional structures (session, presbytery, synod), and practical governance patterns.
 - **Existential / pastoral**: congregational life, discipline as restorative, care of souls, plurality and parity of elders in pastoral function.
 - Synthesize perspectives to defend specific Reformed distinctives: plurality of elders, parity (functional equality) among elders, graded courts with appeal, and disciplined exercise of keys.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Reformed confessions (Westminster), New Testament witness (Pastoral Epistles, Acts, epistles), early church practice, Puritan and Scottish kirk polity, contemporary advocates of congregationalism and episcopacy.
 - Methodological resonance with Cornelius Van Til (presuppositional reasoning) and Poythress's own multiperspectival theory developed across his corpus.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (church as covenant community), offices (elder/pastor/minister), discipline (keys, admonition, excommunication), authority and power, sacraments only insofar as related to office and oversight, covenant and confessional subscription.

- **Closing line**
 - Poythress locates Presbyterian polity as an integrated, covenantal ordering that only makes sense when doctrine, social/institutional reality, and pastoral life are held together under a multiperspectival theological method.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic use of multiperspectivalism to analyze polity-treats office and discipline as simultaneously theological, social, and pastoral phenomena.
 - Strong insistence that confessional norms (WCF, Directory) function as a normative perspective, not a straightjacket, mediated by biblical exegesis and pastoral exigency.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters reductionist approaches that ground polity solely in historical practice (antiquarianism) or only in isolated exegetical texts (textualism).
 - Challenges congregationalist claims of ultimate local autonomy and episcopal centralization by arguing for interdependent courts and parity among elders.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Applying triperspectival categories (normative/situational/existential) as hermeneutical lenses for canonical passages on church order.
 - Clarifying the distinction between office (ontological/constitutional status) and function (practical exercise), helping to adjudicate debates over plural eldership vs. single-pastor models.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful within conservative Reformed circles as a methodological supplement to confessional and exegetical arguments.
 - Cited by scholars and pastors seeking a philosophically coherent defense of Presbyterian arrangements; less uptake in churches unconvinced by multiperspectival epistemology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a disciplined framework for integrating doctrine, practice, and pastoral wisdom; valuable for seminary instruction on polity and for denominational debates over office and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Multiperspectivalism / Triperspectivalism** - methodological framework using complementary perspectives (normative, situational, existential) to approach theological questions.
- **Normative perspective** - doctrinal/confessional and biblical standards that determine what ought to be.
- **Situational perspective** - historical, institutional, and pragmatic factors shaping how polity is embodied.
- **Existential (pastoral) perspective** - the lived, pastoral needs and spiritual welfare of congregants informing application.
- **Elder (presbyter)** - office in Reformed polity; Poythress stresses both ontological status and functional plurality.
 - Distinguishes **ruling elder** and **teaching elder/minister** in functional terms while defending parity in essential officehood.
- **Plurality of elders** - theological and practical rationale for multiple elders in local congregations for accountability and mutual oversight.
- **Parity of elders** - claim that elders share essential office status even with differentiated roles; counters hierarchical episcopal claims.
- **Church courts (session, presbytery, synod, assembly)** - graded structures for adjudication and discipline; defended as covenantal expressions of corporate accountability.
- **Discipline / keys of the kingdom** - corrective, restorative practice rooted in covenant obligations; argued to be exercised communally through elders and courts.
- **Ordination** - constitutive act recognizing office; analyzed as both theological (calling/warrant) and situational (ecclesial recognition).
- **Office vs. function** - conceptual distinction used to settle debates over titles, roles, and powers.
- **Confessional subscription (WCF)** - normative anchor that interacts with biblical exegesis and pastoral exigency.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for integrating doctrinal, pastoral, and practical definitions of office and discipline.
- As a **polemic** against congregationalist and episcopal reductions of polity.
- As an **exegetical-model** showing how to read church-order texts through complementary theological lenses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary seminars to bridge systematics, hermeneutics, and practical theology.
