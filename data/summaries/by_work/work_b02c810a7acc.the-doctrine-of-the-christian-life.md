### TITLE
**The Doctrine of the Christian Life** (Theology of Lordship series) - John M. Frame, P&R, 2008

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written amid late-20th/early-21st century Reformed renewal, shaped by Van Tilian presuppositionalism and Frame's own tri-perspectival method.
 - Addresses evangelical ethics during culture-war debates (abortion, sexuality, war, economics), worship controversies, and Reformed discussions on law, liberty, and civil society.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Ethics is theology**: Christian ethics is the application of **God's Word** to all areas of life by **obedient persons** in **real situations** under the **Lordship of Christ**.
 - The moral life is structured by God's lordship attributes (authority, control, presence) and known through **tri-perspectivalism** (normative, situational, existential).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: metaethics and epistemology of ethics; Scripture's authority and sufficiency; revelation, reason, and conscience.
 - Law and gospel; covenantal setting of the moral law; love as fulfillment; casuistry and wisdom.
 - Extended exposition of the **Decalogue** (1st-10th commandments) with applications (worship, images, vows, Sabbath, authority, life, sexuality, property, truth, desire).
 - Virtues and motives; Christian liberty and conscience; church discipline; oaths and vows.
 - Social ethics: family, work, economics, the state and just war, civil disobedience, bioethics, sexuality, and culture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture and Reformed confessions; Calvin; Westminster Standards.
 - Van Til; Kuyper; discussion with Niebuhr's Christ-and-culture typology.
 - Engagement with **theonomy** (Rushdoony, Bahnsen), **natural law** (Aquinas and heirs), and modern ethical theories (Kant, Mill, Aristotle, Fletcher).
 - Evangelical ethicists (e.g., Geisler) on graded absolutism and conflicting norms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; Trinity and lordship; covenant theology; law and gospel; sanctification and union with Christ; ecclesiology (worship, discipline); pneumatology (illumination, fruit); eschatology (already/not yet) as moral horizon; Christology as ethical center and exemplar.
- **Center of gravity**
 - Grateful, Spirit-empowered obedience to Jesus' lordship, applying Scripture wisely in concrete circumstances for the glory of God and the good of neighbor.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Tri-perspectival method** integrating standards, situation, and agent; correlates with lordship attributes (authority, control, presence).
 - **Ethics as theology** (not an autonomous discipline); Scripture's sufficiency for moral norms; rehabilitation of **casuistry** as pastoral wisdom.
 - Robust, Christocentric exposition of the **Decalogue** as trans-covenantal moral core; **love** as summary of the law.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects antinomianism and legalism; affirms the third use of the law.
 - Critiques **theonomy**'s direct transfer of OT civil penalties; upholds abiding moral law with prudent application.
 - Resists **natural law** as an independent norm; affirms general revelation subordinate to Scripture.
 - Engages and reframes deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics as partial perspectives.
 - **Worship**: advocates a modified regulative principle; permits pedagogical depictions of Christ (non-idolatrous), in contrast with stricter Reformed iconoclasm.
 - **Sabbath**: Lord's Day sanctification without rigid traditionalism; underscores mercy and wisdom.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Triads: normative/situational/existential; motive/goal/standard; authority/control/presence.
 - Ethical knowledge as covenantal and analogical; conscience formed by Word and Spirit in community.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and churches; praised for clarity, pastoral reach, and integration.
 - Debated by strict confessionalists (2nd commandment, Sabbath), by theonomists, and by natural-law proponents.
- **Enduring value**
 - A comprehensive, biblically anchored method that travels well across loci; exemplar of applied Reformed casuistry for pastors and teachers.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tri-perspectivalism**: Ethics viewed through three lenses:
 - **Normative** (God's commands), **situational** (facts, consequences, providence), **existential** (agent, motives, conscience).
- **Lordship attributes**: **Authority** (right to command), **control** (sovereign rule over circumstances), **presence** (indwelling Spirit shaping the agent).
- **Ethics as theology**: Moral claims are theological judgments about what God approves and blesses.
- **Law of God / Decalogue**: Enduring moral core; case laws illustrate applications; love fulfills the law.
- **Love as fulfillment**: Summary norm guiding applications; never antithetical to commandments.
- **Casuistry**: Case-based reasoning that applies general norms to concrete particulars with wisdom.
- **Modified regulative principle**: Scripture governs worship's elements and ends; prudential freedom in circumstances; rejects man-made rites as binding.
- **Christian liberty and conscience**: Freedom from human traditions; conscience normed by Scripture; charity in disputable matters.
- **General vs. special revelation**: General revelation true yet suppressed; Scripture normatively interprets creation for ethics.
- **Theonomy (critical engagement)**: Affirms continuity of moral law; denies simple transposition of OT civil penalties.
- **Just war**: Defense of limited, criteria-governed warfare; rejects pacifism as normative ethic for the state.
- **Christ and culture**: Eschatological tension (already/not yet); multiple lawful modes of cultural engagement under Christ's lordship.
- **Sanctification and union with Christ**: Ethical transformation flows from union, Spirit's indwelling, and gratitude.
- **Two-kingdoms (qualified)**: Distinguishes church and state vocations without erecting a moral-dualism firewall.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for the method of Christian ethics and the third use of the law.
 - As a polemical reference against theonomy, radical two-kingdoms, antinomianism, and autonomous natural law.
 - As an exegetical model for Decalogue-based moral theology and worship practice.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking sanctification, ecclesial discipline, public theology, and eschatological hope.
