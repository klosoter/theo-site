### TITLE
Reading the Word of God in the Presence of God - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical milieu (late 20th-early 21st century). Poythress writes from a Westminster/Reformed academic and pastoral horizon, interacting with both classical Reformation/Puritan hermeneutics and modern biblical-theological debates.
- **Central thesis**
 - Reading Scripture is inherently an act of worship in the presence of the triune God: true interpretation unites careful exegesis with prayerful dependence on the Spirit and a Christ-centered canonical perspective (Christ in OT and NT).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture is authoritative and intended to be read as address from God; therefore reading requires a spiritual posture (prayer, repentance, humility).
 - The Holy Spirit illumines readers; illumination does not replace historical-grammatical exegesis but forms a cooperative relation with it.
 - The Bible is a unified canon; the New Testament reveals the fullness of Christ, and the Old Testament must be read typologically/canonically as anticipating and witnessing to Christ.
 - Practical consequences: preaching, personal devotion, and communal formation must integrate rigorous exegesis with worshipful reading.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Calvin, Augustine, Puritan devotional hermeneutics, and recent canonical theologians. Engages contemporary critical approaches (historical-critical method, literary/canonical criticism) and dialogues with theologians like John Frame (multiperspectivalism) and Brevard Childs (canonical emphasis).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, canonicity), Christology (presence of Christ in OT and NT), Trinity (role of the Spirit in illumination; reading in the presence of the triune God), covenant and typology, pastoral theology and spiritual formation.
- **Closing line**
 - Knowledge of the Bible is both intellectual and doxological: the triune God speaks, the Spirit enables hearing, and Christ is the interpretive center that unites Old and New Testaments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates rigorous exegesis with devotion: reading as worship rather than merely information extraction.
 - Strong Christocentric canonical hermeneutic: the Old Testament is legitimate only when read in relation to Christ as revealed in the New.
 - Balances Spirit-led illumination with objective methods-no antithesis between spiritual reading and academic exegesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely historical-critical or purely literary approaches that dissociate interpretation from worship and the Spirit.
 - Modifies some strands of canonical theology that underplay the role of individual/communal spiritual responsiveness by insisting reading must be a presence-driven practice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "reading in the presence of God" as a technical pastoral-hermeneutical category that subsumes illumination, worship, and canonical Christ-centered interpretation.
 - Applies multiperspectival reasoning to hermeneutics: theological, historical, and devotional perspectives are mutually corrective.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Reformed and evangelical academic and pastoral circles for blending scholarship with spiritual formation; used in seminary courses on hermeneutics and preaching.
 - Cited by those seeking a corrective to detached critical methods and by ministers concerned for devotional depth in exegesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a sustainable model for preaching and Bible reading that preserves scholarly rigor while promoting spiritual transformation; durable for pastoral training and devotional theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presence of God**
 - Reading as standing before the triune God; shapes posture, prayer, and interpretive humility.
- **Illumination**
 - The Spirit's enabling role; not a substitute for exegesis but its necessary complement.
- **Christocentric reading**
 - Christ as the interpretive center binding OT types and NT fulfillment.
- **Typology**
 - Valid canonical patterns where OT events/figures anticipate Christ; historically grounded and theologically canonical.
- **Canonical reading**
 - Interpreting texts within the Bible's final redemptive-historical shape, recognizing inter-testamental coherence.
- **Worshipful exegesis / devotional hermeneutic**
 - Exegesis done as an act of worship-affective and formative as well as cognitive.
- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture as God-speech; normative for belief and life, requiring both academic and devotional fidelity.
- **Multiperspectivalism**
 - Using complementary perspectives (e.g., grammatical-historical, theological, pastoral) to avoid one-sided readings.
- **Christ in OT and NT**
 - Emphasis that the OT witness must be read as pointing to and fulfilled in Christ in the NT.
- **Analogy of faith**
 - Interpreting Scripture with Scripture; coherence across the canon under Christ's lordship.
- **Historical-grammatical method (reformed)**
 - Retained and re-shaped: historically aware but theologically attuned and worshipful, not purely positivistic.
- **Spiritual formation**
 - Reading as formative practice that shapes character, devotion, and preaching.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional resource for a pastoral, devotional hermeneutic that keeps exegesis rigorous but doxologically oriented.
 - As a polemic resource against secularizing historical-critical exclusivism and against pietistic anti-intellectualism.
 - As an exegetical model in preaching and biblical-theology courses for reading the OT in light of Christ in the NT.
