### TITLE
The Case for Covenant Communion (2004) - Peter J. Leithart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed renewal and controversy; emerges amid the Federal Vision debates and renewed interest in patristic and covenantal sacramentology.
 - Published as an intervention in debates over paedocommunion, the nature and administration of the Lord's Supper, and Reformed sacramental practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Leithart argues that the Lord's Supper should be administered to baptized covenant children (paedocommunion) because communion is a covenantal act tied to household membership, not merely an individual profession of saving faith.
 - Problem addressed: the Reformed practice of "closed" or "believer's" communion for baptized children and the doctrinal basis for excluding covenant children from the table.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical-historical exegesis: household passages (e.g., Genesis passover, household circumcision, Acts 2 & 16) show continuity between Old and New covenant table inclusion.
 - Covenant logic: baptism incorporates children into the covenant community in a manner warranting participation in covenant signs and meals.
 - Sacramental theology: sacraments are not merely signs of faith but instruments/seals that signify and effect covenant union; the supper is a covenant meal signaling communal and familial identity in Christ.
 - Ecclesiology and pastoral practice: the church as covenant family should practice open communion to baptized households, with pastoral oversight rather than a prior individual adult profession requirement.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed theology (Westminster standards, Calvin's sacramental theology) but critiques its praxis.
 - Dialogues with contemporary Reformed critics of paedocommunion and with proponents within the Federal Vision movement.
 - Uses Old Testament typology (Passover, covenant meals), New Testament household texts, and patristic examples.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (inclusion, continuity)
 - Sacramental theology (nature and efficacy of baptism and the Lord's Supper)
 - Ecclesiology (visible church, household belonging)
 - Christology and union with Christ (as ground of covenant participation)
 - Implications for soteriology/justification (boundary questions about how covenant inclusion relates to saving faith)

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The work reorients Eucharistic practice around **covenant membership and household continuity**, contending that the Lord's Supper functions primarily as a covenant meal for baptized households rather than a rite reserved only for those with an explicit, adult verbal profession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on the family-household dynamics of covenant life; reads communion first as a familial/covenantal meal, not merely an individual sign of faith.
 - Treats baptismal incorporation as a sufficient warrant for table participation, shifting emphasis from individual forensic assurance to corporate, covenantal belonging.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges the dominant Reformed practice of closed communion rooted in a narrowly forensic reading of justification and an individualistic criterion for table admission.
 - Contrasts with strict Westminster practice by appealing to typology and household practice in Scripture and early church examples.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "communion" in explicitly covenantal-family terms (paedocommunion framed not as an innovation but as fidelity to covenantal logic).
 - Deploys the language of covenant "inclusion" and sacramental "participation" to undercut sharp dichotomies between sign and sacrament.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential and controversial: formative for many who identify with or sympathize with the Federal Vision and paedocommunioners.
 - Provoked strong critique from conservative Reformed bodies (PCA, OPC circles) and contributed to wider debates on justification, the nature of sacraments, and ecclesial practice.
 - Sparked pastoral and confessional conversations about discipline, assurance, and catechesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concentrated theological defense of paedocommunion grounded in covenantal reading of Scripture; useful for teaching on sacramental ecclesiology and the social shape of covenant faith.
 - Provokes careful reexamination of assumptions about the relationship between baptism, faith, and the Lord's Supper.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant Communion** - Communion defined primarily as an act of the covenant household; table access tied to baptismal membership.
- **Paedocommunion** - Admission of baptized children to the Lord's Supper; central practical proposal defended.
- **Household passages** - Biblical texts (Passover, Gen. ritual meals, Acts 2, Acts 16) used to argue continuity of family inclusion.
- **Baptismal incorporation** - The claim that baptism incorporates children into covenant community with attendant sacramental rights.
- **Covenant objectivity** - Emphasis that covenant membership is not merely subjective faith but an objective social status conferred in sacraments.
- **Sacraments as seals/instruments** - Sacraments both signify and effect covenantal union; sacramental efficacy emphasized against pure memorialism.
- **Visible church / household ecclesiology** - Church conceived primarily as a family/household where sacraments are communal markers.
- **Union with Christ** - The theological ground for participation; communion as manifestation of union, not solely an expression of forensic imputation.
- **Typology of Passover** - Use of OT meal-typology to support NT household inclusion at the table.
- **Disciplinary pastoral oversight** - Proposal that pastoral care/catechesis, not exclusion, governs participation of children.
- **Federal Vision** - Movement/context with which the work is associated; shared emphases on covenant objectivity and sacramental efficacy.
- **Justification by faith (debated relation)** - Work engages controversies over whether covenantal belonging alters standard forensic formulations; often cited in debates about the Federal Vision's stance on justification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for paedocommunion and covenantal Eucharistic theology.
- As a **polemic** against closed/confirmation-based communion practices in Reformed churches.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading household texts and OT/NT typology for sacramental practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Federal Vision discussions linking baptismal inclusion, sacramental efficacy, and questions about justification and visible covenant membership.
