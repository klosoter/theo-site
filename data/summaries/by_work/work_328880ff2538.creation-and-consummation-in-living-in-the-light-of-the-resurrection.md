### TITLE
Creation and Consummation - essay in Living in the Light of the Resurrection (Richard B. Gaffin Jr.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed-evangelical theological milieu; corrective to both revivalist retreatism and secularizing optimism about cultural progress. Engages renewed interest in biblical theology and inaugurated eschatology within Reformed circles.
- **Site usage:** 1 reference - Topic cited: **Vocation / Dominion and Culture Mandate**.
- **Central thesis:** The resurrection of Christ grounds a biblically coherent **creation-to-consummation** framework in which human vocation (the dominion/culture mandate) is both affirmed and reconfigured: Christians are to work for the good of creation in the present, informed by the inaugurated but not yet consummated reality of the new creation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical base: the resurrection as the decisive eschatological event (Christ as "firstfruits") that inaugurates the new creation.
 - Theological exegesis: demonstrates continuity between created order and new creation while recognizing ontological discontinuity brought by redemption.
 - Ethical implication: vocation and dominion are not autonomous projects; they are to be exercised under Christ's lordship and in light of final consummation.
 - Practical applications: cultural engagement is legitimate and mandated, yet must be eschatologically shaped (avoid both triumphalist dominionism and world-denying pietism).
- **Figures and interlocutors:** Dialogues with proponents of inaugurated eschatology (e.g., mainstream evangelical scholars), critiques of dispensational separation of present cultural engagement, and corrective to pietistic withdrawal; operates within covenantal/Reformed conversation partners.
- **Doctrines treated:** Resurrection, eschatology (already/not-yet), creation, new creation, covenant, Christology (lordship and eschatological center), anthropology (vocation), providence, redemption of creation.
- **Closing line:** The resurrection secures a creation-consummation continuity that grounds a Christ-centered vocation: Christians cultivate and steward creation now, as a witness to and foretaste of the consummated new creation under Christ's lordship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Resurrection as hermeneutical key:** Gaffin places the resurrection at the center of biblical theology, using it to read the relation between creation and consummation rather than treating eschatology as an add-on.
- **Balanced continuity/discontinuity:** Argues for a calibrated continuity-creation remains good and purposive even as redemption brings a qualitative newness; avoids both uncritical cultural optimism and categorical dualism.
- **Vocation reoriented by eschatology:** Cultural mandate is affirmed but reframed: human dominion is legitimate stewardship under Christ's inaugurated kingship, not autonomous cultural mastery.
- **Correction to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Counters pietistic withdrawal that treats culture as corrupt and therefore to be abandoned.
 - Counters triumphalist culturalism that treats present cultural transformation as identical with final consummation.
- **Conceptual/terminological emphasis:** Reliance on the language of "firstfruits," "new creation," and "already/not‑yet" as organizing theological moves rather than novel coinages.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise theological justification for faithful cultural engagement; frequently cited in discussions of public theology, Christian vocation, and the doctrine of the resurrection.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a durable exegetical-theological framework for ethics and vocation that resists both secular accommodation and pietistic retreat; valuable for pastors, theologians, and students grappling with the cultural mandate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (Christ as Firstfruits):** The decisive eschatological event inaugurating the new creation; guarantees future consummation.
- **Creation-consummation continuity:** The thesis that God's created order persists in purpose into the new creation, though transformed by redemption.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / Already-Not‑Yet:** The structural rubric describing present participation in the new creation that awaits final fulfillment.
- **New Creation:** The eschatological reality begun in Christ's resurrection which orders Christian hope and practice.
- **Vocation (calling):** Christian participation in worldly tasks as divinely appointed stewardship, reinterpreted in light of resurrection hope.
- **Dominion / Culture Mandate:** Human responsibility to cultivate creation; affirmed as legitimate but always derivative from and accountable to Christ's lordship.
- **Lordship of Christ:** Christ's reigning, eschatological sovereignty that governs vocation and cultural action.
- **Redemption of Creation:** The restoration-transformative aim of God that includes material creation, not only individual souls.
- **Covenant framework:** Constitutive theological lens that secures continuity and promises while framing ethical responsibilities.
- **Ethical consequence:** Social, cultural, and vocational engagement must be eschatologically and Christologically formed.
- **Continuity vs. Discontinuity:** Balance between maintaining created goods and recognizing radical newness introduced by redemption.
- **Stewardship:** Practical mode of exercising dominion under covenantal responsibility.
- **Anti-dualism:** Rejection of neat sacred/secular split; all created work has theological significance.
- **Telos (eschatological end):** The consummation that orients present activity and judgment.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Reformed doctrine of vocation and cultural mandate grounded in resurrection theology.
 - As a **polemic** against both retreatist pietism and secular triumphalism regarding culture.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Pauline and Johannine resurrection motifs to practical ethics and public theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed public theology to argue for faithful, hope‑shaped cultural engagement.
