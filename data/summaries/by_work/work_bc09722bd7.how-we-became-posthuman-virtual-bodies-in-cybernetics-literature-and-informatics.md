### TITLE
How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics - N. Katherine Hayles (1999)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1999 amid late-20th-century debates in cybernetics, cognitive science, information theory, and emergent digital culture. Interdisciplinary work rooted in literary studies, media theory, and science studies; engages late Cold War and post-Cold War scientific imaginaries.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Modern scientific and cultural narratives configured the human as an *informational pattern* separated from its material instantiation; this "posthuman" construction privileges disembodied information and produces virtualized bodies, raising questions about personhood, agency, and materiality.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical genealogy of cybernetics and information theory: Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon, John von Neumann, Turing, and key cybernetic networks.
 - Literary and cultural readings showing how narratives instantiate and propagate models of disembodied information.
 - Theorization of "virtual bodies": bodies distributed across prostheses, networks, and media rather than confined to a single organic substrate.
 - Critique: informationalism (the view that information is ontologically primary) obscures embodied, material, and embodied-embedded aspects of cognition and moral agency.
 - Proposal: re-ground posthuman studies in a view that acknowledges both information patterns and their necessary material, embodied instantiation (an *embodiment thesis*).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon, John von Neumann, Alan Turing; cyberneticists (Bateson, Wiener), literary authors and filmic texts; contemporary theorists such as Donna Haraway and AI/transhumanist proponents. Draws on cognitive science, systems theory, and literary criticism.
- **Doctrines treated (theological relevance):** implicit engagement with doctrines and topics rather than explicit theological argument - anthropology (what it is to be human), incarnation and embodiment (theological counterpart to Hayles's embodiment thesis), personhood, agency, sacramental presence (questions about materiality vs representation), eschatology and teleology where technology reshapes notions of destiny.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Hayles destabilizes any theology that treats persons as mere information by insisting that embodiment - the material, distributed, and situated enactment of agency - must remain central to accounts of human nature and dignity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats the rise of the posthuman as a cultural-technological-historical formation, not a simple technical inevitability.
 - Insists on *embodiment as a corrective* to informationalism: information without a substrate is a conceptual abstraction, not a person.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on classic computationalist views and on strong-AI/transhumanist claims that equate mind with software independent of substrate.
 - Nuances Haraway's cyborg by emphasizing that the cyborg/posthuman is not a pure escape from materiality but a reconfiguration of embodiment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Virtual body" (bodies enacted through networks, prostheses, simulations)
 - Articulation of "informational pattern" vs. "material instantiation" as analytically distinct levels
 - Emphasis on *nonconscious cognition* and distributed agency
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited across humanities, STS, digital humanities, and ethics; receives secondary engagement in theology for its implications for christology, sacramentality, and theological anthropology.
 - Used by theologians to critique tech-utopian readings of immortality, disembodied personhood, or purely informational souls.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a rigorous historicized account of the conceptual shift toward informationalism.
 - Serves as a pivotal corrective for disciplines tempted by reductionist readings of mind and personhood.
 - Provokes sustained dialogue between theology and digital culture studies around embodiment, dignity, and technology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Posthuman:** the cultural/technological construction that reconceives humans principally as informational patterns rather than primarily embodied organisms.
- **Cybernetics:** interdisciplinary field studying control, communication, and feedback in machines and organisms; Hayles traces its narratives and metaphors.
- **Informational pattern:** the abstraction that can be separated conceptually from its material substrate; central to Hayles's critique.
 - Theological relevance: challenges views equating soul or identity with transferable information.
- **Virtual body:** bodies constituted through prostheses, networks, simulations, and practices rather than as bounded organic entities.
- **Embodiment thesis:** Hayles's corrective insisting that cognition and agency always require material instantiation and situated enactment.
- **Disembodiment / informationalism:** twin tendencies to privilege information and neglect materiality; target of Hayles's critique.
- **Nonconscious cognition:** cognitive processes not reducible to conscious reasoning, often distributed across systems and artifacts.
- **Feedback loop:** cybernetic mechanism of regulation and adaptation that Hayles shows underpins models of agency in networked systems.
- **Prosthesis / extension:** technologies that extend capacities and reconfigure bodily identity; used to argue for distributed embodiment.
- **Agency distributed:** agency is not always centered in a single organism but may be distributed across systems and artifacts.
- **Simulation vs. instantiation:** distinction between representational model and material enactment; Hayles emphasizes the necessity of instantiation.
- **Pattern/instantiation relation:** analytical pairing to track how informational descriptions depend on material carriers.
- **Materiality of information:** claim that information always has a material dimension - contra purely abstract informationalism.
- **Human/inhuman boundary:** Hayles problematizes rigid boundaries, showing porous transitions shaped by technology and narrative.

How this work is used across theological loci:
- Definition source for debates on "posthuman" in theological anthropology and ethics.
- Polemical resource against theological or philosophical positions that reduce persons to disembodied information.
- Conceptual pivot for rethinking incarnation, sacramental presence, and ecclesial embodiment in an age of networks and prostheses.
