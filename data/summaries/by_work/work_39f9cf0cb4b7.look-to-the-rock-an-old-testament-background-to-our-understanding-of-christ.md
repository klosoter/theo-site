### TITLE
Look to the Rock: An Old Testament Background to Our Understanding of Christ - Alec Motyer

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1987 amid late-20th-century evangelical renewal of biblical theology and typological reading of Scripture.
 - Motyer, an evangelical Anglican and seasoned Old Testament scholar, writes from a confessional, Reformed-oriented evangelical milieu reacting both to skeptical historical-critical trends and to loose allegorical readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament, properly read, is a sustained witness to Christ; motifs and institutions of the OT (especially the "rock" motif) are best understood as typological and forward-pointing to the person and work of Jesus.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with a thematic (motif) study centered on the image of the "rock" in the OT as a symbol of divine deliverance, provision, and presence.
 - Moves from motif to wider OT material: law, sacrificial system, priesthood, kingship, prophecy, psalms - showing continuity and fulfilment in Christ.
 - Combines careful exegesis of key texts with theological synthesis: historical-grammatical exegesis yields typological connections that are canonical and Christocentric.
 - Final move: Christ is the eschatological culmination of OT hopes - the true Rock, Temple, Sacrifice, King and Prophet.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the broad typological tradition (church fathers and Reformation readings implicitly present).
 - Critiques strands of liberal critical scholarship that deny integral Christological reading; interacts with contemporary evangelical OT scholarship.
 - Uses canonical texts (Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Samuel, prophetic corpus) as primary sources rather than secondary theological systems.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (OT background for New Testament understanding)
 - **Typology and typological method**
 - **Covenant and mediation** (Christ as Mediator)
 - **Atonement, sacrifice, and priesthood**
 - **Kingship and kingdom theology**
 - **Revelation and canonical reading of Scripture**
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Old Testament, read in its canonical and typological coherence, points unambiguously to Christ as the consummation of Israel's hopes - the true Rock who secures covenant, worship, kingship, and salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Uses a single recurring motif (the Rock) as a unifying lens to unlock multiple OT structures - cultic, kingly, prophetic - and their Christological significance.
 - Insists on disciplined typology: typological reading grounded in historical exegesis, not allegory or speculative typologizing.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters both reductionist historical-critical approaches that strip out christological meaning and pietistic allegorists who read the OT as floating symbols unaffixed to their historical contexts.
 - Contrasts with mechanistic "proof-text" christologizing by offering theological-historical connections that respect genre and context.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Treats motifs as theological "thematic keys" for canonical Christology - a method attractive for preaching and theological synthesis.
 - Articulates a clear hermeneutic: historical-grammatical exegesis + canonical-typological synthesis = Christological reading.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in evangelical and Reformed circles; widely used in seminary teaching and preaching as a compact model for OT christological reading.
 - Influenced later evangelical canonical and typological studies; often cited in homiletical resources and Christocentric OT curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical tool: accessible model for pastors and students to read the OT Christocentrically without abandoning scholarly rigor.
 - Serves as a corrective to both skeptical and overly speculative hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rock (motif)** - central image showing God as deliverer, sustainer, and covenant foundation; typologically fulfilled in Christ.
- **Typology** - interpretive method where persons/events/institutions in the OT are "types" whose true meaning is realized in Christ; Motyer insists on historical anchoring.
- **Canonical reading** - reading texts within the whole OT canon and in relation to the New Testament, not in isolation.
- **Christological fulfillment** - the claim that OT promises, symbols, and institutions reach their goal in Jesus.
- **Covenant mediation** - OT structures (priests, prophets, kings) prefigure Christ as the unique Mediator.
- **Priesthood & sacrifice** - cultic system as a pointer to the ultimate atoning work of Christ, not merely ritual remnants.
- **Kingship / Messiah** - royal motifs (Davidic covenant, temple rule) reinterpreted as anticipations of Christ's reign.
- **Prophecy and promise** - prophetic word functions as forward-looking testimony culminating in Christ.
- **Typological motif method** - using recurring images (e.g., rock, water, temple) as keys for theological synthesis.
- **Historical-grammatical exegesis** - method affirmed as the foundation for legitimate typology.
- **Fulfillment hermeneutic** - how OT texts find their intelligible end in the person and work of Christ.
- **Worship/Temple imagery** - cultic language not obsolete; refigured in Christ as true locus of God's presence.
- **Escha­tology** - OT hopes (kingdom, restoration) are eschatologically realized in Christ.
- **Mediator / Revelation** - Christ as the decisive revelation and mediator of the covenant.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching: practical method for connecting OT text to Christ without allegory.
 - As a **definition source** for disciplined typology: clarifies limits and warrants for typological claims.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Christology and biblical theology courses: supplies canonical-theological linkage between OT institutions and NT fulfillment.
