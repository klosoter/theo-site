### TITLE
**The Christian Looks at Himself** (Anthony A. Hoekema, 1975)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published mid-1970s within Reformed pastoral-theological milieu; aimed at pastors, seminarians and laity seeking a biblically rooted Christian self-understanding amid rising pastoral psychology and existentialist currents.
 - Hoekema writes from a conservative Reformed vantage, dialoguing with modern psychology, secular anthropology, Roman Catholic thought, and intra-Reformed debates.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christians must understand human nature, sin, and salvation as a unified, biblical whole: who we are (constitution and the imago Dei), what is wrong (sin and guilt), and how God restores (regeneration, sanctification, assurance, perseverance).
 - Emphasizes pastoral implications: doctrine of the person must inform assurance, holiness, and pastoral care.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Human constitution and the image of God - biblical exegesis and theological synthesis arguing for a holistic, relational imago Dei.
 - Part II: The fall and its effects - scope of sin, nature of guilt, and the distortion of the created order.
 - Part III: Redemption and renewal - regeneration, sanctification, and the believer's progressive restoration in Christ.
 - Part IV: Assurance and perseverance - grounds for assurance, evidences of grace, and the Reformed doctrine of perseverance with pastoral counsel.
 - Major moves: exegetical foundation (Genesis and Pauline texts) → critique of dualistic and reductionist alternatives → doctrinal construction (anthropology and soteriology) → pastoral application (assurance, discipline, counseling).

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engages classical and Reformed authorities (Augustine, Calvin), contemporary Reformed theologians, critics from Roman Catholic and Arminian perspectives, and modern psychologists/philosophers who press dualism or strict behaviorist readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (psychosomatic constitution), **Imago Dei**, **Hamartiology**, **Regeneration**, **Sanctification**, **Assurance**, **Perseverance**, and pastoral implications for ecclesiology and spiritual formation.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: Christian self-knowledge is a biblically grounded, pastoral anthropology that insists on human psychosomatic unity and the concrete restoration of the imago Dei in Christ as the basis for true assurance and spiritual growth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, clear affirmation of **psychosomatic unity**: humans are a unified body-soul person; crude substance dualism is rejected in favor of an integrated anthropology with mutual interdependence of body and soul.
 - Pastoral integration: theology is consistently directed toward spiritual formation and pastoral counseling - doctrine as praxis.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters existentialist and therapeutic self-centered approaches by relocating assurance in objective promises (Christ's work) combined with subjective evidences (fruit of faith).
 - Challenges extreme dualism and materialistic reductionism; gives a middle path that respects biblical texts and contemporary insights into human personality.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes criteria for **assurance** (trust in Christ's objective work + observable perseverance/fruit), making it a practical diagnostic for pastors rather than a mere abstract doctrine.
 - Frames the **imago Dei** primarily in relational and functional terms (orientation to God, responsibility, calling), not merely intellectual capacity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Reformed seminaries and pastoral circles as a concise, accessible introduction to Christian anthropology.
 - Frequently cited in courses on pastoral theology, assurance, and the imago Dei; used as a corrective to both pietistic subjectivism and cold doctrinal abstraction.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical tool: useful for integrating doctrine with pastoral care, counseling, and spiritual formation.
 - Remains a concise entry point for discussions on human nature, assurance, and the restoration of the imago Dei.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Humans as unified body-soul persons; rejects sharp substance dualism and reductionistic materialism.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - Functional-relational account: human vocation, authority, and relationality toward God and others; damaged but not obliterated by the fall.
- **Traducianism**
 - Discussed critically: Hoekema surveys the view that the soul is derived from parents; notes pastoral and theological liabilities.
- **Creationism (of the soul)**
 - Hoekema favors *creationism* (God directly creates each soul) as the more theologically responsible option while admitting mystery and limits to systematic certainty.
- **Regeneration**
 - The Spirit's sovereign act that renews the whole person; central for true Christian identity and ethical change.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive transformation of the psychosomatic person, both forensic and experiential, grounded in union with Christ.
- **Assurance**
 - Twofold ground: objective (Christ's atoning work and promised saving grace) and subjective evidences (faith's fruit); pastoral markers provided for assessing assurance.
- **Perseverance**
 - Reformed assurance that true believers will persevere by divine preserving grace; pastoral cautions about easy presumptions.
- **Hamartiology (sin)**
 - Sin as pervasive corruption of faculties, inclinations, and social structures - not merely isolated acts.
- **Conversion**
 - Comprehensive turning: repentance and faith affecting the whole person and life.
- **Fruit/evidences of grace**
 - Practical indicators (love, holiness, growth) used pastorally to confirm assurance.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The center of soteriology; ontological and ethical implications for personal identity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed anthropology (psychosomatic unity and imago Dei).
 - As a **polemic resource** against both traducianist reductionism and dualist/materialist models.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for interpreting Genesis and Pauline anthropology in soteriological contexts.
 - As a **practical/pastoral pivot** in courses on assurance, sanctification, and pastoral counseling.
