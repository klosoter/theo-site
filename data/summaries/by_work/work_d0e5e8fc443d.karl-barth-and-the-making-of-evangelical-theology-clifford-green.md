### TITLE
Karl Barth and the Making of Evangelical Theology - Clifford Green (Oxford, 1997). 
Study of Karl Barth's reception and formative effect on twentieth-century evangelical and Reformed covenantal theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar theological realignments: neo-orthodoxy, revival of Barthianism, evangelical anxieties about modernity and confessional identity.
 - Green situates Barth not as an outsider but as a decisive shaper of evangelical theological self-understanding across Anglo‑American and continental contexts.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth reconfigured evangelical theology by reworking covenantal categories and trinitarian Christology so that covenant, election, and justification are read Christocentrically rather than primarily juridically.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical tracing: how Barth read and critiqued Reformed confessional formulations (Westminster, Heidelberg) and the classical Covenant of Works/Covenant of Grace schema.
 - Theological reconstruction: Barth relocates the covenantal center in the person and work of Christ (covenant as relational/Christological event), grounding revelation in the Word‑event rather than propositional proof.
 - Reception analysis: evangelicals variously appropriated, resisted, or modified Barthian categories; his language shaped later debates (e.g., Federal Vision, dispensational vs. progressive covenantalism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Barth as interlocutor with Reformed confessional tradition, neo‑orthodox colleagues (e.g., Emil Brunner), and twentieth‑century evangelical leaders and theologians who read him sympathetically or polemically.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word as event), Scripture, covenant (Mosaic covenant; Covenant of Works/Covenant of Grace), Trinity (perichoresis, relationality), Christology (Christ as covenant partner), election, and justification.
- **Closing line**
 - Green presents Barth as the theologian who reoriented evangelicalism from a juridical, contract‑driven covenantalism to a trinitarian‑christological covenant theology in which the Mosaic and primal covenants are read through Christ as the decisive covenantal act.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Christocentric covenant:** covenant is not primarily a juridical contract but a relational, historical act centered on the incarnate Christ.
 - **Word as event (Geschehen):** revelation understood as the encounter in the living Word, reshaping evangelical epistemology.
 - **Trinitarian grounding:** soteriology and covenantal order rooted in the perichoretic life of the triune God, resisting ontological subordination.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Modifies classical Reformed **Covenant of Works** language by denying that the primal covenant is primarily a bilateral legal bargain; instead emphasizes divine initiative and Christ as representative.
 - Counters dispensational bifurcation of biblical covenants by pressing continuity in Christ without collapsing legitimate typological distinctions (in conversation with progressive covenantalism).
 - Implicit critique of Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS): Barth's trinitarian theology resists permanent ontological hierarchies within the Godhead.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts **election** as election in and through Christ (Christological election) rather than an abstract decree prior to covenantal reality.
 - Uses covenantal language as interpretive key rather than confessional technicalism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influenced evangelicals who sought a renewed doctrinal center; provoked pushback from confessionalists and later surfaced in polemics around **Federal Vision** and justice/justification debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to read confessions historically and theologically, provides a trinitarian corrective to juridical reductions of covenant, and remains a pivot for contemporary covenantal and soteriological discussions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - Treated as covenantal instance to be read christologically and typologically, not simply as a legalistic code.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Reinterpreted: Green shows Barth resists treating it as a primary forensic contract; emphasizes divine initiative and representative vocation of Christ.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Centered on Christ as the mediating covenantal partner; continuity with prior covenants located in Christ.
- **Covenant Theology (Reformed tradition)**
 - Barth reframes classical federal categories, pressing a Christ‑first hermeneutic that reshapes Reformed covenantal teaching.
- **Confessional Formulations of Covenant**
 - Green analyzes Barth's reading and selective appropriation of confessional texts (e.g., Westminster) as historically conditioned rather than final logos.
- **Word as Event / Revelation**
 - Revelation is an encounter in the living Word (Scripture as witness), shifting evangelical epistemology from propositional sufficiency to relational proclamation.
- **Trinity / Perichoresis**
 - Barth's emphasis on intra‑Trinitarian relations undermines EFS‑style hierarchies; Trinity grounds covenantal economy.
- **Christ as Covenant Partner / Representative**
 - Central pivot: all covenants and election are fulfilled and interpreted in the person and work of Jesus.
- **Election (Christocentric)**
 - Election postured in the person of Christ rather than an abstract decree detached from covenantal history.
- **Justification by Faith**
 - Rearticulated within a covenantal, Christocentric frame - debate site for critics (e.g., Federal Vision controversies).
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) Debates**
 - Barthian trinitarianism is used to critique EFS claims and to defend ontological equality of persons with relational order.
- **Federal Vision & Justification controversies**
 - Barth's covenant reconfiguration is invoked both to critique Federal Vision forensic moves and to provide alternative covenantal models.
- **Dispensationalism vs Progressive Covenantalism**
 - Barth functions as a critical interlocutor for both, offering resources to affirm continuity in Christ while rejecting simplistic dispensational breaks.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** for rethinking covenantal loci: shifts hermeneutic from legal-contract to Christ‑centered covenant. 
- As **polemic and resource**: deployed by critics and proponents in debates over justification, Federal Vision, and EFS. 
- As an **exegetical model**: reading Mosaic and other biblical covenants typologically through Christ and the Word‑event.
