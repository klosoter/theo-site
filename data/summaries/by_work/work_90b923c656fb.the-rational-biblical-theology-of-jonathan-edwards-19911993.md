### TITLE
**The Rational Biblical Theology of Jonathan Edwards (1991-1993)** - John Gerstner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical/Reformed scholarship, rising interest in recovering Puritan and early-American theology for systematic and pastoral use.
 - Gerstner writes as a confessional Reformed apologist reacting to both liberal historiography (which downplays doctrinal coherence) and pietistic caricatures (which separate intellect and affections).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Edwards is best understood as a *rational biblical theologian*: his theology is thoroughly scriptural yet systematically ordered by rational categories; affections and intellect are integrated, not opposed.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close readings of Edwards's major essays and sermons to show methodological consistency: biblical exegesis → philosophical argumentation → pastoral application.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish Edwards's epistemic posture: Scripture as norm interpreted by a disciplined reason informed by metaphysics.
 - Demonstrate Edwards's moral psychology: disordered loves, compatibilist will, and the necessity of divine grace.
 - Trace doctrinal loci from sin and salvation through sanctification, providence, and eschatology, showing internal coherence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Jonathan Edwards (sermons, treatises, notes).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Calvinist scholasticism, Puritan predecessors, Enlightenment critics, contemporary Edwards interpreters.
 - Opponents addressed: reductionist Enlightenment readings, sentimental pietism, modern revisionists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture as rule; God (sovereignty, simplicity); Trinity and Christology in typical Edwardsian metaphysical mode; sin (original sin, total depravity); soteriology (election, atonement, regeneration, sanctification); providence; affections and religious experience; eschatology (final judgment and eternal states).
 - Explicit treatments include **Total Depravity and Total Inability** and **Final Judgment and Eternal States** as distinct loci, with Edwards both exegetically grounded and philosophically argued.
- **Closing line**
 - Gerstner locates Edwards at the intersection of rigorous biblical exegesis and systematic metaphysical clarity: a Reformed theologian who deploys reason to defend and order the truths of Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses Edwards's coherence: theology as rational ordering of biblical truth, not mere devotional reflection.
 - Highlights Edwards's moral-affective psychology as central to theological anthropology and soteriology.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that portray Edwards as an irrational mystic or as an Enlightenment rationalist; presents a mediating portrait that integrates both.
 - Contrasts Edwardsian compatibilism with libertarian free-will readings and with Arminian accounts of ability.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes Edwards's use of "rational" not as cold abstraction but as disciplined reasoning about God that includes affections as evidences and operands of truth.
 - Emphasizes "degrees" language in sanctification and eternal recompense as systematic rather than merely homiletical.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed circles to reaffirm Edwards's reliability as a systematic source; influential in seminary curricula and revival historiography.
 - Critiqued by some scholars for potentially imposing later scholastic categories on Edwards or understating historical nuance.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, polemically aware recovery of Edwards for pastoral and academic theology; valuable for teaching doctrinal coherence, moral psychology, and Reformed eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rational Biblical Theology** - Theology grounded in Scripture and ordered by disciplined reasoning; not opposed to affections.
- **Affections** - Central locus for Edwards: emotional/volitional orientations that reveal true religion and ground moral change.
- **Divine Sovereignty** - Primary axiom shaping Gerstner's reading: providence, election, and government are decisive.
- **Compatibilism** - Edwardsian account of human freedom: will acts according to strongest motive; incapacity for saving good stems from disordered loves.
- **Total Depravity** - All faculties affected by sin; moral inability to choose God without grace.
 - Use: Gerstner appeals to Edwards to rebut any softening of original sin; see locus treatment "Total Depravity and Total Inability."
- **Total Inability** - Closely tied to depravity; inability is empirical (motive-based), not merely forensic.
- **Imputation** - Forensic transfer (Adam's guilt, Christ's righteousness); Gerstner affirms Edwards's traditional formulations.
- **Regeneration** - Immediate, sovereign act of God reorienting affections; enlivens reason and will.
- **Sanctification (degrees)** - Progressive and measurable; Edwards's "degrees of glory" language informs both ethics and eschatology.
- **Providence** - God's meticulous governance; metaphysical grounding for historical events and revival phenomena.
- **Final Judgment** - Definitive public vindication and condemnation administered by Christ; Gerstner notes Edwards's insistence on justice and retribution.
 - Use: Gerstner treats this under "Final Judgment and Eternal States," emphasizing literal eternal consequences.
- **Eternal States** - Heaven/hell as real, qualitatively distinct states with degrees of blessedness or suffering.
- **Typological Hermeneutics** - Edwards's reading of Scripture frequently uses typology to connect biblical history with redemptive realities.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Edwardsian articulations of depravity, inability, and compatible freedom.
- As a **polemic** against revisionist portrayals of Edwards (both liberal and pietistic).
- As an **exegetical-model** for integrating sermon/text exegesis with systematic theology, especially in anthropology and eschatology.
