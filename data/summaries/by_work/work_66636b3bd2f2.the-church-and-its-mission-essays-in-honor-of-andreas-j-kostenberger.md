### TITLE
The Church and Its Mission: Essays in Honor of Andreas J. Köstenberger (ed. D. A. Carson)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** A contemporary evangelical Festschrift produced within late 20th/early 21st-century conservative Protestant scholarship. Situated in the postconservative-evangelical milieu that seeks to marry rigorous New Testament exegesis with practical missiology and church-life concerns. Intended to honor Andreas J. Köstenberger, a prominent evangelical New Testament scholar and missions advocate.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The church's mission must be rooted in faithful biblical exegesis and embodied in the life of the local church: mission is the activity of the triune God (missio Dei) realized in and through the church's proclamation, discipleship, and witness.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: **Biblical exegesis** - close readings of key New Testament mission texts (Great Commission, Acts, Pauline mission practice), arguing for continuity between Jesus' mission and the church's task.
 - Part II: **Theological framing** - treatments of missio Dei, Trinity, Christology, and soteriology that ground the church's mission in God's redemptive purposes.
 - Part III: **Historical-practical reflection** - surveys of church history, missions movements, and contemporary mission praxis (church planting, contextualization, evangelism strategy).
 - Part IV: **Pastoral and ecclesial application** - implications for local church life, leadership, and cross-cultural engagement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Evangelical New Testament scholars and mission practitioners; engages with debates involving missio Dei proponents (e.g., Lesslie Newbigin), critics of reductionist social-gospel approaches, and voices advocating radical contextualization. Implicit contrasts with liberal theology, pragmatic parachurch models, and certain strands of postmodern mission theory.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (central), missiology, revelation and biblical authority, Christology, soteriology, Trinity (as missional grounding), hermeneutics, and pastoral theology.
- **Closing line:** The volume insists that a robust, faithful mission theology issues from Scripture via sound exegesis and must be embodied in local churches committed to proclamation, discipleship, and cross-cultural witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that mission theology be exegesis-driven rather than program-driven.
 - Prioritizes the **local church** as the primary locus of mission, not parachurch agencies or programmatic innovation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects social-gospel reductionism by affirming social concern only within the framework of gospel proclamation and discipleship.
 - Pushes back against pragmatism and managerial models of missions that detach strategy from biblical doctrine.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Synthesizes biblical-theological categories (kingdom, covenant, witness) with operational mission language (church planting, contextualization), creating usable bridges for pastors and missionaries.
 - Recasts missio Dei in ways that stress agency of the church (as called participant) rather than abstracting God's mission from ecclesial responsibility.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely respected in conservative evangelical and Reformed circles as a Festschrift that models scholarship-serving-practice.
 - Used as a resource in seminary courses on missions and ecclesiology; influences evangelical conversation on church planting and NT-based mission strategy.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models integration of rigorous NT exegesis with concrete missional praxis.
 - Serves as an accessible corrective to both liberal and overly pragmatic mission narratives, offering a theologically robust paradigm for churches.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missio Dei:** God's mission; the theological anchor that grounds church mission in Trinitarian activity.
- **Great Commission:** The primary New Testament mandate for the church's missionary vocation (Matt 28:18-20; parallels).
- **Local church:** Emphasized as principal agent of mission (gathered community, discipleship center, sending base).
- **Biblical theology:** Methodological priority - tracing redemptive-historical motifs that inform mission practice.
- **Contextualization:** Engagement with culture that must be biblically constrained and gospel-centered.
 - Contrast: careful against syncretistic or relativizing contextualization.
- **Church planting:** Practical expression of mission; argued as normative strategy in expansion and discipleship.
- **Evangelism (Gospel proclamation):** Central and indispensable to mission; not reducible to social action.
- **Discipleship:** Ongoing formation in obedience to Christ; the means by which converts become ecclesial participants.
- **Hermeneutics:** Exegetical responsibility emphasized - theology of mission derives from sound interpretation of Scripture.
- **Incarnational mission:** Presence and witness modeled on Christ's incarnation - balance of proclamation and presence.
- **Witness:** Both verbal testimony and communal life; witness rooted in Trinity and Christ's atoning work.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Non-negotiable foundation for doctrine and mission strategy.
- **Mission praxis:** Integration of doctrine and practice - training, leadership, and organizational implications.
- **Kingdom of God:** Missional horizon; frames mission as participation in God's renewing rule.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical/NT-grounded mission theology emphasizing local church centrality.
 - As a **polemic** against secularized, pragmatic, or reductionist mission models.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how careful New Testament interpretation shapes missional practice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Reformed-evangelical doctrinal commitments with contemporary church-planting and discipleship strategies.
