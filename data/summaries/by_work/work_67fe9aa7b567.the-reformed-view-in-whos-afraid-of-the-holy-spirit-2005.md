### TITLE
"The Reformed View" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in Who's Afraid of the Holy Spirit? (2005)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical response to charismatic renewal and debates over continuations of charismatic gifts.
 - Ferguson writes from a conservative Reformed pastoral-theological milieu, aiming to defend a balanced, biblically rooted pneumatology for churches wary of both excess and neglect.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit must be confessed as a divine, personal Agent whose work is continuous and central to salvation, Christ's ministry, and the life of the church; at the same time, Christian reflection must be shaped by Scripture, covenant theology, and pastoral sobriety rather than sensationalism or anti-pneumatic denial.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of the **Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit** as orthodox Trinitarian doctrine (personhood, will, intellect, affections; fully divine).
 - Exposition of the Spirit's role in the life and work of Christ:
 - Spirit as active in Christ's earthly ministry (anointing, empowerment for ministry).
 - Spirit as participant in the resurrection and exaltation of Christ (Scriptural witness that the Spirit is involved in the raising of Jesus and in declaring him Lord).
 - Application to contemporary questions:
 - Relation of Spirit to Word and sacraments - Spirit works primarily through God's appointed means.
 - Careful assessment of spiritual gifts and charismatic claims - neither automatic credence nor dismissive cessationism.
 - Pastoral implications: assurance, sanctification, and worship ordered by Spirit-led, Word-centered fidelity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformation and Puritan authorities (e.g., Calvin, Owen) invoked for Scripture-centered pneumatology.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include charismatic renewal leaders and cessationist critics; Ferguson also dialogues implicitly with modern theologians who marginalize the Spirit.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (Personhood and deity of the Spirit)
 - Christology (Spirit's relation to Christ's ministry and resurrection)
 - Pneumatology (regeneration, sanctification, gifts)
 - Soteriology and ecclesiology (assurance, church life, means of grace)

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson's theological center of gravity: the Reformed tradition can and must confess a robust, scripturally governed pneumatology that honors the Spirit's person and power without abandoning the primacy of Word, covenant, and sober pastoral order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the Spirit's activity being normally mediated through Word and sacrament - a covenantal, non-spectacular pneumatology.
 - Balancing role: affirming continuities of Spirit activity (including gifts) while warning against unregulated experientialism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects charismatic tendencies toward private verification of experience by insisting on Scripture and ecclesial discernment.
 - Contrasts with strict cessationism by refusing to make theological denial of Spirit's ongoing charismatic action the default position.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on a "Word-Spirit" hermeneutic: the Spirit authenticates and applies the Word rather than overriding it.
 - Framing Spirit's operations within the covenant economy rather than primarily in revivalist categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received among conservative Reformed seminarians, pastors, and laity as a clarifying middle path.
 - Influential as a pastoral corrective in Reformed churches engaging charismatic movements.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, teachable articulation of Reformed pneumatology that is both orthodox and practically applicable for ministry and worship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Personhood of the Spirit**
 - Affirms attributes (will, knowing, personal agency) distinguishing Spirit from an impersonal force.

- **Deity of the Spirit**
 - Equates Spirit's divine status with Father and Son; scriptural and creedal support emphasized.

- **Word-Spirit hermeneutic**
 - The Spirit's work is normally exercised through Scripture's proclamation and understanding.

- **Spirit and sacraments**
 - Spirit-enabled efficacy of baptism and Lord's Supper; means of grace are Spirit-ordained.

- **Regeneration**
 - Spirit as the agent who sovereignly quickens unbelieving hearts to new life.

- **Sanctification and assurance**
 - Ongoing Spirit-work producing holiness and inner testimony that grounds Christian assurance.

- **Spiritual gifts / charismatic gifts**
 - Recognizes gifts as genuine possibilities; urges ecclesial order, testing, and submission to Scripture.

- **Spirit in Christ's ministry**
 - The Spirit anointed and empowered Jesus for proclamation and ministry (e.g., the baptismal anointing).

- **Spirit in Christ's resurrection**
 - Affirms scriptural witness that the Spirit participates in the resurrection/exaltation of Christ (used to connect Christ's victory to Spirit's redemptive work and to underline the continuity between Christ's resurrection and believer's new life).

- **Covenantal framing**
 - Places pneumatology within covenant promises and fulfillment in Christ.

- **Continuation vs. cessation**
 - Ferguson neither dogmatically cessationist nor uncritically charismatic; promotes tested continuity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source** - concise Reformed statement of Person and deity of the Spirit for doctrinal summaries and creedal teaching.
 - **Exegetical model** - used to anchor exegesis linking the Spirit to Christ's ministry and resurrection (shows how to read texts like Luke, Romans, and Pauline passages in covenantal context).
 - **Polemic / corrective** - practical guide for pastors negotiating charismatic claims and for correcting both excess and neglect in congregational practice.
