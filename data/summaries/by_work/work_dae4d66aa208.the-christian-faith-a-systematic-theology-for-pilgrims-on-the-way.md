### TITLE
**The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way** (2011) - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed confessional retrieval amid evangelical fragmentation (postmodern hermeneutics, open theism, NPP/Federal Vision debates, charismatic renewal, culture-war activism).
 - Written from Westminster Seminary California, in conversation with Reformed orthodoxy and broader ecumenical dogmatics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God's triune speech creates and covenants a pilgrim people; the gospel is an accomplished, external announcement that the Spirit applies through Word and sacrament, uniting believers to Christ within the already/not yet kingdom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prolegomena: revelation as triune speech; Scripture as covenantal canon; theology as receptive, ecclesial science.
 - Doctrine of God: classical theism (simplicity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity, Creator/creature distinction; analogical knowledge.
 - Creation, providence, and humanity: image, vocation, law, Sabbath; Adam under a covenant of works.
 - Covenant economy: pactum salutis; works/grace covenants; Mosaic typology and law-gospel distinction within redemptive history.
 - Christology: Chalcedon, anhypostasis/enhypostasis, extra Calvinisticum, threefold office; atonement with penal substitution integrated with victor/moral dimensions.
 - Soteriology: union with Christ (double grace), effectual calling, justification by imputed righteousness (including active obedience), adoption, sanctification, perseverance.
 - Pneumatology: Spirit's mission to unite to Christ through the ordinary means; eschatological down payment and gifts ordered to the church's edification.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: visible/invisible distinction; marks (Word, sacrament, discipline); covenant children; baptism and the Supper as means of grace; offices and keys of the kingdom.
 - Eschatology: inaugurated kingdom, pilgrimage, two-age schema, resurrection hope, judgment, new creation; two-kingdoms ethics and vocation.
- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages Calvin, the Reformed scholastics (Ursinus, Turretin), Bavinck, Vos; Luther and the law-gospel/theology-of-the-cross stream.
 - Interacts critically with Schleiermacher, Barth, Torrance, Rahner, Pannenberg, Milbank; evangelical biblicism and pietism; N. T. Wright and the NPP; open theism and theistic personalism; sacramental theologies (Rome/Orthodoxy).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; Trinity; creation/providence/anthropology; covenants; Christology; atonement; Spirit and ordo salutis; church and sacraments; last things; Christian life and vocation.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Gospel precedence: God's covenantal promise in Christ, ministered by the Spirit through Word and sacrament, creates and sustains a pilgrim church on its way to the consummation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Architectonic use of covenant (creation-to-consummation); strong law-gospel distinction; gospel as indicative that grounds the imperative.
 - Union with Christ as the integrative soteriological category; double grace (justification and sanctification) without confusion.
 - High, classical doctrine of God within a confessional Reformed frame; retrieval of impassibility and simplicity.
 - Church- and means-of-grace-centered piety; ordinary ministry over revivalist techniques; sacramental realism in a Reformed key.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against pietistic subjectivism and pragmatism: prioritizes preaching and sacraments over experience/technique.
 - Against transformationalist triumphalism: articulates two-kingdoms, pilgrim eschatology; vocation within common grace rather than culture-redemption mandate for the church as church.
 - Against NPP/Federal Vision: reasserts imputation, covenant of works, and distinction of law/gospel; critiques covenantal monocovenantalism.
 - Against open theism/theistic mutualism: defends classical attributes and exhaustive divine foreknowledge.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Scripture as covenantal canon using speech-act theory (locution/illocution/perlocution) to link inspiration and effectual ministry.
 - Reframing ordo salutis within historia salutis via union with Christ, avoiding mere sequencing.
 - Indicative-imperative and gift-then-gratitude as pedagogical pattern across loci.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted as a contemporary Reformed dogmatics alongside Bavinck; used in seminary curricula.
 - Debated in discussions on two kingdoms, Mosaic republication, and sacramental practice; appreciated across confessional Reformed circles for balance of historical depth and contemporary engagement.
- **Enduring value**
 - A coherent covenantal synthesis that is exegetically sensitive, historically rooted, ecclesially oriented, and pastorally usable for preaching, catechesis, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace**
 - Adam under law for eschatological life; post-fall salvation in Christ by promise. Sinai as typological republication in the earthly layer.
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption)**
 - Intratrinitarian grounding of redemption and assurance.
- **Law-Gospel Distinction**
 - Law commands and condemns; gospel announces what God has done. Organizes preaching and assurance.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Forensic and renovative benefits flow from a single union; anchors ordo within historia.
- **Double Grace**
 - Justification by imputation and sanctification by participation, inseparable yet distinct.
- **Active Obedience of Christ**
 - Righteousness fulfilled for us, imputed in justification.
- **Means of Grace**
 - Word, baptism, Supper as Spirit's ordinary instruments of Christ's presence and gift.
- **Speech-Act Bibliology**
 - Inspiration/illumination framed as divine speaking that not only signifies but effects.
- **Classical Theism**
 - Simplicity, immutability, impassibility, aseity; analogical predication and Creator/creature distinction.
- **Two Kingdoms**
 - Christ's one lordship administered in two regimes (common/redemptive); churchly ministry distinguished from civil/cultural callings.
- **Extra Calvinisticum**
 - The Logos remains omnipresent beyond the flesh; safeguards Chalcedonian Christology and sacramental realism without ubiquity.
- **Theology of the Cross**
 - Divine self-revelation in weakness; opposes a theology of glory; shapes pastoral method.
- **Indicative then Imperative**
 - Ethical exhortation grounded in accomplished redemption; gift precedes gratitude.
- **Visible/Invisible Church and Marks**
 - Word, sacrament, discipline define the church's identity and mission.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed covenant theology, union with Christ, and justification.
 - As a polemical benchmark against NPP, Federal Vision, open theism, and revivalist pragmatism.
 - As an exegetical-theological model for law-gospel preaching and sacramental practice.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking bibliology (speech-act), ecclesiology (means), and soteriology (union).
