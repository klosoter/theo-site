### TITLE
**The Gospel According to Jesus (1988) - John F. MacArthur**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1980s evangelical milieu: reaction to growing "easy-believeism," seeker-sensitive ministries, and pragmatic evangelistic methods.
 - MacArthur writing from conservative, Bible-teaching pastoral and seminary context (The Master's College / Seminary; Calvary Chapel era debates nearby).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The authentic gospel necessarily entails repentance and submission to Christ's lordship; faith that does not produce obedient discipleship is not saving faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegetical readings of Gospel and Pauline texts to show Jesus' demands (e.g., Matthew 7:21-23, Luke 9:23-26, John 3, James).
 - Distinguishes between intellectual assent/temporary decision and genuine conversion that results in transformed life.
 - Argues that assurance must rest on evidentiary fruit of faith (obedience, perseverance), not mere profession or emotional experience.
 - Clarifies relation between faith and works: works are not the grounds of justification but are inseparable evidence of a living, justifying faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Explicit polemics against contemporary evangelistic practice and "easy-belief" portrayals of the gospel.
 - Engages Free Grace advocates (subsequent controversies placed him in debate with Zane Hodges, Charles Ryrie, et al.) and broader evangelical popularizers.
 - Scripture-centered method with frequent appeal to Gospel narratives and apostolic teaching; conservative Protestant theological framework.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (conversion, justification, regeneration, sanctification)
 - Repentance and faith
 - Assurance of salvation
 - Discipleship and the nature of true conversion
 - Pastoral theology and evangelistic practice
- **Closing line**
 - The work's center of gravity: genuine saving faith is inseparable from Christ's lordship - conversion demands repentance and produces obedient discipleship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Popularized the label and programmatic thrust of "Lordship salvation" for late 20th-century evangelical discourse.
 - Insists on a behavioral and moral criterion as necessary evidence for distinguishing true faith from nominal profession.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges "decisionism" and evangelistic formulas that separate belief from lifelong submission.
 - Pushback to Free Grace positions that detach assurance and eternal life from post-conversion evidence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reasserts classical covenantal and Reformation emphases on faith's fruit while carefully attempting to avoid a works-righteousness charge; reframes "faith" as inherently operative and dispositional rather than merely propositional.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential and widely read; generated vigorous controversy (the Lordship controversy).
 - Adopted by many conservative pastors and teachers as corrective to shallow evangelism; criticized by Free Grace defenders and some evangelicals who saw a threat to sola fide.
 - Sparked numerous responses, symposia, and follow-up defenses and critiques within evangelicalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for pastors and teachers as a pastoral-exegetical challenge to superficial conversion theology.
 - Enduring as a polemical and pedagogical resource that forces clearer definitions of "faith," "repentance," and "assurance."

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lordship salvation**
 - Faith in Christ that acknowledges and submits to Christ as Lord; MacArthur's focal term and rallying concept.
- **Easy-believism**
 - Pejorative for evangelistic presentations that equate mere verbal assent or momentary decision with salvation.
- **Saving faith**
 - A trust that results in repentance and obedience; not merely intellectual agreement.
- **Repentance**
 - Essential component of conversion; a genuine turning from sin accompanying saving faith.
- **Justification**
 - For MacArthur, forensic acquittal by faith alone but necessarily evidenced by sanctification and good works.
- **Sanctification**
 - The progressive outworking of salvation; the primary arena where evidence of genuine faith appears.
- **Assurance**
 - Properly grounded in the fruit of faith (perseverance, obedience), not on transient experiences or mere professions.
- **False convert / Nominal profession**
 - A professed believer lacking the transformative evidence of true regeneration.
- **Fruit as evidence**
 - Behavioral and moral change used as indicators, not causes, of saving faith.
- **Discipleship**
 - Lifelong submission and training under Christ's lordship; central to MacArthur's gospel presentation.
- **Perseverance**
 - Endurance in faith and growth in holiness as normative evidence for genuine salvation.
- **Regeneration**
 - God's sovereign work that produces new life; MacArthur stresses its inseparability from changed behavior.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy (anthropology)**
 - MacArthur's overall theological tendency aligns with a **dichotomous** view (material body + immaterial soul/spirit viewed functionally unified), generally skeptical of strict trichotomy as exegetically forced; he prioritizes soteriological and moral indicators over speculative tripartite anthropology.
- **Good works**
 - Necessary fruit and evidence, though not the meritorious ground of salvation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a definitional source in contemporary soteriology debates: clarifies contested vocabulary (faith, repentance, lordship).
 - As polemic: primary evangelical counterpoint to Free Grace/easy-belief positions and to pragmatic evangelism.
 - As an exegetical/pastoral model: used in sermons, evangelism training, and discipleship curricula to insist on holiness and lifelong submission as the shape of true conversion.
