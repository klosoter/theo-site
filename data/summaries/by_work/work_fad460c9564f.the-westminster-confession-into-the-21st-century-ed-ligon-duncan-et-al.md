### TITLE
The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century (ed. Ligon Duncan, et al.) - notes on **Self-Attestation and Authority of Scripture**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Modern, confessional Reformed revival and apologetic moment (early 21st century editorial project). Purpose: rearticulate the Westminster Standards for contemporary theological, ecclesial, and cultural challenges while dialoguing with modern biblical criticism, epistemology, and postmodern skepticism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reaffirmation of the Westminster doctrine that Scripture is the supreme, divinely-authoritative rule of faith and life, with a particular focus on how Scripture **attests to its own authority (self-attestation)** in a way consonant with Reformed confessionalism and pastoral faith.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Reassert the confessional claims: inspiration, infallibility, clarity (perspicuity), sufficiency of Scripture.
 - Develop a twofold account of authority:
 - **Objective:** Scripture's propositional truthfulness grounded in God as author.
 - **Subjective/epistemic:** The inner testimony of the Holy Spirit enables the believer to recognize Scripture's authority - this is not mere feeling but epistemic warrant for assent.
 - Defend self-attestation as compatible with historic Reformed teaching: Scripture does not need external supernatural proofs to be authoritative, yet historical and rational evidences remain appropriate aids.
 - Engage contemporary challenges: higher criticism, naturalistic epistemologies, and religious pluralism; propose confessional responses that preserve both doctrinal rigor and pastoral sensitivity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary source: Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms.
 - Scriptural exegesis across Paul, the Gospels, and OT prophetic witness as foundation.
 - Contemporary apologetic and epistemological interlocutors (analytic and historical critics) addressed indirectly through essays seeking integration rather than capitulation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration, Scripture's authority and self-authentication, illumination (testimony of the Spirit), perspicuity and sufficiency, canonicity, covenantal reading, and implications for ecclesial authority and preaching.
- **Closing line:** The volume defends a robust confessional posture: Scripture is God-breathed and self-attesting by the Spirit's witness, while historical and rational evidences play a supporting-never substitutive-role for evangelical assent and church authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses a balanced twofold model of authority combining **objective propositional truth** with **subjective Spirit-wrought recognition**, avoiding both fideism and rationalist reductionism.
 - Reframes classic Westminster language for contemporary epistemic debates without abandoning confessional categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects minimalist accounts that reduce Scripture's authority to communal or experiential consensus.
 - Distinguishes itself from liberal-critical positions that locate authority in historical-critical method; instead insists on divine origin as decisive.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies "self-attestation" to mean not isolation from evidences but primacy of Scripture's internal divine warrant.
 - Introduces modern epistemic vocabulary (warrant, justification, testimony) to interpret traditional doctrines (illumination, witness of the Spirit).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Received positively in conservative Reformed circles as a timely restatement of standards.
 - Functions as a pedagogical and polemical resource in seminaries and presbyteries wrestling with Scripture's status in pluralist contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a model for integrating confessional fidelity with contemporary philosophical tools.
 - Useful as a concise handbook for pastors, educators, and theologians defending Scripture against both skeptical naturalism and uncritical experientialism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation:** Scripture's claim to authority grounded in its divine authorship and the Spirit's internal testimony; primary warrant for belief.
- **Testimony of the Holy Spirit (illumination):** The Spirit's internal witness enabling believers to recognize and assent to Scripture's truth; not subjective autonomy but epistemic confirmation.
- **Objective authority:** The propositional truth and normative status of Scripture grounded in God as author.
- **Subjective recognition:** The believer's receptive assent enabled by the Spirit; distinguishes persuasion from mere persuasion by rhetoric.
- **Perspicuity (clarity):** Scripture is sufficiently clear in its essential saving truths for the ordinary reader under the Spirit's guidance.
- **Sufficiency:** Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and godly living; external aids may assist but cannot replace it.
- **Inspiration / infallibility:** Scripture is God-breathed and free from error in its salvific witness; foundation for self-attestation claims.
- **Canonical finality:** The closed canon as the locus where self-attestation is exercised; canonical texts carry normative weight.
- **Secondary evidences:** Historical, archaeological, and rational supports - useful and legitimate but subordinate to Scripture's internal authority.
- **Epistemic warrant:** Modern philosophical term used to describe how Scripture provides justifying reasons for belief via divine attestation.
- **Covenantal hermeneutic:** Reading Scripture within redemptive-historical and covenantal frameworks prescribed by Westminster.
- **Prophetic credibility:** Role of fulfilled prophecy as supportive evidence consonant with self-attestation.
- **Magisterial use:** The confession's role in the church's teaching and ordination standards, anchoring practical application of the doctrine.
- **Propositional revelation:** Emphasis on Scripture conveying truths (propositions) rather than merely existential or mystical data.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for confessional Reformed accounts of Scripture's authority and self-authentication.
- As a **polemic** against liberal biblical criticism and naturalistic epistemologies that deny divine authorship.
- As an **exegetical-pedagogical model** for preaching and catechesis that integrates illumination, perspicuity, and sufficiency.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary Reformed theology to employ analytic epistemology without surrendering confessional commitments.
