### TITLE
**The Divine Self: Person, Essence and I Am** - Paul Helm

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-Reformed theological milieu (early 21st century). Helm writes as a philosopher-theologian situating classical doctrinal commitments (Trinity, divine simplicity, aseity) in conversation with analytic philosophy of language, mind, and personhood.
 - Reaction to recent proposals that re-conceive God primarily in relational or "social" terms; seeks to recover theological resources from Augustine, Calvin, and classical orthodoxy while employing analytic clarity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can God be rightly spoken of as a *person* such that biblical personal language (especially the Exodus "I AM") is preserved without fracturing divine unity? Helm contends that genuine divine personhood is compatible with, and grounded in, the unity of divine essence rather than requiring a prior fragmentation of God into discrete centers or separable subjects.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: identifies confusions in accounts that treat divine persons as analogous to human individual subjects or as merely relational centers (risks: tritheism, modalism, or impoverished metaphysics).
 - Analysis of "person" and "I" predicates: explicates what is meant by selfhood when applied to an utterly simple, aseitic being; distinguishes personal attribution from numerical division of substance.
 - Trinity and relations: argues for understanding **relations of origin** (Father begetting Son, Spirit spirating) as real but not compositionally partitioning the divine essence.
 - Scriptural-theological exegesis: reads "I AM" and other personal theonyms to show that divine self-reference expresses absolute aseity and existential priority, not a human-style individuated subjectivity.
 - Synthesizes philosophical analysis and doctrinal tradition to propose a model where divine persons are real centers of personal reference grounded in single divine being.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Athanasius, Aquinas, Calvin (resources and loci classicorum).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: advocates of social Trinitarianism, analytic theologians debating divine simplicity (e.g., Leftow, Swinburne implicitly), and philosophers of mind concerned with personhood and self-reference.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility, revelation (notably Exodus 3), and the language of divine personhood; implicates Christology and covenantal revelation by grounding personal predicates in divine being.

- **Closing line**
 - Helm's theological center: **God is a true personal self whose personal selfhood is wholly consonant with the indivisible divine essence - the "I AM" names personal existence without entailing ontological composition.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses compatibility of classical divine simplicity with robust personal language; insists personhood does not entail metaphysical parts or separable subjects.
 - Prioritizes a philosophical-linguistic analysis of first-person divine self-reference as decisive for doctrine.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on social-Trinitarian models that treat the persons as independent centers akin to human selves, arguing they tend toward tritheism.
 - Critiques reductionist human-analogue accounts of God (e.g., modeling God's personhood on human psychological individuation), showing theological and metaphysical inadequacies.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Recovers and refines talk of the "divine self" as a theological-technical term: a personal self constituted by aseity and essence rather than by individuating accidents.
 - Emphasizes "relations of origin" as non-compositional explanatory grounds for interpersonality within God.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well regarded in Reformed and analytic-theological circles for clarifying debates about divine simplicity and personhood.
 - Utilized by scholars resisting social-Trinitarian emphases and by those seeking to integrate classical orthodoxy with contemporary analytic resources.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a tight, philosophically informed defense of traditional Trinitarian commitments that aids pastors, systematicians, and analytic theologians in handling biblical anthropomorphism and divine self-talk.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Self** - The conception of God as a personal self grounded in aseity and essence rather than in multiplicity or psychological individuation.
- **Person (in God)** - Not a separate human-like subject; a mode of divine self-reference compatible with one essence and real relations.
- **Essence** - The single divine being that grounds attributes and personal predication without composition.
- **I AM** - Exodusic theonym interpreted as existential self-manifestation: absolute self-existence and personal self-reference.
- **Divine Simplicity** - Doctrine that God is non-composite; Helm argues it is compatible with personal predicates.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; central to Helm's account of divine selfhood and "I" discourse.
- **Relations of Origin** - Father-Son-Spirit relations that are real and differentiating without dividing the essence.
- **Social Trinitarianism (contrast)** - The view Helm critiques when it treats persons as discrete centers akin to human persons.
- **Modalism (contrast)** - Avoided by Helm's insistence that persons are not mere modes; they are real relations grounded in essence.
- **Personal Predication** - How we ascribe "I", "He", "Who" to God; analyzed to preserve both personal talk and unity.
- **Immutability / Impassibility** - Doctrines retained and integrated into Helm's account of an enduring divine self.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for theological accounts of divine personhood compatible with divine simplicity.
- As a **polemic/reference** in debates opposing social-trinitarian or quasi-psychological accounts of the persons.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical self-reference (esp. Exodus "I AM") into systematic formulations of God's aseity and personhood.
