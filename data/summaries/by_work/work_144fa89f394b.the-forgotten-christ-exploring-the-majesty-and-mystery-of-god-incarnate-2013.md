### TITLE
**The Forgotten Christ: Exploring the Majesty and Mystery of God Incarnate** (2013) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2013 within a broadly Reformed, confessional Protestant milieu; addresses perceived contemporary losses of classical Christology in evangelical and mainline settings.
 - Gaffin writes as an exegetical theologian shaped by Westminster/Reformed covenant theology and by mid-20th-century conservative biblical scholarship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Modern theology and ecclesial practice have largely "forgotten" the biblical Christ by reducing, privatizing, or reinterpreting the incarnate Son; recovery of the **majestic and mysterious** character of God incarnate is necessary for right doctrine, worship, and life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis establishes the person and work of Christ as the decisive revelation of God (focus on Pauline and Johannine Christology).
 - Historical-theological retrieval: affirms Chalcedonian two‑nature Christology and Reformation readings against contemporary distortions (e.g., kenoticism, existentialist appropriation).
 - Theological synthesis: situates incarnation within covenantal and soteriological frameworks - Christ as representative/federal head who restores what Adam forfeited.
 - Practical consequence: ecclesial confession and Christian formation must be re-ordered around the incarnate Son.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals widely to New Testament texts and patristic/Chalcedonian formulations; interacts with Calvinist tradition figures (Calvin, Warfield) and critiques modern theologians who marginalize the historic Christ (various liberal, kenotic, or existential interpreters).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (person and two natures, incarnation, exaltation)
 - **Trinity** (Son as consubstantial with Father and Spirit)
 - **Revelation** (Christ as the Word who discloses God)
 - **Covenant & federal headship** (Christ as second Adam; relation to Adam's historicity)
 - **Atonement and union with Christ** (representative exchange and participatory life)
 - **Scripture and confessional theology**

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin insists that recovery of the majestic and mysterious incarnate Christ is the requisite hinge for orthodox doctrine, covenantal soteriology, and the life of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Simultaneous stress on the **majesty** (divine identity/exaltation) and **mystery** (incarnational humility, redemptive participation) of Christ as mutually explanatory.
 - Firm insistence on biblical, confessional, and historical continuity - not a novelty but retrieval.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal demythologizing, existential appropriation of "Christ of faith" versus historical Jesus, and modern kenotic accounts that dilute Chalcedonian realism.
 - Restores a robust representative Christ against purely moral-influence or functionalist readings.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Framing the problem as "forgetting" clarifies sociological-theological diagnosis: loss results from shifts in hermeneutics, worship, and ethical prioritization.
 - Rearticulates classical terms (representation, union) in close exegetical connection to Pauline anthropology and covenant language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and evangelical academic circles as a clear, biblically grounded Christological resource.
 - Used by seminaries and pastors wanting a corrective to contemporary Christological erosion; less engagement among critics outside confessional Reformed networks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating tight exegesis with systematic retrieval; durable pedagogical tool for teaching orthodox Christology and its ecclesial implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation** - the decisive event in which the Son assumes human nature; locus of revelation and redemption.
- **Two Natures / Chalcedonian Christology** - affirmation of full deity and full humanity in one person; nonconfused, non-separated.
- **Majesty** - the divine, exalted identity and lordship of the Son; guards against domestication of Jesus.
- **Mystery** - the paradox of the incarnate Son's humiliation and hiddenness; theological acceptance of God's condescension.
- **Union with Christ** - participatory reality grounding justification, sanctification, and resurrection life.
- **Federal Headship / Representation** - Christ as second Adam who legally and covenantally represents believers; restores what Adam forfeited.
 - Related: **Historicity of Adam** - Gaffin treats Adam's historicity and federal role as necessary background for coherent covenantal soteriology.
- **Atonement** - representative, juridical, and participatory dimensions tied to Christ's personhood.
- **Revelation (Christocentric)** - Scripture's primary function is to bear witness to the incarnate Son as definitive self-disclosure of God.
- **Kenosis (critique)** - critical engagement with theories that construe divine self-emptying as ontological diminution.
- **Scripture & Confession** - articulation that biblical exegesis and historic creeds together guard doctrine.
- **Person vs. Work distinction** - insistence that the Son's person grounds and secures his salvific works.
- **Christ of history vs. Christ of faith** - Gaffin insists the categories must not be severed; historical incarnation is the basis for faith.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for orthodox, Reformed Christology in seminary courses.
 - As a **polemic** against kenoticism, liberal reductions, and existentialist re-readings of Christ.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline and Johannine Christology tied to covenantal theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Adam's federal headship and historicity to Christ's representative, covenantal work.
