### TITLE
From Human to Posthuman: Christian Theology and Technology in a Postmodern World - Brent Waters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-2000s conversation at the intersection of theology, bioethics, and cultural theory. Responds to rapid technoscientific change (biotechnology, cyberspace, prosthetics) and to postmodern critiques of autonomous modern subjectivity.
 - Waters writes as a constructive Christian ethicist/theologian seeking to relocate classical theological categories within a context shaped by **postmodern/posthuman** thought.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Technology destabilizes inherited theological anthropologies: the modern autonomous human is exhausted. Waters contends that Christian theology must reconceive the human in light of technological mediation without abandoning core creedal commitments (creation, incarnation, eschaton).
 - The key problem: how to hold together **imago Dei**, embodiment, and redemption when human identity is increasingly hybrid, prosthetic, and networked.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: surveys postmodern and posthuman critiques that dissolve the modern subject and show technology as constitutive of identity.
 - Theological retrieval: revisits Scripture and doctrinal resources (creation theology, incarnation, sacramentality) to supply a theological anthropology that can account for mediated/hybrid humans.
 - Normative proposal: offers a Christian posthumanism that
 - affirms the created goodness and finitude of embodied life,
 - recognizes technological mediation as morally and ontologically significant,
 - proposes ethical norms shaped by incarnation, neighbor-love, and eschatological telos.
 - Practical implications: discusses bioethical dilemmas, church practices, and public theology oriented to flourishing amid technological change.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Secular/posthuman theorists: Donna Haraway, N. Katherine Hayles, and postmodern critiques of the subject.
 - Philosophical technology critics: references to Heideggerian (instrumentality/ enframing) concerns and to phenomenological accounts of embodiment.
 - Theologians and traditions: retrieval from classical Christian doctrines (Augustine/Aquinian patterns), engagement with contemporary theological ethicists and ecumenical concerns.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (imago Dei, embodied personhood)
 - **Christology/Incarnation** (as theological anchor for embodied mediation)
 - **Creation and providence** (creational ontology against technological absolutism)
 - **Ethics** (moral responsibility for technologies and their uses)
 - **Eschatology** (eschatological telos informing present technological discernment)
 - Secondary: ecclesiology and sacramental practice as loci for resisting dehumanizing uses of tech.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Waters aims to craft a **Christian posthuman theology** that refuses naïve technophilia or technophobia and instead locates human identity in the relational, embodied, incarnational story of God - thus equipping theology to critique and shape technological futures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats technology not as mere tool but as formative of human subjectivity; foregrounds **mediation** and **prosthetic** dimensions of modern life.
 - Centers the **incarnation** as a theological corrective and resource for thinking about embodied hybridity rather than retreating to abstract spiritualism.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against classical modernist theological anthropology that assumes an autonomous, pre-technological subject.
 - Corrects both techno-utopian posthumanism (which celebrates dissolution of human limits) and Luddite theological rejection (which romanticizes an unmediated human nature).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Adopts and Christianizes the language of **posthuman/posthumanism**, **technological mediation**, and **prosthesis**, using them as theological categories rather than purely cultural-scientific descriptors.
 - Frames a "posthuman theology" that is not anti-human but reorients human identity within creation and redemption.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in theological ethics, practical theology, and religious studies as an early robust Christian engagement with posthumanist discourse.
 - Influential for scholars rethinking sacramentality, bioethics, and ecclesial formation under technological conditions; cited across interdisciplinary fields that bridge theology and technology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological model: theological retrieval + critical engagement with cultural theory.
 - Serves as a corrective to both uncritical adaptation to technology and retreat from public techno-ethical engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Posthuman / Posthumanism** - reconfiguration of the human beyond modernist autonomy; Waters Christianizes the category to preserve moral and creational constraints.
- **Technological mediation** - the thesis that technologies shape perception, identity, and social relations; central analytic lens.
- **Embodiment** - insistence that despite mediation humans remain bodily and that theology must begin with incarnational realism.
- **Imago Dei** - reframed as relational and vocational, providing limits and aims for technological augmentation.
- **Incarnation** - normative paradigm for orientation to embodied, mediated existence; theological anchor for technology ethics.
- **Prosthesis / Cyborg language** - used descriptively to analyze human-technology hybrids and normatively to argue for ethical integration.
- **Creation / Creatural finitude** - theological constraint against technological absolutism or transcendence of creatureliness.
- **Eschatological telos** - final orientation that shapes present judgments about technology's role in human flourishing.
- **Ethics of responsibility** - emphasis on stewardship, neighbor-love, and justificatory practices for technological adoption.
- **Sacramentality / Ecclesial formation** - locus for resisting dehumanizing uses of technology and cultivating embodied practices.
- **Technoscience** - recognition of integrated science and technology as cultural force requiring theological critique.
- **Mediation vs. authenticity** - rejects simple authenticity/inauthenticity dichotomy; focuses on formative practices.
- **Hybridization** - description of identity mixing biological, technological, social elements; theological evaluation required.
- **Public theology** - use of theological resources to participate in societal debates over technology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "Christian posthumanism" and for theology of technological mediation.
 - As a **polemic** against both uncritical techno-optimism and nostalgic rejection of technology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics and ecclesiology: supplies language and categories for curricula on technology, bioethics, and liturgical formation.
 - As an **exegetical model** showing how incarnational and creational doctrines can be brought to bear on contemporary technoscientific questions.
