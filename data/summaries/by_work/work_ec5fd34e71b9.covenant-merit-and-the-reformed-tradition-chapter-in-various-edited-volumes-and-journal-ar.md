### TITLE
Covenant, Merit, and the Reformed Tradition - Scott Swain (chapter; essays/journal contexts)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed retrieval and constructive theology. Part of a broader conversation about how classical Reformed scholastic categories (merit, imputation, covenant) bear on contemporary soteriology and pastoral concerns.
 - Responds to both Roman Catholic scholastic accounts of merit and popular misunderstandings of "works" in Protestant contexts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformed tradition preserves a distinct, covenant-shaped account of merit: good works do not procure justification but may properly be said to receive divine recompense because of the believer's covenantal union with Christ and God's merciful justice.
 - Problem addressed: how to speak of "merit" and "reward" without collapsing into Pelagianism or Roman merit-theory, and how to maintain both divine grace and divine justice in soteriology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological diagnosis: traces classical categories (medieval condign/congruous merit) and how Reformers and Reformed scholastics appropriated, transformed, or rejected them.
 - Theological reconstruction:
 - Distinguishes justification (forensic, by imputation through Christ's obedience) from reward (recompense for sanctified good works).
 - Grounds the believer's eligibility for reward in union with Christ (federal headship and Christ's mediatorial obedience).
 - Articulates how God's justice can rightly distribute reward without compromising sola gratia: God awards on covenantal promises, not owed as intrinsic human claim.
 - Pastoral and polemical applications: clarifies evangelical praxis regarding assurance, holiness, and the motivation for good works.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Reformers (notably Calvin), Reformed scholastic writers (e.g., Turretin-style categories), and the medieval scholastic vocabulary (Aquinas: condign vs congruous merit) as a background foil.
 - Dialogues with contemporary Reformed scholars who debate merit, imputation, and reward; often presumes familiarity with Pauline exegesis on works and wages (e.g., Romans 4-8; 2 Corinthians 5).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works vs covenant of grace), justification (forensic imputation), sanctification, Christology (mediatorial/federal headship and the double obedience), divine justice, grace, merit, and eschatological reward.

- **Closing line**
 - Swain's theological center of gravity: a covenantal account secures both the gratuitous nature of justification and a biblically intelligible place for reward - believers rightly receive recompense, but only within the gracious, imputed righteousness effected by Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes **covenantal status** as the proper ground for speaking of reward: not intrinsic human worth but relational rights via union with Christ.
 - Reframes merit-language so it supports divine justice without becoming an anthropocentric claim to righteousness.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both Roman claims that human works can earn justification and antinomian or radical Protestant denials that any notion of recompense is legitimate.
 - Contrasts with medieval intrinsic-merit models by relocating the "right" to reward in Christ's mediatorial work and covenant promises.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates scholastic categories (e.g., condign merit) within a Reformed covenantal economy, but reinterprets them so that reward is derivative of Christ's federal obedience and the believer's union with him.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among contemporary Reformed theologians and pastors seeking a robust doctrine of sanctification that preserves assurance and motivates holiness.
 - Serves as a corrective in academic debates over imputation, merit, and the semantic range of "reward" in Pauline theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, historically aware, and theologically exact model for teaching how good works relate to salvation, pastoral assurance, and eschatological recompense.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Framework for salvation where rights to reward flow from union with Christ rather than personal intrinsic merit.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Background contrast: the failed paradigm where obedience would merit life; helps demarcate Reformed repudiation of works-righteousness.
- **Merit**
 - Reformed construal: not autonomous earning of justification; can denote rightful recompense within covenantal promises.
 - Sub-distinction: derivative/communicative merit grounded in Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Condign vs Congruous Merit**
 - Historical categories reclaimed and reinterpreted: condign (strictly fitting recompense) is reframed as due only by Christ's satisfaction; human congruousness redirected to covenantal gratuity.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness for justification; central to denying human merit for salvation.
- **Federal Headship / Union with Christ**
 - Ontological and legal ground for both imputation (justification) and entitlement to reward.
- **Double Obedience**
 - Christ's active and passive obedience as the basis for believers' justification and their eligibility for reward.
- **Divine Justice**
 - Preserved by showing God can justly reward obedience without compromising grace because rewards are given according to covenant promise.
- **Good Works**
 - Fruits of union with Christ; not causes of justification but grounds for future recompense and ecclesial commendation.
- **Reward / Recompense**
 - Eschatological and present blessings that God gives in accordance with covenantal promises, distinct from justification.
- **Forensic Justification**
 - Legal declaration by God; contrasted with rewards to prevent conflation of grateful duties and salvific status.
- **Sanctification**
 - Ethical outworking that evidences union with Christ and supplies the content for divine recompense.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source**: to define and limit "merit" in Reformed vocabulary for courses on soteriology and ecclesiology.
 - **Polemic**: as a constructive rebuttal to Roman Catholic merit claims and to antinomian tendencies.
 - **Exegetical model / conceptual pivot**: employed in Pauline exegesis to distinguish wages/labour metaphors (Romans) from justificatory categories, and to ground pastoral teaching on assurance and reward.
