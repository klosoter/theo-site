### TITLE
**Richard B. Gaffin Jr., Geerhardus Vos: Reformed Biblical Theologian, Confessional Presbyterian (secondary)**

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-late 20th century reception of early-20th-century Princeton scholarship; Gaffin writes as a late-Princeton Reformed theologian reclaiming Geerhardus Vos for contemporary biblical theology and confessional Presbyterianism.
 - Addressing trends in biblical theology (form-critical, existential, and canonical schools) and the decline of historical-redemptive readings in some evangelical circles.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin argues that Vos represents a paradigmatic Reformed biblical theologian whose **redemptive-historical method** and confessional commitments supply a robust framework for doctrinal coherence, especially for doctrines of **assurance and perseverance**.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Vos's method: history-centered, organic covenantal development rather than disconnected topical treatments.
 - Defense of Vos against caricatures (e.g., as merely antiquarian or pietistic) and clarification of his fidelity to Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Application: how Vos's categories (promise/fulfillment, covenant-historical typology, inaugurated eschatology) inform pastoral and doctrinal concerns such as assurance of salvation and perseverance of the saints.
 - Practical-theological implications: biblical theology as servant to confessional and pastoral needs.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Geerhardus Vos's own corpus (biblical theology lectures, OT/NT essays).
 - Interlocutors: Princeton milieu (e.g., B. B. Warfield), contemporaneous critics (form criticism, existential/canonical approaches), and later interpreters (some modern evangelical biblical theologians).
 - Implicit contrast with pietistic subjectivism and with scholastic abstraction divorced from historical revelation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (progressive, historical), Covenant (covenant of redemption; covenants of works and grace), Christology (central, typological fulfillment), Eschatology (inaugurated consummation), Soteriology (election, union with Christ, assurance, perseverance), Hermeneutics (typology vs. allegory, OT-NT continuity).

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin presents Vos as the exemplar of a **confessional, redemptive-historical biblical theology** that secures doctrinal coherence and pastoral assurance by rooting soteriology in the covenantal, historical work of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasis on organic, historical continuity: revelation unfolds in stages but is one saving plan centered in Christ.
 - Strong linking of biblical-theological method to confessional norms-biblical theology serves systematic doctrine, not supplants it.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that detach typology from Christocentric fulfillment or reduce covenantal categories to moralism.
 - Contrasts Vos's historical-grammatical-typological approach with both form-critical atomism and later canonical theology that subsumes history under final canonical form.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulation of **inaugurated eschatology** via covenant-historical language; renewed stress on the covenant of redemption as an interpretive hinge.
 - Precision in the **union with Christ** motif as the ground for assurance and perseverance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Revived interest in Vos across Reformed seminaries; Gaffin's treatment legitimated Vos as a theological resource beyond antiquarian interest.
 - Influenced debates on pastoral assurance, covenant theology revival, and the redemptive-historical movement in homiletics and hermeneutics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, reliable interpretive blueprint for using Vos in systematic and pastoral contexts.
 - Valuable corrective to individualistic assurance models by embedding assurance and perseverance in covenantal, historical union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-historical (biblical) theology**: reading Scripture as an unfolding single plan of salvation centered in Christ.
- **Covenant of redemption**: intra-Trinitarian pact grounding the economy of salvation; interpretive hinge in Vos/Gaffin.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace**: classic Reformed covenants recast within historical development.
- **Typology**: historically-real patterns in OT pointing forward to Christ; not mere moral exempla or allegory.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: the already/not-yet structure of salvation realized in Christ's work.
- **Union with Christ**: existential and forensic bond that grounds justification, sanctification, assurance, and perseverance.
- **Assurance**: certainty of salvation rooted in covenantal promises and objective work of Christ as mediated in the life of the believer.
- **Perseverance (of the saints)**: final perseverance understood in relation to covenantal election and union with Christ.
- **Historical continuity**: emphasis on organic progression rather than discontinuous doctrinal islands.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic**: interpretive priority of Christ in reading all Scripture.
- **Confessional Presbyterianism**: ecclesial and doctrinal commitments shaping theological method and application.
- **Pastoral biblical theology**: using redemptive-historical insight to ground pastoral care (assurance, discipline).
- **Exegetical typology**: method linking specific OT texts to NT fulfillment with rigorous historical-grammatical controls.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the redemptive-historical method and its confessional constraints.
 - As a **polemic** against subjective assurance models and ahistorical readings that undermine perseverance.
 - As an **exegetical model** for OT-NT continuity that informs preaching and systematic formulations of soteriology.
