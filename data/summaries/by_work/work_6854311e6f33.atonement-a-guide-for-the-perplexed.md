### TITLE
Atonement: A Guide for the Perplexed - Adam J. Johnson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary introductory/advanced survey, part of the "Guide for the Perplexed" style literature aimed at students and pastors.
 - Situated in post-conservative theological conversation that seeks to recover ancient and Reformation patterns while engaging modern critiques (historical-critical, ethical, and philosophical).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The book addresses the perennial question: what does Scripture mean by Christ's saving work? Johnson contends that a faithful doctrine of atonement must be historically informed, biblically grounded, and theologically integrated-resisting reduction to a single metaphor or mechanism.
 - He aims to navigate between caricatured alternatives (e.g., exclusive penal substitution vs. purely Christus Victor readings) to show how multiple motifs function together in Christian thought.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Introductory orientation: method, theological commitments (canonical reading, Trinitarian and covenantal horizons).
 - Biblical survey: key OT sacrificial language, Suffering Servant, Psalms; New Testament emphases (Pauline forensic language, Johannine participation, Pauline participation, the Gospels' kingdom/eschatological motifs).
 - Historical trajectory: patristic recapitulation and Christus Victor emphases; medieval satisfaction and penal-thinking; Reformation developments (Calvinic forensic and covenantal notes); modern controversies (Anselmian readings; 19th-20th century developments; contemporary proposals).
 - Contemporary debates: critique of monolithic theories; assessment of strengths and limits of major models.
 - Constructive proposal: an **integrative pluralism**-a model that preserves the legitimacy and complementary roles of multiple atonement motifs (Christus Victor, satisfaction/substitution, participation/recapitulation, and ethical exemplarism) within a Trinitarian-covenantal frame.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic authors (Irenaeus, Athanasius), medieval (Anselm), Reformers (Calvin), moderns (Gustaf Aulén, John McLeod Campbell, J. H. Bavinck), and contemporary interlocutors (N. T. Wright, J. D. G. Dunn, C. S. Lewis critics, proponents of penal substitution like John Murray and modern critics).
 - Engagement with biblical scholarship (Pauline studies, Johannine theology) and systematic theologians (Barth, Moltmann to varying degrees).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (central), Christology, Trinity, covenant, sin and guilt, sacrificial typology, ecclesiology (union with Christ), eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Johnson's theological center: **atonement is multifaceted and must be read as the single, Trinitarian work of God in Christ that liberates, reconciles, substitutes, and unites-interpreted within covenantal and ecclesial horizons rather than reduced to one mechanism.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong methodological insistence on **multimodal reading**: Scripture's metaphorical plurality is theological data, not a problem to be reduced.
 - Prioritizes **union with Christ** (participation) as the hermeneutical key that coheres other motifs into a single economy of salvation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects simplistic historiographies that portray Anselmian/penal models as the only historically significant approach.
 - Challenges exclusive proponents of either penal substitution or Christus Victor, arguing that each isolates biblical emphases to the detriment of a holistic soteriology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advocates the label **"integrative pluralism"** (or similar), emphasizing web-like relations among atonement motifs rather than hierarchy or strict synthesis.
 - Uses "matrix language" to describe how biblical images occupy different functional slots (legal, cosmic, participatory) within one salvific event.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued as a readable, student-friendly corrective to reductionist readings; often recommended in seminary courses.
 - Has modest traction in Reformed circles as a clarifying resource that does not abandon penal substitution but resists its isolation.
 - Cited in ecclesial teaching contexts where ecumenical attention to patristic motifs is desired.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching: helps students hold complex data.
 - Serves as a constructive ecumenical bridge-helpful for dialogues between Protestant, Orthodox, and Catholic emphases on atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement** - Johnson treats it as the umbrella term for the work of Christ that includes liberation, satisfaction, substitution, and participation.
- **Penal substitution** - Recognized as a crucial Reformation and Protestant insight (legal-forensic language); Johnson affirms its importance but warns against making it exclusive.
- **Satisfaction (Anselmian)** - Explains moral/ontological dynamics of honor and satisfaction; placed historically and critiqued when read without covenantal context.
- **Christus Victor** - Emphasizes Christ's victory over powers; Johnson rescues its patristic merits and insists on its compatibility with substitutionary ideas.
- **Recapitulation/Participation** - Union with Christ; central organizing motif for Johnson that integrates other strands by positing salvation as incorporation into Christ.
- **Propitiation/Expiation** - Sacrificial language analyzed for both cultic and forensic senses; Johnson stresses semantic range in biblical usage.
- **Covenantal framework** - The lens that situates legal metaphors (forensic) and relational metaphors (participation) within God's faithful dealings with Israel and the church.
- **Trinitarian economy** - The insistence that atonement is the **work of the triune God**, not merely a transaction between Father and Son.
- **Moral exemplarism** - Treated as a secondary motif; Johnson acknowledges pastoral and ethical value but cautions against making it the primary atonement theory.
- **Forensic language** - Legal categories (justification, imputation) are affirmed as the NT's idiom for how sin and righteousness are dealt with.
- **Cosmic powers** - Language for spiritual and structural evil that Christus Victor addresses.
- **Union with Christ** - Key explanatory principle for sanctification, justification, and final glorification.
- **Ecumenical integration** - How varied traditions' emphases can be read as complementary, not antagonistic.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** and orientation for students encountering diverse atonement theories.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist monocausal models (either strictly penal or strictly Christus Victor).
 - As an **exegetical-model** recommending canonical, Trinitarian, and covenantal readings of key texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula when steering soteriology toward integrative, ecumenically aware constructions.
