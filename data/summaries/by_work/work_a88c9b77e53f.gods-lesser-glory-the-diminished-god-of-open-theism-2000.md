### TITLE
God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism (2000) - Bruce A. Ware

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2000 in the aftermath of the 1990s evangelical surge in Open Theism (Pinnock, Sanders, Boyd, Hasker).
 - Written from an evangelical/Reformed-leaning classical-theist perspective reacting to perceived theological and pastoral dangers of Open Theism.
 - A polemical volume aimed at seminary instructors, pastors, and doctrinally conservative audiences.

- **Central thesis**
 - Open Theism diminishes the glory of God by denying or attenuating core divine attributes (notably exhaustive foreknowledge, immutability, and sovereign providence), thereby undermining biblical doctrine, worship, and the theological coherence of God's character.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: identifies the central claims of Open Theism (future openness, denial of exhaustive definite foreknowledge of free acts, emphasis on divine relationality and risk).
 - Exegetical/theological critique: argues biblical texts more naturally support classical theism (God's exhaustive foreknowledge and providential control).
 - Philosophical-theological consequences: traces how Open Theism affects doctrines of sovereignty, omniscience, immutability, and providence.
 - Pastoral implications: contends that a "diminished" God weakens confidence in promises, prayer, and worship.
 - Concluding appeal: calls for retention of classical formulations that secure both divine greatness and faithful piety.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary targets: Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Gregory Boyd, William Hasker, Thomas Oord.
 - Allies and antecedents: classical theists from Reformed tradition; appeals to older orthodox formulations of divine attributes.
 - Method: sustained engagement with Open Theist texts, Scripture, and philosophical-theological argument.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes: omniscience, omnipotence, immutability, impassibility.
 - Providence and sovereignty.
 - Foreknowledge and human freedom (libertarian freedom vs. divine exhaustive knowledge).
 - Revelation and biblical interpretation insofar as texts about God's knowledge, promises, and plans are concerned.
 - Secondary touchpoints: worship, prayer, and theodicy.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Ware insists that retaining a robust, classical understanding of God's knowledge and sovereignty is necessary to preserve the fullness of God's glory, the integrity of biblical teaching, and the health of Christian worship and trust.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Uses the rubric of **"glory"** as a theological measuring-stick: theology is evaluated by whether it increases or diminishes the divine glory due to God.
 - Strong link between **doctrine and doxology** - doctrine that diminishes attributes diminishes worship.

- **Corrections or contrasts to Open Theism**
 - Rejects Open Theism's redefinition of foreknowledge as compatible only with a risky, dynamically changing future and instead defends **exhaustive definite foreknowledge**.
 - Argues Open Theism over-prioritizes creaturely freedom at the expense of divine sovereignty and covenantal assurance.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"lesser glory"** functions as a rhetorical and analytic innovation: a way to encapsulate theological loss rather than only logical inconsistency.
 - Frames Open Theism as not merely mistaken but as theologically and pastorally deleterious.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among conservative evangelicals and Reformed seminarians as a definitive polemic against Open Theism.
 - Sparked substantial response from Open Theists; has become a standard reference in debates over divine foreknowledge and providence.
 - Criticized by some for polemical tone and for underestimating the pastoral motives behind Open Theism's emphasis on divine relationality.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, accessible defense of classical theistic attributes tied to pastoral concerns.
 - Valuable as a compact statement showing how alterations in one locus (foreknowledge) ripple across theology, worship, and pastoral life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism**
 - The view that the future contains genuine possibilities; God knows the future as partly open and does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of all future free acts.
- **God's glory**
 - Ware's evaluative standard: the worthiness of God to receive praise; theology judged by whether it enhances or diminishes this glory.
- **Exhaustive definite foreknowledge**
 - Classical claim that God knows with certainty all true future propositions, including free human actions.
- **Future openness**
 - The Open Theist claim that future events are not fully determined and thus not fully known by God as settled facts.
- **Divine sovereignty / providence**
 - Ware's insistence that God exercises comprehensive, purposive control over creation consistent with foreknowledge.
- **Immutability**
 - The classical attribute asserting God's unchangeableness; Ware argues Open Theism effectively relativizes this.
- **Omniscience**
 - Full, complete knowledge of all truths; Ware defends this as necessary to preserve God's supremacy.
- **Impassibility**
 - Traditional idea that God does not have passions in the sense of being subject to emotional change that impairs sovereignty; Ware connects Open Theism's relational emphasis to problematic volatility.
- **Divine risk**
 - Open Theists' claim that God takes real risks; Ware sees this as diminishing God's sovereignty and glory.
- **Libertarian freedom**
 - Human free will that Open Theists often affirm; Ware critiques how its affirmation is balanced against divine omniscience.
- **Relationality**
 - Open Theism's stress on God's dynamic responsiveness; Ware grants relationality but resists making it foundational at cost of other attributes.
- **Praise and worship implications**
 - How alterations in doctrine affect believers' trust and worship; Ware foregrounds this practical consequence.
- **Exegetical claims**
 - Ware engages key biblical texts (e.g., prophetic certainty, divine promises) to argue against Open Theist readings.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise polemic and summary defense of classical theism in systematic theology courses.
 - As a pastoral-apologetic resource showing practical implications of doctrinal shifts (prayer, assurance, worship).
 - As a conceptual pivot in debates over foreknowledge and providence-frequently cited by critics of Open Theism.
