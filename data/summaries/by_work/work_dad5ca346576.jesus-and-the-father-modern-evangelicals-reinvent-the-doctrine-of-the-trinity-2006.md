### TITLE
Jesus and the Father: Modern Evangelicals Reinvent the Doctrine of the Trinity (Kevin Giles, 2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical landscape where debates over gender, authority, and church order sharpened. Published amid a resurgence of complementarian appeals to a supposed **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** of the Son to the Father as theological support for male headship.
 - Giles writes as an evangelical Trinitarian and historian reacting to contemporary complementarian theology (notably Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware).

- **Central thesis**
 - Modern appeals to an eternal, ontological subordination of the Son (EFS) are a theological innovation that reintroduces forms of subordinationism condemned in the patristic and classical orthodox tradition. Biblical texts show functional or economic subordination in the work of salvation, not an eternal inequality of will or authority within the Godhead.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological survey: patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern sources on relations within the Trinity, focusing on how tradition handled origin, monarchy of the Father, and eternal generation.
 - Exegetical critique: close readings of key NT passages cited for EFS (e.g., John 5, 6, 14-17; Philippians 2; 1 Corinthians 15:24-28) arguing they describe mission/role, not ontological submission.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: defends Nicene formulation of homoousios, eternal generation of the Son, and perichoretic mutual indwelling; insists on **ontological equality of being and will** while allowing economic ordering in mission.
 - Polemical engagement: critiques contemporary proponents for conflating economic order with ontological relations and for selective use of historical texts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware, and other contemporary evangelical proponents of EFS.
 - Historical sources emphasized: Athanasius, the Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus), Augustine, key conciliar formulations. Also engages modern theologians on both sides.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (incarnation and obedience), revelation (interpretation of Johannine and Pauline sayings), soteriology indirectly via economic roles.

- **Closing line**
 - Giles locates the theological center of gravity in classical Nicene orthodoxy: the Father and Son share one divine will and being; subordination language properly describes mission, not eternal intra-Trinitarian authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reasserts a strong distinction between the **economic Trinity** (roles in history) and the **immanent Trinity** (eternal relations of being and will).
 - Stresses **eternal generation** and the Cappadocian lexicon as corrective to modern term-shifts that recast origin as authority.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct rebuttal of EFS proponents: argues they have read modern social patterns (hierarchy, headship) back into Trinitarian doctrine and misread patristic texts.
 - Contrasts with complementarian hermeneutic that uses intra-Trinitarian subordination to validate gender hierarchies.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies language: distinguishes **submission** (economic/relational obedience in mission), **subordination** (ontological inferiority), and **origin** (eternal begetting) to expose conflations in contemporary debate.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in egalitarian theological literature and among historians defending classical Trinitarianism.
 - Sparked extended exchanges with EFS proponents; became a key reference in academic and ecclesial disputes on gender and doctrine.
 - Met with criticism from complementarian scholars who dispute Giles's readings of both modern texts and patristic sources.

- **Enduring value**
 - Important corrective for students and pastors: re-centers classical sources and hermeneutics in Trinity debates and models historically-informed theological critique.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**: Contemporary thesis that the Son is eternally subordinate in role/authority to the Father; Giles argues this is a novel and mistaken reintroduction of subordinationism.
- **Ontological equality**: The claim that Father, Son, and Spirit share one divine essence and will; central to Giles's corrective.
- **Economic Trinity**: God's roles in creation, redemption, and history; Giles insists economic ordering (mission/submission) is temporal and not indicative of eternal intra-Trinitarian relations.
- **Immanent Trinity**: The inner life and relations of the Godhead; Giles defends classical distinctions here against modern role-based redefinitions.
- **Eternal generation**: The doctrine that the Son is begotten from the Father without beginning; used to account for relation without implying inferiority.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling**: Terminology Giles invokes to stress unity of being and will among persons of the Trinity.
- **Subordinationism**: Historical heresy asserting ontological inferiority of the Son; Giles argues modern EFS risks reintroducing this error.
- **Monarchy of the Father**: Classical notion of the Father as source (archē) within the Trinity; Giles preserves it but warns against translating 'source' into 'authority.'
- **Mission vs. Being**: Distinction Giles repeatedly enforces: differing missions do not imply differing divine being.
- **Scriptural loci**: John (esp. 5, 14-17), Philippians 2, 1 Corinthians 15 - chapters Giles reinterprets as economic/functional, not ontological.
- **Patristic hermeneutic**: Giles appeals to Cappadocians and Athanasius as normative interpreters for guarding against ontological subordination.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition and corrective source** on classical Trinitarian categories against EFS.
- As a **polemic** in egalitarian vs. complementarian debates, often cited by egalitarianists.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Johannine and Pauline texts in a way that preserves Nicene orthodoxy.
- As a **conceptual pivot** directing debates back to patristic theology and the distinction between economy and immanent relations.
