### TITLE
The Grace of God and the God of Grace: Sanctification and the Christian Life - Kevin DeYoung (articles and sermons)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical pastoral theology. DeYoung writes as a pastor-theologian in the early 21st century, addressing churches shaped by both historic Reformed confessions and popular evangelical movements; interlocutory context includes modern debates over "hyper-grace," legalism, and the experiential life of holiness.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Sanctification must be understood both as a definitive change in Christ (positional) and as a progressive, Spirit-wrought transformation (practical). True sanctification is gospel-driven: the believer's standing in Christ secures sanctification and the gospel motivates perseverance in holiness.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define sanctification in two complementary senses: **definitive (positional)** and **progressive (experiential)**.
 - Locate sanctification in union with Christ: what God has done (imputation, new standing) enables and grounds what God is doing (mortification, revival of affections).
 - Expose common errors:
 - Legalism/perfectionism: overemphasis on human effort and rule-keeping.
 - Antinomianism/hyper-grace: denial of normative moral transformation as necessary evidence.
 - Give pastoral prescriptions: faithful means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer, church discipline), regular repentance, and cultivation of joy as the engine of obedience.
 - Conclude with pastoral encouragement about perseverance and assurance: sanctification is both indicational (what we are) and incremental (what we become).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis (Pauline emphasis), Reformed tradition (Calvin, John Owen, Puritans), contemporary Reformed pastors and writers (implicit contrast with Wesleyan perfectionist strains and modern "hyper-grace" teachers). Uses pastoral experience and sermonic illustration over heavy systematic novelty.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sanctification (definitive and progressive), justification (relation to sanctification), union with Christ, imputation vs impartation, the work of the Holy Spirit, means of grace, repentance, assurance, perseverance.
- **Closing line:** A gospel-centered account: because Christ has definitively sanctified us, the Spirit progressively makes us holy - sanctification is both a secured status and an ongoing, grace-enabled struggle.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear dual framing - **Sanctification: Definitive and Progressive** - consistently used to prevent two common errors (presuming perfection or excusing sin).
 - Strong pastoral insistence that the gospel, not moralism, must be the motive and method for holiness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against legalistic moralism that treats sanctification as primarily human achievement.
 - Rejection of antinomian "grace only" readings that minimize ethical transformation as nonessential.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes accessible language for an old doctrinal distinction: precise pairing of "what God has done for us" (definitive) with "what God is doing in us" (progressive).
 - Emphasizes joy and gospel affections as the primary fuel of progressive sanctification.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed and evangelical pastoral contexts as a usable, pastoral corrective.
 - Valued by pastors and small-group leaders more than by academic theologians; influential in preaching and discipleship resources.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, pastorally ripe schema for catechesis on holiness.
 - Useful bridge between systematic theology (doctrine of salvation) and practical pastoral application (sanctified life).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification (definitive):** Positional holiness - the believer's standing as set apart in Christ (imputation, new identity).
- **Sanctification (progressive):** Ongoing Spirit-worked transformation in holiness, habit, and affections.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological and forensic ground for both justification and sanctification; primary nexus in DeYoung's account.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration that grounds assurance; distinguished from sanctification but inseparable in practice.
- **Imputed righteousness:** Christ's righteousness credited to the believer; secures definitive sanctification.
- **Imparted / infused holiness:** The Spirit's application of Christ's life to believers, enabling progressive sanctification.
- **Mortification:** Deliberate putting to death of sin; practical discipline enabled by the Spirit.
- **Vivification (or vivifying):** The Spirit-given enlivening, growth of new desires and virtues.
- **Means of grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer, church discipline - instruments God uses for progressive sanctification.
- **Law (mirror/instructor):** Law's role is diagnostic and formative, subordinate to the gospel as motive.
- **Joy / gospel affections:** The emotional and spiritual energy that propels obedience in DeYoung's pastoral theology.
- **Assurance & perseverance:** Assurance rooted in Christ secures confident perseverance; perseverance is evidence of true sanctification.
- **Antinomianism / Legalism:** Errors contrasted with balanced Reformed sanctification.
- **Gospel-shaped sanctification:** Short formula summarizing DeYoung's syntheses - holiness as the fruit, not the root, of salvation.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for the definitive/progressive distinction in sanctification.
 - As a **pastoral polemic** against both legalism and antinomian excesses.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching sanctification from Scripture with pastoral application.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discipleship curricula emphasizing gospel motivation for holiness.
