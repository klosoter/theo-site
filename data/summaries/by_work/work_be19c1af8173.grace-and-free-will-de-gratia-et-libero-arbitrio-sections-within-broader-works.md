### TITLE
Grace and Free Will (De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-13th century scholastic theology; Dominican intellectual milieu; synthesis of **Augustinian** soteriology with **Aristotelian** metaphysics.
 - Written as a systematic treatise addressing contemporary controversies over sin, grace, and human agency (against Pelagian and Semi‑Pelagian tendencies then and earlier).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To show how divine **grace** and human **free will** are compatible: grace is necessary for any truly good or meritorious act, yet the will remains genuinely free and responsible.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Establishes metaphysical account of causality: God = primary, universal cause; creatures = secondary/instrumental causes.
 - Distinguishes kinds and operations of grace:
 - **Prevenient (antecedent) grace**: the gift that renders the will capable of beginning to will the good.
 - **Operative grace**: the divine action that moves the will to act (actual graces).
 - **Cooperative grace**: the concurrence of created agency with divine motion.
 - Argues that:
 - Original sin wounds nature so that unaided will cannot attain supernatural good.
 - Grace is gratuitous and efficacious (properly moves will without violating freedom).
 - Merits are real but rest on prior grace and divine promise (distinguishes condign vs congruous merit).
 - Predestination is an eternal divine decree consistent with God's justice and mercy.
 - Uses philosophical analysis of volition, habit, and motion to defuse charges of determinism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: **Augustine** (authority on grace and sin).
 - Opponents/problems named: **Pelagius**, **John Cassian**/Semi‑Pelagianism.
 - Philosophical resources: **Aristotle** (causation, habit, potency/act), Peter Lombard, and Aristotelian natural philosophy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (habitual and actual), free will, original sin, justification, merit (condign/congruous), predestination/reprobation, divine causality and human responsibility.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Salvation is fundamentally the work of **divine gratuitous causation** that elevates and moves a genuinely free will to participate in merits - grace enables and secures the will's moral agency without obliterating it.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear tripartite distinction of grace (antecedent/operating/cooperating) that preserves genuine human agency while insisting on grace's necessity.
 - Integration of Aristotelian causality to explain efficacious divine action without metaphysical determinism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against **Pelagianism**: rejects the idea that the unassisted natural will can achieve supernatural goods or justification.
 - Against **Semi‑Pelagianism**: denies that the first movement toward God can rightly be attributed to unaided human will; insists prevenient grace is needed from the outset.
 - Nuances **Augustine** by supplying a philosophical account of how grace moves the will (not merely appeals to scriptural assertions).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **habitual (sanctifying) vs actual grace**, and terminological clarity around **condign** (strictly deserved, by promise) vs **congruous** merit (fitting reward).
 - Emphasis on **instrumentality**: created causes truly act, but only insofar as moved by God, preserving both divine primacy and creaturely agency.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for later **Thomistic** Catholic theology and Counter‑Reformation teaching.
 - Provoked debates with **Jesuit** Molinists and later scholastics over divine causality and freedom (precursor to premotion/congruism debates).
 - Protestant readers (Luther, Calvin) critiqued Aquinas's synergy but also drew from his Thomistic clarity on grace's necessity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of philosophical-theological synthesis: precise metaphysical apparatus applied to patristic soteriology; indispensable for teaching on grace, freedom, and merit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gratia (grace)** - gratuitous favor of God; includes habitual (sanctifying) and actual operations.
- **Liberum arbitrium (free will)** - genuine human freedom preserved though moved by God.
- **Gratia antecedens (prevenient grace)** - grace that makes the will capable of turning to God; necessary for the first act toward supernatural good.
- **Gratia operans (operative grace / actual grace)** - the divine action that moves the will at the moment of willing or acting.
- **Gratia cooperans (cooperative grace)** - concurrence where the human will performs with the divine motion.
- **Efficacious vs sufficient grace** - Aquinas: grace rendered efficacious by God's action; human consent still required but enabled.
- **Habitual grace (gratia habitualis)** - infused disposition/habit (sanctifying grace) that permanantly orients the soul.
- **Meritum de condigno** - merit strictly due in justice because of God's promise; presupposes sanctifying grace.
- **Meritum de congruo** - fitting reward (not strictly owed) for acts by those not rightly in grace; distinguishes degrees of merit.
- **Praedestinatio (predestination)** - God's eternal decree to confer eternal life on the elect; consistent with gratuitous causation.
- **Reprobatio (reprobation)** - God's just judgment in withholding grace; treated as logically compatible with human responsibility.
- **Original sin** - wounded human nature; explains necessity of grace against Pelagian claims.
- **Pelagianism** - denial of necessity of prevenient grace; Aquinas refutes.
- **Semi‑Pelagianism** - claim that first move toward God can be by human will; Aquinas rejects this and affirms Augustine.
- **Instrumental causality** - creatures act as true, subordinate causes under God's primary causation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Catholic doctrine on the types of grace, merit, and predestination.
 - As a **polemic** against Pelagian and Semi‑Pelagian positions and as a bridge between Augustinian theology and Aristotelian metaphysics.
 - As an **exegetical-model** and philosophical template for subsequent debates on divine causality, freedom, and the nature of merit.
