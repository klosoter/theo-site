### TITLE
On the Morals of the Catholic Church (De Moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae) - Augustine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Composed in Augustine's Milan/Rome period (late 4th century), written as an apologetic/pastoral response amid conflicts with Manichaeans and other critics who accused Christians of licentiousness. Reflects transition from Neoplatonic formation to distinctively Christian theology; addresses Roman moral expectations and anti-Christian slanders.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the moral integrity of the Catholic Church against charges of immorality while articulating a Christian anthropology and ethic that grounds moral responsibility in a psychosomatic unity of personhood and the ordering of loves.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose the accusation: critics claim Christians behave immorally; Manichaean dualists deny moral agency for bodily acts.
 - Argue for human unity: soul and body constitute one moral agent; bodily action cannot be excused by appeal to a separate material principle.
 - Locate moral fault in the will: sin results from disordered loves/will (early formulation of ordo amoris); habits and interior disorder explain recurring vice.
 - Affirm normative Christianity: true Christian moral life is ordered by grace, Scripture, and tradition; virtues are rightly ordered loves under the rule of God.
 - Conclude with pastoral exhortation: Church discipline and sanctifying grace correct disorder and enable moral transformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Manichaeans (primary opponent); general Roman critics; use of Scripture, apostolic tradition, Stoic and Platonic moral language reframed Christianly.
- **Doctrines treated:** Human nature and psychosomatic unity; will and moral responsibility; sin and concupiscence (incipient); virtue and habit; grace and moral renewal; ecclesial morality (the Church as moral community).
- **Closing line:** Augustine centers Christian ethics on a unified psychosomatic person whose moral life is determined by the ordered will - healed and re-ordered by grace within the Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Psychosomatic unity:** clear insistence that body and soul form one moral subject, undermining any excuse that separates material agency from moral culpability.
 - **Will-centered moral causality:** locates moral failure primarily in volitional disorder rather than in a metaphysical material principle.
 - **Order of loves (proto-ordo amoris):** early articulation that virtue consists in rightly ordered affections toward God and neighbor.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Manichaean dualism which posits a culpability-excusing material principle; Augustine reclaims responsibility for bodily acts.
 - Reframes Platonic/Neoplatonic notions of soul-body dualism into a Christian anthropology that affirms bodily goodness yet underscores need for interior reorientation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Moves language from forensic blame toward interior dispositional diagnosis (habitus, ordered will), paving way for later Augustinean notions of concupiscence and original sin.
 - Develops a practical ecclesial ethic that ties doctrine to communal discipline and grace-enabled moral reform.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read among medieval theologians as an authoritative corrective to dualist anthropology.
 - Influenced later Protestant and Reformed formulations of human nature as a unified person corrupted by sin, yet accountable; provided scaffolding for debates on free will, grace, and sanctification.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of combining pastoral apology, philosophical argument, and doctrinal clarity.
 - Essential for understanding Augustine's move from Neoplatonism to a Christian moral vision centered on will, habit, and grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity:** the thesis that body and soul constitute a single moral agent; used to rebut dualism and to ground moral responsibility.
- **Will (voluntas):** primary moral faculty; disorder of the will explains sin more than material causation.
- **Order of loves (proto-ordo amoris):** virtue conceived as properly ordered affections; mis-ordered loves = vice.
- **Concupiscence (concupiscentia):** nascent treatment here as disordered inclination; a precursor to Augustine's fuller doctrine of concupiscence.
- **Habitus (habit):** moral character/habit as formative of repeated action; links psychology and ethical formation.
- **Grace (gratia):** necessary for re-ordering loves and enabling true virtue; Church as vessel of sanctifying grace.
- **Church (ecclesia) as moral community:** the Church is defended as morally disciplined and formative rather than morally corrupt as accused.
- **Dualism / Manichaeism:** the opponent thesis denied; Augustine dismantles its ethical implications.
- **Responsibility / culpa:** moral blame rests on the person (unified soul-body), not on material principles.
- **Virtue (virtus):** redefined in theological terms as right-ordered action rooted in love of God.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium):** affirmed as operative but subject to disorder and in need of grace.
- **Interiority:** attention to inner disposition as decisive for moral assessment.
- **Scriptural tradition:** Scripture provides normative content for ordering loves and virtues.
- **Moral apology:** the work functions as a defense of the Church's ethics against slander.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Augustine's psychosomatic anthropology and early formulations of ordered will.
- As a **polemic model** against dualistic systems that excuse moral responsibility.
- As an **exegetical/pastoral template** showing how doctrinal claims shape communal moral teaching and discipline.
