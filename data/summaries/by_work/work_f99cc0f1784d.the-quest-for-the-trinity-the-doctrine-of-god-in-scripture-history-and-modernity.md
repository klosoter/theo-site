### TITLE
The Quest for the Trinity: The Doctrine of God in Scripture, History and Modernity - Stephen R. Holmes

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Anglican/academic theology (late 20th-early 21st century). Written amid renewed interest in classical Trinitarianism, the rise of "social" Trinitarian proposals, and debates over modern biblical criticism and analytic theology.
 - Aimed at scholars and advanced students seeking an integrated account that connects biblical evidence, patristic and medieval dogma, Reformation reception, and modern theological renegotiations.

- **Central thesis**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity must be recovered as a historically rooted, scripturally warranted, and theologically disciplined doctrine; modern critiques and novel proposals often misread either Scripture or the historical formulations and thereby weaken the doctrine's theological integrity and ecclesial function.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of New Testament trinitarian data ( Father, Son, Spirit; baptismal and doxological texts).
 - Historical tracing: patristic formulations (esp. Cappadocians, Athanasius, Augustine), key medieval and Reformation developments, creedal stabilization.
 - Critical engagement with modernity: Enlightenment reductions, Schleiermacher, Barth, Rahner, Moltmann, and analytic/social Trinitarianism.
 - Evaluation of contemporary proposals (including language-use debates) and an argument for fidelity to classical categories while allowing responsible development.
 - Closing move: the doctrine's continuing ecclesial, doxological, and apologetic importance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scriptural witnesses (NT synoptics, Johannine corpus, Pauline and Petrine tradition).
 - Patristic: Cappadocians, Athanasius, Augustine.
 - Medieval and Reformation: Aquinas, Luther, Calvin.
 - Moderns: Schleiermacher, Barth, Rahner, Moltmann, Pannenberg; contemporary analytic and social-Trinitarian voices.
 - Specific engagement with Cornelius Van Til's "One Person" language proposal and its critics (treatment of language that prioritizes divine unity over person-language).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic vs. immanent), person/hypostasis, ousia/substance, perichoresis, divine simplicity, revelation and Scripture, Christology, pneumatology, creedal theology and doxology.

- **Closing line**
 - Holmes insists that a robust Trinitarian doctrine is best preserved by disciplined attention to Scripture and doctrinal history, resisting both reductive modern critiques and ungrounded novelties.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrative method: marries close biblical exegesis with careful historical retrieval and measured engagement with modern philosophical-theological issues.
 - Stresses the ecclesial and liturgical function of creedal language; theology as a practiced grammar, not abstract metaphysics alone.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques naïve forms of social Trinitarianism for risking tritheism and collapsing divine simplicity.
 - Challenges certain modern eliminativist or reductionist readings (e.g., that the Trinity is merely metaphorical, ethical, or sociological).
 - Offers a corrective to proposals like Van Til's "one-person" language by showing how overemphasis on unity can erode genuine trinitarian distinctions and biblical personhood.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Tactical use of historical categories (economic/immanent) as regulative tools rather than dead technicalities.
 - Emphasis on "language practices" - how theological speech functions in worship, doctrine, and apologetics.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in evangelical, Anglican, and Reformed circles for its balance between fidelity to tradition and engagement with modern thought.
 - Frequently used in postgraduate courses as a compact, critical synthesis of trinitarian theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a reliable bridge between Scripture and dogmatic history; a corrective against fashionable but unstable accounts of the Trinity; useful for doctrinal teaching and pastoral catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity** - God's self-revelation and action in history (what God does).
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God is in himself (relations within the Godhead); Holmes treats both as theologically connected but distinct.
- **Hypostasis / Person** - Real distinct centers of relational being in the Godhead; emphasized against modalism and against reductive social models.
- **Ousia / Substance** - Divine unity; the classical language preserving monotheism.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling of Father, Son, Spirit; used to guard against separation or collapse of persons.
- **Divine simplicity** - God's non-composite being; invoked as a check on tritheistic tendencies.
- **Social Trinitarianism** - Contemporary model that reads Trinity in social-relational terms; Holmes critiques its potential to fragment divine unity.
- **One-Person Language (Van Til)** - Proposal stressing language of God's unity to avoid error; Holmes examines its merits and risks, arguing it can underplay biblical plural personhood if pushed too far.
- **Analogy of being / analogical language** - Limits and shape of human speech about God; Holmes stresses historically informed analogical talk.
- **Economic-immanent relation** - The methodological rule connecting revelation and doctrine.
- **Creedal theology** - Use of historic creeds as interpretive and formative guides.
- **Doxological function** - Role of Trinitarian doctrine in worship and ecclesial identity.
- **Scriptural trinitarian data** - Baptismal and benedictory formulae, Johannine and Pauline passages as primary evidence.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise definition-source and historical primer for the doctrine of the Trinity.
 - As a polemical resource against reductionist modern accounts (both eliminativist and certain social-Trinitarian forms).
 - As an exegetical-model exemplar: reading NT trinitarian texts in light of patristic categories.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking doctrinal fidelity, liturgical practice, and contemporary theological engagement.
