### TITLE
The Gospel to the Nations: Perspectives on Paul's Mission - ed. Peter G. Bolt & Mark D. Thompson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Pauline studies within late 20th-early 21st century scholarship; conversation located at the intersection of historical-critical exegesis, missiology, and systematic theology.
 - Responds to熱 debates sparked by the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) and renewed interest in second‑temple Jewish contexts, while addressing ecclesial and missional concerns in Reformed and evangelical settings.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The volume argues that Paul's gospel must be read primarily as a missionary, covenantal announcement to the nations: Paul proclaims Christ as the fulfillment of God's purposes for Israel such that Gentiles are incorporated into the covenant people.
 - The problem tackled is the tendency to read Paul narrowly as a soteriological or forensic theologian apart from his mission and corporate, covenantal concerns.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Collection of essays that together:
 - Reconstruct Paul's missionary strategy and proclamation (kerygma) to Gentile audiences.
 - Reassess key Pauline doctrines (justification, law, covenant, reconciliation) in light of Paul's mission to the nations.
 - Engage primary textual evidence (Pauline letters, Acts, LXX) and Second Temple Jewish background.
 - Major moves:
 - Historical-exegetical re-reading of Pauline texts with attention to audience and purpose.
 - Theological synthesis locating justification, election, and ecclesiology within a missional-covenantal frame.
 - Practical/missiological reflections on how Pauline theology shapes church mission.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Close engagement with Paul himself (esp. Romans, Galatians, 1-2 Corinthians, Acts), the LXX, and Second Temple literature.
 - Scholarly interlocutors include proponents and critics of the NPP (e.g., E. P. Sanders, J. D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright), as well as classic Protestant interpreters.
 - Missiological voices and Reformed systematicians feature in cross-disciplinary dialogue.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, justification, law and "works of the law", Christology (reconciling and covenantal roles of Christ), ecclesiology (Jew-Gentile unity; the church as eschatological people), revelation and scriptural interpretation, mission and apostolic authority.

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers a **covenantal-missional reading of Paul**: the gospel is God's action in Christ to gather the nations into the covenant people, and this missional logic must reshape doctrinal formulations of justification, law, and church identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes Paul's identity as a missionary theologian rather than treating mission as an application of doctrines developed elsewhere.
 - Integrates exegetical detail with missiological and covenantal theology, yielding a synthetic reading useful for both scholars and practitioners.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Balances the NPP's corrective on first‑century Judaism by insisting on the theological centrality of Christ and justification for Gentile inclusion - neither discarding NPP insights nor reducing Paul to anti‑Jewish polemic.
 - Pushes back against reductive forensic readings that abstract justification from communal and covenantal realities.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "the nations" (ethne) as central hermeneutical key for Paul rather than a peripheral sociological detail.
 - Emphasizes corporate and covenantal dimensions of terms often read individualistically (e.g., justification, reconciliation).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but steady influence in Reformed and evangelical circles as a resource linking Pauline exegesis and mission theology.
 - Adopted in seminary courses on Paul, mission, and covenant; cited in subsequent works that treat Paul's missionary agenda.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for interdisciplinary studies uniting exegesis, theology, and mission.
 - Useful corrective to specialists who isolate doctrine from apostolic praxis; valuable for teaching Pauline theology in missional contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel (euaggelion)** - Proclaimed news of Christ's person and work that effects inclusion of the nations; not merely individual salvation but corporate covenant entry.
- **Nations (ethne)** - Primary audience motif; theological category denoting Gentile peoples being grafted into God's people.
- **Mission (apostolic kerygma)** - Paul's vocation and method; shapes theological priorities rather than being derivative.
- **Covenant/covenantal nomism** - Framework for understanding continuity between God's promises to Israel and the inclusion of Gentiles.
- **Justification (dikaiosis/dikaiosune)** - Reinterpreted with corporate and covenantal emphases; forensic language situated in community‑forming context.
- **Law (nomos / "works of the law")** - Read in light of boundary markers and covenant identity, not simply moral code; central to Jew-Gentile relations.
- **Reconciliation** - Cosmic and communal restoration in Christ that unites formerly estranged peoples into one people of God.
- **Ekklesia (church)** - The eschatological covenant community transcending ethnic divisions; primary locus of mission and identity.
- **Second Temple background** - Contextual studies that inform Paul's language and polemics; used to temper anachronistic readings.
- **Kerygmatic theology** - Approach treating proclamation as formative for doctrinal content; doctrine emerges from apostolic preaching.
- **Inclusion/union with Christ** - Concept that links individual participation to corporate incorporation into covenantal people.
- **Justification by faith / obedience of faith** - Tension explored to preserve both Pauline stress on faith and call to covenantal obedience.
- **Scriptural interpretation (midrashic/LXX usage)** - Shows Paul's dependent use of Scripture to ground mission claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a covenantal-missional reading of Paul in courses and lectures.
 - As a **polemic resource** or corrective in debates over the New Perspective, tempering extremes on both sides.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline mission passages (Acts, Romans, Galatians) with theological and missional sensitivity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in integrating systematic theology (covenant, justification) with practical missiology and ecclesiology.
