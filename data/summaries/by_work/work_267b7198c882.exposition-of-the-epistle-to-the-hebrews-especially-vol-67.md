### TITLE
**John Owen - Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews (esp. Vols. 6-7)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑17th century English Puritan and Reformed context; Owen (1616-1683) wrote while a leading Puritan theologian and chaplain to the Commonwealth.
 - The commentary emerges from intensive pastoral-exegetical work in a confessional era marked by debates over sacerdotalism, covenant theology, and Antinomianism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Hebrews demonstrates Christ as the singular, superior Priest and Mediator inaugurating a better covenant; Owen insists this superiority secures final, efficacious atonement, true sanctification, and persevering faith.
 - A recurring doctrinal focus in Vols. 6-7: the nature of the Mosaic covenant in relation to the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace - notably his treatment of the Mosaic covenant "as to substance."
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Verse‑by‑verse, exegetical theology moving through Hebrews' major movements:
 - Superiority of Christ to angels and Moses (earlier vols summarized).
 - **Vols. 6-7**: concentrated exposition of Hebrews 7-10: Melchizedek, Christ's priesthood, the inefficacy of Levitical sacrifices, the once-for-all sacrifice, and the inauguration of the New Covenant.
 - Practical exhortations, faith and perseverance, warnings against apostasy (later chapters treated elsewhere in the series).
 - Major theological moves:
 - Demonstrate typology: Melchizedek as prefiguring Christ's eternal priesthood.
 - Establish legal‑forensic arguments: the Levitical system could not perfect conscience; Christ's sacrifice does.
 - Covenant analysis: locate Mosaic law within the covenants schema, distinguishing ceremonial/moral elements and assessing the Mosaic covenant "as to substance" relative to the Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Hebrews text against Roman Catholic priestly claims, Socinian denials of atonement, and dissenting Protestant readings.
 - Dialogues with Reformed predecessors (Calvinate exegesis), Jewish typological readings, and contemporary Puritan theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Covenant of Works, Covenant of Grace), Christology (mediatorial office, eternal priesthood), atonement (satisfaction/propitiation), typology, law‑grace distinction, soteriology (justification, sanctification, perseverance).
- **Closing line**
 - Owen's Hebrews centers on Christ's unique priesthood and sacrifice as the covenantal pivot that both fulfills and supersedes Mosaic mediation, securing an efficacious covenant of grace grounded in substitutionary atonement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Rigorous covenantal reading of Hebrews: Owen reads priesthood and sacrifice through a systematic covenantal lens, insisting on careful distinctions between covenants while allowing for nuanced overlap (e.g., Mosaic features that resemble a works principle).
 - Pastoral‑polemic method: dense doctrinal argumentation coupled with application to perseverance and holiness.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters Roman Catholic sacerdotal continuities by denying any perpetuation of Levitical efficacy in Christ's era.
 - Opposes Socinian moralistic readings that minimize substitutionary atonement; affirms objective satisfaction.
 - Clarifies contemporary Puritan disputes by distinguishing the Mosaic covenant's legal demands from the Covenant of Grace's saving promise.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Use of the phrase and category "as to substance" to describe the Mosaic covenant's alignment with the Covenant of Works in certain respects - a careful, technical qualification rather than a wholesale identification.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed covenant theology, cited by later Puritans and theologians (e.g., Edwards, later English and Dutch Reformed scholars).
 - Served as an exegetical and doctrinal standard for interpreting Hebrews within covenantal systems.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies disciplined Puritan exegesis married to systematic theology; remains a model for covenantal interpretation, typological analysis, and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Owen's reference to the original Adamic covenant; he also assesses whether Mosaic law carries a works‑principle "as to substance."
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The redemptive covenant fulfilled in Christ; Owen reads Hebrews as unveiling this covenant's superiority.
- **"As to substance"**
 - Technical qualifier Owen uses to say the Mosaic covenant, in some legal respects, resembles a works covenant without replacing or nullifying the Covenant of Grace.
- **Mediator / Mediation**
 - Christ as sole mediator, combining priesthood and kingship; decisive theme in Vols. 6-7.
- **Melchizedek**
 - Typological key: prefigures Christ's unique, eternal, non‑Aaronic priesthood.
- **Priesthood (Levitical vs. Christ's)**
 - Contrast of temporary, repetitive sacrifices with Christ's once‑for‑all efficacious sacrifice.
- **Sacrifice / Satisfaction / Propitiation**
 - Central soteriological vocabulary Owen defends as objective and efficacious in Hebrews' framework.
- **Typology**
 - Method: Old Testament persons and rites as real but temporary shadows fulfilled in Christ.
- **Law: ceremonial / moral distinction**
 - Owen distinguishes ceremonial ordinances from moral law while noting the Mosaic covenant's composite character.
- **Perseverance and apostasy**
 - Practical soteriology: Hebrews interpreted to require true perseverance; warnings are real, not mere hypothetical.
- **Conscience / perfecting of conscience**
 - Key forensic argument: Levitical sacrifices could not perfect conscience; Christ's sacrifice does.
- **Better covenant / better sacrifice**
 - Recurrent Hebraic motif employed systematically by Owen to argue Christ's preeminence.
- **Exegetical‑pastoral synthesis**
 - Owen's method: close exegesis that issues in doctrinal clarity and pastoral exhortation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source in Reformed covenant theology (esp. nuanced statements about Mosaic covenant).
- As polemic against Roman Catholic sacerdotal claims and Socinian denials of substitution.
- As an exegetical model for Hebrews: typology, priesthood, and covenantal interpretation.
- As a conceptual pivot in debates about the relation between law and gospel, and the status of Mosaic ordinances.
