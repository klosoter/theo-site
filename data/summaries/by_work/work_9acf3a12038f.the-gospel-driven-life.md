### TITLE
The Gospel-Driven Life - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within early 21st-century conservative Reformed evangelicalism; pastoral-theological response to moralism, therapeutic Christianity, and consumer-driven church culture.
 - Situated in ongoing Reformed recovery movements emphasizing Christocentric preaching, catechesis, and covenantal ecclesiology.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Christian life must be shaped and sustained by the full gospel (justification and union with Christ), not by moral effort or merely initial conversion; the gospel is the motive, means, and power of sanctification and ecclesial formation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern Christianity often severs justification from sanctification or reduces the gospel to moral instruction or self-help.
 - Theological correction: return to classic Reformed doctrines - justification by faith, union with Christ, imputation, covenant - as the theological grammar for Christian living.
 - Practical outworking: gospel-driven preaching, catechesis, means-of-grace-centered pastoral ministry, and church life that forms believers into the image of Christ.
 - Final exhortation: holiness flows from received righteousness; the Spirit applies Christ to daily life by Word and sacrament.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Reformers (especially Calvin), classical Reformed theology, and contemporary Reformed voices; critiques popular evangelical trends and therapeutic/pietistic emphases.
 - Engages pastoral writers and critics of moralism; converses implicitly with proponents of seeker-sensitive and performance-based discipleship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (central), sanctification, union with Christ, imputation (double imputation), adoption, covenant theology, means of grace (Word and sacraments), ecclesiology (church and kingdom), repentance, assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - The gospel is not merely the entry ticket to Christianity but the ongoing power and pattern of everything the church is and does: Christ received, Christ lived.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the gospel as the comprehensive framework for both forensic justification and progressive sanctification; continually stresses **union with Christ** as the operative mystery enabling holy living.
 - Moves beyond a two-stage gospel (conversion versus sanctification) to an integrated dynamic where justification fuels obedience.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects **moralism** (faith as ethical effort) and **therapeutic Christianity** (gospel as self-improvement) by re-centering grace and imputed righteousness.
 - Pushes back on forms of pietism that privatize sanctification apart from the church's covenantal means.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the phrase **"gospel-driven"** as a pastoral programmatic term: not novel doctrinally but a concise conceptual pivot for ministry strategy.
 - Recasts pastoral practice as gospel-shaped formation rather than performance-based discipleship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a practical theology resource for pastors, small groups, and laity.
 - Influential in renewing emphasis on preaching Christ, catechesis, and sacramental formation within confessional churches.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear bridge between systematic doctrine and pastoral practice; useful for clergy formation, sermon shape, and congregational discipleship programs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel**
 - Not merely news of forgiveness at conversion; the ongoing proclamation and application of Christ (forensic and relational) that empowers sanctification.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration of righteousness by faith; foundational for identity and assurance; prevents legalism and antinomianism.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The union is the primary locus of sanctification and communion; believers live by virtue of being "in Christ."

- **Imputation (double imputation)**
 - Christ's righteousness imputed to believers; believers' sin imputed to Christ - doctrinal engine of assurance and gratitude-driven obedience.

- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive life shaped by the Spirit through the Word and sacraments; fruit of union, not merely human effort.

- **Means of grace**
 - Word, preaching, and sacraments as God-ordained instruments whereby the gospel is applied to believers.

- **Covenant / Church**
 - Church as covenant community where gospel identity and formation occur; ecclesiology tied to kingdom presence and witness.

- **Kingdom (Church and Kingdom)**
 - Presents the kingdom as already/not-yet reality mediated by the church's gospel ministry; the church embodies and proclaims kingdom realities.

- **Repentance**
 - Continuous gospel response, rooted in justification and sustained by grace - not merely moral reform.

- **Assurance**
 - Gospel-based confidence grounded in Christ's work and promises, not introspection or performance.

- **Holiness as gratitude**
 - Obedience flows from grateful reception of grace, reframing ethics as response rather than means.

- **Pastoral catechesis**
 - Use of doctrinal teaching (catechesis) to form Gospel-shaped believers in corporate contexts.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the term "gospel-driven" and for articulating gospel as both justification and sanctification.
- As a **polemic** against moralistic, therapeutic, or performance-based forms of Christianity.
- As a **pastoral/discipleship model** emphasizing preaching, catechesis, and means-of-grace ministry for church and kingdom formation.
