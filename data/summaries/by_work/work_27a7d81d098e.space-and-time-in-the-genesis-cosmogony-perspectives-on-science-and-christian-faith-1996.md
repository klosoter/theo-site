### TITLE
Space and Time in the Genesis Cosmogony (Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, 1996) - Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1996 amid intensified evangelical debates on how Genesis 1 relates to modern cosmology and geology.
 - Kline writes from a Reformed, covenantal-O.T. exegetical perspective, addressing both pastoral and scholarly audiences engaged in the science‑and‑scripture conversation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1 presents a theological-cosmological ordering of **space and time** (functional and covenantal categories) rather than a scientific, material chronology. The account inaugurates ordered realms for divine habitation and covenantal life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Kline distinguishes **ontology (what things are for)** from **chronology (when material things came into being)**; Genesis emphasizes the former.
 - He reads the six days and the Sabbath as **inaugurative acts**: God assigns functions, boundaries and roles to created domains (heaven/firmament, seas, dry land, luminaries, living creatures, humans) culminating in divine rest/enthronement.
 - Space and time are treated as theological categories instituted by God to structure covenantal life (temple motif): creation functions as God's cosmic sanctuary.
 - From this, Kline argues against simple concordism (reading Genesis as modern scientific narrative) and against reducing the text to mere primitive cosmology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the ancient Near Eastern cosmogonies (e.g., Enuma Elish) as cultural contrasts.
 - Interacts with modern scientific cosmology implicitly (Big Bang, geology) and explicitly with contemporary concordist and literalist readings current in evangelical discourse.
 - Dialogues with exegetical precedents emphasizing literary/functional readings of Genesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (nature and purpose of biblical cosmology).
 - Covenant theology (creation as covenantal ordering).
 - Sabbath theology (rest as enthronement; soteriological and cultic significance).
 - Indirectly implicates theology of God's kingship and temple/Tabernacle typology.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Genesis 1 primarily reveals God as sovereign king who ordains space and time to be the functional, covenantal theater of his presence and rule - the text is theological inauguration, not scientific reportage.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that Genesis 1 is a functional/inaugurative cosmogony: creation is about **assignment of roles and boundaries**, not stepwise material formation described in scientific terms.
 - Clear linking of the **Sabbath/rest** motif to divine enthronement and the completion of covenantal ordering.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges literalist/concordist interpreters who read Genesis as competing scientific cosmology; also resists simplistic "myth vs. history" dismissals by affirming historical divine action without demanding modern scientific categories.
 - Corrects readings that treat the days as merely poetic scaffolding by providing a theological account for their structure and function.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **space-time** as theological categories (not merely physical descriptors) instituted by God.
 - Emphasizes **functional ontology** and **cosmic temple** as hermeneutical keys for Genesis cosmogony.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and conservative academic circles as a robust non-concordist model; frequently cited in debates over the interpretation of Days of Creation and the role of Genesis in the science-scripture interface.
 - Provoked critique from strict young-earth literalists and from scholars insisting on more historically descriptive readings.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical model linking Genesis 1 to Sabbath and covenant theology; valuable for pastors, theologians, and students navigating theology-of-creation issues in dialogue with science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cosmogony** - Genesis 1 as an account of ordering and assignment, not as modern physical cosmogony.
- **Space and Time** - Treated as divinely instituted frameworks for covenantal life; theological categories rather than neutral scientific abstractions.
- **Functional ontology** - The approach that Scripture describes what created things are for (their roles/functions) more than how materially they came into being.
- **Inauguration / inaugural acts** - The six days as acts that establish roles, boundaries, and liturgical order in creation.
- **Cosmic temple / divine habitation** - Creation as the sanctuary where God dwells and rules; Sabbath as temple consecration and enthronement.
- **Sabbath / divine rest** - Not merely cessation but the consummation of ordering and the ratification of God's kingship.
- **Concordism** - The interpretive posture Kline critiques: mapping Genesis day-by-day onto modern scientific chronology.
- **Framework hypothesis (contrastive use)** - Related interpretive model that sees days as a literary framework; Kline shares affinities but emphasizes covenantal/temple function more strongly.
- **Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) cosmogonies** - Used as a foil: Israelite cosmogony differs by theological purpose (temple/kingdom emphasis) rather than mythic struggle.
- **Ontology vs. chronology** - Key hermeneutical distinction: Genesis prioritizes ontological/function over temporal sequence.
- **Enthronement motif** - God's rest as enthronement; connecting creation to kingship motifs of ANE and Scripture.
- **Assignment of boundaries** - God's delimitation of heavens/earth, day/night, sea/land as formative acts.
- **Divine kingship** - Underlying theological reality what the cosmogony serves to display.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Exegetical model: frequently cited as a robust non-concordist reading of Genesis 1 for biblical theology courses.
 - Polemic/clarification: used to rebut simplistic literalist and concordist claims and to reframe science-and-scripture discussions around covenantal ordering rather than scientific reconciliation.
