### TITLE
**Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (essay in The Law is Not of Faith)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed discussion; situated in post-Conservative Resurgence debates and reactions to the Federal Vision controversies. Gaffin writes from an orthodox, confessional Reformed perspective emphasizing classical Pauline soteriology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Union with Christ is the primary explanatory principle for covenantal salvation; covenant categories must be interpreted in light of the believer's real, objective union with the risen, covenantal Head.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Surveys biblical data (especially Pauline) to locate salvation benefits in union with Christ rather than in purely juridical or exclusively covenantal-administrative categories.
 - Argues that the Covenant of Redemption provides the ontological ground for the Covenant of Grace, but the believer's access to covenant benefits is mediated by union with the Messiah.
 - Defends classic Reformed distinctions (forensic imputation, representative headship) while integrating them with an organic, ontological notion of union - i.e., believers are truly joined to Christ so that his obedience, death, resurrection, and life are theirs.
 - Critiques positions that collapse distinctions between covenants (Monocovenantalism/Federal Vision tendencies) or that reduce covenant to mere legal code without grounding in personal union.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Pauline corpus and Reformed confessions as primary sources.
 - Engages contemporary interlocutors including proponents of Federal Vision / monocovenantal approaches and recent union-with-Christ scholarship.
 - Dialogues implicitly with historic covenant theologians (Covenant of Redemption schema) and with those who overemphasize either forensic or ethical aspects of covenant.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (Covenant of Redemption/Grace), union with Christ (Christology and soteriology), justification (imputation), sanctification, adoption, ecclesiology (covenantal status), revelation and Scripture as witness to union.
- **Closing line:** Gaffin locates the center of covenantal soteriology in the believer's real union with Christ - the union that makes covenant promises present realities and secures justification, sanctification, and final salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **union with Christ** as the theological lens through which covenantal promises and legal/forensic categories must be read.
 - Seeks synthesis between **objective** (Christ's accomplished work) and **subjective/real** (personal union) dimensions of salvation without collapsing either.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Federal Vision/monocovenantal tendencies that, in Gaffin's view, blur important covenant distinctions and risk conflating covenantal standing with guaranteed salvific perseverance apart from union-based appropriation.
 - Pushes back against treatments that make covenant primarily an external, administrative structure rather than an existential union in Christ.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced deployment of classic terms (imputation, representation) within an integrated "unional" framework; not novel coinage but ecumenical re-weighting of categories.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Esteemed among conservative Reformed scholars and pastors as a corrective to both legalistic and purely sociological readings of covenant.
 - Frequently cited in debates over Federal Vision and in contemporary studies of Pauline union theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies how covenantal schemas (including Covenant of Redemption) and Pauline union-truths cohere.
 - Serves as a concise pedagogical resource for linking confessionally Reformed covenant theology to New Testament soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** The believer's real, ontological participation in Christ - the central category for appropriating covenant benefits.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** The intra-Trinitarian agreement securing the Messiah's work; for Gaffin, the ontological ground of Covenant of Grace.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The historical administration of salvation promises; to be read and realized through union with Christ.
- **Federal Vision / Monocovenantalism:** Contemporary interlocutor; Gaffin critiques tendencies to collapse covenantal distinctions and overlocate salvation in covenantal administration rather than union.
- **Imputation:** Forensic transfer of Christ's obedience/active righteousness to believers; maintained but articulated within a unional framework.
- **Representative headship:** Christ as federal head whose acts are legally and existentially reckoned to his people through union.
- **Objective vs. subjective realities:** Objective - Christ's accomplished work; Subjective - believer's appropriation via union; Gaffin insists both are real and related.
- **Justification:** Declared righteousness grounded in Christ's work and received in union; not merely a covenantal status nor merely an ethical consequence.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive outworking of the union; distinguishes causal priority (union grounds sanctification) without collapsing the orders.
- **Covenant signs (circumcision / baptism):** Administrative marks that point to union and membership, but cannot replace or guarantee actual union.
- **Forensic/ethical distinction:** Maintains forensic imputation while integrating ethical unional transformation.
- **Ecclesial participation:** Corporate dimension of covenant membership is affirmed but conditioned by real union with Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for a confessional, union-centered Reformed soteriology.
- As a **polemic** against Federal Vision/monocovenantal readings that underplay union or forensic categories.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians) through the union-with-Christ motif.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Covenant of Redemption theology to pastoral assurance, sacraments, and covenantal administration.
