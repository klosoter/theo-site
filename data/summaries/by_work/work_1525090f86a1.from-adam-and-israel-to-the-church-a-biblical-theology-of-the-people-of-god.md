### TITLE
From Adam and Israel to the Church: A Biblical Theology of the People of God - Benjamin L. Gladd

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed biblical theology conversation (early 21st century).
 - Situated amid debates about covenant continuity/discontinuity, the relation of Israel and the church, and canonical/typological reading strategies.
 - Dialogues with both classical Reformed covenantalism and recent "progressive covenantalism" and canonical approaches.

- **Central thesis**
 - Gladd argues for a canonical, redemptive-historical progression in which the identity of the people of God is traced from Adam through corporate Israel to the church: Israel is the elect corporate vehicle in redemptive history, and the church is the inclusion of those who belong to Christ (Jew and Gentile) within that ongoing covenantal people.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lays a narrative-canonical framework: creation (Adam) -> election and covenant with Israel -> fulfillment in Christ -> expansion to the church.
 - Emphasizes **corporate representative headship** (Adam/Christ; Israel/Christ) as the mechanism for inclusion and exclusion in the people of God.
 - Readings of key OT promises and institutions (land, seed, temple, election) as typological anticipations fulfilled in Christ and embodied in the church.
 - Addresses the theological problem of continuity vs. discontinuity: continuity in covenantal promises and representative structures; discontinuity in the form and composition of the covenant people post-Christ.
 - Applies canonical and typological hermeneutics to defend a non-supersessionist but non-separatist account: the church participates in Israel's covenantal inheritance through Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages canonical and redemptive-historical interpreters; interacts implicitly and explicitly with modern covenant theologians, progressive covenantalists, and critics of supersessionism.
 - Draws on OT and NT canonical readings, classical Reformed categories (federal headship, covenant), and recent scholarly work on Israel-church relations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant(s) (Adamic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)
 - Ecclesiology (people of God, boundary markers)
 - Christology (representative headship, fulfillment)
 - Soteriology (corporate election, inclusion of Gentiles)
 - Canonical hermeneutics, typology, covenantal theology

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The people of God are best understood as a single, covenanted community traced corporately from Adam to Israel to the church, with Christ as the decisive representative who fulfills Israel's role and extends covenant membership to all who belong to him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses canonical unity and narrative progression over atomized proof-texting; the identity of the people of God is primarily corporate and covenantal, not merely ethnic or institutional.
 - Carefully balances **continuity of covenant promises** with **discontinuity of covenant administration** after Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters strong supersessionist claims that erase Israel's ongoing theological significance; also resists radical bifurcation that treats Israel and the church as wholly separate covenants.
 - Offers a corrective to overly individualistic soteriologies by recovering corporate representative dynamics in salvation history.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces and clarifies the use of "people of God" as a canonical category moving through redemptive epochs rather than static designation.
 - Refines typological language to emphasize covenantal fulfillment rather than mere correspondence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles seeking a robust canonical-covenantal ecclesiology.
 - Cited in discussions on Israel and church relations and used as a resource in biblical-theological syllabi.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined canonical-typological method for connecting OT institutions to NT fulfillment.
 - Helpful for pastors and scholars needing a theologically balanced account of covenantal continuity with pastoral and ecclesial implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **People of God** - Central canonical category traced from Adam to Israel to the church; corporate identity marker.
- **Representative headship** - Adam/Christ and Israel/Christ frameworks explaining corporate inclusion and exclusion.
- **Adamic covenant / Adam as representative** - Foundational corporate structure initiating the people-of-God motif.
- **Israel as covenant vehicle** - Israel is the chosen corporate bearer of covenant promises and typological institutions.
- **Typology / fulfillment** - OT persons, places, and institutions anticipate their fulfillment in Christ and the church.
- **Covenant continuity / discontinuity** - Continuity in promises and representative structures; discontinuity in covenant administration and composition post-Christ.
- **Canonical theology** - Reading Scripture as a unified narrative that shapes theological categories.
- **New Covenant** - The decisive covenantal fulfillment that incorporates Gentiles into the people of God through Christ.
- **Corporate election** - Election conceived in corporate, covenantal terms rather than solely individual mechanics.
- **Grafting / inclusion of Gentiles** - Not mere addition but incorporation into the one covenant people through Christ.
- **Ecclesial boundary markers** - How the church is identified as the people of God (faith in Christ, baptism, covenant participation).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a canonical-covenantal account of the people of God in systematic and biblical theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for typological and narrative reading that connects OT institutions to NT ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against crude supersessionism and against models that sever Israel and the church entirely.
