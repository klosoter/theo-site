### TITLE
Jesus Remembered (Christianity in the Making, Vol. 1) - James D. G. Dunn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid the "third quest" for the historical Jesus and ongoing debates of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP).
 - Dunn writes as a leading New Testament scholar attentive to Jewish context, oral tradition, and early Christian confession; addresses both historical Jesus research and origins of early Christology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Early Christian faith and theology must be understood as the product of communal memory: the ways early communities remembered, shaped, and transmitted recollections of Jesus (words, deeds, passion, resurrection) produced the earliest Christological and kerygmatic forms.
 - The question: How did memory, social context, and early proclamation form the figure of Jesus and the emergence of high Christology?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Establishes methodological framework - social memory studies applied to earliest Christian tradition; critiques purely literary or skepticism-driven reconstructions.
 - Part II: Traces the content and forms of early remembrance - sayings, stories, creeds, hymns, and the kerygma - showing layered development but strong continuity with Palestinian Jesus.
 - Part III: Considers how remembrance generated early Christology - the titles, Lordship, suffering-servant, prophetic and apocalyptic aspects, and resurrection as focal memory-event.
 - Major moves:
 - Rehabilitate oral tradition as structured, communal, and reliable within parameters.
 - Situate Jesus within first-century Palestinian Judaism and apocalyptic expectation.
 - Demonstrate that high Christological confession (e.g., "Jesus is Lord") arises very early as retrospective communal interpretation of memory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages with Bultmannian skepticism, E. P. Sanders and the NPP, contemporary historical-Jesus scholars of the "third quest," and memory-theory scholars (e.g., Halbwachs implicitly).
 - Uses the Synoptic Gospels, Pauline letters (esp. early creedal material), and other early Christian witnesses as primary evidence.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (origin and early development), resurrection, kerygma/mission, revelation in memory, relation of Jesus to Israel (covenant continuity), and early ecclesiology (confessional identity).
- **Closing line**
 - The shape of Christian doctrine is rooted in the communal act of remembering Jesus: memory is both the hermeneutical key and the theological engine that produces early Christology and kerygma.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Puts "collective memory" at the center of origins: memory is constructive yet constrained and is a legitimate historical category for reconstructing early Christianity.
 - Affirms significant continuity between the historical Jesus and the earliest proclamations rather than radical discontinuity.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters Bultmann-style demythologizing and excessive skepticism that reduces early traditions to later theological invention.
 - Contrasts with approaches that posit late, purely Hellenistic Christological innovation by arguing for Palestinian-Jewish roots.
 - Offers a middle path relative to Bauckham's extreme emphasis on eyewitness testimony: memory-based communal transmission rather than exclusive dependence on named eyewitnesses.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of social memory theory to Gospel and creedal material; treats kerygma as remembered proclamation shaped by liturgical and catechetical practice.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in historical-Jesus and early Christology studies; shaped subsequent work deploying memory theory.
 - Adopted by many scholars in the NPP orbit and those seeking to bridge historical-critical and theological concerns; critiqued by proponents of stronger eyewitness claims or by those skeptical of oral reliability.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a workable methodology for linking historical Jesus research with origins of Christian doctrine; valuable for exegetes, historians, and theologians interested in the social formation of belief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Collective/social memory** - communal processes by which groups retain, shape, and transmit past events; central explanatory category for tradition formation.
- **Kerygma** - early proclamation; here treated as shaped by memory and formative for Christological claims.
- **Pre-Pauline tradition / creeds** - early confessional formulas that predate and inform Paul; evidence for early high Christology.
- **Oral tradition** - not chaotic transmission but structured, communal, and rule-governed; a primary carrier of Jesus-material.
- **Christology from below** - development of Christological understanding beginning with remembered Jesus rather than theological a priori.
- **"Jesus remembered" paradigm** - shorthand for Dunn's approach: memory as formative, interpretive, and foundational.
- **Lord (kyrios) and resurrection** - titles and events that function as focal memories around which early confession crystallizes.
- **Palestinian Judaism / apocalyptic context** - background setting for Jesus and initial remembrance; continuity rather than rupture with Israel.
- **Kerygmatic plausibility** - the fit between early proclamation and its Palestinian-Jewish origins; helps test historicity.
- **Oral-liturgy nexus** - how worship and memory mutually reinforce forms of tradition.
- **Third quest engagement** - places Dunn within the broad movement emphasizing social, Jewish contexts and methodological pluralism.
- **Critique of radical skepticism** - argues for measured confidence in early transmitted material.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological source** for applying social-memory theory to New Testament studies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for tracing the transmission and function of creeds and sayings in forming early Christology.
 - As a **polemic** against both extreme skepticism about tradition and against accounts that detach early Christian belief from its Jewish matrix.
