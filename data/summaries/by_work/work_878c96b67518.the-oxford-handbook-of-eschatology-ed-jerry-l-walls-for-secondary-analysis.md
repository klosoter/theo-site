### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology (ed. Jerry L. Walls) - focused secondary analysis: **Eschatological Anthropology** in the thought of Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Oxford Handbooks series (early 21st c. scholarly moment; editor Jerry L. Walls). Interdisciplinary, largely Anglo-American analytic and historical engagement with eschatology. Aims to retrieve eschatology for systematic, biblical, philosophical, and ethical theology.
 - This note treats the Handbook as a secondary resource informing a study of **Thomistic eschatological anthropology**: how Aquinas conceives human personhood, death, intermediate state, resurrection, and final destiny within medieval metaphysics refracted through contemporary debates.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How should Christian anthropology understand personal continuity and ultimate human destiny: bodily resurrection and beatific vision vs. disembodied immortality or purely psychological survival? The Handbook frames this as both philosophical problem (personal identity, survival) and theological/doctrinal problem (resurrection, judgment, new creation).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Handbook organization: philosophical analyses of identity and immortality; biblical exegesis on resurrection texts; systematic proposals for judgment/kingdom; ethical implications for present life.
 - When read for Thomistic anthropology, major moves are:
 - Establish Aquinas's **hylomorphic** anthropology (soul as form of body) and consequent rejection of simple dualistic immortality.
 - Place the soul's natural desire for immortality within beatific teleology (final union with God) rather than self-preserving soul-substance.
 - Reconstruct continuity of personal identity through resurrection (reconstitution of embodied, individuated human persons) and the role of particular judgment/practices that correlate present moral life with eschatological state.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary medieval interlocutor: St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa theologiae, Quaestiones disputatae on the soul, De anima).
 - Comparative sources: Augustine, late antique continuities, medieval Scholastics.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: philosophers of personal identity (Parfit, van Inwagen), analytic theologians, biblical scholars on Pauline and Johannine resurrection texts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (soul/body hylomorphism), resurrection of the body, immortality, beatific vision, particular and final judgment, heaven/hell, intermediate state, eschatological ethics, Christology (as basis for resurrection), and eschatological teleology for creation/new creation.

- **Closing line**
 - The Handbook, read against Aquinas, presses a **Thomistic center of gravity**: true human destiny is bodily, relational, and participatory-immortality is realized in the resurrection and beatific vision, not in disembodied persistence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The Handbook emphasizes rigorous engagement between **philosophy of personal identity** and classical doctrinal claims, making Aquinas's hylomorphism a resource against simplistic dualism.
 - Stresses ethical implications: eschatology shapes moral anthropology and social practice (how present actions form the resurrected person).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters modern individualist or "soulish immortality" readings: Aquinas reads immortality teleologically (destiny-in-God) rather than as mere persistence of isolated soul-substance.
 - Contrasts with some modern theologians who privatize eschatology (focus on inner afterlife) by reasserting bodily and communal dimensions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrative use of analytic identity-talk (psychological vs. bodily continuity) to clarify medieval categories like substantial form, individuation, and identity through death and resurrection.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in contemporary systematic and philosophical theology as a corrective to dualistic eschatologies; employed in ecumenical and Reformed conversations to recover bodily resurrection and beatific teleology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching eschatology as interdisciplinary: links historical theology (Aquinas) with current debates in metaphysics, ethics, and biblical studies; models how doctrine and analytic philosophy can mutually inform.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hylomorphism** - Aquinas's view that human persons are a composite of soul (form) and body (matter); central to rejecting simple soul-survival accounts.
- **Substantial form** - The soul as the organizing principle of the living body; grounds personal identity prior to and after death.
- **Resurrection of the body** - Final, bodily re-creation/continuation of the person; the Handbook highlights this as theologically normative over disembodied survival.
- **Beatific vision** - Direct, final union with God; the telos that gives meaning to immortality for Aquinas.
- **Intermediate state** - The condition between death and final resurrection; treated as real but not ultimate, preserving moral and personal continuity pending resurrection.
- **Particular judgment** - Immediate judgment at death affecting the soul's intermediate state; linked to meritorious dispositions that shape resurrected existence.
- **Personal identity (continuity vs. psychological)** - Analytic categories applied to Aquinas to show identity through substantial form and eventual bodily continuity.
 - Contrast: psychological continuity models (memory, consciousness) vs. Thomistic form/body continuity.
- **Immortality** - Not mere cessationlessness but participation in God's life via beatific vision and restored embodied life.
- **Eschatological teleology** - Purpose-driven anthropology: present life ordered toward final union; eschatology as formative for moral agency.
- **New creation** - Cosmic restoration and transformation of matter; eschatology extends beyond individual soul to creation's destiny.
- **Particular uses in loci**
 - Definition source: authoritative historic theological model for arguing against dualist afterlife models.
 - Exegetical model: guides reading of Pauline resurrection texts toward bodily and communal readings.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in philosophical theology to translate medieval categories into contemporary debates on personal identity and survival.
 - Polemic: resource in apologetics against secular/transhumanist visions that sever resurrection from embodied continuity.
