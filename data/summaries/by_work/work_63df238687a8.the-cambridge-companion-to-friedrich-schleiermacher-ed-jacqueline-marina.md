### TITLE
The Cambridge Companion to Friedrich Schleiermacher, ed. Jacqueline Mariña (Cambridge University Press, 2005). Edited volume of contemporary essays surveying Schleiermacher's theology, method, historical context, and reception.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Turn of the 19th century German theological culture: post-Kantian critical philosophy, Romanticism, reaction to rationalist Enlightenment and confessional orthodoxy. Schleiermacher (1768-1834) writes amid Prussian university reform and rising historical-critical scholarship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Schleiermacher relocates theology from metaphysical proof-structures to the description and articulation of *religion as feeling* - the immediate consciousness of absolute dependence - thereby redefining revelation, dogma, and soteriology as expressions of religious self-consciousness.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Critique of both Enlightenment rationalism (natural theology as insufficient) and rigid dogmatism (church formulae as frozen).
 - Theology as description of the religious life: systematic theology must interpret the structure of religious experience (feeling, intuition, and productive self-consciousness).
 - Recasting doctrines (God, Trinity, Christ, sin, redemption) as correlates and idealizations of the religious consciousness rather than metaphysical primitives.
 - Emphasis on the historical mediation of Christian revelation through Christ and the church while retaining a formalist account of dogma as normative expression.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Kant, Herder, Jacobi, Fichte, Schleiermacher's opponents in orthodox Lutheran and Reformed circles; later interlocutors include Hegel, 19th-20th century liberal theology and modern systematic theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - God and divine attributes, revelation, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, ethics, hermeneutics, and aesthetics of religion.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's theological center of gravity: theology as the disciplined articulation of the communal and individual consciousness of dependence on the Absolute, converting doctrinal language into descriptions and norms of religious feeling.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology grounded in *Gefuhl* (feeling) - a psychological/phenomenological starting point uncommon in prior dogmatics.
 - Correlation method: doctrines correlate to conditions of religious self-consciousness and cultural-historical mediation.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Retracts confidence in metaphysical proofs of God (Kantian influence) while resisting the privatizing excesses of pietism; seeks a mediating position between rational proof and pietistic experientialism.
 - Challenges traditional Calvinist/augustinian accounts (e.g., total depravity) by reframing sin as distortion of religious feeling rather than total ontological corruption.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasting "revelation" as both historical (Christ-event) and immediate (religious intuition); dogma as normative linguistic form for experienced truth.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for modern liberal Protestant theology, historical-critical hermeneutics, and theological aesthetics; heavily critiqued by conservative and Reformed theologians for undermining classical statements on sin and divine immutability.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a methodological model for reading doctrinal claims sociologically and psychologically; indispensable for understanding 19th-century Protestant theology and the genealogy of modern theological liberalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religious feeling (Gefuhl)** - primary datum: intuition of absolute dependence; the hermeneutical key for reconstructing doctrine.
- **Absolute dependence** - existential stance toward God; replaces metaphysical proof as the starting point for theology.
- **Dogma as form** - doctrinal propositions are normative linguistic expressions standing over communal religious consciousness.
- **Revelation: immediate and historical** - revelation is both the inner religious intuition and the concrete revelation in Christ and Scripture.
- **Christology: mediator-exemplar** - Christ is the decisive historical embodiment of absolute dependence; revelation realized in person and community.
- **Sin and moral anthropology**
 - Schleiermacher rejects classical **Total Depravity and Total Inability** formulations: sin is construed as a corruption/distortion of religious feeling and moral life, not an absolute ontological incapacitation; redemption restores right feeling and moral responsiveness.
- **Doctrine of God and divine attributes**
 - Terminological reframing of **Simplicity, Aseity, Immutability, Impassibility**:
 - Schleiermacher treats these attributes as theological constructs intelligible within the religious consciousness rather than as abstract metaphysical categories.
 - Emphasizes God's dynamic, living spirituality and relational immanence; critics argue this relativizes classical immutability/impassibility.
- **Correlation method** - mapping doctrines to structures of consciousness and cultural-historical forms.
- **Hermeneutical priority** - interpretive discipline governing Scripture, dogma, and tradition.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Schleiermacher's method (feeling, correlation) and for reinterpreting doctrines (God, Christ, sin).
- As a **polemic or comparative resource** when engaging Reformed loci on **Total Depravity/Total Inability** and classical doctrines of divine **simplicity/aseity/immutability/impassibility** - both for critique and for historical explanation.
- As an **exegetical-model** and historical guide in courses on modern theology, showing the move from confessional dogmatics to experience-centered theology.
