### TITLE
A Prince of the Church: Schleiermacher and the Beginnings of Modern Theology (Brian A. Gerrish) - secondary study of Friedrich Schleiermacher with emphasis on the pneumatological dimensions of Christ's ministry and resurrection

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century historical-theological study of an early 19th-century project: Schleiermacher writes in the wake of Enlightenment critique, Kantian philosophy, German Romanticism, and confessional Protestant decline.
 - Gerrish reads Schleiermacher as the formative architect of modern Protestant theology, locating Schleiermacher between orthodox supernaturalism and Enlightenment rationalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Schleiermacher reframes Christian doctrine by relocating authority in the lived, immediate experience of God (religious feeling, "absolute dependence") and by making the Spirit the decisive category that explains Christ's ministry and the meaning of the resurrection.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Schleiermacher critiques both cold rationalism and naive supernaturalism; he proposes a theology grounded in the **religious consciousness** common to believers.
 - Christ is presented as the paradigmatic instance of perfect God-consciousness; the Spirit is the existential continuity between Jesus and the Christian community.
 - The resurrection is interpreted not merely as a juridical or physical proof but as the Spirit's vindication and continuing presence - the foundation for hope and communal life.
 - Gerrish traces how Schleiermacher's pneumatology reconfigures Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology and how this reconfiguration launched modern theological method.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Schleiermacher in dialogue with Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Neander, Enlightenment critics, and confessional orthodoxy. Gerrish also interacts with later liberal and conservative receptions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as immediate religious feeling), Christology (Christ's consciousness), Pneumatology (Spirit as principle of life), Resurrection (theological significance), Soteriology (participation in Christ via Spirit), Ecclesiology (church as Spirit-body).
- **Closing line**
 - Gerrish reads Schleiermacher as the theologian who made the Spirit the hermeneutical key: Christ's ministry and resurrection are to be understood as the historical manifestation and ongoing vindication of God's presence in human consciousness through the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes **religious feeling ("absolute dependence")** over propositional certainties; the Spirit is the existential ground of Christian identity rather than a metaphysical addendum.
 - Treats the resurrection primarily as the **Spirit's confirmation** of Jesus' religious significance and as the source of communal hope.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond orthodox supernaturalism by denying that miracles and resurrection must be defended as violations of natural law; contrasts with rationalists by affirming an immediate religious reality that undergirds ethics and worship.
 - Counters Hegelian system-building by preserving the asymmetry and particularity of Jesus' religious accomplishment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Elevates **"God-consciousness"** and **Spirit as the social-practical continuity** between Jesus and the church.
 - Recasts "resurrection" as ecclesial-pneumatological vindication rather than primarily juridical or metaphysical event.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in liberal and modern Protestant theology: pastoral theology, historical-critical hermeneutics, and theological method.
 - Criticized by conservatives for apparent reduction of objective historical claims and by some radicals for uncritical subjectivism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model for integrating existential religious experience with historical theology; indispensable for studying developments in modern Christology and pneumatology and for teaching how modern theology reinterprets the resurrection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute dependence** - the foundational religious feeling; human awareness of dependence on God; primary datum for theology.
- **God-consciousness** - Christ understood as the person in whom religious consciousness reaches perfect intensity; model for discipleship.
- **Religious feeling** - non-propositional experiential ground for revelation and theological claims.
- **Spirit/Pneumatology** - the operative presence of God that unites Jesus and the church and grounds hope in the resurrection.
 - Spirit as **continuity**: preserves Jesus' salvific significance in communal life.
 - Spirit as **vindication**: the resurrection is the Spirit's attestation of Jesus' God-consciousness.
- **Resurrection (Gerrish on Schleiermacher)** - less a pure metaphysical reanimation than the Spirit-mediated affirmation and continuing power of Jesus for the community.
- **Miracles** - expressions of religious significance rather than mere natural-law violations; subordinated to the witness of religious experience.
- **Revelation as experience** - unfolds primarily in feeling and communal religious life rather than in propositional revelation alone.
- **Church as organism** - the social body in which Spirit and Christ's influence are concretely realized.
- **Historicity vs. theological significance** - Gerrish emphasizes Schleiermacher's shift from proving historic facts to interpreting their redemptive meaning via Spirit.
- **Moral influence** - Schleiermacher's atonement language leans toward moral-exemplary and participatory models rather than penal substitution.
- **Theological method** - starting point in experience leads to constructive doctrine shaped by historical-critical reflection.
- **Immanence over supernaturalism** - God's immediate presence in consciousness and community is favored over a metaphysically interventionist model.
- **Theological anthropology** - human receptivity (feeling) as condition for knowing God.
- **Ecclesial eschatology** - resurrection articulated as present and future hope realized by the Spirit in the church.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Schleiermacherian pneumatology and the role of "God-consciousness" in Christology.
 - As a **polemic and exegetical model**: invoked to criticize or to reframe traditional accounts of the resurrection and miracles in pastoral and systematic theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in historiography of modern theology: shows how pneumatology recentered theological method and ecclesial identity.
