### TITLE
**Thomas Weinandy, Does God Suffer? (secondary; read with Thomas Aquinas on classical theism and Christology)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century/early 21st-century theological debate reacting to process theology, liberation theologies' anthropomorphic emphases, and modern kenotic proposals. Weinandy writes as a contemporary Catholic systematic theologian sympathetic to Thomistic classical theism and pastoral orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Weinandy argues that a truly divine God cannot properly be said to suffer in the sense of undergoing change, loss, or passibility; attributing literal suffering to God undermines divine immutability, impassibility, and the objective ground for salvation. Scriptural and Christological suffering must be accounted for without collapsing God into creaturely passibility.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Exegetical claim: biblical language of divine suffering is analogical, anthropopathic, or communicative about God's attitudes without entailing divine passibility.
 - Philosophical-theological claim: classical attributes (immutability, impassibility, eternity) are essential to a coherent doctrine of God; suffering implies alteration and privation incompatible with those attributes.
 - Christological synthesis: suffering occurs in the human nature of the Son; the **hypostatic union** and **communicatio idiomatum** permit attributing suffering to the Person of the Son without ascribing change to the divine nature.
 - Polemic: critiques of kenotic theologies and process models for conflating creaturely experience with divine being and for failing to secure Christ's saving efficacy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary interlocutors: proponents of process theology, kenotic christology, and contemporary theologians who affirm a "suffering God."
 - Classical sources: heavy appeal to **Thomas Aquinas** (esp. on immutability, impassibility, and the relation of attributes), patristic exegetes on communicatio idiomatum, and Scripture.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (impassibility and relationality), Christology (hypostatic union; **munus triplex**: priest, prophet, king), atonement (active and passive obedience), attributes of God (immutability, impassibility), and revelation (analogical language about God).
- **Closing line:** Weinandy centers a classical-Thomistic defence of divine impassibility: God does not suffer in His divine nature; Christ's passion is real yet belongs properly to the human nature of the Son, secured by the communicatio idiomatum and necessary to preserve salvation's objective ground.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Firm insistence that attributing suffering to God threatens the coherence of revelation: only a non-changing, impassible God can be ground of covenantal promises and final salvation.
 - Careful exegetical restraint: scriptural anthropopathies are retained but reinterpreted to protect divine simplicity and immutability.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Contrasts sharply with process theology and strong kenotic readings that posit divine self-emptying as ontological relinquishment of attributes.
 - Corrects some modern pietistic readings that equate divine relationality with passibility; affirms relationality without ontological change.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Re-articulation of traditional Thomistic categories for contemporary debates, making case-analytic distinctions between **passive/active obedience** of Christ and levels of predication in communicatio idiomatum.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited among conservative Catholic and Reformed theologians defending classical theism; used in pastoral-theological critique of sentimental or therapeutic images of God.
 - Provoked responses from proponents of kenosis and process thought who argue Weinandy underreads biblical pathos and the relational costliness of redemption.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Exemplifies how Thomistic metaphysics and patristic Christology can be mobilized for contemporary doctrinal controversies.
 - Models careful interplay of exegesis, metaphysics, and pastoral concerns when treating divine suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo real change; central to Weinandy's rejection of divine suffering.
- **Impassibility:** God cannot be passively affected by external forces; distinguishes divine being from creaturely suffering.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The communicative properties between Christ's natures; used to ascribe suffering to the Person without implying change in the divine nature.
- **Hypostatic union:** The single Person of the Son with two natures; the locus for explaining how God is said to suffer in Scripture without divine passibility.
- **Munus triplex (threefold office):** Christ's roles as prophet, priest, and king; Weinandy uses this to clarify Christ's active (king/prophetic fulfillment) and passive (priestly atonement) obedience.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's lifelong fulfillment of divine law; necessary for positive righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death; real human suffering borne by the Son's human nature, essential for atonement.
- **Kenosis (and kenotic theories):** Theories of divine self-emptying; Weinandy critiques ontological kenosis that posits loss of attributes, defending instead a relational, non-ontological reading.
- **Anthropopathism:** Attributing human emotions to God in Scripture; Weinandy treats these as analogical, not literal predicates of divine nature.
- **Patripassianism (rejected):** The heretical notion that the Father suffers; Weinandy traces careful distinctions to avoid such conflations.
- **Analogy of being / analogical predication:** The linguistic and metaphysical tool to speak truthfully of God without category error.
- **Divine simplicity (background):** Underwrites Weinandy's insistence that suffering would fracture divine unity.
- **Atonement (conceptual framing):** Woven through active/passive obedience debate; Weinandy insists on objective efficacy anchored in divine immutability.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for classical theism's stance on impassibility in systematic theology courses.
 - As a **polemic** against process and ontological kenotic theologies in Christological and Trinitarian debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading anthropopathic language in Scripture through communicatio idiomatum and Thomistic analogical predication.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of active/passive obedience and the munus triplex when safeguarding the objective basis of atonement.
