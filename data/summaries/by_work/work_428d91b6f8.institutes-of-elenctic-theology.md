### TITLE
**Institutes of Elenctic Theology** - Francis Turretin (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 1679-1685). Reformed scholastic textbook produced at the Academy of Geneva; Latin original, later translated and widely used in Anglo-Reformed contexts.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th century Reformed Geneva; post-Reformation polemical environment. Reaction to Arminianism, Socinianism, Amyraldian hypothetical universalism, Roman Catholic scholasticism, and rising Cartesian philosophy.
 - Work composed as academy textbook for theological education; distinctly scholastic and disputational in method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate and systematize classical Reformed orthodoxy by *elenctically* refuting errors and establishing authoritative formulations across loci of theology.
 - Emphasis on certitude of revealed truth, divine sovereignty (election/reprobation), and the integrity of covenantal and sacramental doctrine.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Organized by loci (doctrinal topics): Scripture and revelation, God (attributes, Trinity), creation and providence, angels, fall and sin, Christology, soteriology (incl. predestination), sanctification, law and gospel, sacraments, church and civil government, eschatology.
 - Method: definition of terms, presentation of Reformed thesis, citation of Scripture and patristic/scholastic precedents, systematic objections from opponents, detailed refutation (elenctics), and practical application.
 - Recurrent move: demonstrate internal coherence of Reformed positions and the insufficiency of alternative accounts (Arminian, Socinian, Cartesian, Amyraldian).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Arminians/Remonstrants, Socinians, Amyraldians (Saumur school), Roman Catholics (Jesuit casuistry and Thomism), and Cartesian rationalists.
 - Sources: Scripture, Augustine, Calvin, Beza, earlier Reformed scholastics; heavy use of patristic and scholastic categories to clarify doctrines.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (verbal inspiration, perspicuity, sufficiency)
 - Doctrine of God (simplicity, immutability, providence), Trinity
 - Creation, providence, angels, demonology
 - Anthropologia: original righteousness, total depravity, original sin
 - Christology: two natures, active/passive obedience, satisfaction and imputation
 - Soteriology: effectual calling, justification by faith, sanctification, union with Christ, predestination and reprobation
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works and grace), law and gospel distinction
 - Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper as sign and seal, real spiritual presence)
 - Ecclesiology and polity, magistracy, eschatology
- **Closing line**
 - A systematic, polemical restatement of historic Reformed orthodoxy using scholastic precision and elenctic method to secure doctrinal certitude against contemporary heterodoxy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on *objective certitude* of revealed truth and the ability of reason to defend faith without compromising revelation.
 - Careful balance between divine sovereignty (unconditional election) and human responsibility; nuanced account of causality and moral agency.
 - Precise technical distinctions (e.g., degrees of assent, modes of divine decree, rigorous definitions of imputation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Polemically corrects Amyraldian hypothetical universalism and Socinian denial of Christ's satisfaction; sharp counter to Cartesian reductions of theology to natural philosophy.
 - More scholastically systematized than Calvin's pastoral style; less speculative than medieval scholastics while retaining their analytical tools.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reapplies classical scholastic categories (quasi-causa, efficacious/instrumental grace, formal/remote causality) within Reformed frames.
 - The elenctic format: systematic presentation combined with thorough refutation of named opponents as pedagogical device.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical in Reformed seminaries from late 17th century through 19th century; influential in American and Scottish Presbyterianism.
 - Served as standard textbook opposing Enlightenment rationalism and modern deviations within Protestantism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of disciplined, rigorous theological method; invaluable for teaching systematic theology, Reformed historical doctrine, and confessional apologetics.
 - Resource for careful definitions and fine-grained distinctions often absent in modern overviews.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elenctic** - argumentative, refutational method aimed at exposing error and securing assent to truth.
- **Scholastic method** - quaestiones, definitions, syllogistic distinctions applied to loci theology.
- **Unconditional election** - God's sovereign, sovereignly gracious choosing; defended against conditional/elective schemes.
- **Reprobation** - the negative counterpart to election; treated with moral and logical clarity to preserve divine justice.
- **Imputation** - forensic accounting of Christ's obedience and sinners' sins; central to Turretin's justification doctrine.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace** - federal framework for understanding law, promise, and Christ's mediatorial role.
- **Efficacious grace** - distinction between sufficient and efficacious grace to explain effectual calling without denying human responsibility.
- **Verbal inspiration / perspicuity of Scripture** - high view of Scripture's authority and clarity for salvation.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's fulfillment of the law (active) and his suffering/satisfaction (passive) both requisite for justification.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals** - sacramental realism (spiritual presence) against memorialist and Roman Catholic positions.
- **Divine simplicity / immutability / providence** - classical theism affirmed against Cartesian and anthropomorphic reductions.
- **Certitude vs probability** - epistemological insistence that certain theological truths can be known with moral and doctrinal assurance.
- **Anthropological total depravity** - human inability to effect salvation absent sovereign grace.
- **Hypothetical universalism (Amyraldianism)** - target thesis; Turretin rejects softened universal atonement formulations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for classic Reformed formulations (predestination, imputation, covenant).
- As a **polemical manual** against Arminianism, Socinianism, Amyraldianism, and Cartesian reductionism.
- As a **methodological exemplar** for deploying scholastic precision in systematic theology and seminarian training.
