### TITLE
**Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship - Kevin J. Vanhoozer**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / Publication Context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century theological conversation: reaction to Bultmannian demythologization, postliberal and narrative theology, growth of theological interpretation of Scripture.
 - Intersects continental hermeneutics, speech-act theory, and analytic concerns about divine action and agency.

- **Central Thesis**
 - Theology must "remythologize": recover mythic/narrative modes (not as irrational fable but as formative theological discourse) to account for divine action, the passion of God, and the idea of God as author of salvation history and Scripture. This recovers a performative, script-like understanding of revelation and human vocation.

- **Core Argument / Structure**
 - Critique of demythologization: removing myth impoverishes Christian praxis and imagination, converting theological claims into mere propositional paraphrases divorced from worshipful performance.
 - Positive proposal: theology as dramaturgy - God as Author who issues scripts (Word/Scripture) and enacts saving performance in history.
 - Employs speech-act theory (Austin, Searle) to model divine communicative action: divine utterances do things (promises, commands) that call for human performance.
 - Reframes divine passion: God's suffering is intelligible via the trinitarian, incarnational narrative - especially Christ's passion - without collapsing into pure human emotion or abandoning divine sovereignty.
 - Methodological prescription: recover canonical, liturgical, and narrative forms as essential loci for theology, emphasizing formation (ethos) over exclusively propositional knowledge.

- **Figures / Interlocutors Engaged**
 - Implicit/explicit engagement with Bultmann (demythologizing), Barth (revelation-centered theology), Moltmann (theology of hope and divine suffering), and contemporary hermeneuts (Ricoeur, speech-act theorists).
 - Dialogues with analytic accounts of divine action and controversies over impassibility/passibility.

- **Doctrines Treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (canonical, performative account)
 - Trinity (as framework for divine action and relationality)
 - Christology (passion and incarnation as locus of divine suffering)
 - Divine attributes (impassibility, immutability, providence)
 - Ecclesiology and ethics (formation-centered praxis arising from script-performance)

- **Closing Line**
 - Vanhoozer's theological center of gravity: theology should reclaim mythic-narrative, dramaturgical modes to explain how God authors, enacts, and invites human participation in salvation - thereby integrating doctrine, worship, and ethical formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique Emphases**
 - Rehabilitation of "myth" as a formative, sacramental narrative that shapes moral imagination rather than a mere primitive error.
 - Theology framed as dramaturgy: Scripture and divine action function like a script that authorizes human actors to perform faithful roles.

- **Corrections / Contrasts**
 - Pushes back on demythologizing tendencies that reduce Christian truth to abstract propositions.
 - Counters deistic or mechanistic pictures of divine action by emphasizing communicative, authorial engagement with creatures.
 - Offers an alternative to purely existential or private narrativizations of faith by insisting on communal, canonical scripts.

- **Conceptual / Terminological Innovations**
 - "Remythologizing" as a programmatic term.
 - Use of "authorship" and "performance" to reconceive revelation and human response.
 - Strategic application of speech-act theory to divine speech and Scripture.

- **Reception and Influence**
 - Widely cited in the theological interpretation movement and among evangelicals interested in canonical/performative approaches.
 - Influential for those rethinking doctrine in light of narrative theology; critiqued by some analytic theologians and those anxious about the term "myth."
 - Stimulated further work on divine action, suffering of God, and theological aesthetics.

- **Enduring Value**
 - Provides a robust pedagogical and hermeneutical model for integrating exegesis, doctrine, and ethics.
 - Useful corrective to overly propositional or privatized theologies; durable resource for preaching, liturgy, and pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Remythologizing**
 - Recovering mythic/narrative modes as formative theological speech, not as primitive falsity.

- **Myth (redefined)**
 - Narrative matrix that shapes identity and practice; normative when anchored in Scripture and Christian confession.

- **Divine Action**
 - God's activity conceived as communicative and performative, not merely occasional causal intervention.

- **Authorship**
 - God as Author of the script (Scripture and salvation-history); human agents as authorized performers.

- **Performance / Dramaturgy**
 - Theology-as-drama: worship and ethics are performances authorized by divine speech-act.

- **Speech-Act Theory**
 - Tool for explaining how divine utterances (promises, commands) constitute realities and summon faithful response.

- **Passion of God**
 - Theologically framed via Christ's suffering: divine involvement in suffering without losing divine agency or sovereignty.

- **Impassibility / Passibility**
 - Reappraisal: insists on trinitarian resources and incarnation to reconcile divine immutability with God's relational responsiveness and suffering.

- **Canonical-Linguistic Approach**
 - Emphasis on Scripture as a canonical script that governs interpretation and praxis.

- **Formation / Ethos**
 - The goal of remythologized theology: moral and corporate formation through liturgical and narrative means.

- **Providence as Scripted Agency**
 - Divine governance described in authorial terms - ordering history by means of speech-act and enacted promises.

- **Audience / Actor Distinction**
 - Christians are called from passive audience to active performers within God's authored drama.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for theological interpretation movement (script/performance hermeneutic).
- As a **polemic** against demythologization and depersonalized accounts of divine action.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture as authoritative script for Christian formation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on divine suffering, providence, and the interface of doctrine with liturgy and ethics.
