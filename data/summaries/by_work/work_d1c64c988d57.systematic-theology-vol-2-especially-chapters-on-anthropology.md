### TITLE
Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on anthropology) - Author unknown

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated in the post-Enlightenment confessional systematic tradition that seeks to integrate biblical exegesis, classical theology, and responses to modern philosophy.
 - Aimed at seminary use: intermediate-level exposition of human nature within a broader doctrinal system (creation, fall, redemption, consummation).
 - Site usage: four primary reference foci are repeatedly deployed across topics - **Genesis 1-2** (imago Dei, creation of man), **1 Corinthians 15 / Luke** (resurrection, soul-body relation), **Augustine / Patristic texts** (soul origin and inner constitution), and **Calvin / Reformation exegesis** (image of God, vocation).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Anthropology is decisive for soteriology and ecclesiology: how one conceives the human soul, its origin, and the imago Dei determines interpretations of sin, redemption, and sanctification.
 - Primary problems addressed: **Traducianism vs Creationism**, **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy**, and the **nature and persistence of the Imago Dei**.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory exegetical chapter on Genesis (imago Dei) and key Pauline texts on body, soul, and resurrection.
 - Historical survey of patristic, medieval, and Reformation positions on soul origin and composition.
 - Systematic synthesis proposing a **psychosomatic unity** (stress on functional-relational image of God) while allowing theological space for different theories of soul origin.
 - Pastoral implications: sin's damage to the imago, ongoing sanctification, and hope in bodily resurrection.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristics (Augustine, select ante-Nicene writers), Scholastics (Aquinas as interlocutor on soul-substance), Reformers (Calvin, Luther), and moderns (philosophical anthropology and 19th/20th-century theologians).
 - Frequently interacts with philosophical accounts of personhood (dualism, materialism, emergentism) as rivals or supplements.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (constitution, origin of soul, image of God)
 - Creation and fall (original sin, federal headship)
 - Soteriology (union with Christ, regeneration, sanctification)
 - Eschatology (resurrection, continuity/discontinuity of body and person)
 - Pneumatology and Christology as they inform regeneration and restoration of the image.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The volume anchors human dignity and destiny in the imago Dei and union with Christ, arguing for a theological anthropology that is biblically grounded, historically informed, and pastorally oriented toward restoration rather than metaphysical speculation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust insistence on **psychosomatic unity**: rejects crude soul/body separations and mitigates speculative metaphysics by privileging biblical narratives of embodied personhood.
 - **Functional-relational reading of the imago Dei**: gives weight to human vocation (rule, covenantal relation) alongside substantive accounts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects excesses of classical Cartesian or Platonic dualism by stressing embodied life and resurrection hope.
 - Nuances both traducianist and creationist camps rather than demonizing either; treats the debate as theological-historical with pastoral stakes.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Develops the term **"image-restoration"** to link imago Dei language directly to soteriology and sanctification (not merely anthropology).
 - Uses "psychosomatic person" as a categorical term to replace older polarities.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopts a pedagogical tone that made it widely used in Reformed and conservative Protestant seminaries as a balancing text between dogmatic clarity and pastoral application.
 - Influenced later conversations about embodiment in Reformed pastoral theology and debates about personhood in systematic theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between historical theology and contemporary issues (neuroscience, bioethics, resurrection theology).
 - Valuable for classrooms as a compact synthesis of the major anthropological debates with practical theological consequences.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - central category; treated functionally (vocation/authority), relationally (community/Trinity analogies), and substantively (powers/heart).
- **Psychosomatic unity** - preferred anthropological model stressing the integrated person (body + soul/spirit as a unity).
- **Traducianism** - view that the soul is propagated through human generation; examined historically and theologically as an option for explaining heredity of sin.
 - Use: debated for its explanatory power regarding original sin and parental transmission.
- **Creationism (of souls)** - view that God creates each soul directly; treated as the competing explanatory model.
 - Use: weighed for scriptural support (e.g., Genesis 2:7) and pastoral implications about divine action.
- **Dichotomy** - human constitution as body + immaterial soul; held provisionally in parts of the text.
- **Trichotomy** - human constitution as body + soul + spirit; discussed and critiqued for biblical and philosophical adequacy.
- **Original sin / hereditary guilt** - linkage between anthropology and soteriology; how sin affects the image and is transmitted.
- **Union with Christ** - soteriological pivot that reshapes anthropology (restoration of image, new life).
- **Regeneration** - Spirit's work renewing the imago; key to pastoral application.
- **Resurrection body** - eschatological fulfillment; grounds the insistence on embodied personhood.
- **Personhood** - theological-ethical category tied to imago Dei; used against reductive materialism.
- **Soul / Spirit (pneuma, psyche)** - terminological distinctions explored but ultimately subordinated to the unity of the person.
- **Image-restoration** - coined functional link term connecting anthropology to sanctification and final glorification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classroom summaries of traducianism vs creationism and dichotomy vs trichotomy.
- As a **polemic** against Cartesian dualism and reductionist materialism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-2 and Pauline anthropology (1 Cor, Romans).
- As a **conceptual pivot** tying imago Dei to soteriology, pastoral practice, and eschatological hope.
