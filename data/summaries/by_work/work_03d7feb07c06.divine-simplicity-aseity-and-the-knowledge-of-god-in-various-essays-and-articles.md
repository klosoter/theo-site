### TITLE
**Divine Simplicity, Aseity, and the Knowledge of God** - Richard A. Muller (collection of essays/articles)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century historical-theological recovery within Reformed scholarship; intersection of classical theism debates in analytic theology and historical studies of the Reformation and post-Reformation scholasticism.
 - Muller's project is historiographical and constructive: recovering how Reformed confessions and scholastics treated divine attributes, then testing those treatments against contemporary philosophical criticism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Classical affirmations - **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility, and God's exhaustive knowledge** - can be coherently maintained within the Reformed theological tradition when properly understood historically and philosophically. Many modern criticisms arise from misreadings or category errors.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical reconstruction: trace how Augustine, medieval scholastics, Reformers (especially Calvin) and Reformed scholastics handled divine simplicity and the knowledge of God.
 - Conceptual clarification: distinguish ontological simplicity (no metaphysical parts), conceptual or predicative simplicity, and how attributes are not separate constituents but identical with the divine essence in different conceptions.
 - Knowledge-theory move: argue that God's knowledge is **essential** (inseparable from his aseity) while accounting for knowledge of contingent creatures via decrees and the eternal relation of God to his acts - avoiding incoherent change or mutability.
 - Polemical work: respond to modern objections (e.g., that simplicity makes God unknowable or precludes genuine relational knowledge) by showing how the Reformed tradition handled divine relation without compromising simplicity.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic and medieval sources (Augustine, key scholastics); Thomistic and anti-Thomistic strands noted.
 - Reformation authors (Calvin) and post-Reformation Reformed scholastics (expositors of confessional orthodoxy).
 - Contemporary interlocutors include analytic philosophers of religion and critics who press problems of theology/ metaphysics (without relying on specific novices).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), providence, decree, knowledge of God (essential vs. knowledge of contingents), Trinity indirectly insofar as simplicity bears on persons/relations.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Muller's essays argue that a historically grounded, philosophically attentive reading of Reformed and scholastic theology preserves classical divine simplicity and aseity while supplying coherent accounts of divine knowledge and action.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous historical-theological method: refuses to replace historical nuance with modern caricature or purely philosophical reconstructions.
 - Balances fidelity to confessional texts with analytic clarity about metaphysical categories (essence/attribute distinction).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects modern caricatures that depict Reformed thinkers as naive metaphysicians or that simplicity necessarily entails a dead, impersonal deity.
 - Contrasts with some contemporary proposals (e.g., open theism, Molinism, or certain relational models) by defending the coherence of divine foreknowledge grounded in the divine essence/decree.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Reinsists on careful distinctions (ontological vs. predicative simplicity; essential knowledge vs. contingent knowledge) and reclaims older scholastic vocabulary in analytically sharpened form.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and confessional theology circles as a corrective to both caricatured histories and to speculative revisionism.
 - Cited by theologians as authoritative historiography when engaging classical attributes; influences contemporary debates about God's knowledge and immutability.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating historical exegesis and philosophical theology; valuable for teaching how doctrinal continuity and conceptual coherence are maintained across eras.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - The doctrine that God is not composite; attributes are identical with God's one simple essence rather than separate parts.

- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; God exists from himself, not caused or sustained by anything else.

- **Immutability**
 - God does not undergo intrinsic change; his essence, will, and knowledge are stable through time.

- **Impassibility**
 - God does not suffer or undergo emotional change as a finite being does; affections are not passively imposed upon God.

- **Essential Knowledge**
 - Knowledge that belongs to the divine essence itself - God knows by virtue of what God is.

- **Knowledge of Contingents**
 - How God knows creatures and future contingent events; Muller emphasizes that this knowledge is consistent with simplicity, often related to divine decree or eternal relation to his acts.

- **Ontological vs. Predicative Simplicity**
 - Ontological: no metaphysical parts.
 - Predicative: how we speak of attributes without implying composition.

- **Real Distinction**
 - The distinction between Creator and creature; Muller's usage defends a non-compositional account of divine attributes while sustaining real creaturely reality.

- **Decree (Eternal Decree)**
 - Divine eternal act/plan through which contingents are known and willed without introducing change into God.

- **Classical Theism**
 - Broad framework embracing simplicity, immutability, aseity, omniscience, omnipotence; Muller's writings defend this shape against reduction or rejection.

- **Reformed Scholasticism**
 - The post-Reformation theological methodology and language Muller rehabilitates as faithful to confessional commitments while philosophically respectable.

- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: citation for careful, historically grounded definitions of simplicity and aseity.
 - Polemic and constructive pivot: used against open theism and certain modern critiques to defend classical theism.
 - Exegetical model: template for reading Reformation and scholastic texts on divine attributes without anachronism.
