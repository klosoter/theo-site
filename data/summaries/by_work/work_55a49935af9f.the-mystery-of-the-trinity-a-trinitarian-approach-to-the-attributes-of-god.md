### TITLE
**The Mystery of the Trinity: A Trinitarian Approach to the Attributes of God** - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century/recent Reformed evangelical scholarship, addressing renewed interest in Trinitarian theology across analytic and continental streams.
 - Positioned within conservative Reformed theology but dialoguing with contemporary philosophy of religion and patristic/medieval resources.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The attributes of God must be understood through a truly Trinitarian lens: divine attributes are neither merely abstract qualities of an impersonal essence nor disjointed properties, but the one divine being expressed in relational distinctions of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with implications for both the immanent and economic Trinity.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of traditional attribute-language and problems raised by non-Trinitarian or reductionistic accounts (e.g., purely monadic conceptions).
 - Exposition of a Trinitarian method: attribute predication attends to both unity of being and personal plurality.
 - Analysis of key attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, immutability, aseity, love, wisdom) as they disclose intra-Trinitarian relations and economic revelation.
 - Systematic reconciliation of unity (divine simplicity, oneness of essence) with personal differentiation (relations of origin, perichoresis) without collapsing persons or fracturing attributes.
 - Practical and theological consequences for revelation, worship, and Christian doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Deep engagement with patristic theology (Athanasius, Augustine), medieval formulations (Aquinas) and contemporary analytic and Reformed thinkers.
 - Dialogues with proponents and critics of divine simplicity, and with varieties of social Trinitarianism and Barthian emphases.
 - Uses biblical exegesis as primary control, supplemented by philosophical clarifications.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), attributes of God, revelation, Christology (as locus for divine attributes in person), perichoresis, analogy of being/analogy of attribution, communicable vs. incommunicable attributes.

- **Closing line**
 - The book situates the divine attributes within the mystery of triune life: God is one being whose attributes are fully intelligible only as personal and relational within Father, Son, and Spirit and as disclosed in redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes a robustly Trinitarian hermeneutic for attribute-theory: attributes should be read through intra-divine relations and the economy of revelation rather than abstractly.
 - Balances metaphysical concerns (simplicity, unity) with biblical personalism (relations, mission).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters accounts that treat attributes as mere predicates of an undifferentiated essence (reducing personal relations to modal roles).
 - Pushes back on social-Trinitarian tendencies that risk ontological pluralism by showing how attributes can be person-relative without violating unity.
 - Offers a middle path between rigid classical theism and loose social models.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "person-relative" predication of attributes: the same divine attribute can be instantiated or manifested in different personal relations without pluralizing essence.
 - Clarifies the distinction between immanent (intra-Trinitarian) and economic (redeeming, revelatory) modes of attribute disclosure.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries and among theologians seeking a Trinitarian corrective to abstractions in attribute-talk.
 - Cited in debates on divine simplicity, Trinitarian ontology, and pastoral implications of God's love and knowledge.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically responsible framework for integrating classical theism with Trinitarian particularity; useful for doctrine, preaching, and philosophical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian approach**
 - Read attributes primarily through Father, Son, and Spirit and their relations.

- **Divine attributes**
 - Qualities such as omniscience, love, immutability, omnipotence as discussed in relational and economic registers.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - The inner life and relations of Father, Son, and Spirit as the ground for attribute predication.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - How attributes are disclosed in salvation history and revelation; the normative context for human knowledge of God.

- **Divine simplicity**
 - Treated as compatible with personal distinctions if simplicity is clarified to allow person-relative manifestation.

- **Person-relative attributes**
 - The idea that attributes are instantiated differently in each person without dividing the divine essence.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling used to explain unity of being alongside personal distinction.

- **Communicable vs. incommunicable**
 - Reworked to show how communicable attributes (love, wisdom) reflect intra-Trinitarian life; incommunicable attributes retain unity-of-essence significance.

- **Analogy of attribution**
 - Emphasized over univocal predication; human language analogically tracks the triune God.

- **Incarnational disclosure**
 - Christ as the decisive location where attributes (love, wisdom, power) are personally revealed.

- **Relational ontology**
 - Ontological language that foregrounds relations without collapsing into social trinitarianism.

- **Revelation-centered method**
 - Scripture governs metaphysical choices; theological metaphysics is servant to biblical testimony.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Trinitarian-informed attribute-theory in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic** against reductionist classical theism and against untethered social trinitarianism.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how biblical texts yield Trinitarian readings of divine qualities.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminars on the Trinity, divine simplicity, and the doctrine of God in Reformed curricula.
