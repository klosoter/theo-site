### TITLE
Dispensationalism - Vern Poythress (New Dictionary of Theology, ed. Sinclair Ferguson & David Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary Reformed theological reference (early 21st century). Entry addresses a broadly influential Protestant movement rooted in 19th-20th century Anglo‑American evangelicalism and its recent variations.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** Dispensationalism is presented as a systems‑level hermeneutical and historical framework that partitions redemptive history into successive "dispensations" or administrations; Poythress assesses its coherence with biblical covenantal structure and orthodox theological commitments.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition and historical sketch: origin in Darby, Scofield popularization, 20th‑century American expositors (Chafer, Ryrie, Walvoord).
 - Core features articulated: multiple dispensations; a literal/grammatical‑historical hermeneutic; strict Israel/church distinction; future, national fulfillment of Old Testament promises; premillennial eschatology and (often) pretribulational rapture.
 - Varieties surveyed: classical dispensationalism vs. revised/progressive dispensationalism (acknowledging partial theological adjustments).
 - Critical assessment: strengths (clarity of biblical-historical stages, attention to prophecy) and weaknesses (overemphasis on discontinuity, hermeneutical rigidity, tensions with covenant theology and New Testament typology).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** John Nelson Darby, Cyrus I. Scofield, Lewis Sperry Chafer, John Walvoord, Charles Ryrie; interlocutors include covenantal critics and recent mediating voices in progressive dispensationalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and hermeneutics, covenant (and its continuity/discontinuity), ecclesiology (church identity), eschatology (millennium, rapture), typology, promise and fulfillment, Christology insofar as it relates to messianic fulfillment.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Poythress locates dispensationalism theologically as a hermeneutical program that privileges dispensational administrations and literal fulfillment, but he argues it struggles to integrate covenantal unity and typological promise‑fulfillment as portrayed in the New Testament.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Clear taxonomy of dispensational variants (classic vs. revised/progressive) and their differing hermeneutical moves.
 - Balanced appraisal that credits dispensationalism for attention to prophetic texts while scrutinizing its philosophical presuppositions.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Contrasts dispensationalism's strict discontinuity with **progressive covenantalism**'s emphasis on progressive realization of covenant promises and unity of God's redemptive plan.
 - Challenges the dispensational insistence on an absolute Israel/church bifurcation by appealing to New Testament reinterpretation of Old Testament promises (typology, corporate continuity).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Highlights the value of distinguishing *administrations/dispensations* as a heuristic without endorsing their theological absolutization.
 - Reframes debates as hermeneutical (rules of interpretation) rather than merely sectarian doctrinal quarrels.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed circles as a concise, critical, and fair reference entry; used as a standard corrective against popular dispensational claims.
 - In wider evangelical scholarship, recognized for clarifying internal diversity (classic vs. progressive) and for fostering constructive dialogue.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Useful as a teaching aide: concise taxonomy, measured critique, and ecumenical posture that prompts further study of hermeneutics and covenantal continuity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dispensation(s):** Historical administrations in which God tests humanity under particular obligations; central organizing category for the system.
- **Literal (grammatical‑historical) hermeneutic:** Method claiming straightforward, face‑value reading especially for prophetic and promise texts.
- **Israel/Church distinction:** Doctrinal boundary asserting separate destinies/roles for ethnic Israel and the Christian church.
- **Promise‑fulfillment (future national fulfillment):** The dispensational claim that many OT promises await literal, national realization for ethnic Israel.
- **Premillennialism / Pretribulational rapture:** Eschatological positions commonly associated with dispensational systems.
- **Classic vs. Progressive (revised) dispensationalism:** Classic = strict discontinuity and sharp dispensational divisions; Progressive = greater recognition of present fulfillments and overlap, but retains key distinctions.
- **Covenant theology (contrast):** Rival framework emphasizing unity of covenantal promises and continuity between Israel and church-primary foil in Poythress's critique.
- **Typology:** Biblical method whereby persons/events prefigure New Testament realities; used to argue continuity against dispensational literalism.
- **Continuity vs. discontinuity:** Core axis of debate; degree to which redemptive history is unified or administratively segmented.
- **Hermeneutical presuppositions:** Underlying interpretive commitments that shape dispensational conclusions.
- **Administration / stewardship:** Alternative label for dispensational epochs; helpful as descriptive, not necessarily prescriptive.
- **Eschatological consummation:** The final fulfillment of God's promises; treated differently in dispensational schema (geopolitical Israelites) vs. covenantal schemas (ecclesial/eschatological unity).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition and taxonomy** of dispensational positions for classroom and reference use.
- As a **polemic resource** within Reformed critiques-clarifies hermeneutical faults and theological implications.
- As an **exegetical model comparator**: students consult it to compare literalist dispensational hermeneutics with covenantal/typological readings.
