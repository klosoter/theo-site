### TITLE
A Discourse on the Immutability of God - Stephen Charnock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid‑17th century English Puritan theology; part of Charnock's larger series "The Existence and Attributes of God" (posthumously published). Written in the milieu of Reformed scholasticism, pastoral Puritan preaching, and controversies with Arminianism, Socinianism and rising latitudinarian tendencies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God is immutable - He does not change in being, perfections, decrees, or purpose. Apparent changes in God (relenting, repenting, being angry or compassionate) are accommodative expressions of His immutable nature rather than literal alterations in divine essence.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition and scope: immutability as identity of divine essence and perfections through eternity.
 - Grounding immutability in **aseity** (self‑existence) and **simplicity** (noncomposition) so that God cannot receive or lose actuality.
 - Distinctions of change: accidental vs substantial; changes in God are impossible because He has no potentiality.
 - Reconciliation with Scripture: treat anthropopathic language as accommodation; explain divine temporality in economic relations without ontological change.
 - Practical and pastoral consequences: immutability secures promise‑keeping, providence reliability, and the efficacy of Christ's work.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy appeal to Scripture (e.g., Malachi 3:6; James 1:17; Hebrews 13:8); dialogue with Augustine and Reformed authorities (Calvinian commitments), implicit polemics versus Arminianism/Socinianism and Stoic misunderstandings of immutability.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, impassibility), providence, covenant and promise, revelation (accommodation), Trinity (treated insofar as immutability must cohere with economic distinctions), Christology (reliability of redemptive acts).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** God's immutability is the root of His trustworthiness and theologically secures that His nature, counsel, and promises remain constant even as He graciously condescends in time.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Pastoral‑soteriological emphasis:** Charnock repeatedly connects immutability to gospel assurance - God's unchangeableness guarantees the perseverance of gifts and the fidelity of promises.
- **Balanced correction to errors:**
 - Corrects Stoic/Platonic misreading (immutability as lifelessness) by insisting immutability entails eternal, active agency, not passivity.
 - Counters simplistic readings that would make biblical descriptions of God contradictory to immutability by developing a careful doctrine of accommodation and anthropopathism.
- **Analytic clarity rooted in Reformed metaphysics:** Uses scholastic categories (potentiality/actuality, substance/accident) to discriminate kinds of change and to show why God cannot undergo them.
- **Terminological care on impassibility:** Defends impassibility as freedom from suffering/change while allowing relational affections (mercy, anger) to be real but not constitutive of change in God.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly regarded in Puritan and later evangelical/Reformed circles as a clear, pastoral, systematic treatment. Cited by later orthodox Calvinists and used as a foil against modern process theology and any theology reducing God to creaturely mutability.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a compact model for integrating metaphysical argument, biblical exegesis, and pastoral application; valuable for teaching immutability without detaching God from compassionate action.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immutability:** God's unchangeableness in essence, attributes, will and decree; the central thesis.
- **Aseity:** Self‑existence; grounds immutability because God's being depends on no cause or change.
- **Simplicity:** Absence of parts in God; explains why attributes are identical with divine essence and not subject to alteration.
- **Impassibility:** Freedom from suffering and involuntary change; Charnock defends this while allowing genuine divine affection without ontological change.
- **Anthropopathism / accommodation:** Scripture's ascription of passions or changes to God for human comprehension; a key exegetical tool to reconcile text with immutability.
- **Potentiality/Actuality (change categories):** Philosophical framework used to show God has no potential that could be actualized, thus no change.
- **Eternal decrees vs temporal acts:** Distinction that God's counsel is eternal (immutable) though His actions are executed in time without constituting change in counsel.
- **Providence:** God's governance of creation exercised immutably; used to show consistency and reliability in governance.
- **Promise‑keeping / covenant faithfulness:** Practical corollary - immutability ensures God honors promises.
- **Anthropomorphism:** Related to accommodation; bodies of Scripture requiring literal reading are reinterpreted to safeguard immutability.
- **Moral perfections (holiness, justice, mercy):** Treated as constant attributes that manifest diversely but do not fluctuate.
- **Relational economy (economic Trinity):** Appears implicitly when reconciling God's temporal actions with ontological immutability.
- **Immutability vs change in revelation:** Distinguishes between revelation unfolding in time and change in God's essence - the former permitted, the latter denied.
- **Use in polemics:** Deployed against process theology, modern theisms that posit divine mutability, and reductionist readings of biblical emotion language.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for classical Reformed immutability (theological entry‑level definition plus metaphysical support).
 - As a **polemic** and exegetical model against views that ascribe real change to God (process theology, some liberal theologies).
 - As a **pastoral resource** linking doctrine to assurance (promise‑keeping, covenant reliability) and as a conceptual pivot in discussions of divine attributes.
