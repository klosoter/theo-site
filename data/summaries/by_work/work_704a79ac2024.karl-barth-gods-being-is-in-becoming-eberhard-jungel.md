### TITLE
Eberhard Jüngel, Karl Barth: God's Being Is in Becoming - a sustained theological reading of Karl Barth's doctrine of God (focus on reinterpreting attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century reception of Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics; post‑war neo‑orthodoxy) reframed by Eberhard Jüngel (German Lutheran systematician) as a positive corrective to both classical metaphysical theism and liberal subjectivism.
 - Jüngel's book reads Barth theologically rather than historically, placing Barth within ongoing Trinitarian and revelational conversations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The classical static account of divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) must be reinterpreted so that **God's being is essentially evental and relational** - "being is in becoming" without collapsing God into creaturely change.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: traditional metaphysical predicates reduce God to atemporal, unchanging substance or else require a modern revision that risks making God merely processual.
 - Recovery: Barth (as Jüngel reads him) replaces metaphysical substance with **revelatory event**; God's being is not an ontological static but the self‑manifesting act of God in Christ.
 - Rearticulation of attributes:
 - **Simplicity** preserved as non‑composite personhood (relational unity), not as inert metaphysical oneness.
 - **Aseity** redefined: God is "from Himself" insofar as He is self‑communicative and self‑giving in revelation, not an isolated monad.
 - **Immutability** kept as faithfulness (constancy of covenantal will) rather than unchangeability indifferent to history.
 - **Impassibility** reinterpreted in light of the cross: God is affected in Christ without ceasing to be God.
 - Theological coda: the Trinity supplies the conceptual grammar-divine being as kenotic, free, and relational without metaphysical fragility.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical theism (Augustine, Aquinas, Anselm), Enlightenment/modern critics (Hegel, Schleiermacher), contemporary critics (Bultmann), and Barth's own corpus (Romans commentary, Church Dogmatics).
 - Jüngel uses Barth to confront both scholastic residue and modern immanentism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (central), Trinity (grounding ontology), Christology (incarnation and cross define God's being), election/covenant (locus for covenantal fidelity), attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
- **Closing line**
 - Jüngel articulates Barth's move: the true ontology of God is not static substance but the divine self‑event in revelation - God's being is known and constituted in the history of God's self‑communion in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The striking formula **"God's being is in becoming"** reframes attributes as predications about God's self‑disclosure rather than metaphysical accidentals.
 - Priority given to **revelation/event** over metaphysical ontology: doctrine emerges from God's acts, not abstract categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects scholastic and Enlightenment accounts that treat attributes as metaphysical properties independent of God's action.
 - Opposes purely process theology by maintaining God's freedom, sovereignty, and triune integrity while acknowledging real divine relationality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts **aseity** as self‑donation, **immutability** as covenantal faithfulness, and **impassibility** as a theologically reshaped capacity to be truly present in suffering (Christocentric passibility).
 - Uses Trinitarian relationality (perichoresis) to preserve simplicity without atomistic unity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in post‑Barthian systematic theology and contemporary Reformed/Lutheran discussions; shaped debates on divine suffering, theodicy, and relational ontology.
 - Provoked critique from classical theists worried about loss of metaphysical assurances and from radical process thinkers who find the account too conservative.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a disciplined route for teaching attributes that keeps Christ as the hermeneutical center for doctrine of God.
 - Serves as a bridge between biblical‑theological revelationism and responsible systematic reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Being / Becoming** - Core polarity: God's being is not inert substance but realized in divine self‑action (revelation).
- **Simplicity** - Reinterpreted: non‑composite relational unity (Trinitarian unity rather than atomistic simplicity).
- **Aseity** - "From‑Himself" as self‑communicative freedom: God is causa sui only in the sense of self‑gift, not isolated self‑subsistence.
- **Immutability** - Covenantal constancy/faithfulness rather than static impassibility; God's will is reliably steadfast in history.
- **Impassibility** - Recast via the cross: God truly suffers in Christ without ontological diminution.
- **Revelation / Event** - Revelation is the constitutive act in which divine being is disclosed and effected.
- **Trinity / Perichoresis** - Relational intra‑divine life provides the ontological logic for dynamic unity.
- **Christocentrism** - Christ is the hermeneutical and ontological key: all attributes must be read through the incarnation and atonement.
- **Kenosis** - Theological motif for divine self‑emptying as real participation in creaturely suffering, guarded by divine freedom.
- **Analogia Relationis** - Predication of God analogically via relation rather than metaphysical identity.
- **Election / Covenant** - Historical loci where divine faithfulness and becoming are concretely named.
- **Event ontology** - Philosophical uptake that privileges occurrences (revelation) over static being.
- **Anti‑metaphysical critique** - Negative assessment of attributive metaphysics that abstracts from revelation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Trinitarian, evental account of attributes (redefining classical terms).
- As a **polemic** against classical metaphysical theism and against reductive modern theology.
- As an **exegetical model**: reading biblical revelation (Christ and cross) as primary data for systematic claims about God's being.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates on divine suffering, prayer, and the compatibility of divine constancy with historical responsiveness.
