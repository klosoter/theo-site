### TITLE
The Person and Work of Christ - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Princeton theology; conservative Reformed scholastic method reacting to German liberalism and historical-critical trends. Warfield writes as a biblically grounded, confessional apologist of classical orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the biblical and historical Christian understanding of who Christ is (eternal Son, true God and true man) and what he accomplishes (atonement, exaltation), against modern reductions (mythic, moralistic, kenotic, or purely functional accounts).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of **hypostatic union**: one divine Person with two complete natures; rigorous maintenance of both full deity and full humanity.
 - Defense of **eternal sonship and incarnation**: Sonship is an eternal personal relation, not a mere beginning at the incarnation.
 - Rejection of **kenoticism** and any doctrine that compromises divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, or impassibility in the divine nature.
 - Exposition of **atonement** as substitutionary and forensic: guilt, pollution, and death addressed by Christ's vicarious sacrifice; imputation is central.
 - Trinitarian correlates: ontological Trinity undergirds economic roles (Munus Triplex - prophet, priest, king) without subordinating the Son ontologically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Patristic and Scholastic sources, Reformation dogmatics, and contemporaries: German liberalism (Ritschl et al.), evolving Barthian and Rahnerian trajectories (not direct contemporaries in all essays, but Warfield's categories are later used in those debates), and early American Presbyterian controversies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (primary), Doctrine of the Trinity, Soteriology (atonement, imputation), Doctrine of Sin (guilt, pollution, death), Theology Proper (attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), and Christ's fulfillment of Old Testament types.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's work centers on a resolute, doctrinally tight christology: the eternal Son becomes incarnate without loss of divine attributes, accomplishing substitutionary atonement within the economic roles of prophet, priest, and king.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in preserving classical metaphysical categories (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) while accounting for biblical passibility in the human nature of Christ.
 - Priority of **ontological Trinity**: persons are real distinctions within one divine essence; economic roles are real but derivative.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal tendencies that reduce Christ to exemplary humanity or moral teacher.
 - Opposes kenotic readings that posit real divestment or change in the divine nature; resists any eternal functional subordination that implies ontological inequality.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Reasserts traditional terms (hypostasis, persona, natura) with methodological rigor adapted to modern theological discourse.
 - Clarifies the relation of **eternal Sonship** to incarnation in ways later debated by Barth and Rahnerian thinkers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; central to Princetonian legacy and 20th-century conservative Christological formulations.
 - Used polemically against modernist and later liberal and some revisionist neo-orthodox reinterpretations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear exegetical and dogmatic model for teaching orthodox Christology; a reliable repertory of arguments for substitutionary atonement and against theological reductionisms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - One Person (the Son) subsists in two complete natures, divine and human; avoids Nestorian and Eutychian errors.
- **Eternal Sonship**
 - Sonship is an eternal personal relation within the Trinity, not merely an economic title adopted at the incarnation.
- **Incarnation**
 - The Word assumes human nature without change to divine attributes; full humanity and full deity coexist in Christ.
- **Kenosis (rejected)**
 - Warfield rejects any ontological self-emptying that entails loss or change in the divine nature.
- **Simplicity / Aseity / Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Divine attributes maintained strictly for the divine nature; passibility allowed only in the assumed human nature.
- **Substitutionary Atonement / Imputation**
 - Christ bears guilt/pollution and dies as the legal substitute; righteousness and guilt are imputed according to forensic categories.
- **Munus Triplex (prophet, priest, king)**
 - Functional exposition of Christ's office-work; reconciles office with ontological unity of the Son.
- **Ontological vs Economic Trinity**
 - Emphasizes ontological primacy: distinctions of persons grounded in eternal relations; economic roles do not alter divine essence.
- **Guilt, Pollution, and Death**
 - Treats sin's dimensions to justify the necessity and sufficiency of Christ's atoning death.
- **Christ in OT and NT**
 - Typological continuity: OT previsional structures find fulfillment in the incarnate Son.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination Debates**
 - Warfield's framework is a resource to oppose readings that claim eternal subordination as ontological inequality.
- **Rahner's Rule and Barth's reformulation (relation)**
 - Warfield's categories supply classical counterpoints to later Barthian and Rahnerian emphases; used as a conservative foil in 20th-century debates.
- **Imputation vs Participation**
 - Warfield argues for forensic imputation while recognizing participatory aspects in union with Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed Christology and the hypostatic union.
- As a **polemic** against kenoticism, liberal reductions, and eternal ontological subordination.
- As an **exegetical model** for correlating OT typology and NT fulfillment.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching soteriology (substitution, imputation) integrated with high Trinitarian theology.
