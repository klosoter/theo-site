### TITLE
Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life - Karl Rahner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Late 20th-century Roman Catholic theology, post-Vatican II renewal; Rahner as a leading Jesuit theologian and representative of transcendental Thomism and existential-realist method. Written to respond to pressures from existentialist, historical-critical, and liberation/hope-oriented eschatologies.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** To reconceive Christian eschatology so that the **future consummation** and the **present reality of salvation** are held together: death and eternal life are both a present eschatological event and the horizon of a final divine self-disclosure.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Diagnosis of failures in modern eschatological discourse (reduction to myth, over-realized or over-futurist readings).
 - Anthropology: human finitude, transcendence, and the experience of death as boundary-situation that opens toward God.
 - Theology of death: not mere annihilation or timeless disembodiment but an existential transformation mediating personal destiny before God.
 - Judgment: a double emphasis on particular (personal) and final (cosmic/public) judgment understood as the same divine act seen from different perspectives - revelation rather than primarily forensic condemnation.
 - Resurrection and new creation: bodily continuity and participation in the divine life; projection of individual destiny into cosmic consummation (new heavens and new earth).
 - Pastoral and sacramental implications: liturgy and sacrament as signs and real participations in the eschatological life now.
- **Figures/sources/interlocutors engaged:** St. Augustine, Aquinas, patristic tradition; modern interlocutors include Rudolf Bultmann (realized eschatology critique), Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, Pannenberg; engagement with biblical texts (Paul, Johannine literature) and philosophical anthropology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology, death, grace (supernatural existential), Christology (eschatological Christ), Trinity (communion as eschatological destiny), resurrection, judgment, new creation.
- **Closing line:** Rahner centers eschatology on the **ontological encounter with God's final self-communication** - death and eternal life are the presentively operative and futurely fulfilled disclosure of human being before God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Integrative present-future model:** Neither purely "realized" nor purely "futurist"; eschatology is simultaneous existential encounter and future consummation.
- **Existential-anthropological starting point:** Uses "boundary experience" of death to ground eschatological claims rather than abstract speculation about afterlife details.
- **Judgment reinterpreted:** Moves judgment language from juridical retribution to **revelatory disclosure** of one's openness/closure to grace; emphasis on relational truth rather than mere forensic verdict.
- **Trinitarian anthropology:** Final destiny is participation in interpersonal divine life - the eschaton as interpersonal communion, not isolated bliss.
- **Correction/contrast to predecessors:**
 - Against Bultmann: rejects reduction of eschatology to present existential decision while insisting on genuine future eschaton.
 - Against speculative futurism (literalist antichrist/millennial schemes): warns against reduction of Christian hope to historical prediction.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Deployment of Rahnerian categories (supernatural existential, transcendental method) to articulate how grace is both present and awaiting fulfillment.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly influential in Catholic systematic and pastoral theology; used in ecumenical dialogue with Protestant theologians; critics (especially some Reformed and conservative Catholic circles) argue Rahner underemphasizes penal/soteriological aspects and is sometimes ambiguous about hell and particular judgment.
- **Enduring value:** Model for integrating anthropology, sacramental practice, and hope; robust framework for pastors and theologians navigating tension between present faith and future promise.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschaton:** The final consummation; for Rahner, both present horizon and future event.
- **Death (Thanatos):** Boundary-situation that reveals human finitude and opens to God; existential transition, not mere cessation.
- **Eternal life:** Participation in the divine life; present through grace and destined for fullness in the resurrection/new creation.
- **Particular judgment:** The personal aspect of God's self-disclosure at death; a revelatory encounter rather than purely legal sentence.
- **Final/general judgment:** The public cosmic disclosure of history's meaning - the same divine act as particular judgment, seen corporately.
- **Realized vs. Future eschatology:** Rahner holds a dialectical synthesis - eschatology is already operative in Christ and sacraments yet awaits final realization.
- **Supernatural existential:** Rahner's category for the permanent possibility/ground of grace indwelling human consciousness; explains present experience of salvation.
- **Transcendental method:** Philosophical-theological approach that grounds theological claims in the structures of human experience and openness to the infinite.
- **Resurrection of the body:** Affirmed as bodily continuity transformed; central to Rahner's critique of pure spiritualism.
- **New heavens/new earth:** Cosmic consummation which integrates individual destinies into redeemed creation.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness:** Treated cautiously - primarily theological-symbolic markers of opposition to God's self-revelation rather than timetable-bound figures.
- **Millennial views:** Rahner resists literalist, sensational readings; prefers ecclesial-historical and theological-symbolic readings.
- **Eschatological anthropology:** Humans defined by openness to God; destiny is communion, not isolated immortality.
- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Catholic eschatology integrating sacrament and hope.
 - As a **polemic** against both reductionist realized eschatologies and sensational futurist interpretations.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading New Testament eschatological language sacramentally and existentially.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking theological anthropology, sacramental theology, and pastoral care for death and dying.
