### TITLE
**Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology: Its Genesis and Development, 1909-1936** - Bruce McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late Wilhelmine/German Empire and Weimar-era theological milieu; reaction to 19th-century Protestant liberalism and Ritschlianism; formative context includes WWI, postwar crisis, and early reception of modern philosophical idealism and neo-Kantianism.
 - McCormack follows Barth from his early Bonn and Berlin essays through the early Church Dogmatics precursors, ending with 1936 (post-Voices and after early disputations).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Barth develops a *critically realistic dialectical theology*: a theology that insists on the objective, historically located reality of divine revelation while employing a dialectical method to resist both naive realism and subjective idealism. McCormack argues this formation is coherent and traceable rather than merely a series of ruptures.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Genealogical reconstruction: traces Barth's movements from pastoral experience and pastoral theology through academic engagements with Swiss and German liberalism and sources in Kierkegaard, Luther, and Schleiermacher.
 - Methodological analysis: explicates how Barth fuses critical philosophy and theological realism - critique of subjectivity, affirmation of objective event of revelation in Christ.
 - Doctrinal consolidation: shows how doctrines of revelation, Christology, and Trinity cohere within Barth's early dialectical realism and how he reformulates earlier positions up to 1936.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Ritschlian liberalism, Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, Luther; interlocutors include contemporaries and critics such as Emil Brunner (later controversies), Bultmann, and the neo-Kantians.
 - Uses Rahner's Rule as hermeneutical lens: assesses whether later Barth should govern readings of earlier texts and offers a reformulation of how to deploy such a rule for Barth.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word of God as event), Christology (Christ as the decisive revelatory event), Trinity (relational ontology as ground for revelation), critique of natural theology and analogy of being, soteriology implicit in election and encounter.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth's early theology is best read as a disciplined synthesis: a dialectical method committed to the historic, objective reality of Christ as revelation, giving rise to a sustained, critically realistic Reformed dogmatics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - "Critically realistic" - McCormack highlights Barth's insistence on the real, objective nature of revelation against both metaphysical realist claims and epistemic subjectivism.
 - Theology as encounter: revelation is an event that both breaks into history and requires critical theological appropriation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Ritschlian reduction of revelation to religious experience; opposes analogia entis and any natural theology that grounds God in creaturely categories.
 - Recovers Luther and Kierkegaard to reorient dogmatics around divine freedom and otherness rather than anthropocentric religion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "dialectical theology" not as mere polemic or paradox-mongering but as a disciplined critical realism - method plus ontological claim.
 - Reformulates Rahner's Rule for Barth: recommends a historically sensitive continuity reading that allows early formulations to be judged, but not simply overwritten, by later maturity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - McCormack's reconstruction has reshaped Barth scholarship by insisting on internal coherence and methodological clarity; widely cited in Reformed and academic circles as corrective to both hagiographic and iconoclastic readings.
 - Provided resources for contemporary systematicians seeking to appropriate Barth's method without caricature.
- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies a rigorous scholarly framework for teaching Barth's development, aids in theological method debates, and clarifies Barth's continued relevance for critiques of modern theology and natural theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Critically realistic**
 - Theology that affirms the objective reality of revelation while subjecting claims to critical, dialectical appropriation.
- **Dialectical theology**
 - Method emphasizing paradox, divine otherness, and the tension between God's hiddenness and revelation; here rehabilitated as disciplined critical method.
- **Revelation as event**
 - Revelation occurs in the historical, incarnate person and work of Jesus Christ; it is not merely propositional content nor private religious experience.
- **Word of God**
 - Distinction between the Word as event (Christ), the written Word (Scripture), and the proclaimed Word (preaching); unity grounded in Christ.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)**
 - Rejected as a legitimate basis for natural theology; Barth insists on qualitative distinction between Creator and creature.
- **Natural theology**
 - Critiqued and largely displaced by Barth's insistence that knowledge of God comes only through revelation, not autonomous human reason.
- **Otherness / infinite qualitative distinction**
 - Emphasis on God's absolute alterity that must be bridged only by God's self-disclosure in Christ.
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - Hermeneutical principle that later mature thought may govern interpretation of earlier writings; McCormack reformulates its application to Barth-use later texts to clarify but not to anachronistically overwrite early positions.
- **Method vs. Ontology**
 - McCormack insists Barth's dialectic is not merely epistemic strategy but presupposes an ontological claim about revelation's reality.
- **Church Dogmatics (precursors)**
 - Early formulations traced to later CD themes; helps map continuity into Barth's mature project.
- **Critique of subjectivism**
 - Polemic against reducing theology to human religious consciousness; restores event-centered disclosure.
- **Historical loci usage**
 - As a definition source for Barthian method and theological realism.
 - As a polemic resource against natural theology and liberal theology.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Barth's developmental trajectory without collapsing discontinuity into simple progressivism.
 - As a conceptual pivot in systematic theology for integrating revelation-focused metaphysics with critical reflection.
