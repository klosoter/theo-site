### TITLE
**Convergence: Spiritual Journeys of a Charismatic Calvinist** (Sam Storms, 2005)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early 21st-century Reformed renewal context; published amid renewed debate between conservative Reformed/cessationist circles and charismatic/continuationist movements. Storms writes as a pastor/intellectual negotiating both streams.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - It is possible and theologically coherent to be fully Reformed in soteriology and ecclesiology while also affirming ongoing charismatic gifts and experiential work of the Holy Spirit - a proposed "convergence" between Reformed theology and charismatic practice.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Part memoir/testimony: personal spiritual journey into charismatic experience. 
 - Part apologetic: biblical exegesis defending continuationism (Acts, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians). 
 - Part practical theology: pastoral guidance for orderly use of gifts, worship, and spiritual formation within a Reformed church. 
 - Emphasis on Scripture as norm, experience as subordinate but confirmatory, and church order as essential.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages broadly with classic Reformed sources (Calvin's pneumatology), 19th-20th-century cessationist arguments (e.g., Warfield-style claims), and modern charismatic scholarship and leaders (continuationist exegetes and pastors). Uses biblical texts as primary interlocutor.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Pneumatology** (baptism in the Spirit; gifts; filling), **ecclesiology** (order, authority), **soteriology** (sovereignty, sanctification), **revelation and Scripture** (normativity of Scripture vs. prophetic utterance), and pastoral theology of worship and spiritual formation.
- **Closing line:** 
 - Storms advances a centering thesis: fidelity to Reformed doctrine does not require rejection of charismatic experience; rather, ordered continuationism enriches covenantal, sovereign Christianity without abandoning Scripture's primacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - **Convergence** as a constructive paradigm: a deliberate synthesis, not syncretism, that holds Reformed confessions and charismatic practice together. 
 - Strong pastoral concern for order and accountability in charismata - charismatic enthusiasm disciplined by covenantal structures.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects both caricatures: opposes cessationism that reads gifts out of the church's life and charismatic excesses that relativize Scripture. Argues that earlier Reformed suspicion of manifestations grew from historical contingencies, not necessarily inexorable theology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes "baptism in the Spirit" language within covenantal and conversion frameworks, arguing for nuance between initiation (conversion) and experiential endowment (empowerment). 
 - Advocates "regulated charismaticism" - normative, tested, congregationally accountable manifestation of gifts.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited among Reformed charismatics as a pastoral and theological bridge. Critiqued by strict cessationists for overemphasizing experience; appreciated by charismatics for pastoral clarity and by many Reformed leaders as an earnest attempt at theological integration.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Serves as a pragmatic model for churches seeking to hold Reformed doctrine and charismatic practice together; useful in pastoral training, ecumenical conversation, and pneumatological studies that value both Scripture and Spirit-led practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Convergence:** Integrative proposal to hold Reformed theology and charismatic practice in tandem.
- **Continuationism:** The view that sign gifts and revelation-charismata continue beyond apostolic era; Storms' primary biblical claim.
- **Cessationism:** Opposed thesis that revelatory gifts ceased; Storms reframes common cessationist arguments as culturally conditioned.
- **Baptism in the Spirit:** Distinguished between conversion/union with Christ and subsequent empowering experiences for witness and service.
- **Gifts of the Spirit (charismata):** Treated as real, diverse, and subject to testing and order within the church.
- **Tongues and prophecy:** Affirmed as legitimate but subject to interpretation, edification rules, and congregational discernment.
- **Scripture primacy / normative revelation:** Scripture remains final authority; charismatic speech judged by biblical standards and church oversight.
- **Order and accountability:** Principle stressing pastoral governance, testing of prophecy, and conformity to confessional norms.
- **Experiential validation:** Experience may confirm but not override Scriptural truth; used cautiously as corroborative evidence.
- **Pastoral prudence:** Emphasis on shepherding, mentoring, and protective boundaries to prevent abuses.
- **Sanctification and empowerment:** Charismatic experience integrated into Reformed soteriology - gifts aid sanctification and mission without displacing sovereign grace.
- **Regulated charismaticism:** Term for an ecclesial practice that allows gifts under accountable structures.
- **Prophetic testing:** Standards and criteria offered for discerning genuine prophetic utterances.
- **Ecclesial unity amid diversity:** The goal of holding doctrinal clarity with diverse spiritual expression.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the "convergence" paradigm in studies of contemporary Reformed pneumatology. 
- As a **polemic and pastoral model** against both cessationist rigidity and charismatic excess - frequently cited in pastoral formation and church polity discussions. 
- As an **exegetical-model resource** illustrating balanced reading of Acts and 1 Corinthians in continuity with Reformed soteriology and ecclesiology.
