### TITLE
A Christian Theory of Knowledge - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; Van Til teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary; reaction against Enlightenment epistemologies, liberal theology, and evidentialist apologetics. Part of the growth of presuppositional apologetics within conservative Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **All genuine knowledge presupposes the triune God and the revelation He has given in Scripture.** Human reason apart from this presupposition is ultimately irrational and self-defeating.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Epistemological starting point: critique of the possibility of neutral, purely empirical, or purely autonomous reason.
 - Diagnosis: sin infects human cognition; unbelief produces a rival, self-contradictory worldview.
 - Method: presuppositional/transcendental argument - show that only the Christian God provides the preconditions for intelligibility (laws of logic, uniformity, moral norms).
 - Positive account: knowledge is relational and covenantal - Scripture and the Holy Spirit place the believer in the right relation to reality; revelation is epistemic ground.
 - Apologetic consequence: Christian apologetics must expose the unbeliever's inconsistent presuppositions and appeal to the necessity of Christian theism for rationality, rather than merely adducing neutral proofs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with Enlightenment philosophers (Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant), modern empiricists and rationalists, and contemporary apologists evidentialists. Within Reformed circles, notable interlocutors include Gordon H. Clark (debates on right starting point), and later interpreters like Greg Bahnsen and John Frame.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and general), authority and epistemic primacy of Scripture; sin and the antithesis (its effect on cognition); the role of the Holy Spirit (illumination and persuasion); the Creator-creature distinction and God's sovereignty as epistemic foundation.
 - Secondary treatment: implications for natural theology (largely rejected), apologetics, and theological method.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Genuine knowledge is possible only when one presupposes the living God revealed in Scripture; without that presupposition, reason collapses into self-contradiction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Radically **presuppositional** stance: knowledge begins with God, not with neutral experience or autonomous reason.
 - Use of a **transcendental argument**: demonstrates that certain necessary preconditions for intelligibility point to the Christian God.
 - Epistemology as **covenantal-relational** rather than merely propositional or foundationalist.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against evidentialist apologetics: rejects the idea that neutral facts or historical proofs can establish Christianity to an unbiased reason.
 - Against Clarkian rationalism: differs over the nature of the proper starting point (Van Til stresses the personal triune God and revelation; Clark emphasizes abstract logical axioms).
 - Critiques Enlightenment autonomy of reason and the possibility of a non-theistic account of logic, morals, and uniformity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Restores the term **"presupposition"** to center-stage in epistemology and apologetics.
 - Frames epistemic conflict in terms of the **antithesis**-two mutually exclusive worldviews (Christian and non-Christian) that interpret the same data differently.
 - Emphasis on **no neutral ground** as an epistemological axiom for theological method.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical apologetics; foundational for later presuppositionalists (Bahnsen, Frame, Kuyper-influenced thinkers).
 - Provoked sustained debate with more classical and evidentialist apologists and with Clarkian rationalists; remains controversial outside Reformed circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forces careful attention to **ultimate commitments** in epistemology and theology; integrates doctrine and method; provides a robust critique of assumed neutrality in philosophy of religion and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - Method that begins apologetic and epistemic inquiry by identifying and testing ultimate commitments; the Christian faith is the necessary presupposition for knowledge.
- **Transcendental argument (TAG)** - Argument showing that certain features of intelligible experience (logic, morality, uniformity) presuppose the existence of the Christian God.
- **Antithesis** - The fundamental opposition between the believer's and unbeliever's worldview, affecting interpretation of facts and reason.
- **No neutral ground** - Denial of an impartial vantage point from which to adjudicate worldviews; every argument presupposes something.
- **Revelation (special vs general)** - Special revelation (Scripture and Christ) is epistemically primary; general revelation is interpreted through the lens of Scripture.
- **Common grace** - Explains why unbelievers can exhibit true knowledge and moral insights without endorsing their ultimate epistemic standings.
- **Illumination / Holy Spirit** - The Spirit's role in enabling true knowledge and faith; epistemic change is not merely intellectual but spiritual.
- **Creator-creature distinction** - Ground for rejecting autonomous human reason and grounding divine authority as epistemic ultimate.
- **Sinful corruption of cognition** - Doctrine that sin affects human knowing, producing bias and contradiction in unbelieving reasoning.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Scripture functions as the normative presupposition for Christian knowledge and argument.
- **Coherence and intelligibility** - The Christian worldview uniquely secures the coherence of logic, laws of nature, and moral norms.
- **Anti-evidentialism** - Critical stance toward evidential proofs that presume neutral criteria for justification.
- **Ultimate commitments** - The existential and cognitive starting points that determine interpretive frameworks.
- **Practical apologetic strategy** - Focus on exposing inconsistencies and demonstrating the necessity of Christian presuppositions rather than proving Christianity by detached proofs.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and methodological source for Reformed epistemology and apologetics (articulating presuppositional method).
- As a polemic against evidentialist and Enlightenment models of neutral reason.
- As a conceptual pivot integrating doctrine (revelation, sin, Holy Spirit) with epistemology and apologetic strategy.
