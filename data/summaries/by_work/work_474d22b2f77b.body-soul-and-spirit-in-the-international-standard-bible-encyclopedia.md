### TITLE
Body, Soul, and Spirit - Anthony A. Hoekema (article in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, revised edition)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed contribution within the revised ISBE (post-mid 20th c.). Hoekema writes as a conservative Reformed theologian engaged with contemporary biblical scholarship, historical theology, and pastoral concerns about popular dualistic and Platonic tendencies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the Bible does not support a simple Platonic trichotomy of three separable substances (body, soul, spirit); instead Scripture depicts human beings as a psychosomatic unity with nuanced uses of terms that highlight different aspects (life/personality, relational spirit) and points decisively to eschatological hope in bodily resurrection rather than an automatically immortal soul.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Lexical and exegetical survey of Hebrew and Greek terms (Heb. nephesh, ruach; Gk. psyche, pneuma; soma, sarx) showing overlap and context-determined usage.
 - Historical-theological survey tracing Greek (Platonic, Stoic) and Jewish influences, patristic and medieval formulations, Reformation and modern positions.
 - Critical assessment of dichotomy vs. trichotomy:
 - Argues against classical trichotomy as extrabiblical and beholden to Platonic metaphysics.
 - Advocates for a qualified dichotomy or psychosomatic unity: twofold human constitution expressed in varied biblical language.
 - Eschatological reorientation: emphasis that human destiny (resurrection, transformation, eternal life) structures biblical anthropology more than abstract metaphysical accounts of "immortality."
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Plato and Hellenistic thought; Jewish OT anthropology; patristic figures (e.g., Origen as a trichotomy exemplar; Augustine as formative for Western thought); medieval scholastics; Reformers and modern evangelical theologians. Hoekema interacts with biblical lexicons and recent evangelical interpreters.
- **Doctrines treated:** anthropology, eschatology (resurrection, intermediate state), Christology (incarnation implications for human nature), soteriology (redemption of the whole person), indirectly pneumatology (role of Spirit in life and regeneration).
- **Closing line:** Hoekema locates the theological center of gravity in an eschatological, christocentric anthropology: humans are united psychosomatic persons whose true destiny is bodily resurrection and transformed relational life with God, not preservation of an inherently immortal, separable soul.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that biblical terms function complementarily rather than mapping onto a rigid philosophical tripartite schema.
 - Moves anthropology from metaphysical speculation to eschatological hope - resurrection frames identity, not abstract soul survival.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Direct corrective to patristic and modern trichotomy proponents (e.g., Origenist lines) who read Greek metaphysics into biblical language.
 - Nuances the medieval/Platonic assumption of innate soul immortality by underscoring Scripture's emphasis on divine gift and eschatological consummation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses the phrase "psychosomatic unity" as exegetical-theological default while distinguishing functional roles: **psyche** (life/personality) and **pneuma** (relational capacity toward God) without positing ontological tripartition.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and broader evangelical circles as a sober, text-sensitive corrective to popular dualism and speculative trichotomy.
 - Frequently cited in introductory and intermediate treatments of biblical anthropology and in pastoral contexts opposing Platonic afterlife notions.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a compact, balanced synthesis that helps students move from lexical data to theological anthropology shaped by eschatology and redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Nephesh (Heb.):** OT term often rendered "soul" or "life"; denotes living person, appetite, or seat of life rather than an immaterial separable substance.
- **Ruach (Heb.):** "Spirit" or breath; used for wind, life-breath, and the relational/spiritual orientation toward God.
- **Psyche (Gk.):** "Soul" in NT usage - life, self, or person; contextual and often overlapping with soma and pneuma.
- **Pneuma (Gk.):** "Spirit" - the inner capacity for fellowship with God, often linked to regeneration and the Holy Spirit's activity.
- **Soma / Sarx (Gk./Heb. cognates):** "Body" / "flesh" - the material aspect, sometimes used morally ("flesh") but fundamentally part of human unity.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** Hoekema's preferred schema emphasizing the inseparable unity of body and life/personality; resists neat substance dualism.
- **Dichotomy (body + soul/spirit):** The view Hoekema favors as biblical-default, understood dynamically rather than as a strict metaphysical binary.
- **Trichotomy (body, soul, spirit):** Treated critically as philosophically influenced and exegetically unnecessary; Scripture does not consistently delineate three separable substances.
- **Immortality (inherent vs. bestowed):** Hoekema stresses that immortality is God-given and tied to resurrection/eschatological consummation, not intrinsic to an independent soul.
- **Intermediate state:** The period between death and final resurrection - discussed with caution; priority given to resurrection as theological center.
- **Resurrection:** The decisive eschatological event that secures human continuity and identity as embodied persons; ontologically primary for Christian anthropology.
- **Relational spirit:** Use of "spirit" to denote the human capacity for communion with God, enlivened by the Holy Spirit in regeneration.
- **Exegesis over metaphysics:** A methodological hallmark - let biblical usage govern doctrine rather than imposing Greek metaphysical categories.
- **Use across loci:**
 - Employed as a concise **definition source** for evangelical anthropology courses.
 - Used **polemic** against trichotomy and Platonic dualism in pastoral and apologetic contexts.
 - Functions as an **exegetical model** for reading biblical anthropology with an eschatological horizon.
