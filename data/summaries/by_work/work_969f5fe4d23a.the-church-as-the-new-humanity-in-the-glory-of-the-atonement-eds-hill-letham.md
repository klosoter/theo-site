### TITLE
**Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "The Church as the New Humanity"** (in The Glory of the Atonement, eds. J. I. Packer & O. R. Letham)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed theological renewal; contribution to a Festschrift on atonement theology that stakes ecclesiology on Christ's reconciling work. Gaffin writes from conservative Reformed covenantal and biblical-theological convictions, reacting against both reductionist institutional and sociological accounts of church.
- **Central thesis:** The church is the corporate "new humanity" created by Christ's atoning, reconciling work-its identity, unity, and marks are ontologically grounded in union with Christ rather than principally in external structures or sociological categories.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation in Pauline texts (esp. Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Corinthians): Christ effects a new creation; believers are constituted as one new human reality in him.
 - The atonement is not merely individual forensic transaction but formative of a corporate, ecclesial reality-Christ's death and resurrection bring into being a reconciled people.
 - Union with Christ is the pivotal category: it explains justification, sanctification, and the church's visible/invisible distinction and sacraments as participatory signs of membership in the new humanity.
 - Eschatological character: the church is an inaugurated reality-already constituted by Christ, awaiting its consummation in the new creation and final kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Pauline corpus as primary; engages Reformation theologians (covenantal tradition), critiques liberal social and purely institutional models, and interacts broadly with contemporary Anglican/Reformed sacramental and ecclesiological debates.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, atonement, union with Christ, covenant, ecclesiology (nature and marks), sacraments (baptism/Lord's Supper), eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Ecclesiology must be read out of Christology and atonement: the church is not an addendum to salvation but the corporate, eschatologically inaugurated humanity that Christ creates by his reconciling work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Insists on **corporate ontological formation**: atonement produces a new social-ontological reality (the church) rather than merely changing individual status.
 - Centralizes **union with Christ** as the key hermeneutical and systematic node linking soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects views that make the church primarily an institution, voluntary association, or social-ethical project.
 - Opposes a purely forensic or private reading of atonement that neglects its communal-formative consequences.
 - Offers a counter to both Roman Catholic over-institutionalization and liberal/traditional sociological reductions by retaining sacramental significance without collapsing identity into visible polity alone.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Revives and sharpens the language of the **"new humanity"** as ecclesial category (drawing from Paul) rather than mere ethical exhortation.
 - Emphasizes the **inaugurated eschatology** of the church: already-ness of new creation realities grounded in Christ.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely regarded within contemporary Reformed scholarship as a robust corrective to fragmentation between soteriology and ecclesiology.
 - Influential in debates over covenantal identity, the nature of sacraments, and critiques of dispensational/individualistic ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies how atonement theology must shape church doctrine and practice.
 - Serves as a concise model for teaching ecclesiology out of Christology in seminary and pulpit contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New humanity:** The church as the collectively constituted people created by Christ's reconciling work (Pauline root: e.g., 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 2).
- **Union with Christ:** The constitutive bond making believers members of the new humanity; explanatory center for sacraments, justification, sanctification.
- **Atonement as formative:** Atonement effects corporate reality, not merely forensic declaration.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / already-not-yet:** The church exists now as the new creation in seed form, awaiting consummation in the kingdom/new creation.
- **Corporate ontology:** The notion that persons are ontologically constituted as a people in Christ.
- **Marks of the church:** Unity, holiness, catholicity, apostolicity read as attributes of the new humanity grounded in Christ, not merely institutional traits.
- **Visible/invisible church:** Reinterpreted through corporate union-visible structures and sacraments are signs of the ontological new humanity whose full reality is eschatological.
- **Sacramental participation:** Baptism and Supper as means by which one is signally included in the new humanity.
- **Kingdom relation:** Church as instrument and sign of Christ's reign-distinct but inseparable from the kingdom inaugurated by Christ.
- **Covenant framework:** Ecclesial membership located within covenant corporate realities produced by Christ's work.
- **Representative Christ / solidarity:** Christ's representative action effects the communal solidarity of the church.
- **Reformed ecclesiology:** Gaffin's account used to restore classical Reformed emphases-covenant, sacraments, Christ-centered church identity.
- **Polemic use - One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church:** Cited to argue that these creedal marks must be understood in light of corporate, Christ-created identity.
- **Polemic use - Church and Kingdom:** Employed to maintain distinction and relation: church participates in, witnesses to, and anticipates the kingdom without equating the two.
- **Analytic use - Nature and Marks of the Church:** Serves as exegetical-theological model for deriving marks from Pauline anthropology and atonement.
- **Historical use - Reformation Ecclesiology:** Used to reframe Reformation emphases on covenant and sacraments within a Christocentric, atonement-grounded ecclesiology.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **doctrinal definition source** for ecclesiology rooted in atonement and union with Christ.
 - As a **polemic resource** against individualistic, institutionalist, or dispensational accounts of the church.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul's anthropology and ecclesiology together.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching Reformed sacramental and covenantal ecclesiology.
