### TITLE
A History of Western Philosophy and Theology (2015) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2015 by P&R; written from a conservative Reformed, presuppositionalist perspective. A synthetic history aimed at students of theology and philosophy, interacting with classical, medieval, Reformation, modern, and contemporary figures.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The history is presented as an intellectual narrative showing how philosophical ideas and theological commitments co-shape each other; Frame argues that epistemology and theological doctrine are inseparable and that Christian theology must defend a theistic, Scripture-centered epistemic framework.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Ancient and patristic foundations - Plato, Aristotle, Augustine; formation of key categories (being, knowledge, providence).
 - Part II: Medieval scholasticism - synthesis of faith and reason (Aquinas) and the later Reformation corrections (contrast between analogia entis and analogia fidei).
 - Part III: Reformation to modernity - epistemic shifts (faith vs reason, empiricism, rationalism), debates about God's existence and knowability.
 - Part IV: Modern and contemporary responses - apologetics, epistemology of faith, analytic philosophy of religion; Frame evaluates these from a Reformed epistemological lens.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, modern analytic figures (e.g., Plantinga indirectly in epistemology discussions).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, epistemology of faith, providence, Trinity and Christology in historical context, natural theology vs. revelation, divine attributes and the knowability of God.
- **Selected topical references (site usage)**
 - **Analogia entis vs analogia fidei** - Historical treatment in the scholastic and Reformation chapters (discussion of Aquinas and the Reformers; see scholasticism/Reformation sections).
 - **Existence and knowability of God** - Treated in the chapters on philosophy of religion and modernity (arguments for God's existence, skepticism, and the limits of natural theology).
 - **Epistemology and the knowledge of God** - Developed across multiple chapters, culminating in Frame's critique of modern epistemologies and defense of a theistic, Scripture-grounded knowledge of God.
- **Closing line**
 - Frame's theological center of gravity: theology must begin with God's self-revelation in Scripture and reconstruct philosophy and epistemology in service to that theocentric, covenantal framework.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that epistemology is theological: knowledge claims presuppose either the triune God of Scripture or autonomous human reason.
 - Integration of philosophical history with explicit doctrinal concerns rather than neutral intellectual history.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques Aquinas where he appears to concede too much to natural theology (analytic distinction between analogia entis and the Reformers' analogia fidei).
 - Opposes modern empiricist and rationalist attempts to separate knowledge of God from God's self-revelation; corrective toward presuppositional Reformed apologetics.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - While not inventing new technical terms, Frame repurposes classical categories to argue for a tri-fold epistemology (normative, situational, existential) elsewhere in his corpus; this historical work reads those commitments back into the history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries as a pedagogical bridge between philosophy and theology; used as a corrective to secular intellectual histories.
 - Wider influence limited by confessional stance, but it is respected for clarity and thorough engagement with primary figures.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching historical-theological continuity and for students who must see how epistemological choices shape doctrinal outcomes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis**
 - Classical Thomistic doctrine that there is a proportionate similarity between God and creatures; Frame traces its medieval force and critiques its use when it undermines revelation-sufficiency (see Scholasticism chapter).
- **Analogia fidei**
 - Reformation corrective emphasizing analogy of faith (interpretive coherence under Scripture) over ontological similarity; Frame aligns this with Reformed insistence on revelation primacy.
- **Natural theology**
 - Arguments and knowledge of God from nature/reason alone; treated historically and critically, especially in relation to modern skepticism.
- **Existence of God**
 - Surveys classical proofs (ontological, cosmological, teleological) and modern critiques; Frame evaluates their import but emphasizes revelation as decisive for knowability.
- **Knowability of God**
 - Distinguishes epistemic access via revelation vs. natural knowledge; Frame affirms limited natural knowledge but stresses covenantal revelation as primary.
- **Epistemology of faith**
 - The view that knowledge of God is rooted in God's self-revelation and covenant; Frame situates this against foundationalist and empiricist models.
- **Presuppositionalism (implicit)**
 - Frame's background method: all reasoning presupposes theological commitments; history is read through this lens without necessarily labeling every chapter presuppositionalist.
- **Reformational theology**
 - Emphasis on Scripture's authority, covenantal structure, and corrective to medieval synthesis.
- **Classical theism**
 - Treatment of divine simplicity, immutability, impassibility in historical context and clash with modern sensibilities.
- **Revelation vs Reason**
 - Ongoing dialectic in the work: how reason is disciplined and enabled by revelation.
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: concise historical summaries of key doctrines (e.g., analogia entis/fidei).
 - Polemic: employed to defend Reformed epistemology against naturalistic or neutralist histories.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in courses to reframe epistemological questions in theology around revelation and covenant.
