### TITLE
Understanding Baptism and the Spirit (Westminster Theological Journal, 1977) - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 1977 within the Reformed theological milieu of Westminster Theological Journal.
 - Written during the post-1960s rise of the charismatic movement, when debates about a distinct "baptism with the Spirit" apart from conversion were acute.
 - Engages both biblical exegesis and systematic (Reformed) sacramental theology in response to charismatic and some pietistic readings.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The key claim: NT references to baptism of the Spirit primarily denote **incorporation into Christ/the body** at conversion (a once-for-all, soteriological act), not necessarily a distinct, subsequent charismatic experience evidenced by extraordinary gifts.
 - Problem addressed: Are Spirit-baptism and charismatic experiences the same, distinct, or hierarchically related events?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of pivotal texts (Acts, 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 6, Galatians 3:27-29) to determine the force of prepositions and contexts ("in," "with," "by," "into").
 - Shows NT language of "into the body" points to **union/incorporation** rather than mere empowerment for ministry.
 - Theological synthesis: Relates pneumatological language to **union with Christ**, regeneration, and the sacramental economy (water baptism as sign/occasion).
 - Polemical move: Critiques Pentecostal/charismatic insistence on a subsequent Spirit-baptism defined by charismatic phenomena; warns against identifying the Spirit's normative work (union/regeneration) with optional experiences.
 - Practical implication: Distinguishes ordinary saving work of the Spirit from extraordinary manifestations; preserves covenantal sacramentality and ecclesial identity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: contemporary charismatic proponents and some popular explanatory models in evangelicalism.
 - Sources: canonical NT texts, Reformed sacramental and covenant theology implicit in the method; engagement is exegetical-theological rather than historical theology heavy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (baptism of the Spirit, gifts)
 - Ecclesiology (body of Christ, incorporation)
 - Sacramentology (relation of Spirit-baptism to water baptism and covenant signs)
 - Soteriology (regeneration, union with Christ)

- **Closing line**
 - Poythress centers the doctrine: **Spirit-baptism is fundamentally the Spirit's one-time, constitutive incorporation of believers into Christ and his body; charismatic phenomena are distinct and do not redefine that core soteriological act.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight exegetical attention to prepositional language ("into," "with," "by") and how it shapes theological categories.
 - Stresses covenantal/sacramental coherence: Spirit-baptism as the spiritual reality corresponding to sacramental sign (especially water baptism).
 - Prioritizes union with Christ as the theological center for understanding Spirit-baptism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects charismatic models that treat Spirit-baptism as a separate, subsequent empowerment event prior to or apart from conversion.
 - Counters purely experiential or gift-centric readings that make extraordinary manifestations normative evidence of Spirit-baptism.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and distinguishes multiple verbal/thought-forms: "baptism into Christ/body," "baptism with the Spirit," "baptism by the Spirit," using consistent theological categories (incorporation vs empowerment).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted and cited in conservative Reformed responses to charismatic claims; influential in seminary teaching on pneumatology.
 - Regarded as a succinct exegetical resource for pastors and theologians defending sacramental-covenantal interpretations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for bridging careful exegesis with systematic commitments.
 - Durable clarifications of terminology that continue to aid debates on the relation of regeneration, sacrament, and charismatic experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism of the Spirit** - primary NT concept; identified by Poythress with incorporation into Christ and into the body (soteriological act).
- **Baptism into the body / into Christ** - denotes union with Christ; the decisive theological content of Spirit-baptism.
- **Baptism with/by the Spirit** - often used to denote the means or instrumentality of incorporation or empowerment; Poythress distinguishes instrumental sense from existential incorporation.
- **Regeneration** - the Spirit's renewing work that coincides with or effects incorporation; not identical with charismatic manifestations.
- **Union with Christ** - theological center; Spirit-baptism effects this union and grounds ecclesial status.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - how water baptism and other signs relate to Spirit-baptism; Poythress preserves a covenantal sign-reality correlation.
- **Charismatic gifts / manifestations** - extraordinary phenomena (tongues, prophecy); treated as distinct from the normative soteriological act.
- **Pentecost / Acts sequences** - historical-theological locus examined to distinguish inauguration (church-wide) from ordinary application to persons.
- **Evidence view** - the idea that gifts are normative evidence of Spirit-baptism; Poythress critiques this as insufficient and misleading.
- **Once-for-all vs subsequent** - contrast between baptism as constitutive at conversion and the charismatic claim of an added subsequent baptism.
- **Incorporation** - shorthand for the Spirit's act of uniting a believer to Christ and the body.
- **Ecclesial identity** - consequence term: baptism as determinant of membership/standing in the church body.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** clarifying what NT "baptism of the Spirit" most plausibly means in Reformed theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against charismatic claims of a subsequent Spirit-baptism as normative evidence.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading key Pauline and Acts texts in sacramental and pneumatological debates.
