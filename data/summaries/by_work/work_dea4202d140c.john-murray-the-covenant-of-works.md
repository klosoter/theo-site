### TITLE
John Murray, The Covenant of Works (Westminster confessional/reformed context) - focus: the counterfactual question "What if Adam had not sinned?"

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theology; Murray writing as part of the Westminster/Orthodox Presbyterian theological milieu. Engages historic Puritan and Covenant theology traditions (Westminster Confession, Westminster divines, and post-Reformation federal thinkers).
 - Reaction against both pietistic/subjectivist reductions of covenant language and modern skeptics who treat the covenant of works as anachronistic or morally unjust.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defend the reality and legal character of the **covenant of works** between God and Adam: life promised upon perfect, personal obedience; treat Adam as federal head whose obedience or disobedience determines the legal standing of his posterity.
 - Address the speculative counterfactual: what would human destiny have looked like had Adam not sinned? Murray uses the question to clarify covenantal categories rather than indulge fanciful speculation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify definition: covenant of works is a legal covenant, constituted by a command and a promissory life-contingent reward, distinct from the covenant of grace.
 - Ground covenant in Scripture (Genesis 2:16-17; Paul's use in Romans and 1 Corinthians) and in the law/gospel distinction of Reformed exegesis.
 - Analyze federal headship: Adam's representative role makes his probation morally and legally determinative for his progeny.
 - Limit speculation: Murray allows legitimate theological inference about a non-fallen human state but resists reconstructing metaphysical details beyond biblical warrant. Emphasizes the *function* of the covenant (trial, accountability, covenantal risk) over fanciful outcomes.
 - Connect to Christology: Adam typifies Christ (two covenant heads); the covenant of works grounds the need, nature, and logic of the covenant of grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Westminster Standards, Puritan divines, and authors like Robert Shaw/Turretin by implication; dialogues with later critiques denying a distinct covenant of works.
 - Responds implicitly to modern scholarship that minimizes federalism or reinterprets Genesis anthropologically.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works vs covenant of grace)
 - Federal headship and imputation
 - Original righteousness and sin, probation, law and gospel
 - Soteriology and Christ typology; implications for sacraments and corporate election

- **Closing line**
 - Murray's center of gravity: the covenant of works is a biblically warranted, legally framed covenant in which Adam as federal head stood under a life-contingent command, and careful, disciplined treatment of the hypothetical non-fall preserves covenantal categories crucial to Reformed soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the *legal/contractual* texture of the covenant of works rather than a mere natural law or existential probation.
 - Emphasizes disciplined restraint: theological counterfactuals (Adam's non-fall) are admissible only insofar as they illuminate covenant categories, not to construct speculative metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that conflate covenant of works with a form of meritorious pagan ethic or that reduce it to mere probation without representative significance.
 - Counters neo-Protestant or liberal readings that deny federal imputation and treat Genesis purely as mythic anthropology.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies language: "works" understood as covenantal obedience under legal promise rather than autonomous intrinsic merit; distinguishes strictly between covenantal promise of life and later covenantal mercy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in mid-to-late 20th century Reformed seminaries (Westminster, OPC, PCA) as a clarifying restatement of classic federal theology.
 - Provoked continued debates with scholars skeptical of prelapsarian legal structures and with those advocating alternative readings of Genesis and Paul.

- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies a tightly argued framework for teaching covenant theology, federal headship, and the theological logic that links Adam and Christ; valuable for polemics and pastoral catechesis where covenant categories shape sacramental and soteriological teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - legal covenant with Adam; life promised upon perfect obedience.
- **Covenant of Grace** - God's merciful covenant inaugurated after the fall; stands in contrast to works-covenant.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam as representative whose action legally affects posterity.
- **Imputation** - Adam's sin imputed to descendants; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Probation** - the testing character of Adam's command; not mere information but covenantal trial.
- **Original Righteousness** - Adam's pre-fall state conditioned by covenantal favor and obedience.
- **Life (as promise)** - the covenantal reward; juridical status of life vs death contingent on obedience.
- **Law and Gospel** - law as covenant stipulation; gospel as covenantal remedy and promise.
- **Typology of Adam-Christ** - Adam as type of Christ; two covenant heads framing redemptive history.
- **Counterfactual/Non-fall speculation** - permitted only to illuminate covenantal function, not to reconstruct metaphysical details.
- **Merit (rebutted sense)** - Murray denies that the covenant implies autonomous human earning of salvation; "merit" always mediated by covenantal promise and divine sovereignty.
- **Prelapsarian Hypothesis** - disciplined theological reconstruction of what life under works-covenant entailed; kept within biblical warrant.
- **Sacramental implications** - baptism, covenant signs understood in light of continuity/discontinuity between covenants.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: standard Reformed definition and defense of the covenant of works in systematic theology.
 - Polemic: weapon against neonomianism, Pelagian tendencies, and modern denials of federal imputation.
 - Exegetical model: framework for reading Genesis 1-3 and Pauline texts on Adam (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) as covenantal and representative.
