### TITLE
The Doctrine of God: Introducing the Big Questions - John C. Peckham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical-analytic milieu (early 21st century). Aimed at seminary students and scholars seeking a conversation between biblical theology, historical dogma, and analytic philosophy of religion. Engages current debates such as open theism, process thought, Molinism, and classical theism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To introduce and defend a coherent, biblically responsible account of God that preserves classical attributes (sovereignty, omniscience, omnipotence, simplicity, immutability) while answering contemporary challenges about divine action, knowledge, and relationality.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis of contemporary challenges to classical theism (open theism, process theology, skepticism about divine attributes).
 - Theological and philosophical defense of core divine attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, omniscience, omnipotence).
 - Treatment of divine knowledge and providence in relation to creaturely freedom (surveying Molinism/middle knowledge, compatibilist approaches, and open theism critiques).
 - Trinitarian considerations: integration of economic and immanent Trinity talk and implications of Trinitarian relationality for divine action.
 - Pastoral and practical implications: prayer, prayerfulness, and God's providential governance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical sources (Aquinas, Augustine), Reformers (Calvin), contemporary analytic and evangelical interlocutors (William P. Alston, Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, proponents of open theism such as Clark Pinnock, and process theologians such as David Griffin and Thomas Oord). Uses biblical exegesis alongside metaphysical reasoning.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, impassibility), omniscience and foreknowledge, providence and sovereignty, divine freedom, Trinitarian theology (economic vs immanent), revelation and prayer, problem of evil as it relates to divine sovereignty and goodness.
- **Closing line:** Offers a concise defense of a theocentric classical theism that seeks coherence between biblical testimony and analytic metaphysics-affirming God's sovereign knowledge and action while taking seriously creaturely freedom and relational life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses integration of careful biblical exegesis with analytic clarity-avoids purely speculative metaphysics detached from Scripture.
 - Prioritizes coherence among attributes rather than isolated defenses; seeks to show that simplicity, immutability, and omniscience form a mutually supporting set when properly understood.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Critiques open theism for perceived biblical and metaphysical shortcomings (incomplete divine knowledge, problems for providence).
 - Challenges process theology for fragmenting divine sovereignty and classical attributes.
 - Engages Molinism skeptically but fairly, assessing whether middle knowledge coheres with divine simplicity and sovereignty.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Employs analytic distinctions (e.g., different senses of divine knowledge, kinds of necessity) to clarify traditional dogmatic categories for contemporary debate.
 - Frames relationality within Trinitarian and incarnational paradigms to avoid reductive anthropomorphism while affirming genuine divine responsiveness.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminary courses as an introductory yet sophisticated treatment.
 - Cited in discussions that bridge Reformed dogmatics and analytic philosophy of religion; considered a go-to concise resource for defending classical options against open/process proposals.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Useful as a compact, interactional primer that models how to do systematic theology in conversation with contemporary philosophy and biblical studies.
 - Durable teaching tool for covering doctrine, debates, and pastoral implications in one volume.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical theism:** The traditional view attributing aseity, simplicity, immutability, omniscience, and omnipotence to God; Peckham defends this as biblically and philosophically coherent.
- **Divine simplicity:** God is not composite; attributes are identical with God's being; used to secure divine unity and avoid metaphysical fragmentation.
- **Immutability / impassibility:** God's non-changing nature and freedom from being passively affected; argued compatible with real relational action toward creation.
- **Aseity:** Self-existence and independence of God; grounds divine sovereignty and ultimate causality.
- **Omniscience:** Complete knowledge of past, present, and future; discussion includes problems posed by libertarian freedom and open theism.
 - Relation to **foreknowledge** and **future contingency** is a major locus of debate.
- **Providence / sovereignty:** God's governance of creation; reconciliation of providential control with genuine creaturely agency is a central task.
- **Open theism:** Contemporary rival view that limits divine foreknowledge of future free actions; critiqued on exegetical and metaphysical grounds.
- **Process theology:** Views God as evolving with creation; assessed negatively for undermining classical divine attributes.
- **Molinism / middle knowledge:** Theory that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; evaluated for compatibility with divine simplicity and providence.
- **Trinity (economic vs immanent):** Distinction used to show how God's inner life grounding divine action in history preserves both immanence and revelation.
- **Prayer & divine action:** Practical-theological discussion showing how classical attributes inform a robust doctrine of prayer.
- **Freedom (compatibilist vs libertarian):** Explored in relation to providence and foreknowledge; Peckham favors solutions that maintain divine foreknowledge without collapsing human responsibility.
- **Revelation & Scripture:** Scripture as primary for theological claims, with philosophy as servant to theological interpretation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for key classical theism terms and debates.
- As a **polemic** resource against open theism and process proposals in contemporary evangelical contexts.
- As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating how to read Scripture in dialogue with philosophical theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses bridging dogmatics, philosophy of religion, and pastoral theology.
