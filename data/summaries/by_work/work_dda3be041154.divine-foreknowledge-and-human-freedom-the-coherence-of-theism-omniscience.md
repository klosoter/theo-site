### TITLE
Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom (chapter) - William Lane Craig; in The Coherence of Theism (essay on Omniscience, foreknowledge, providence, and theodicy)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic-theological engagement with classical theism; interplay of analytic philosophy of religion and evangelical systematic theology.
 - Reaction against both deterministic Reformed accounts and Open Theism; part of broader revival of **Molinism** in contemporary analytic theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - **God's exhaustive foreknowledge is compatible with genuine libertarian human freedom**, and this compatibility undergirds a robust account of providence and a theodicy that preserves divine omniscience and sovereignty.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establish the problem: apparently incompatible triad - (1) God knows future free choices infallibly, (2) humans are libertarianly free, (3) foreknowledge seems incompatible with freedom.
 - Introduce and defend **middle knowledge (scientia media)** as the theological-philosophical solution:
 - God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (what any free creature would do in any feasible circumstance) prior to His creative decree.
 - Using that knowledge, God sovereignly chooses which world to actualize, thereby securing providential ends without deterministically causing free acts.
 - Respond to major objections:
 - **Grounding objection** (what makes counterfactuals true?) - Craig offers accounts aimed at showing these truths are metaphysically prior and intelligible as true independent of actual choice, and that divine knowledge is not causal coercion.
 - Temporal/timelessness worries - Craig argues middle knowledge can be held by a timeless (or atemporal) God; temporal ordering of knowing and willing can be framed without impugning omniscience.
 - Apply to **providence and the problem of evil**: God's choice among feasible worlds explains why a just and omniscient God permissibly allows some evils for greater goods achievable only in worlds where creatures exercise genuine freedom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Luis de Molina and classical Molinists; Thomas Aquinas and Thomistic critics; contemporary interlocutors include Open Theists (e.g., Clark Pinnock, Gregory Boyd), theological determinists/compatibilists, and philosophers raising the grounding objection.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Omniscience**, providence, foreknowledge, human freedom (libertarianism), divine timelessness/eternity, theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig's theological center of gravity: **Molinist middle knowledge secures God's exhaustive foreknowledge and providential sovereignty while preserving genuine libertarian human freedom and furnishing resources for theodicy.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic integration of analytic semantics for counterfactuals with classical theistic commitments; insistence that God's sovereign choice of world explains providence without deterministic causation of free acts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with **open theism** by defending exhaustive divine knowledge of future free acts.
 - Contrasts with compatibilist determinism by preserving libertarian freedom and with simple foreknowledge views by explaining God's epistemic priority via middle knowledge.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Popularized contemporary defense of **scientia media** within evangelical and analytic contexts, pressing formal responses to the grounding objection and temporal-order objections.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence in evangelical, Reformed-adjacent, and analytic theology communities; widely cited as the standard modern defense of Molinism.
 - Persistent critique from Thomists, compatibilists, and open theists; the grounding objection remains a central locus of debate.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a clear, teachable model for integrating providence, omniscience, and libertarian freedom; indispensable for courses on divine foreknowledge, providence, and theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle knowledge (scientia media)** - God's knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, logically prior to divine creative decree and used to choose which world to actualize.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - Statements of the form "If placed in circumstance C, agent A would freely do X"; their truth and grounding are central to Molinist claims.
- **Libertarian free will** - Freedom incompatible with deterministic causation; Craig defends this as compatible with divine foreknowledge via middle knowledge.
- **Simple foreknowledge** - The view that God simply foreknows future free acts without middle knowledge; criticized for failing to account for providential choice without determinism.
- **Open Theism** - Position denying exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free acts; Craig polemicizes against it as undermining traditional omniscience.
- **Grounding objection** - Challenge demanding metaphysical truth-makers for counterfactuals of freedom; Craig offers responses arguing for their antecedent truth and intelligibility.
- **Divine timelessness / eternity** - Question of whether God's knowledge is atemporal; Craig maintains middle knowledge can be integrated with classical timeless or eternalist accounts.
- **Actualization of possible worlds** - God's selection among feasible worlds based on middle knowledge to accomplish providential ends.
- **Providence** - Divine governance; explained by God's use of middle knowledge to bring about intended outcomes without violating free agency.
- **Theodicy / problem of evil** - Molinism supplies resources: evils allowed as consequences of free agency necessary for greater goods actualized in the world God chose.
- **Sovereignty** - God's ordering of world-history via choice of creatable world, retaining responsibility for outcomes without causal coercion of free acts.
- **Transworld depravity (contrast)** - A competing account in discussions of possible worlds and freedom; relevant in debates about realistic feasible worlds.
- **Omniscience (exhaustive)** - Craig defends that God knows all truths including counterfactuals and free future contingent truths.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary **definition source** and systematic exemplar for contemporary Molinism and middle knowledge.
- As a **polemic** against Open Theism and against simple foreknowledge/deterministic accounts of providence.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theodicy discussions: shows how divine foreknowledge and libertarian freedom jointly inform explanations for the existence of evil.
