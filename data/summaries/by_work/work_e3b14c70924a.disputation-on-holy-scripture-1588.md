### TITLE
Disputation on Holy Scripture (1588) - William Whitaker

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late Elizabethan England (1588). Whitaker, Regius Professor of Divinity (Cambridge), writing within the Reformed/Protestant scholastic milieu responding to Counter‑Reformation claims about authority.
 - Work addresses controversies produced by the Council of Trent and Jesuit/Counter‑Reformation apologists over Scripture v. Tradition and magisterial authority.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is divinely authoritative and **self‑attesting** (autopistia): it requires no prior infallible ecclesiastical interpreter to make it authoritative; its witness to itself - principally via the Holy Spirit - establishes its divine origin and normative claim.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Preliminary: establish criteria for divine authorship and canonical status (prophecy, miracles, apostolic origin).
 - Primary moves:
 - Positive proof that Scripture is from God: historical attestations (miracles, apostolic testimony), prophetic fulfillment, and internal coherence.
 - Epistemic account of authority: the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** is the decisive ground by which believers are assured of Scripture's divine authorship and authority.
 - Doctrinal consequence: Church tradition and magisterium cannot be set as the formal, prior ground of Scripture's authority; instead, ecclesial authority is derivative.
 - Practical hermeneutic: Scripture is sufficiently perspicuous for its saving message when read with Spirit‑enabled reason.
 - Polemic emphasis: rebuttal of Roman claims that the Church's infallible interpretation is necessary to establish or enforce Scripture's meaning.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Augustine and Reformation theologians (Calvinian and Bucerian strains) for doctrine of Spirit‑witness and perspicuity.
 - Targets Catholic scholastic and Tridentine assertions - engages general Counter‑Reformation arguments rather than a narrow single opponent.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, canonicity, authority of Scripture, sufficiency and perspicuity of Scripture, role of the Holy Spirit (illumination), ecclesiology in relation to magisterial authority.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Whitaker's central claim: Scripture, by divine authorship and the Spirit's internal testimony, is self‑authenticating and the ultimate norm for faith and life; ecclesiastical authority is derivative and interpretive, not foundational.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precise articulation of **self‑attestation** combined with scholastic method: Whitaker integrates rigorous disputational logic with pastoral/experiential appeals to Spirit testimony.
 - Balances external evidences (miracles, prophecy) with internal epistemic criteria (illumination) rather than relying exclusively on one mode.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects extreme sola scriptura caricatures by affirming an active ecclesial and historical role for tradition while denying its priority as the formal ground of Scripture's authority.
 - Contrasts with Roman claims that the Church's magisterium is necessary to constitute Scripture's authority and to secure its interpretation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of autopistia (self‑attestation) in an English/Latin polemical theology; sharper integration of Spirit‑witness doctrine into a juridical account of canonicity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Important in English Reformed circles and Cambridge theology; used by later Reformed scholastics and Puritan divines as a concise defense of Scripture's epistemic status.
 - Less canonical than Calvin's Institutes but frequently cited in polemical debates over authority in late 16th-17th century Britain.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models disciplined Protestant apologetics for Scripture: combines intellectual argument, typological and historical proofs, and pneumatological epistemology.
 - Useful as a case study in debates over self‑authenticating religious texts and the relation of Spirit testimony to historical evidence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self‑attestation (autopistia)** - Scripture's property of bearing witness to its own divine origin; central epistemic claim.
- **Testimony of the Holy Spirit (testimonium Spiritus Sancti)** - Internal witness that certifies Scripture to believers; not magical but experiential and evidential.
- **External attestation** - Miracles, fulfilled prophecy, apostolic authorship as historically observable grounds for Scripture's divine claim.
- **Canonicity** - Criteria and process by which books are recognized as Scripture; Whitaker stresses apostolicity and divine signs alongside Spirit testimony.
- **Perspicuity (claritas)** - Scripture's sufficient clarity for matters necessary to salvation when read with Spirit‑enabled reason.
- **Sufficiency (sufficientia)** - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and doctrine; tradition may help but cannot add to this sufficiency.
- **Magisterium (ecclesial authority)** - Church authority is important for order and interpretation but is derivative and not the formal cause of Scripture's authority.
- **Inspiration (inspiratio)** - God as ultimate author of Scripture; Whitaker maintains verbal/real divine authorship in traditional Reformed terms.
- **Revelation (revelatio)** - God's disclosure of saving truth through Scripture, authenticated by Spirit and historical signs.
- **Hermeneutical method** - Spirit‑guided historical‑grammatical reading, supported by reason; suspicious of appeals to infallible ecclesial dicta.
- **Authority (auctoritas)** - Distinction between formal (what makes Scripture normative) and material (content derived from apostolic writings).
- **Illumination** - Ongoing work of Spirit enabling understanding and assent to Scripture's claims.
- **Autonomy vs. Derivative authority** - Key contrast: Scripture's autonomy in authority vs church's derivative interpretive role.
- **Polemical use** - Work frames arguments against Counter‑Reformation positions on scriptural dependence on tradition.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Protestant accounts of scripture's self‑attestation and the testimony of the Spirit.
- As a **polemical manual** against Roman claims for magisterial primacy over Scriptures.
- As an **exegetical/epistemological model** demonstrating how historical evidence and pneumatology combine to ground biblical authority.
