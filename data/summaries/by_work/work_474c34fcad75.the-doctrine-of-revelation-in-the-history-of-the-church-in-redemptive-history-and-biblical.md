### TITLE
The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of the Church - Geerhardus Vos (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Turn-of-the-century Reformed scholarship; Vos writing from the Princeton/Redemptive-Historical school reacting to 19th-century liberalism, Schleiermacher, and scholastic abstractions. Essay collected in Vos's Redemptive History volumes that systematize biblical theology as historical.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Revelation must be understood as God's historical, redemptive self-disclosure in acts culminating in Christ and embodied in Scripture; the doctrinal problem is overcoming abstracted notions of "revelation" (pure propositions, purely immanent religious feeling, or isolated natural theology) that sever revelation from history and covenant.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Survey of historical treatments of revelation (patristic, medieval, Reformers, moderns), showing recurring tensions: revelation as event vs. abstract truth; continuity of general and special revelation vs. their qualitative distinction.
 - Positive thesis: revelation is organic, progressive, covenantal, and Christocentric - special revelation presupposes and perfects general revelation but cannot be reduced to it.
 - Methodological insistence: theological doctrine must follow historical sequence of redemptive acts (acts -> testimony -> canon -> doctrine).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic (Augustine), medieval scholastics (Aquinas), Reformers (Calvin, Luther), and moderns (notably Schleiermacher and liberal theology), plus Roman Catholic and Protestant articulations of natural theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Revelation** (general and special), **covenant**, **Scripture and inspiration**, **Christology** (as the center of revelation), **progressive revelation**, and implicit notes on **soteriology** and **ecclesial reception** of the Word.
- **Closing line capturing the work's center of gravity:** 
 - Revelation is fundamentally an historical, covenantal self-disclosure of God realized in redemptive acts culminating in Christ and canonically preserved in Scripture; theological method must therefore root doctrine in the history of God's saving acts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence that revelation is primarily actual and historical (God does and then speaks), not merely propositional content or inner religious consciousness.
 - Emphasis on the organic, progressive unity of revelation: later revelations fulfill and clarify earlier general disclosure rather than simply add propositions.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects scholastic abstraction that treats revelation as a static deposit separable from historical context.
 - Critiques Schleiermacher's reduction of revelation to religious feeling and modern liberalism's domestication of revelation to moral or cultural categories.
 - Reclaims continuity with Reformational covenant theology while insisting on stronger historical-historical hermeneutic than classical dogmatics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Frames revelation within a redemptive-historical matrix: terminology and method that stress acts, covenants, and progressive disclosure as theological primitives.
 - Distinguishes clearly between the ontic reality of general revelation and the soteriological necessity of special revelation.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Highly influential in Reformed biblical theology and evangelical hermeneutics; foundational to later redemptive-historical movements and to conservative treatments of Scripture's authority and historicality.
 - Read as corrective both by conservative scholars resisting liberal demythologizing and by those seeking a historically grounded doctrine of inspiration.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models a historically sensitive doctrinal method that connects canonical exegesis with systematic claims; valuable in courses on revelation, biblical theology, and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (act vs. proposition):** Vos stresses **revelation-as-act** (God's deeds) prior to or essential to revelation-as-stated-propositions (Scripture).
- **General Revelation:** God's self-disclosure in nature and conscience; real and universal but insufficient for salvific knowledge.
- **Special Revelation:** Redemptive disclosures (promises, covenant acts) culminating in Christ and preserved in Scripture; soteriologically decisive.
- **Progressive Revelation:** The historical unfolding and clarification of divine self-disclosure across covenantal stages.
- **Redemptive History (Heilsgeschichte):** Methodological principle treating revelation within the flow of salvation history rather than as atemporal dogma.
- **Covenant:** Structural category for organizing revelation; covenants are the loci in which acts and promises become corporate revelation.
- **Accommodation:** God's condescending mode of disclosure to human capacities; explains anthropomorphic, cultural, and historical forms of revelation.
- **Scripture/Canon:** The trustworthy written testimony to culminatory redemptive acts; the normative record of special revelation.
- **Inspiration:** Closely tied to the historical acts - Scripture is authoritative because it witnesses to objective redemptive events.
- **Christocentricity:** Christ is the center and climax of revelation; all prior revelation finds its telos in him.
- **Historicality:** The insistence that revelation is located in time and real events, not merely theological constructs.
- **Natural Theology (critique):** Vos affirms natural knowledge of God but denies its sufficiency for redemptive truth or detailed knowledge of divine will.
- **Testimony:** The ecclesial and canonical witnessing function by which acts become doctrinal content.
- **Doctrine vs. History:** Vos argues doctrine must be grounded in reconstructed redemptive-historical sequence, not reverse-engineered from abstract dogma.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **methodological definition source** for redemptive-historical biblical theology and for anchoring doctrine in events.
 - As a **polemic** against theological liberalism, abstract scholasticism, and reductionist theories of revelation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture Christocentrically and historically, linking narrative acts to doctrinal formulation.
