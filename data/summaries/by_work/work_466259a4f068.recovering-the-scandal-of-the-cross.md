### TITLE
Recovering the Scandal of the Cross - Joel B. Green & Mark D. Baker

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical scholarship (early 21st century) responding to late-20th/early-21st‑century trends that domesticate or domesticate the cross (therapeutic moralism, cultural accommodation). Situated within New Testament scholarship and pastoral theology, with attention to historical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Christian gospel centers on a cross that is scandalous (offensive, destabilizing) to human pride and power; recovering that scandal - rather than domesticating, trivializing, or reducing it - is essential for authentic proclamation, pastoral ministry, and theological coherence.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modern and many contemporary theological currents have softened, privatized, or triumphalized the cross so that it stops confronting sin, power, and idolatry.
 - Exegetical retrieval: careful reading of New Testament texts (especially Pauline language of scandal, Gospel passion narratives, Hebrews) showing the cross as offense and exigency for repentance and conversion.
 - Theological synthesis: interaction with historical atonement accounts (substitution, Christus Victor, moral exemplar, etc.) to show that a multifaceted but scandal‑honoring account is required.
 - Pastoral and liturgical implications: how preaching, worship, and discipleship must re‑center on a cross that calls for suffering, repentance, and communal transformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** primary interlocutors include Paul and Gospel writers (NT witness); historical theologians and atonement theorists (Anselmian/substitutionary traditions, Aulén/Christus Victor, Abelard moral influence), and contemporary critics who domesticate the cross (liberal theology, consumerist spirituality). The book dialogues with both scholarly and pastoral literature.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, atonement/soteriology, sin, justification, revelation (kerygma), ecclesiology (worship and preaching), and pastoral theology.
- **Closing line capturing the center of gravity:** The cross must be reclaimed as scandal - an offensive, decisive act of God that confronts human pretension and reorders life in submission to Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats *scandal* as a theological category: not merely rhetorical shock but salvific instrument that exposes sin and power.
 - Integrates exegetical sensitivity with pastoral application - the scandal is both proclamation and practice.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects liberalizing tendencies that render the cross ethically suggestive but theologically impotent.
 - Pushes back against reductionist insistence on a single atonement model (e.g., exclusively moral exemplar or exclusively penal substitution), arguing for a multi‑modal retrieval that preserves scandal.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Elevates the NT notion of scandal (skandalon/scandalum) as hermeneutical key for reading atonement and kerygma.
 - Frames atonement metaphors in their rhetorical effect on hearers (offense, stumbling, persuasion), not merely technical doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical academic and pastoral circles as a corrective to pastoral platitudes and as a resource for preaching the cross.
 - Appreciated for its balance - accessible to pastors yet grounded in scholarship - though some confessionalists critique perceived ambiguity on substitutionary mechanics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to marry NT exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral theology.
 - Provides a durable framework for reorienting preaching, catechesis, and worship around a cross that calls for repentance and communal conversion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scandal of the Cross:** The cross as offensive, destabilizing event that confronts human power, pride, and sin; central hermeneutical category.
- **Scandalon (skandalon):** NT term emphasized for its rhetorical and theological import - a stumbling block that reveals unbelief.
- **Kerygma:** Proclaimed gospel that centers on the crucifixion as both scandal and saving act.
- **Atonement metaphors:** Emphasis on plural models (substitution, Christus Victor, moral influence, governmental) used complementarily rather than exclusively.
 - Substitution/penal substitution: treated as one legitimate strand, but argued not to be the sole articulatory frame.
 - Christus Victor: recovery of victory‑over‑powers reading that preserves the cross's subversive force.
- **Justification:** Discussed in relation to how the scandal confronts legal and relational ruptures between God and humans.
- **Sin and power:** The cross exposes structures of sin and worldly power; not merely private moral failure but systemic idolatry.
- **Preaching and proclamation:** Practical emphasis - the scandal shapes homiletics, not just doctrine.
- **Pastoral theology:** The cross shapes pastoral responses to suffering, repentance, and community formation.
- **Incarnation and cruciformity:** The scandal is rooted in the incarnation and summons disciples to a cruciform life.
- **Offense vs. triumphalism:** Distinction between cross as offensive summons and easy triumphalist uses that domesticate it.
- **Narrative retrieval:** The cross must be read within the narrative of Scripture, not isolated as an abstract doctrine.
- **Ecumenical sensibility:** Multi‑model approach enables dialogue across traditions.
- **Hermeneutical pivot:** Uses scandal as a lens for interpreting atonement texts and preaching.
- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "scandal of the cross" in homiletics and pastoral theology.
 - As a **polemic** against therapeutic, domesticated accounts of Christianity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and passion narratives with attention to rhetorical effect.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating soteriology, ecclesiology, and preaching around the cross.
