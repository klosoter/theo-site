### TITLE
Common Grace and the Gospel (1948) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar Reformed theological debate (mid-20th century). Van Til writes from the Orthodox Presbyterian / Westminster tradition, reacting to trajectories in Neo-Calvinism (Kuyperian heirs) and to common-sense or evidentialist apologetics.
 - Part of Van Til's developing presuppositional apologetic; engages confessional Reformed theology and contemporary philosophical trends.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Common grace is real but never salvific or a theological basis for the gospel.** It can restrain evil and enable cultural life, but it cannot provide neutral ground or warrant for knowing God savingly; only special revelation in Christ does that.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern attempts to make common grace a bridge to the gospel presuppose a neutral human standpoint or sufficient natural theology.
 - Distinction: strict bifurcation between **common (general) grace** and **special (saving) grace**; common grace has social, cultural, and civil effects but no redemptive or revelatory authority.
 - Apologetic consequence: Christians must not appeal to autonomous human reason or to a supposed common spiritual knowledge as the primary basis for presenting the gospel; rather, begin with the truth-claims of Scripture (presuppositions).
 - Theological development: explores how doctrines of sin, revelation, and the Trinity bear on limits and legitimate uses of common grace.
 - Pastoral/eschatological point: common grace is provisional and tied to God's temporal governance until consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: proponents of Neo-Calvinist common grace (Abraham Kuyper's heirs), proponents of natural theology and evidential apologetics.
 - Secondary references: Reformed confessional standards (Westminster, Canons), traces of Bavinckian nuance; engages philosophical assumptions about neutrality and reason.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), Theology Proper (God's sovereignty over common gifts), Doctrine of Sin (total depravity and antithesis), Soteriology (exclusive mediatorship of Christ), Bibliology (primacy of Scripture as the norm for gospel), Eschatology (temporary character of common grace).

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til: common grace permits culture and restrains evil but must be subordinated to the antithesis and cannot serve as the epistemic or theological ground for the gospel.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sharp insistence on the **antithesis**: regenerate vs. unregenerate thinking - all thought is interpretive and presuppositional.
 - Refusal to treat common grace as "common ground" for rational persuasion; instead it is a providential ordering under divine sovereignty.
 - Emphasis that common grace is non-redemptive - a clear corrective to conciliatory uses of the category.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Kuyperian tendencies that blur lines between common and special grace by making general revelation or cultural achievement a warrant for the gospel.
 - Opposes evidentialist and natural-theistic apologetics that presume neutral reason or an autonomous human faculty able to receive saving truth apart from Christ and Scripture.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic integration of the antithesis into the doctrine of common grace: common grace construed not as epistemic common ground but as a **restraining, non-salvific divine kindness**.
 - Development of a presuppositional framework for assessing theological categories (common vs. special).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in shaping 20th-century presuppositional apologetics and conservative Reformed responses to Neo-Calvinism.
 - Provoked sustained debate with Kuyperian and more moderate Reformed circles; became a touchstone in the Van Tillian vs. Kuyperian discussions.
 - Long-term impact on Reformed systematicians and apologists (e.g., subsequent generations who adopted presuppositional methods).

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies limits of common grace and defends the priority of revelation for soteriology and apologetics.
 - Useful corrective against ecumenical tendencies that overstate neutral common ground; pedagogically valuable for teaching antithesis and apologetic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace**
 - God's non-saving beneficences: restraining sin, enabling social order and cultural goods; never grounds salvation or saving knowledge.

- **Special grace**
 - Saving, particular grace in Christ; alone effectual for redemption and for rightful knowledge of God.

- **Antithesis**
 - Fundamental and pervasive opposition between regenerate and unregenerate thought; hermeneutical principle for theology and apologetics.

- **General revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure in creation and conscience; valuable for providential knowledge but insufficient for saving faith.

- **Special revelation**
 - Scripture and the incarnation of Christ; the authoritative and necessary basis for the gospel.

- **Neutral ground (rebuttal)**
 - Van Til denies the existence of a neutral, presuppositionless ground; so-called neutral common ground cannot legitimately be appealed to for gospel presentation.

- **Presuppositional apologetics**
 - Method insisting that Christians begin with Scripture's truth-claims and expose the inconsistency of non-Christian presuppositions rather than appealing to unaided human reason.

- **Restraint (of sin)**
 - A key function attributed to common grace: God's providential curbing of evil in society without transforming hearts.

- **Cultural mandate / common gifts**
 - Cultural flourishing and intellectual achievements are real effects of common grace but must be interpreted as non-redemptive.

- **Total depravity / depravity**
 - Human inability to know God savingly apart from special grace; grounds Van Til's rejection of salvific reach for common grace.

- **Accommodation**
 - Theological caution that general revelation or cultural phenomena must not be misread as accommodation to saving revelation.

- **Eschatological provisionality**
 - Common grace holds only until consummation; it is not the eschatological norm.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for distinguishing common vs. special grace in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic** against natural theology and Kuyperian conciliatory uses of common grace.
- As an **apologetic model** (presuppositional) influencing epistemological and hermeneutical approaches.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in doctrines of sin, revelation, and the church's relation to culture.
