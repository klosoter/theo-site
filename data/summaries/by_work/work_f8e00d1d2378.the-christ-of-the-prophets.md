### TITLE
**The Christ of the Prophets** - O. Palmer Robertson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2004 (P&R); fruit of Reformed biblical theology renewing interest in the unity of OT and NT.
 - Positioned against historical-critical atomization of the prophets; builds on Vosian redemptive-historical method.
- **Central thesis**
 - The prophetic corpus proclaims **Christ as the covenantal climax**: the promised Davidic king, suffering Servant, and eschatological Prophet whose person and work fulfill all Old Testament covenants.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Method:** Prophets as **covenant prosecutors** applying Mosaic sanctions, while projecting Abrahamic-Davidic-New Covenant hope toward Christ.
 - **Messianic profiles:** Immanuel, Branch, Servant, Shepherd-King, Son of Man; unified in Jesus.
 - **Covenantal frame:**
 - **Abrahamic** promises universal blessing realized in Christ.
 - **Mosaic** functions pedagogically and typologically within the **covenant of grace**, not as a substantial reversion to a covenant of works.
 - **Davidic** kingship concentrated in the righteous Branch.
 - **New Covenant** (Jer 31; Ezek 36-37) inaugurated by Christ, grounded in the **pactum salutis**.
 - **Exegesis across books:** Isaiah (Servant; Immanuel), Jeremiah (New Covenant), Ezekiel (new heart, Spirit, temple), The Twelve (Day of the LORD; priest-king in Zechariah).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Vos, E. J. Young, Kline (appreciation with critique), Ridderbos; interacts with Childs, Kaiser, and critical scholarship on messianic interpretation and typology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and canon** (organic unity; disciplined typology).
 - **Covenant theology**: **covenant of grace**, **covenant of works** (and Mosaic relation), **covenant of redemption**.
 - **Christology**: prophetic Christology as Prophet-Priest-King; atonement in Servant Songs.
 - **Ecclesiology and ethics**: remnant, holiness, prophetic lawsuit; holy war motifs considered without full Klinean intrusion ethic.
- **Closing line**
 - The prophets herald the **Covenant Head** whose cross and kingdom consummate God's bond-in-blood with his people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prophets as **covenant-law prosecutors** whose indictments and promises both converge on Christ.
 - Consistent use of covenantal categories to integrate disparate prophetic texts into a Christ-centered whole.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects reading the **Mosaic** as a covenant of works **as to substance**; insists it is an administration of the **covenant of grace** with typological works principles for Israel's tenure.
 - Moderates **Klinean intrusion ethics**: acknowledges holy-war intrusion typology but resists leveraging it to recast Mosaic substance.
 - Opposes undisciplined **sensus plenior**; advocates single, organically developing meaning that is canonically extended in Christ.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Reapplies his definition of covenant as **bond-in-blood sovereignly administered** to prophetic preaching.
 - Highlights **pactum salutis** implicitly in Servant obedience and the Father's commissioning, grounding Christ as **Covenant Head**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries for Prophets; complements Robertson's Christ of the Covenants.
 - Serves as a mediating voice between classic Westminster covenantalism and contemporary republication debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models christocentric exegesis without flattening historical context.
 - Provides a coherent covenantal framework for preaching the Prophets.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith):** God's sovereign, life-binding administration; frames prophetic indictments and promises.
- **Covenant lawsuit (rib):** Forensic pattern (charge, evidence, verdict, sanction) structuring prophetic oracles.
- **Covenant of Grace:** One gracious covenant post-Fall with multiple administrations; prophetic hope arises within it.
- **Covenant of Works:** Adamic probation; informs prophetic recapitulations of exile as death and need for a new Adam.
- **Mosaic covenant:** An administration of grace with typological works-principle for land tenure; not CoW in substance.
 - Contrasts with strong republication views; stresses pedagogy and typology toward Christ.
- **Davidic covenant / Branch:** Promise of an everlasting king fulfilled in Christ's righteous rule.
- **New Covenant:** Jeremiah 31; Ezekiel 36-37; internalization of law, forgiveness, Spirit-gift in Christ.
- **Pactum salutis (Covenant of Redemption):** Intra-Trinitarian counsel grounding the mission of the Servant and Christ's headship.
- **Christ as Covenant Head:** Representative second Adam and Davidic king who secures blessings for the remnant-turned-nations.
- **Servant of the LORD:** Isaiah's figure uniting obedience, substitution, and mission to the nations in Jesus.
- **Day of the LORD:** Prophetic crisis/judgment culminating in the cross and final judgment.
- **Remnant:** Preserved seed anticipating the church's expansion in the New Covenant era.
- **Typology:** Organic, prospective patterns (temple, exodus, shepherd) fulfilled in Christ without forcing double senses.
- **Klinean intrusion ethics:** Holy-war intrusion of final judgment into history; appreciated for theocracy but not made constitutive of Mosaic substance.
- **Biblical covenants (Abrahamic-Mosaic-Davidic-New):** Interlocking administrations converging on Christ.

- **How the work is used**
 - **Exegetical model** for reading Prophets christologically within covenantal structures.
 - **Conceptual pivot** in Covenant Theology courses on Mosaic administration, CoG/CoW, and pactum salutis.
 - **Polemic resource** against substantial Mosaic republication and unmoored sensus plenior.
 - **Preaching aid** for integrating prophetic indictment, hope, and Christ's fulfillment.
