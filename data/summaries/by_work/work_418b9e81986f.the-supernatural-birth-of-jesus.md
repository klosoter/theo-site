### TITLE
The Supernatural Birth of Jesus - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton theology reacting to liberal criticism and naturalistic readings of the Gospels; Warfield writes within orthodox Reformed evangelicalism defending traditional propositional doctrines against modernist reductionism.
- **Central thesis**
 - The virgin birth is a genuine supernatural fact attested by Scripture, indispensable to orthodox Christology: it secures the true Incarnation of the eternal Son without confusion or loss of deity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical appeal to the Gospel narratives (chiefly Matthew and Luke) and their theological import: the narratives are not legendary accretions but reliable witnesses to a miraculous event.
 - Logical-theological defence: naturalistic alternatives (paternity theories, mythologies, or purely symbolic readings) fail to account for Christ's sinlessness, messianic identity, and the continuity of divine personhood.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: the virgin birth must be read in continuity with the doctrines of the **eternal Sonship** and the **hypostatic union** - the Son is pre-existent and assumes human nature by miracle without divesting divine attributes.
 - Polemic against modern critical and kenotic proposals that attempt to explain the humanity of Jesus by diminution or evolutionary emergence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture and classical creedal formulations (implicitly Chalcedon).
 - Contemporary critics and liberal theologians who posit naturalistic origins or symbolic readings of the birth narratives.
 - Kenotic theologians and those urging a reinterpretation of divine attributes in the Incarnation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, person and nature, sinlessness), Trinity (eternal Sonship), revelation (authority of the Gospels), soteriology (implications of the God-man for atonement).
 - Engages issues raised under topics: **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation** (insisting Sonship is prior to and not produced by the birth) and **Kenosis theories and critiques** (rejecting ontological loss of deity).
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the virgin birth as a non-negotiable, scripturally grounded hinge between eternal Sonship and the personal, sinless Incarnation - a supernatural act safeguarding both the full deity and true humanity of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong epistemic confidence in the Gospel witness as historical-theological testimony; emphasis on the necessity of miracle to secure orthodox Christological claims.
 - Insistence that the virgin birth is not an isolated curiosity but integral to the doctrine of the God-man.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal attempts to naturalize Jesus' origins by showing their theological impoverishment (they undermine sinlessness, atoning efficacy, and personal identity).
 - Contrasts with kenotic and functional Christologies by refusing any ontological diminution of the Son; affirms communicatio idiomatum without loss of divine attributes.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Clarifies language distinguishing eternal relational Sonship from incarnational status - Sonship is eternal, the birth is an historical act of incarnation.
 - Reasserts classical categories (hypostatic union, incommunicable attributes) against modern re-descriptions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical defenses of the virgin birth and against kenotic revisions; used as a concise, rigorous polemic in seminary teaching.
 - Less traction among liberal scholars but persistently cited by those defending classical Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to combine exegesis, dogmatic precision, and polemic; remains a go-to concise defense of the virgin birth and a resource for rebutting kenotic or naturalistic re-readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Virgin birth / miraculous generation** - Warfield treats this as a historical supernatural act necessary for orthodox Christology.
- **Incarnation** - The eternal Son assuming human nature by miracle, resulting in the hypostatic union without loss of divinity.
- **Eternal Sonship** - The Son's relational identity within the Trinity prior to and independent of the incarnation; the birth does not create sonship.
- **Hypostatic union** - The personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; central explanatory category for Warfield.
- **Kenosis / kenotic theories** - Theories positing divine self-emptying; Warfield critiques ontological readings that imply deprivation of divine attributes.
 - Distinguishes genuine kenosis as volitional humility from ontological loss - accepts the former (Phil 2 language) but rejects the latter when used as metaphysical account.
- **Divine attributes / incommunicable attributes** - Warfield insists these remain integral to the Son even in the Incarnation.
- **Naturalistic explanations / myth theory** - Generic label for critics who secularize the birth narratives; Warfield argues they are exegetically and theologically inadequate.
- **Sinlessness of Christ** - Treated as tied to miraculous generation and the unique mode of Incarnation.
- **Person and nature distinction** - Uses this classical distinction to guard against modalizing or confounding the two natures.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - Employed to explain how properties of both natures are ascribed to the one person without confusion.
- **Authority of the Gospels** - Warfield appeals to Gospel testimony as trustworthy for doctrinal formulation.
- **Accommodation** - Warfield resists reading the narratives merely as divine accommodation; he affirms their historical truth.
- **Ontological kenosis** - Term used critically to reject theories that reengineer divine ontology to explain Jesus' humanity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise **definition source** for the theological significance of the virgin birth and its relation to eternal Sonship.
 - As a **polemic resource** against kenotic and naturalistic reinterpretations in systematic and historical theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Matthew and Luke within confessional commitments to the hypostatic union and the incommunicable attributes.
