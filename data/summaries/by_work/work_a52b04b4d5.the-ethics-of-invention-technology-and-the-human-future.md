### TITLE
**The Ethics Of Invention: Technology And The Human Future - Sheila Jasanoff (2016)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2016 amid rapid advances in genome editing (CRISPR), AI, surveillance tech, and increased public debate about algorithmic governance.
 - Situated in Science and Technology Studies (STS); author is a leading STS scholar (Harvard Kennedy School) known for work on co-production and civic epistemologies.
 - Responds to widespread claims that ethical frameworks or expert technocracy alone can safely steer novel technologies.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Technology-making is also world-making: inventions reshape who we are and what we owe one another; therefore ethics must be institutional, political, and democratic, not merely individual or abstract.
 - The core problem is governance: how to design public institutions and practices that anticipate, evaluate, and constrain technological transformations in line with plural social values.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary technological discourse is dominated by promissory narratives and narrow expert control that obscure value-laden choices.
 - Analytic tools: employs STS concepts (co-production, sociotechnical imaginaries, civic epistemology) to show how knowledge and social order emerge together.
 - Prescription: ethical response requires:
 - institutionalized deliberation and anticipatory governance,
 - distributed accountability across publics, experts, and states,
 - norms and "constitutions" (procedures and infrastructures) that embed humility and responsiveness.
 - Case studies: genetics (CRISPR), predictive policing, autonomous vehicles, surveillance-used to illustrate how choices lock in moral commitments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - STS interlocutors (Latour, Callon-style analytic lineage) and policy scholars; engages bioethics, legal scholars, technology entrepreneurs, and civil society actors.
 - Draws on histories of regulation, comparative national responses, and empirical governance practices rather than abstract moral theory.

- **Doctrines treated (theological translation)**
 - Implicit engagement with doctrines relevant to theology:
 - **Anthropology**: what counts as human agency and dignity under technological mediation.
 - **Ethics**: virtue/responsibility, distributive justice, solidarity.
 - **Creation and stewardship**: human alteration of nature and attendant responsibilities.
 - **Eschatology/practical hope**: promissory rhetoric about futures and its governance.

- **Closing line**
 - Ethics of invention insists that we treat technological design as constitutional and communal work: the moral life of societies depends on how we democratize the power to invent.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats invention itself as an ethical act that configures human capacities and social relations, not merely a problem to be regulated after the fact.
 - Moves the ethical focus from individual actors or abstract principles to **institutions, practices, and civic imagination**.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with technocratic solutions that defer to experts and with purely procedural bioethics checklists; argues both fail to reckon with politics embedded in technical choices.
 - Critiques techno-optimism and techno-pessimism for overlooking how governance shapes outcomes.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reiterates and operationalizes STS tools for ethics:
 - **Co-production** reframed as a site for ethical intervention.
 - Emphasis on **sociotechnical imaginaries** as normative drivers of invention.
 - Calls for **constitutional approaches** to technology governance (procedures that structure power and accountability).

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Widely cited in interdisciplinary ethics, law, and STS; uptake in theological circles is growing where tech ethics intersects with social doctrine, creation care, and anthropology.
 - Useful corrective to theological tendencies that treat technology as neutral tool or only individual moral choice; prompts congregational and ecclesial reflection on civic structures and stewardship.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides an accessible framework for linking empirical cases to normative claims.
 - Valuable for courses on theology and technology, public theology, and ethics: encourages focus on institutional design, civic deliberation, and the theological import of techno-cultural imaginaries.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Co-production**
 - Science/technology and social order are produced together; ethical attention must attend to that mutual shaping.

- **Sociotechnical imaginaries**
 - Shared visions of desirable futures that guide invention and governance; theological analogue: public eschatologies and imaginaries of flourishing.

- **Civic epistemology**
 - The public ways of knowing that legitimate expertise and policy decisions; theological use: ecclesial epistemic practices and public witness.

- **Constitutional approach / constitutionalization**
 - Designing enduring procedures and institutions to govern technologies, embedding rights, responsibilities, and review.

- **Anticipatory governance**
 - Institutional practices to foresee and shape trajectories (foresight, assessment, adaptive regulation).

- **Promissory discourse**
 - Rhetoric of technological salvation or inevitability that silences contestation; parallels with theological promises and false hopes.

- **Technocratic paternalism**
 - Delegation of value-laden choices to experts; target of Jasanoff's critique.

- **Public reason / democratic accountability**
 - Norm requiring that technological decisions be open to plural deliberation and public justification.

- **Responsibility (collective and distributed)**
 - Shifts responsibility from individual inventors to networks: firms, states, publics, and institutions.

- **Ethics of invention (as phrase)**
 - Ethics embedded in the design process, institutional choices, and governance architectures.

- **Precaution vs. innovation tensions**
 - Negotiating harms and benefits without defaulting to either stifling caution or boundless experimentation.

- **Sociotechnical lock-in**
 - How early design and policy choices create path dependencies with moral consequences.

- **Accountability mechanisms**
 - Transparency, oversight, redress, and participatory mechanisms to check power of inventors.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for teaching ethics of technology: clarifies that invention is normative and political.
- As a **polemic** against technocratic or solely principle-based approaches in both secular and theological ethics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating institutional/constitutional thinking into theological reflections on creation, agency, and public responsibility.
