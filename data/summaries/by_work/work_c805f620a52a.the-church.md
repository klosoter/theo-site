### TITLE
The Church - Hans Küng

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-World War II Catholic renewal and the Vatican II era (1960s-1970s). Küng writes as a leading voice of conciliar, historical-critical Catholic theology committed to aggiornamento, ecumenism, and reform; his work engages the immediate theological debates provoked by Vatican II documents, especially Lumen gentium and Unitatis redintegratio.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To reconceive the nature, authority, and mission of the Church so it coheres with Scripture, patristic tradition, historical development, and the demands of modernity - resisting both rigid ultramontanist institutionalism and purely voluntaristic privatizations of faith.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: traditional institutionalist models (hierarchical-monarchical) have produced rigidity, clericalism, and ecumenical obstruction.
 - Retrieval: recovery of biblical and patristic images - people of God, communion (communio), body of Christ, sacrament - as corrective lenses.
 - Systematic proposal: a balanced ecclesiology that emphasizes **communion**, **service**, **sacramentality**, and **mission**, with corresponding structural implications (collegiality, greater lay participation, synodality).
 - Authority and reform: he argues for historically informed limits on magisterial claims (notably on infallibility) and for structures that allow doctrinal development and accountability.
 - Ecumenical and pastoral implications: contends that genuine unity requires structural humility, mutual recognition, and convergent reform rather than unilateral claims of supremacy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, patristics (Augustine, Gregory), medieval and modern church doctrine, Vatican II documents, contemporary theologians (e.g., Karl Rahner, Yves Congar), Protestant and Orthodox ecclesiologies; he also interacts polemically with ultramontane and neo-scholastic defenders of centralized papal authority.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (primary), authority/magisterium, primacy and collegiality, sacramentology (church as sacrament), revelation and tradition (development), ministry and ordination, laity, ecumenism, conscience.
- **Closing line:** Küng seeks a historically grounded, ecumenically responsible ecclesiology that reconfigures authority and structure so the Church can be authentically the communio of believers and effective witness in the modern world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on the Church as **communion (communio)** and **people of God** over purely institutional/hierarchical categories.
 - Integration of historical-critical method into normative ecclesiology: doctrines must show continuity with roots and intelligibility within historical development.
 - Emphasis on **reformability** of structures and doctrines as intrinsic to the Church's life.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct challenge to ultramontanism and absolutist readings of papal primacy and infallibility.
 - Counters neo-scholastic juridical models by retrieving patristic relational and sacramental images.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulation of a dynamic tension between **institution** and **event/communion** without collapsing one into the other.
 - Use of ecumenical criteria (mutual recognition, conciliarity) as standards for legitimate ecclesial claims.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential among liberal and conciliar-minded theologians, ecumenical dialogues, and reform movements; controversial with Vatican authorities and conservative circles.
 - Contributed to postconciliar debates on collegiality, lay ministry, and the limits of magisterial authority; played a role in shaping ecumenical conversations with Protestants and Orthodox.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact, programmatic exemplar of postconciliar Catholic ecclesiology that balances tradition and reform.
 - Valuable for courses on ecclesiology, ecumenism, and authority because it models historical-critical retrieval applied to doctrinal revision.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Church / Ekklesia:** communal assembly called and sent; not merely institutional authority.
- **People of God:** juridical and theological re-centering of the laity within the Church's identity.
- **Communion (Communio):** relational ontology of the Church; basis for ecumenical engagement and internal structures.
- **Magisterium:** teaching office; Küng insists on historically informed limits and responsibility to Scripture and tradition.
- **Primacy / Collegiality:** critique of unilateral papal absolutism; defense of episcopal collegial governance and synodal structures.
- **Sacramentality:** the Church as visible sign and instrument of salvation; sacramental logic extends to structures and ministries.
- **Development of doctrine:** continuity-plus-change model; doctrines evaluated by historical coherence and pastoral fruitfulness.
- **Infallibility (critique):** skeptical, historically and theologically qualified assessment of claims to uncontestable doctrinal pronouncements.
- **Conciliarism / Vatican II retrieval:** appeal to councils and conciliar structures as corrective to centralized power.
- **Laity / Ministry:** advocacy for expanded lay roles and sacramental/pastoral participation; critique of clericalism.
- **Ecumenism:** unity through mutual recognition, doctrinal convergence, and reform, not absorption or domination.
- **Historical-critical method:** normative tool for doctrinal assessment and ecclesial self-understanding.
- **Authority and accountability:** calls for structures that allow critique, renewal, and shared responsibility.
