### TITLE
The Deep Things of God: How the Trinity Changes Everything (Fred Sanders)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - First ed. 2010; revised ed. in the wake of the late-20th-century Trinitarian retrieval among evangelicals.
 - Aimed at renewing evangelical doctrine and practice by retrieving **pro-Nicene** dogmatics within an evangelical piety.
- **Central thesis**
 - The gospel is irreducibly **Trinitarian**: salvation means participation in the life of the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. Evangelical instincts are best when they are consciously and confessionally Nicene.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Evangelical piety already presupposes the Trinity (prayer to the Father, through Christ, by the Spirit; Scripture, mission, assurance).
 - **Biblical basis**: progressive OT disclosure fulfilled in NT revelation; missions reveal and correspond to eternal processions.
 - **Classical grammar**: ontological vs economic Trinity; inseparable operations with ordered personal taxis; eternal generation and spiration anchor missions.
 - **Soteriology**: adoption, union with Christ, and Spirit indwelling are triune gifts; Christian life is doxological participation.
 - **Pastoral practice**: catechesis and worship must name and narrate the triune God.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Scripture; Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed; Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine; Calvin, Owen, Edwards; Bavinck; Barth and Rahner (critically received); evangelical hymnody and catechesis. Engages modern debates (e.g., EFS) by retrieval rather than polemic.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of God (simplicity, immutability implied), **Trinity** (ontological/economic, processions-missions, inseparable operations), **Pneumatology** (person and deity of the Spirit), revelation and hermeneutics, Christology (Son as eternally begotten), soteriology (adoption, union), ecclesial practice.
- **Closing line**
 - The gospel introduces believers into the **life of God**, so only a fully **Nicene, evangelical** confession can sustain evangelical faith and practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes the Trinity the deep structure of evangelical doctrines of Scripture, salvation, and prayer.
 - Strong retrieval of **eternal generation and spiration** as the firm trinitarian grammar for missions.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Resists reducing Trinity to social models or to mere soteriological roles; criticizes any **one person** talk for the Godhead (contra imprecise apologetic formulations, e.g., some Van Tilian shorthand).
 - Rejects **EFS** as a reading of eternity; affirms taxis without positing an eternal authority-submission relation of wills in God.
 - Nuances **Rahner's Rule** with pro-Nicene safeguards (economic truly reveals but does not exhaust the immanent).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Vivid evangelical framing: Father-through-Son-in-the-Spirit as a rule of prayer and reading Scripture.
 - Re-centers inseparable operations as a pastoral, not merely speculative, doctrine.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used across Reformed and broader evangelical seminaries for Trinity and soteriology; a touchstone text in the evangelical pro-Nicene retrieval and in critiques of EFS.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear bridge between catechesis and classical dogma; reliable map for connecting biblical exegesis, doctrine, and devotion without collapsing ontological into economic Trinity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ontological vs Economic Trinity**: Who God eternally is (ad intra) vs how God acts in salvation history (ad extra); economic missions are grounded in eternal processions.
- **Processions (eternal generation and spiration)**:
 - **Eternal generation**: the Son's eternal origin from the Father; basis for the Son's mission.
 - **Eternal spiration**: the Spirit's eternal origin from the Father (and from the Father through the Son); basis for Pentecost and indwelling.
- **Missions**: Sending of Son and Spirit in history that manifest (not create) their eternal relations.
- **Inseparable operations**: The three act as one cause in all external works, with an ordered manifestation (from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit).
- **Appropriation**: Attributing works to a person fittingly (e.g., sanctification to the Spirit) without dividing the divine act.
- **Person (hypostasis)**: Who the Father, Son, Spirit are in real distinction; cautions against calling the one God a single person.
- **Essence (ousia)**: The one undivided divine being; unity of will and power.
- **Rahner's Rule**: Economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity; received with classical safeguards.
- **Barth's reformulation**: Emphasis on revelation of God as triune, received here while maintaining classical processional grammar.
- **Perichoresis**: Mutual indwelling of the persons; underwrites unity without confusion.
- **Spirit's person and deity**: The Spirit is fully God, personally distinct; the one who indwells believers and unites them to Christ.
- **Biblical revelation OT/NT**: OT veiled hints; NT clarity in Christ and Pentecost; progressive disclosure coherent with Nicene faith.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**: Critiqued; obedience of the Son pertains to the economy, not to an eternal subordination of will.
- **Van Til's one person language**: Rejected as misleading; God is one essence in three persons, not one person.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definition-source and catechetical primer for classical Trinitarian grammar in evangelical contexts.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking soteriology (adoption, union) to triune processions and missions.
 - As a polemical resource against EFS and imprecise one-person formulations while offering constructive alternatives.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Scripture with the Father-through-Son-in-the-Spirit rule.
