### TITLE
Twelve Anathemas Against Nestorius - Cyril of Alexandria (circa 428-431 CE)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late antique Christological controversy in the Eastern Roman Empire; immediate context is Cyril of Alexandria's response to Nestorius (Patriarch of Constantinople) and his perceived theo-anthropological partitioning of Christ. Culminates in the Council of Ephesus (431), where Cyril's anathemas were ratified.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the unity of the Person of the Incarnate Word against Nestorian duality; insist the Savior is a single hypostasis in whom the divine Word became flesh, warranting the title Theotokos for Mary.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Opening premise: the reality of the Incarnation commits one to speak of the Word's assuming human nature without division of person.
 - Series of twelve condemnations that target formulations implying a separation between the divine and human persons in Christ.
 - Each anathema negates a specific Nestorian formula or implication (e.g., calling Mary Christotokos only; saying the Word and the man are two subjects).
 - Positive counter-assertions: the Word is the single subject of the incarnate actions (birth, suffering, resurrection), and divine and human natures are united without confusion in one hypostasis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary opponent: Nestorius; secondary influence: Theodore of Mopsuestia (Antiochene exegesis).
 - Cyril draws on Alexandrian patristic practice (Origen, Athanasius by reception), scriptural exposition (Gospels, Pauline texts), and philosophical categories (hypostasis, physis, prosopon) as exegetical tools.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (incarnation, person, natures), ecclesiology (title Theotokos), soteriology implicitly (how God saves), hermeneutics (literal vs. typological reading).
- **Closing line:** At stake is the assertion that the Word of God became flesh in one indivisible personal reality, so Christ is to be confessed as one Person who is both God and man - a foundation for orthodox Christology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The famous formula of the "one incarnate nature (mia physis) of the Word of God" emphasizing concrete personal unity rather than abstract metaphysical division.
 - Stress that the Word is the single subject of incarnational predicates (e.g., "was born," "suffered"), a rhetorical-theological strategy to avoid Nestorian subject plurality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Polemic against Antiochene tendency (exemplified by Nestorius/Theodore) to prioritize the distinction of natures to the point of separating persons.
 - Corrects earlier Alexandrian ambiguities by insisting on the personal unity of the Logos in the incarnation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tactical use of existing terms (hypostasis, prosopon, physis) in new conjunctive ways to assert unity without collapsing natures.
 - The anathemas function less as systematic metaphysics than as juridical-proclamatory formulas aimed at terminological clarity in liturgical and confessional language.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Ratified at Ephesus; Cyril hailed in Eastern Orthodoxy as a champion of theotokos and orthodox Christology.
 - Western and Chalcedonian traditions later read Cyril as compatible with the Chalcedonian Definition, though debate persisted over his "mia physis" formula; Chalcedon (451) sought to harmonize Cyril's unity-language with a clear "two natures" doctrine.
 - Reformed and Protestant theologians have used Cyril selectively as an anti-Nestorian witness for the unity of Christ's person.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of polemical precision and exegetical deployment in Christological disputes.
 - Pedagogical exemplar for articulating personal unity in the incarnation while guarding the reality of two natures.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anathema:** A formal ecclesial condemnation; Cyril's twelve anathemas ban particular formulas deemed heretical.
- **Hypostasis:** Person or subsistence; Cyril uses it to affirm one personal subject in whom natures unite.
- **Physis (nature):** Used in Cyril's contentious phrase "one incarnate physis of the Word"; he means the one personal mode of existence of the Word in the flesh.
- **Prosopon (face/persona):** Relates to how the person of Christ is presented; Cyril emphasizes a single prosopon of the Incarnate Word.
- **Theotokos:** "God-bearer" - defended as scripturally and doctrinally necessary to preserve Christological unity.
- **Nestorianism:** Label for the set of doctrines Cyril anathematizes - primarily a perceived separation of persons in Christ.
- **Union of natures / hypostatic union:** Cyril's locus: natures are distinct but united in one hypostasis without confusion.
- **Mixture/confusion:** The error Cyril avoids - he rejects both Nestorian division and any suggestion that the divine and human natures are mixed into a single blended nature.
- **Subject of predication:** Cyril's argument that the Word is the subject to which incarnational predicates are truly ascribed (e.g., "the Word suffered" in the economy).
- **Theopaschism (related):** Concern whether God can suffer; Cyril's language grants that the Word (God) suffered in the flesh, a tension later hashed out in patristic discourse.
- **Scriptural exegesis:** Cyril's method gives priority to Gospel language about the incarnation and to typological-Alexandrian reading patterns.
- **Council of Ephesus (historic use):** The anathemas serve as the confessional backbone of Ephesus' condemnation of Nestorius.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for orthodox Christology (one person, incarnate Word) and as groundwork for Chalcedonian formulations.
- As a **polemic** and juridical model for condemning and clarifying heresy in conciliar contexts.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating Alexandrian methods of scriptural Christological interpretation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in later debates reconciling personal unity with two natures (key for patristic, Byzantine, and Western systematic receptions).
