### TITLE
On the Social Element in Religion - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 18th / early 19th century German Protestantism; Schleiermacher writing in the wake of Enlightenment criticism, Kantian philosophy, Pietism, and ecclesiastical rationalism. Dialogue with Reformed and Lutheran sacramental traditions and emergent liberal theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Religion is fundamentally a communal, social phenomenon: the religious life is primarily the shared cultivation and expression of the "feeling of absolute dependence." The social element is not accidental but constitutive for worship, sacraments, and ecclesial identity.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Religion defined psychologically as a universal, primary feeling (the consciousness of dependence) that requires expression and formation.
 - This feeling finds its fullest shape and stability only in social forms: community worship, common rites, and institutional memory.
 - Sacraments and public rites (baptism, Lord's Supper) function as communal means for nurturing and externalizing the religious feeling rather than as purely juridical or mechanistic conveyors of grace.
 - The church (Gemeinde) is the organized, historical locus in which individual feeling is cultivated, reflected, and transmitted.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Responds to Enlightenment rationalists and pietists who privatize religion; converses with Kantian moral and epistemological moves; positions itself against both mechanical confessional dogmatism (orthodoxy/ scholasticism) and reductive rationalism.
 - Implicit polemics with Reformed covenantal assumptions (Calvinism) and Baptists on sacramental efficacy and mode.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (central), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), revelation (as inner religious consciousness vs propositional content), regeneration (psychological/ethical development more than forensic imputation), covenant implicitly reconceived as social-religious belonging.
- **Closing line:** Schleiermacher reframes religion as essentially communal feeling and worship: church and sacraments are formative social practices that cultivate and perpetuate religious consciousness rather than mechanical dispensers of supernatural change.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Religion as primary feeling (consciousness of absolute dependence) that is social by nature.
 - The church as the organ for shaping religious feeling historically and ritually.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against individualistic rationalism: restores public, communal dimensions of faith.
 - Against confessional/forensic sacramentalism: rejects the notion of sacraments as automatic channels of grace; emphasizes formative and symbolic efficacy.
 - Against strict credobaptist claims: baptism's meaning is essentially communal/covenantal rather than simply a believer's individual testimony.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Social element" as a theological category making ecclesial practice constitutive of religion.
 - Recasting "efficacy" of sacramental rites in terms of religious formation and communal recognition rather than immediate ontological change.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major influence on liberal Protestant theology, modern ecclesiology, and theological hermeneutics.
 - Criticized by conservative confessionalists and revival movements for undermining objective sacramental grace and doctrinal certainties.
 - Provided resources for later social-trinitarian and communal models of church life.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the role of communal worship and rites in religious formation.
 - Offers a mediating position for discussing baptism (paedo- vs credo-) and sacramental meaning in plural contexts.
 - Stimulates interdisciplinary work linking theology, sociology, and psychology of religion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Social element:** The constitutive communal dimension of religion; religion as formed and expressed in communal practices.
- **Feeling of absolute dependence:** Schleiermacher's definitional locus for religion; a primary subjective religious consciousness.
- **Gemeinde (church/community):** Institutional and liturgical body that cultivates and transmits religious feeling.
- **Sacrament as formative sign:** Rituals (baptism, Eucharist) function primarily to form and witness to religious feeling, not as automatic channels of grace.
- **Baptism (Schleiermacher's use):**
 - Emphasized as a communal initiation into the church's life.
 - Defended infant baptism as legitimate social inclusion while denying instant ontological regeneration; efficacy linked to subsequent development of religious consciousness.
 - Recognizes believer's baptism as valid as personal testimony but subordinates mode to social function.
- **Regeneration:** Understood as ethical and psychological maturation of religious feeling rather than a single forensic event effected ex opere operato.
- **Efficacy:** Recast from metaphysical transfer to pedagogical/communal effectiveness - rites shape disposition over time.
- **Revelation:** Primarily inner, experienced consciousness rather than exclusively propositional revelation.
- **Covenant (reinterpreted):** Less juridical contract, more corporate identity and practice binding persons into communal religious life.
- **Public worship:** The normative environment for cultivating and stabilizing religious feeling.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for ecclesiology emphasizing communal formation rather than doctrinal criterion alone.
- As a **polemical resource** against both mechanistic sacramentalism and privatizing rationalism - often invoked in debates over baptism mode and the meaning/efficacy of infant baptism.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for interpreting sacraments as social-liturgical practices that form religious identity.
