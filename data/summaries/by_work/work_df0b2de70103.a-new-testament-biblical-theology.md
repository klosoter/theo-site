### TITLE
A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New - Gregory K. Beale

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the early 21st century (Baker Academic); arises within contemporary evangelical, Reformed scholarship seeking synthesis of canonical, typological, and intertextual methods. Dialogues with canonical criticism (Brevard Childs), intertextuality (Richard B. Hays), and redemptive-historical traditions (Geerhardus Vos).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament must be read as the theological unfolding and fulfillment of the Old Testament; NT authors and Jesus interpret the OT typologically and christologically, so NT doctrine (Christology, ecclesiology, eschatology) is intelligible only as continuity and transformation of OT covenant promises.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Methodology chapters: defends a canonical, intertextual, typological hermeneutic that respects historical exegesis while foregrounding theological continuity.
 - Thematic development: traces major OT motifs (temple, priesthood, sacrifice, land, people, kingdom, covenant, new creation) as they are reinterpreted and fulfilled in the Gospels, Acts, Paul, the General Epistles, and Revelation.
 - Case studies: detailed exegesis of key NT texts showing OT citation, allusion, midrashic development, and typological fulfillment.
 - Synthetic chapters: articulate the NT's theology of Christ, church, sacraments, and eschatology as integrally shaped by OT revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Brevard Childs, Richard B. Hays, N. T. Wright, Vosian redemptive-historical school, and classic Reformed and patristic typological interpreters; engages historical-critical scholarship but resists fragmentation of canonical unity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (canon), covenant and covenantal progression, Christology (fulfillment and typology), kingdom of God, inaugurated eschatology and consummation, ecclesiology (church as temple/new Israel), sacramental theology (baptism/Eucharist as eschatological signs), typology and intertextual hermeneutics.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** The New Testament is best read as the theologically coherent unfolding and fulfillment of OT covenantal promises in Christ, with its theology grounded in intertextual, typological continuity that reshapes Israelite institutions into the eschatological church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Systematic articulation of an intertextual-canonical method that makes typology central and normative for NT exegesis.
 - Persistent reading of temple, priesthood, and sacrifice motifs as transposed into Christ and the church (church as true temple/new tabernacle).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against strict historical-critical separations of Testaments; critiques reductionist midrash or purely literary accounts that sever theological continuity.
 - Nuanced engagement with N. T. Wright and Hays: shares interest in continuity but insists on more conservative readings of covenantal promises and sacramental/temporal continuity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tight integration of "typology" with robust intertextual methodology-moves beyond loose typological talk to a disciplined taxonomy of fulfillment, anticipation, and recapitulation.
 - Use of "unfolding" to capture both continuity and transformation across covenants.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a textbook and reference for biblical theology and NT exegesis.
 - Praised for methodological clarity and exegetical richness; some critics argue it tends toward over-systematizing typology or understating certain discontinuities emphasized by some historical-critical scholars.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a comprehensive model for reading the NT through the OT with careful exegesis; invaluable for preaching, seminary courses, and for theologians constructing systematic accounts rooted in Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Intertextuality:** NT authors' use of OT texts as theological script; Beale details citation, allusion, echo, and midrashic reshaping.
- **Typology:** Positive, normative hermeneutic-OT persons/events are ontologically anticipatory of Christ and realized in the NT.
- **Unfolding (of covenant):** The progressive realization of covenant promises culminating in Christ and the new creation.
- **Fulfillment:** Not merely end but transformation-OT promises refigured in Christ and the church.
- **Temple motif:** Temple imagery relocated to Christ and the church; Eden/temple/new creation nexus emphasized.
- **New creation:** Central eschatological frame-Christ inaugurates covenantal new creation realized in resurrection and Spirit.
- **Kingdom of God:** Inaugurated eschatology-present reality and future consummation, rooted in covenant fulfillment.
- **Christ as true Israel/temple/son:** Christ recapitulates Israel's vocation and institutions as the definitive covenantant figure.
- **Canon hermeneutic:** Reading NT within the canon's theological coherence; canonical shape governs theological inference.
- **Sacramental typology:** Baptism and Lord's Supper as signs tied to OT sacrificial/temple realities and eschatological consummation.
- **Covenant continuity:** Emphasizes organic continuity between covenants while allowing typological transformation.
- **Eschatological recapitulation:** Historical events are theological recapitulations of earlier covenantal patterns.
- **Midrashic reading (reclaimed):** Recognizes Jewish hermeneutical forms in NT usage but disciplines them within canonical theology.
- **Canon as theological unity:** The canon functions as the decisive shape of biblical theology, not merely a collection of texts.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for evangelical typological and intertextual biblical theology.
 - As an exegetical model for reading NT texts through OT backgrounds in preaching and classroom exegesis.
 - As a conceptual pivot in debates over covenantal continuity, sacramental interpretation, and inaugurated eschatology.
