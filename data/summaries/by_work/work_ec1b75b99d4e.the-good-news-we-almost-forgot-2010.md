### TITLE
The Good News We Almost Forgot (Kevin DeYoung, 2010)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 2010 amid a renewed Reformed/evangelical interest in gospel clarity; reacts to both moralistic therapeutic tendencies and antinomian strains in popular Christianity.
 - Pastoral-theological, written for church leaders and laypeople facing debates over assurance, holiness, and what it means to "believe."
- **Central thesis**
 - The gospel has been misconstrued or underemphasized: true gospel proclamation centers on justification by faith in Christ, which simultaneously secures believers positionally (definitive sanctification) and calls them into ongoing moral transformation (progressive sanctification).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary Christianity often practices "easy believism" (faith without repentance or ensuing holiness) or conversely moralistic religion that confuses works with salvation.
 - Definition: clear explication of the gospel as forensic justification-Christ's righteousness imputed to sinners who trust in Him.
 - Consequence: from justification flows both assurance and the mandate/ability for sanctification; sanctification must be considered both definitive (what Christ accomplished in union with believers) and progressive (habitual growth conforming to Christ).
 - Application: pastoral counsel on preaching, discipleship, assurance, and church discipline that keeps justification central while fostering real holiness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary appeal to Scripture (Pauline soteriology), formative use of Reformation categories (imputation, union with Christ).
 - Dialogues implicitly with contemporary evangelical and pop-Christian tendencies rather than with specific academic opponents.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, sanctification (definitive and progressive), union with Christ, assurance, repentance, faith, imputed righteousness, and pastoral theology.
- **Closing line (theological center)**
 - The gospel is good news both for sinners (justification now) and for saints (holiness thereafter): Christ saves and shapes his people by grace through faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight coupling of assurance and imperatives: assurance must rest on Christ's finished work, not on present performance, yet true assurance produces visible growth in holiness.
 - Explicit double-frame of sanctification: refuses the either/or of "position only" versus "behavior only" accounts; insists on both definitive (positional) and progressive (practical) sanctification as gospel-corollaries.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects easy-believism/cheap grace by stressing repentance and visible transformation as fruits of genuine faith.
 - Pushes back against moralistic religion that makes sanctification the basis for justification or assurance.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Uses everyday pastoral language to reframe classic soteriological categories for non-specialist readers without collapsing forensic and transformative aspects of salvation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed-evangelical ministry contexts as a concise corrective to shallow gospel teaching; helped popular pastors and small groups recenter sermons and discipleship on justification-sancitifcation dynamics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for pastors, small-group leaders, and seminarians as a portable, pastoral synthesis that clarifies how union with Christ secures both acquittal and sanctifying power.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel**
 - The act of God in Christ that both declares sinners righteous (justification) and begins their transformation (sanctification).
- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration of righteousness by God on the basis of Christ's atoning work, received by faith alone.
- **Definitive sanctification**
 - Positional holiness: the believer's status as set apart in Christ at conversion (equivalent to "in Christ" reality).
 - Often paired with "positional sanctification" or "sanctification once-for-all."
- **Progressive sanctification**
 - Ongoing, experiential growth in holiness and conformity to Christ throughout the Christian life.
 - Emphasizes means of grace (Word, Spirit, church discipline) and real struggle.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The nexus tying justification and sanctification together: believers are united to Christ, hence share in his death, resurrection, righteousness, and life.
- **Imputed righteousness**
 - Christ's righteousness credited to the believer for justification; distinguished from imparted righteousness evident in progressive sanctification.
- **Assurance**
 - Confident trust in salvation rooted primarily in Christ's finished work and promises, not in fluctuating personal performance.
- **Repentance**
 - Necessary turning from sin that accompanies saving faith; not optional if one claims genuine belief.
- **Easy-believism**
 - A popular term for faith divorced from repentance and consequent holiness; a primary foil in DeYoung's critique.
- **Antinomianism**
 - The opposite error: denying the need for obedience on the basis of grace; DeYoung rejects this while guarding grace.
- **Mortification and vivification**
 - Practical Christian disciplines of putting sin to death (mortification) and cultivating new life in the Spirit (vivification).
- **Means of grace**
 - Word, sacraments, prayer, and community as conduits by which progressive sanctification occurs.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Pastoral definition source: a concise restatement of gospel basics for preaching and counseling on assurance and holiness.
 - Polemic: standard popular polemic against easy-believism and antinomian tendencies within evangelicalism.
 - Practical/discipleship model: a pastoral framework linking definitive positional truths to daily growth in holiness and means of grace.
