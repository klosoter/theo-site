### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology (co-edited by Scott Swain, 2020)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2020 as part of Oxford Handbooks series: a synoptic, interdisciplinary, international survey of contemporary Reformed theology.
 - Arises in a moment of renewed confessional interest within global Reformed scholarship and institutional theological formation.
 - Intended audience: advanced students, scholars, seminary teachers across historical, systematic, biblical, and practical loci.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Handbook does not forward a single dogmatic thesis but coheres around the claim that **Reformed theology is a rigorous intellectual discipline (theologia as scientia)** shaped by distinctive principia (principles) - chiefly Scripture, covenantal categories, and confessional norms - and thus requires a disciplined theological method that is both confessional and scholarly.
 - The methodological problem treated explicitly: what are the principia of Reformed theology and how do they justify theological knowledge against modern scientism, fideism, and anti-systematic approaches?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Structural sweep: historical foundations → method and epistemology → major doctrines (Trinity, Christology, covenant, soteriology) → ethical, ecclesial, liturgical, and public-theological applications.
 - Thematic moves (esp. under "Theological Method / Principia Theology As Science"):
 - Identify and defend the principia (Scripture, creeds/tradition, reason disciplined by grace, covenantal grammar).
 - Define theological method as an integrative practice: exegetical fidelity → doctrinal formulation → systematic coherence → ecclesial articulation.
 - Reject both reductionist natural theology and anti-systematic suspicion; propose a mediating confessional scientia that is critical, historically informed, and apologetically aware.
 - Show how principia govern tasks across loci (biblical interpretation, dogmatics, pastoral theology).
 - Methodological tools emphasized: historical-theological sensitivity, analytic clarity, doctrinal loci, covenantal hermeneutic, and creedal norms.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and modern Reformed authorities invoked: John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Abraham Kuyper, B. B. Warfield; conversation partners include Karl Barth, modern critical scholarship, analytic theology, and contemporary confessional movements.
 - Sources: Scripture, Reformed confessions, patristic and scholastic resources, and recent philosophical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, doctrine of God (Trinity), Christology, covenant theology, soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments, eschatology, and moral/public theology - each with attention to methodological grounding.

- **Closing line**
 - The Handbook centers Reformed theology as a **confessional, covenantal scientia**: a disciplined, biblically-rooted, and publicly engaged system of theology whose principia govern interpretation, doctrine, and practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Explicit articulation of *principia* as methodological anchors for Reformed theology - not merely sources but normative starting points for theological knowledge.
 - Strong integration of confessional fidelity with contemporary scholarly standards (historical-critical awareness + analytic clarity).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushback against liberal historicism that displaces confessions, and against Barthian anti-systematicism that minimizes doctrinal continuity.
 - Critiques naive natural theology while allowing for disciplined, theologically constrained uses of reason and philosophy.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "theology as science" (scientia) in Reformed idiom: scientific in the classical sense of ordered, coherent knowledge grounded in principia, not in modern empirical scientism.
 - Emphasizes a covenantal grammar as hermeneutical pivot across biblical and systematic work.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Quickly became a reference work in Reformed seminaries and graduate programs; cited in methodological debates about confessional identity and academic standards.
 - Stimulated renewed conversations about integrating analytic methods, historical theology, and confessional commitments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a pedagogical synthesis and reference set for teaching dogmatics and method.
 - Durable resource for those defending confessional theology within the academy and church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principia** - normative starting points for theological inquiry (Scripture, creeds, covenantal categories); not neutral data but authoritative warrants.
- **Theology as scientia** - theology construed as coherent, ordered knowledge grounded in principia (classical sense of "science"), distinct from modern scientism.
- **Confessionalism** - commitment to confessions as ecclesial and doctrinal standards that shape hermeneutics and systematics.
- **Covenantal grammar** - hermeneutical framework that reads Scripture and doctrine through covenantal categories (promise, fulfillment, administration).
- **Exegetical-theological method** - integrated practice where close biblical exegesis is formative for systematic loci and vice versa.
- **Christocentrism** - doctrinal orientation that locates unity of theology in the person and work of Christ.
- **Analytic theology** - use of analytic philosophical tools for clarification and argumentative rigor within a confessional frame.
- **Normative/epistemic authority of Scripture** - Scripture as propositional, divine revelation that sustains theological scientia.
- **Tradition and creeds** - ecclesial memory and doctrinal formulations as mediating authorities for interpretation and teaching.
- **Dogmatics** - systematic ordering of doctrine as an intellectual and ecclesial task, disciplined by principia.
- **Public theology** - application of Reformed doctrinal commitments to social, political, and cultural contexts.
- **Natural theology (disciplined)** - a restrained place for reason and creation-talk, subordinated to revelation and principia.
- **Ecclesial epistemology** - knowledge of God as achieved within the believing community, not purely individualistic.
- **Methodological mediation** - the Handbook's posture of mediating between polar methodological extremes (e.g., liberal historicism vs. fideism).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed theological method and principia in seminars and methodological modules.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal historical-critical displacement of confessions and against anti-systematic trends.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for integrating biblical exegesis with dogmatic synthesis and a **conceptual pivot** in courses on dogmatics, ecclesiology, and public theology.
