### TITLE
**Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch** - John Webster (2003, early-wave theological interpretation; Reformed-catholic retrieval)
- Site usage: 3 references spanning 3 distinct topics.
- Topics cited here: Canon And Tradition; General And Special Revelation; Nature And Task Of Theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Early 2000s retrieval of classical dogmatics amid postliberal hermeneutics and ressourcement. Pushback against historicist reduction and evidentialist foundationalism in Scripture doctrine.
- **Central thesis:** Scripture is a sanctified, creaturely instrument of the triune God, whose self-revelation precedes and authorizes the biblical texts; the church reads these texts within the economy of grace under the rule of faith.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **1. Dogmatic location:** Doctrine of Scripture belongs within doctrine of God and revelation, not as an epistemic prolegomenon. The Word precedes words; theology begins with God.
 - **2. Revelation and sanctification:** Distinguishes but inseparably relates revelation (Gods self-communication) and Scripture (appointed means). Inspiration and sanctification denote the Spirits action rendering these writings fit to serve divine self-testimony.
 - **3. Canon:** Canon is primarily a divine act before an ecclesial act; the church recognizes what God has commissioned. Tradition is ministerial, normed by the prophetic-apostolic deposit.
 - **4. Reading in the economy of grace:** Holy readers for holy Scripture; habits of repentance, patience, and ecclesial submission; reading ruled by creed and directed to Christ.
 - **5. Scripture and theology:** Dogmatics is an act of hearing and repetition under Scripture. Reason is ministerial, not magisterial; exegesis is theological and ecclesial.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors:** Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Bavinck; heavy constructive resonance with Barth; engagement with Childs (canonical approach); contrasts with modern historicism and conservative evidentialism/foundationalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** **General and special revelation**, Trinity, providence, inspiration, sanctification, canon, church and tradition, illumination, authority, clarity and sufficiency, theological interpretation, **nature and task of theology**.
- **Closing line:** Scripture is holy because God sanctifies it to serve his self-giving; the church knows God by being gathered by the Spirit to hear in and through these canonical texts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** 
 - Scripture as **sanctified creature**; holiness of Scripture grounded in Gods act, not in textual properties alone.
 - Strong **economy-of-grace** frame: revelation, canon, reading, and theology coordinated within triune missions.
 - Reading as **moral and ecclesial practice**; the readers holiness matters for understanding.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against **foundationalism**: rejects treating Scripture as a neutral epistemic base prior to dogmatics.
 - Against **historicist captivity**: historical tools are ministerial; sense governed by divine subject matter and rule of faith.
 - Against **purely ecclesiocentric canon**: canon is first a divine commissioning, then ecclesial recognition.
- **Conceptual innovations / formulations:**
 - **Sanctification of Scripture** (as analog to inspiration) highlights the Spirits perfecting work on texts and readers.
 - **Ministerial reason** and **ruled reading** under the creed.
 - **Word precedes words**: revelation grounds Scripture and governs interpretation.
- **Reception / influence:** Catalytic within Reformed and Anglican circles for theological interpretation; widely assigned in seminarians courses on Scripture doctrine and prolegomena; shaped later Webster and allied projects in dogmatic theology.
- **Enduring value:** Re-centers Scripture doctrine on God and grace, integrating canon, tradition, and hermeneutics; provides a lean, theologically thick alternative to both apologetic bibliology and method-driven hermeneutics.
