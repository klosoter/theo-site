### TITLE
Kingdom of God - entry by Sinclair B. Ferguson in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair B. Ferguson et al.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in the late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed scholarly milieu and published within the New Dictionary of Theology, a conservative Protestant reference intended for pastors, students and scholars.
 - Ferguson writes from a Reformed, pastoral-theological perspective that seeks balance between academic exegesis and doctrinal usefulness.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The "Kingdom of God" is best understood as the sovereign rule of God enacted in Christ: a messianic, covenantal reign that is already inaugurated in Christ's person, ministry, death and resurrection but not yet consummated.
 - Proper interpretation must preserve both Christ's messianic self-consciousness and the kingdom's present reality without collapsing into either pure realized eschatology or an exclusively futurist/political kingdom.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Define kingdom language in OT background (Yahweh's kingship, Davidic promise) and show continuity in Jesus' ministry.
 - Demonstrate Jesus' messianic consciousness: Jesus understood and proclaimed that God's rule was present in his ministry; his parables, miracles and pronouncements identify the reign as breaking in through his person and work.
 - Articulate the **already/not-yet** shape of New Testament eschatology: kingdom as inaugurated (real effects, signs, power) yet awaiting consummation (final judgment, universal reign).
 - Draw theological consequences: centrality of Christology (kingdom is centered on the King), implications for ecclesiology (church as witness and instrument), soteriology (kingly rule brings redemption), and ethics (kingdom life shaped by righteousness, mercy, and justice).
 - Critique of distortions: rejects reduction to secular political program or to merely interiorized spirituality; resists over-realized schemes that deny future consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Old Testament kingship and Davidic covenant traditions; Synoptic Gospels and Pauline kingdom language; prophetic eschatological expectations.
 - Engages earlier scholarly positions implicitly: C. H. Dodd's "realized eschatology" and subsequent corrective developments (e.g., George E. Ladd's inaugurated eschatology).
 - Draws on classic Reformed and evangelical theologians for covenantal and Christological framing.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), Eschatology (already/not-yet), Covenant theology, Revelation (Word and person of Christ), Ecclesiology, Soteriology, Ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - The kingdom of God is the rule of the Messiah-present in Christ's person and saving work, manifest in the church by the Spirit, and awaiting the final consummation when God's sovereign reign is fully realized.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong Christo-centric framing: kingdom language is primarily about the person and reign of Christ rather than an abstract social order.
 - Pastoral clarity: aims to mediate scholarly nuance into usable doctrine for preaching and pastoral care.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects extreme forms of realized eschatology by insisting on future consummation.
 - Counters purely political or social-structural readings of kingdom language by affirming spiritual, covenantal, and redemptive dimensions without denying social implications.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No radical neologisms, but clear insistence on reading "kingdom" as "God's sovereign rule" with three integrative loci: person (Christ), proclamation (gospel), and consummation (eschaton).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise, theologically balanced summary; frequently cited in seminary courses, sermons and reference works.
 - Functions as a corrective resource when students encounter polarized readings (hyper-realized or purely futurist).

- **Enduring value**
 - Endures as a compact, theologically integrated treatment that links biblical exegesis to doctrinal loci and pastoral application; useful for bridging academic and pastoral uses.

### KEY TERMS & USES

- **Reign (rule) of God** - Emphasizes governance and authority rather than territory.
- **Messianic consciousness** - Jesus' self-understanding as the anointed King bringing God's rule.

- **Consummation** - Final, universal realization of God's rule at eschaton.
- **Davidic covenant** - OT background that grounds messianic expectations and kingdom promises.
- **Covenant theology** - Frames continuity between God's promises and their fulfillment in Christ's kingdom.
- **Christology** - Focus on Christ as the locus and agent of the kingdom.
- **Eschatology** - Kingdom as eschatological reality with both present signs and future fulfillment.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise **definition source** for sermons, lectures, and bibliographies on kingdom theology.
 - As a **polemic** against politicized or hyper-realized accounts of the kingdom, and as an exegetical model highlighting Jesus' messianic self-consciousness.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology and eschatology in Reformed teaching and classroom summaries.
