### TITLE
**Union with Christ and the Ordo Salutis: Recent Reformed Perspectives - William B. Evans (Westminster Theological Journal, 2008)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed renewal focused on recuperating Vosian/Pauline emphases on union with Christ; renewed interest in how the ordo salutis is to be conceived (logical vs. temporal).
 - Conversation partners include mid-20th and contemporary Reformed theologians reworking soteriology in light of Christology and pneumatology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The work argues that **Spirit-wrought union with Christ should be the theological hub of the ordo salutis**, providing the ontological ground for particular salvific blessings (justification, adoption, sanctification), and that many recent Reformed treatments understate the Spirit's role and the primacy of union.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of recent Reformed proposals about the ordo salutis and their handling of union with Christ.
 - Clarification of conceptual distinctions: **ontological (grounding) vs. logical/temporal order**, and **federal (representative) vs. vital (mystical) union**.
 - Exposition of Scripture and classic Reformed sources to show the Spirit as the efficient cause and sustaining bond of union.
 - Critique of approaches that treat union as derivative or merely concomitant to other soteriological acts (e.g., regeneration or justification).
 - Proposal that a rightly ordered ordo salutis
 - recognizes union as the ground of imputation and participation,
 - preserves distinctions among regeneration, justification, sanctification without atomizing them,
 - and insists on the Spirit's mediatorial role.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical Reformed authors (e.g., John Owen, Geerhardus Vos) and recent interlocutors in the Reformed academy (e.g., John Murray, Richard B. Gaffin Jr., contemporary systematicians and exegetes).
 - Primary engagement with Pauline exegesis (notably Romans, 1 Corinthians) and secondary literature on pneumatology and covenant theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as efficient cause of union)
 - Christology (nature of union with the incarnate Christ)
 - Soteriology (ordo salutis: regeneration, justification, sanctification, adoption)
 - Covenant theology and imputation (federal aspects of union)
 - Ecclesiology (communion with Christ as the basis for covenant community).

- **Closing line**
 - Evans restores and clarifies a Reformed vision in which **the Spirit effects union with Christ, and that union is both the ontological ground and the organizing principle of the ordo salutis**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the Spirit's role as the **constitutive bond** of union (not merely instrumental or illustrative).
 - Careful distinction between union as ground (why one is saved) and the legal/forensic order of declared righteousness.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against treatments that reduce union to a correlate of justification or that sequence regeneration and justification in ways that obscure union's primacy.
 - Bridges Vosian federal emphasis and Murray/Gaffin vital-union emphases, pressing both to account for pneumatology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced pairing of **ontological-grounding** language with the traditional ordo salutis schema to avoid temporal reductionism.
 - Clarifies and operationalizes the federal/vital distinction for contemporary soteriological argument.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited in subsequent Reformed discussions linking pneumatology and soteriology; useful in seminars on ordo salutis as corrective to schematic ordo lists.
 - Valued by scholars wanting a tighter integration of Pauline exegesis with systematic categories.

- **Enduring value**
 - Concise synthesis that functions as a practical corrective: restores union-with-Christ as the central organizing doctrine for Reformed soteriology while preserving forensic distinctives.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - central relational reality by which believers are vitally and federally joined to Christ; ontological ground of participation in his benefits.
- **Ordo salutis** - the "order of salvation"; Evans stresses **logical/ontological ordering** rather than merely temporal sequencing.
- **Spirit as efficient cause** - the Holy Spirit is presented as the agent who initiates, effects, and sustains union with Christ.
- **Ontological vs. temporal priority** - distinction to prevent reading theological priority as chronological sequence.
- **Federal union** - representative, covenantal aspect of union (Christ as federal head whose acts are imputed).
- **Vital union** - organic, life-sharing aspect (communion, indwelling, quickening).
- **Imputation** - transfer of Christ's righteousness grounded in union (both forensic and participatory implications).
- **Regeneration** - new birth; discussed as inseparable from but conceptually distinct from union.
- **Justification** - forensic declaration; grounded in union and imputation but distinct in role and form.
- **Sanctification** - ethical outworking of union; participation in Christ's life under the Spirit's power.
- **Adoption** - familial status flowing from union; social-positional effect of being in Christ.
- **Pneumatology** - theological locus treated as key to understanding how union operates.
- **Christology** - union presupposes and secures the communicative benefits of Christ's person and work.
- **Grounding language** - methodological move to claim union as the explanatory basis for particular soteriological benefits.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for union-with-Christ and clarifying federal/vital distinctions in soteriology.
- As a **polemic** against schematic ordo salutis lists that obscure pneumatological and ontological relations.
- As an **exegetical-model pivot** for reading Pauline texts where union and Spirit language converge (Romans, 1 Corinthians).
- As a **conceptual bridge** in teaching to integrate covenant, Christology, and pneumatology within Reformed soteriology.
