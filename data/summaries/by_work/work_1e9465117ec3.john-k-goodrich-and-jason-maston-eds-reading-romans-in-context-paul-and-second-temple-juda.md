### TITLE
John K. Goodrich and Jason Maston (eds.), Reading Romans in Context: Paul and Second Temple Judaism - Ben C. Blackwell (chapter)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary scholarly conversation (post-New Perspective) about Paul within Jewish literary and religious contexts; engages mid- to late-20th/21st-century debates (Sanders, Dunn, Wright, Barclay).
 - Intended for readers seeking to locate Romans within Second Temple interpretive practices and intra-Jewish debates about law, covenant, and identity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Blackwell contends that Paul's argument in Romans is best understood as a second-temple Jewish reconfiguration of covenantal identity: Paul reinterprets Torah, election, and promise to incorporate Gentiles without abandoning the continuity of God's covenantal faithfulness.
 - The doctrinal problem addressed: how justification, law, and election function in Paul when he writes as an interlocutor inside, not outside, Second Temple Judaism.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Lays groundwork by mapping Second Temple categories (covenant, election, law, eschatology) and hermeneutical practices (midrash, typology, scriptural argument).
 - Demonstrates that several key Pauline terms and moves (righteousness of God, justification, works of the law) are comprehensible against Second Temple debates about boundary markers and covenantal faithfulness.
 - Shows Paul's rhetorical strategy in Romans:
 - Diagnoses universal human failure to meet Torah's demands (chaps. 1-3) using shared Jewish language of sin, exile, and wrath.
 - Reframes "righteousness" as covenantal status granted through faith/faithfulness to God's promise (chaps. 3-5).
 - Reinterprets law's function and "works of the law" as ethnic boundary practices (circumcision, food laws, calendar) rather than general moralism (chaps. 6-10).
 - Articulates an eschatological-historical logic where Christ's death/resurrection and the ingrafting of Gentiles realize and transform Israel's story (chaps. 11-16).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright, John Barclay.
 - Uses Second Temple corpora: Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, LXX, Pseudepigrapha to illuminate shared vocabulary and hermeneutics.
 - Engages modern exegetical methods: socio-rhetorical and intertextual readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant and covenantal nomism; law/Torah and its functions; justification/justification language; election and promise; eschatology and Christology as fulfillment; ecclesiology implicit in redefined peoplehood.

- **Closing line**
 - Blackwell's chapter locates Paul inside Second Temple conversation: Romans is a sustained attempt to preserve God's covenantal promises while reconstituting the boundaries of the people of God around Christ-centered faithfulness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that seemingly theological abstractions (justification, righteousness) are ecclesial and covenantal categories rooted in intra-Jewish debates about identity and practice.
 - Attention to specific boundary markers (circumcision, food, calendar) as central to Paul's polemic, not merely incidental examples.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes beyond simplistic bifurcation between "traditional" Reformation readings and the New Perspective by showing continuity with Jewish thought while preserving theological distinctives (e.g., divine initiative in justification).
 - Critiques readings that universalize "works of the law" to generic moral works; argues for ethnic-boundary reading anchored in Second Temple evidence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the term **covenantal reconfiguration** (Paul's relocation of covenant markers) and proposes reading "faith/faithfulness" as both trust and covenantal fidelity within Jewish discourse.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued by exegetes seeking to integrate Jewish background into Pauline theology without collapsing theological distinctives.
 - In Reformed circles, used to nuance doctrines of justification and covenant, often as a corrective to individualistic or purely forensic readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a balanced, historically sensitive model linking exegesis to doctrinal concerns; useful for theological education, sermon formation, and scholarly debate on Paul and Judaism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Second Temple Judaism** - The religious milieu (ca. 516 BCE-70 CE) whose texts, practices, and hermeneutics shape Paul's categories.
- **Covenantal nomism** - Framework from Sanders describing Israel's covenant orientation; Blackwell uses it to situate Paul's continuity with Jewish covenant thinking.
- **Works of the law (ergon nomou)** - Read primarily as ethnic boundary markers (circumcision, food laws, calendar) rather than general moral achievements.
- **Justification (dikaiosis/dikaioo)** - Treated as covenantal declaration of status grounded in God's promise and enacted through Christ, not reducible to pure forensic transaction.
- **Righteousness of God (dikaiosyne tou theou)** - Understood as God's covenantal faithfulness that establishes a covenant people rather than abstract moral perfection.
- **Faith / faithfulness (pistis)** - Ambiguous term studied as both trust in God's promise and ethical fidelity appropriate to covenant life.
- **Election** - God's choosing of Israel framed historically and eschatologically; Paul reinterprets election to include Gentiles without annulling promises.
- **Boundary markers** - Concrete practices that define group identity; central to explaining Paul's polemical language.
- **Midrashic / intertextual exegesis** - Paul's use of scriptural proof-texting and typology in lines with Second Temple hermeneutics.
- **Eschatology** - Paul's reading of Israel's future as inaugurated in Christ and inclusive of Gentiles.
- **Law/Torah** - Its function reinterpreted: pedagogue, marker, and foil to show need for Christ; not simply moral code.
- **Promise (epangelia)** - The continuity of God's promises figures centrally in Paul's historical-theological argument.
- **Gentile inclusion / ingrafting** - Metaphor (Romans 11) for how Gentiles enter the covenantal story without replacing Israel.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans within Jewish communal debates, especially on "works of the law."
 - As a **definition source** for covenant-centered readings of justification and election that guard divine initiative.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theological conversations trying to reconcile New Perspective insights with historic doctrines of grace.
