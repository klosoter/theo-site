### TITLE
The IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament (1993) - Craig S. Keener

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1993 by InterVarsity Press as part of a series to supply concise historical, cultural, and social background for each New Testament passage. Emerges from late 20th-century evangelical scholarship stressing historical-contextual exegesis and utilization of noncanonical Greco-Roman and Jewish sources.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The commentary argues that understanding the New Testament's references to the Spirit (pneuma/ruach) requires situating texts within first‑century Mediterranean religious, Jewish, and Hellenistic contexts; many apparent theological tensions (e.g., charismatic phenomena vs. institutional church) are clarified by background data rather than purely dogmatic categories.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Systematic, verse-by-verse background notes keyed to biblical books that summarize relevant cultural, linguistic, and historical data.
 - Emphasis on parallels from Second Temple Judaism, Philo, Josephus, rabbinic strands, apocalyptic literature, and Greco-Roman religious practices that illuminate New Testament pneumatology.
 - Cross-references that show how motifs (prophecy, Spirit-baptism, charisma, purification) recur and shift across Luke-Acts, Paul, John, and the Johannine and Petrine letters.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary ancient sources (Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus), Greco-Roman literature, early Jewish sectarian texts; modern interlocutors include mainstream historical-critical scholars and specialists in ancient religions-Keener often synthesizes wide-ranging scholarship rather than arguing against a single opponent.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology, prophecy, eschatology, covenant/new covenant, Christology (as it intersects with Spirit), ecclesiology (Spirit and gifts), revelation, ritual purity and holiness linked to Spirit.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Keener's background exposition consistently portrays the Spirit as the historical agent by which God fulfills Israel's promises and inaugurates a new communal identity across diverse cultural matrices, making pneumatology intelligible only within its first‑century worlds.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes concrete social and religious contexts (rituals, patronage, charismatic practices) over abstract theological schemata.
 - Treats the Spirit as both continuity with Jewish prophetic tradition and as the catalyst for distinctly Christian developments (e.g., gentile inclusion, baptism in/with the Spirit).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Moves beyond narrower historical-critical handbooks that isolate texts; challenges readings that anachronistically impose later theological categories on the earliest pneumatological data.
 - Counters minimalist background treatments by offering abundant primary parallels that complicate simplistic "supernatural vs. natural" divides.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not so much neologisms as methodical bridging: labors to align ancient usage of ruach/pneuma with socioreligious practices (prophetic authority, ritual transfer, charismatic offices).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used across evangelical and academic settings as an indispensable reference; appreciated in Reformed circles for careful historical work though not a systematic theological work.
 - Influential for preachers, teachers, and scholars seeking to ground pneumatological claims in first‑century context.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Serves as a first port of call for contextualizing New Testament references to the Spirit; durable because of exhaustive compilation of background parallels and accessible application to exegesis and sermon preparation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit / Holy Spirit (pneuma / ruach):** Central referent; Keener shows lexical range from life-breath to divine agent, emphasizing contextual nuance.
- **Prophecy:** Understood as both continuity with Israelite prophetic tradition and a reconfigured charismatic function in the church.
- **Spirit-baptism:** Treated as a contested but historically attested initiation motif (Luke-Acts, Paul) linked to empowerment and identity.
- **Charismata / charismatic gifts:** Socially embedded practices (tongues, healing, prophecy) with parallels in Jewish and Greco-Roman worlds.
- **Eschatological Spirit:** The Spirit as sign and agent of the last days and new covenant fulfillment (Joel, John, Luke-Acts).
- **Spirit and purity/defilement:** Backgrounds show links between Spirit-bestowal and concepts of holiness, ritual transformation, and social boundaries.
- **Pneumatology in Paul:** Paul's use of the Spirit as source of sanctification, community discernment, and ethical transformation is contextualized by Hellenistic and Jewish precedents.
- **Luke-Acts pneumatology:** Presents continuity between Jesus' promise, Spirit descent at Pentecost, and Spirit as guide for mission and Gentile reception.
- **Spirit and miracles/healing:** Miraculous signs framed within ancient expectations for divine presence and authority.
- **Spirit and apostleship/authority:** Spirit as legitimating factor for teaching, mission, and leadership in early Christian communities.
- **Spirit language vs. metaphor:** Keener highlights when terms function metaphorically (breath, wind) versus technical theological referent.
- **Jewish vs. Greco-Roman matrix:** Contrasts how Jewish prophetic idioms and Greco-Roman charismatic phenomena inform NT texts.
- **New covenant / Spirit promise:** The Spirit as the marker of covenantal renewal and corporate identity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: supplies immediate historical parallels to inform verse-level interpretation.
 - As a **definition source**: clarifies first‑century semantic range of pneumatological terms.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: grounds systematic pneumatology in concrete social-religious data rather than abstract theology.
 - As a **teaching and homiletical tool**: equips pastors and lecturers to explain Spirit-related texts against ancient cultural backdrops.
