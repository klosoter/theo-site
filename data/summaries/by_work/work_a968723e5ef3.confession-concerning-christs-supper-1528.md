### TITLE
**Confession Concerning Christ's Supper (1528)** - Martin Luther

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 1528 amid the early Protestant Eucharistic Controversy (primarily Luther vs. Zwingli).
 - Part of Luther's sustained pastoral and polemical effort to defend Lutheran sacramental practice against both Roman scholasticism and radical Reformation symbolicism.
 - Theological milieu: emerging Protestant confessional identities; post-Chalcedonian Christological vocabulary still central to doctrinal argument.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defend the **real bodily presence** of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's Supper against symbolic interpretations, while rejecting Roman Aristotelian transubstantiation.
 - Show that Christ's two natures (Chalcedonian Definition) permit the human nature to be present where the person is present, thus grounding the real presence.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirm the literal force of the words of institution: "This is my body" must be taken at face value.
 - Use Christology-particularly the **Chalcedonian Definition and the communicatio idiomatum**-to argue that in the one person of Christ the properties of the divine can be ascribed to the human nature (genus maiestaticum), enabling ubiquity of the human body for sacramental presence.
 - Reject both:
 - Transubstantiation (as reliant on Aristotelian metaphysics and unnecessary scholasticism).
 - Purely symbolic readings (as undermining Christ's promise and the objective means of grace).
 - Emphasize faith as the means by which the sacrament becomes efficacious - the sacrament is a visible sign united to the promise by Christ's word, received by faith.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Ulrich Zwingli (representative of the symbolic/spiritual presence position).
 - Implicit critique of medieval scholastics who rely on Aristotelian categories.
 - Appeals to Scripture (instituting words), early ecumenical Christology (Chalcedon), and patristic talk of communicatio idiomatum.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central): person and two natures; communicatio idiomatum; genus maiestaticum; ubiquity of the human nature.
 - Sacramental theology: nature and efficacy of the Eucharist, sacramental/sign relation, real presence vs. symbolicism.
 - Soteriology and faith: role of faith in receiving sacramental benefits.
 - Indirectly touches on revelation and authority (Scripture over scholastic categories).

- **Closing line**
 - Luther anchors Eucharistic realism in Chalcedonian Christology: because Christ is one person with two natures, the human body may be truly given and received in the sacrament by virtue of the person who is omnipresent.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Moves the debate from metaphysical categories of substance/accident to **Christological dynamics**: the sacrament's reality rests on who Christ is, not on Aristotelian metaphysics.
 - Prominent use of **communicatio idiomatum** and the **genus maiestaticum** to secure real presence without transubstantiation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects medieval transubstantiation by rejecting its scholastic method while retaining objective presence.
 - Contrasts sharply with Zwinglian memorialism: refuses to reduce "is" to "signifies" and insists on the objective promise given by Christ's words.
 - Differs from later Reformed positions (extra calvinisticum) that preserve divine omnipresence but deny ubiquity of the human nature.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of Eucharistic presence to Chalcedonian language in a polemical context - this linkage became a hallmark of Lutheran sacramental theology.
 - Early robust articulation of what later Lutheran orthodoxy would call **sacramental union** (bread and body united by divine promise and presence).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate: sharpened controversies between Lutheran and Swiss Reformers; fueled disputes at Marburg and beyond.
 - Long-term: foundational for Lutheran confessional documents (Formula of Concord); shaped Lutheran polemics against Reformed Eucharistic theology.
 - Wider theology: forced Reformed theologians to clarify their own Christology and the relation of the person to natures (leading to terms like extra calvinisticum).

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies a Christology-driven sacramental theology; indispensable for understanding Lutheran Eucharistic identity and the historical trajectory of Protestant sacramental debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Real presence** - Luther's position that Christ's body and blood are truly given and received in the sacrament.
- **Sacramental union** - the bread and body are truly united in the Lord's Supper by Christ's word and promise (Lutheran technical description developed from this defense).
- **Communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties)** - transfer of attributes between Christ's natures that undergirds Luther's case for presence.
- **Genus maiestaticum** - the 'majestic' genus by which divine attributes (e.g., omnipresence) are ascribed to Christ's human nature; used to justify ubiquity.
- **Ubiquity (of the human nature)** - the controversial claim that Christ's human body is in some way present everywhere by virtue of the personal union.
- **Chalcedonian Definition and Two Natures Doctrine** - the orthodox formula appealed to as the Christological basis for Eucharistic realism.
- **Transubstantiation** - rejected medieval explanation; Luther denies Aristotelian substance/accident framework while affirming presence.
- **Symbolic/memorial view** - position advanced by Zwingli that Luther counters; sees the Supper as sign only.
- **Words of institution ("This is my body")** - treated as literal and decisive for sacramental theology.
- **Faith (instrumental in reception)** - faith is necessary to receive the sacrament's blessings; sacraments are means of grace by promise.
- **Scriptural hermeneutic over scholasticism** - Luther prioritizes literal Scriptural wording and Christology over Aristotelian philosophy.
- **Polemic methodology** - combination of pastoral concern and rigorous doctrinal refutation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Lutheran Eucharistic doctrine and sacramental union.
 - As a **polemic** against both Roman transubstantiation and Reformed memorialism, clarifying confessional boundaries.
 - As an **exegetical model** privileging literal readings of institution words anchored in orthodox Christology, serving as a conceptual pivot linking Christology and sacramentology.
