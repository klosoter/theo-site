### TITLE
The Holy Spirit: Perspectives on Pentecost - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed theological response to the rise of Pentecostal and charismatic movements; aimed at seminaries and pastors within conservative Reformed circles.
 - Works against the backdrop of renewed interest in experiential pneumatology and contested readings of Acts and Paul in the academy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Pentecost must be located redemptive-historically as the inauguration of the promised Spirit in connection with Christ's exaltation; properly understood, the Spirit's outpouring secures union with Christ, the church's eschatological life, and genuine Spirit-given gifts while also limiting the claim that all charismatic phenomena function as ongoing, apostolic revelation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-theological framing: situates Pentecost in covenantal and eschatological promise language (OT promise - Christ's promise - Pentecost).
 - Exegetical base: close readings of Acts 2 and Pauline pneumatology (especially 1 Corinthians and Romans) to derive the Spirit's office.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - The Spirit is the agent of union with the exalted Christ and the means of participation in his life and eschatological gift.
 - Distinguishes normative, ongoing Spirit-graces (faith, sanctification, testimony, ordinary gifts) from the unique, apostolic sign-gifts tied to foundational revelation.
 - Practical and polemical application: critiques both unchecked experientialism and overly minimal Reformed accounts that underplay the Spirit's active present work.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Luke-Acts and Pauline corpus; contemporary charismatic scholars; mainstream New Testament scholarship on Spirit/gifts.
 - Conversational background includes historic Reformed sources (covenant theology) and modern debates among continuationists and cessationists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (primary), revelation and illumination, covenant theology, eschatology, Trinity (Scripture's threefold personal economy), Christology (Spirit as gift of the exalted Christ), ecclesiology (Spirit and the church), gifts and their function.
- **Closing line**
 - Pentecost is the decisive inauguration of the Spirit that secures the church's participation in Christ's exaltation: robustly experiential and sacramental for sanctification, yet theologically bounded so that apostolic sign-revelation does not indefinitely dictate ecclesial authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Redemptive-historical locating of Pentecost: an inaugural, covenantal gift tied to Christ's exaltation rather than occasional charismatic intervention.
 - Priority given to the Spirit as the Lord's means of incorporating believers into the crucified-and-exalted Christ (union with Christ is pneumatologically constituted).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against charismatic readings that treat Pentecost as a template for identical present-day revelatory forms and authoritative signs.
 - Also corrective to some Reformed treatments that underplay the continuing vitality and experiential reality of the Spirit.
 - Affirms a qualified cessationism: distinguishes foundational/apostolic sign-gifts from the ongoing ordinary gifts necessary for church life and sanctification.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear operational pairings: **inaugurative-outpouring** (Pentecost) vs. **ongoing sanctifying presence** (church life).
 - Emphasis on **pneumatic union with the exalted Christ** as the center of Spiritology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well regarded in Reformed seminaries for balancing scriptural exegesis with pastoral sensitivity.
 - Frequently cited in debates over continuationism vs. cessationism as a measured, exegetically-grounded Reformed position.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model for integrating Pauline and Lukan data into a coherent Reformed pneumatology; valuable for preaching, pastoral formation, and classroom instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pentecost**: inaugural outpouring promised in Scripture; redemptive-historical event tied to Christ's exaltation.
- **Inaugurative outpouring**: the once-for-all launching of the New Covenant era of the Spirit.
- **Ordinary (non-sign) gifts**: gifts that sustain faith and sanctification (teaching, exhortation, service) and continue as normative.
- **Sign (apostolic) gifts**: tongues, extraordinary healings, and prophetic confirmations tied to apostolic foundation and revelation.
 - Gaffin: these served a foundational, attesting role and are distinct in function from ongoing gifts.
- **Pneumatic union with Christ**: the Spirit's work in bringing believers into mystical/real participation in Christ's death, resurrection, and exaltation.
- **Spirit and Christ's exaltation**: theologically central link - Spirit given because Christ is ascended/glorified.
- **Redemptive-historical reading**: interpretive stance that locates Pentecost in covenant and eschatological continuity.
- **Qualified cessationism**: the claim that some extraordinary, revelatory gifts were temporary and tied to apostolic revelation, while ordinary gifts continue.
- **Illumination vs. revelation**: illumination (ongoing, Scripture-dependent) as the Spirit's normal present work; revelation (canonical, apostolic) as complete.
- **Ecclesial sanctification**: the Spirit's normative role for church life and moral formation.
- **Experientialism (critique)**: caution against reducing Spirit to subjective, uncontrolled phenomena.
- **Charismatic continuationism (contrast)**: Gaffin disputes the unqualified equation of Pentecost's phenomena with every present charismatic claim.
- **Canonical finality**: the Spirit works now within the boundaries of the completed apostolic witness and Scripture.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, redemptive-historical pneumatology that centers union with Christ.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with charismatic proponents who claim ongoing, apostolically identical revelation.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts and Pauline texts in tandem to derive theological conclusions about gifts and the Spirit's ministry.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology (exaltation) and pneumatology (outpouring) in teaching and homiletics.
