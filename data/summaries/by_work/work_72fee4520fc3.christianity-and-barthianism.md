### TITLE
**Christianity and Barthianism - Cornelius Van Til**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed response to neo‑orthodoxy; Van Til writes from a presuppositional apologetic and covenantal-Reformed vantage to evaluate Karl Barth's theological innovations and their consequences for dogmatics and practice.
 - Dialogue occurs within debates over revelation, natural theology, and the proper relation of Scripture to culture and reason.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Van Til contends that while Barth revived the transcendence of God against liberalism, his reformulation contains epistemological and biblical inconsistencies that compromise classical Reformed doctrine (particularly covenant theology, Christology, and sacramental efficacy). Van Til aims to preserve Scripture‑bound presuppositions and a coherent apologetic without adopting Barth's corrective at the cost of confession.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critical appraisal of Barthian method: rejection of traditional analogia entis, affirmation of analogia fidei, and insistence that God must be spoken of only as He reveals Himself.
 - Diagnosis: Barth corrects liberal immanentism but introduces ambiguity about created order, Christ's human freedom, and covenantal signs.
 - Reformation: Reassert presuppositions rooted in Scripture and the Reformed confessions; defend doctrines potentially weakened in Barthian formulations (Christology, sacramentology, eschatology).
 - Practical theological consequences: baptismal practice, ecclesial identity, and the church's posture toward worldly culture.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Karl Rahner (method and analogical talk), Thomas Aquinas (analogia entis), Reformed confessional standards (Westminster, Belgic), and New Testament apostolic texts (esp. Pauline eschatology).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and epistemology, Trinity, Christology (including debates over the **impeccability of Christ**), covenant and sacraments (infant vs. believer baptism efficacy), analogical language about God (analogia entis vs. analogia fidei), and eschatology (Antichrist / man of lawlessness).

- **Site usage (select cross‑references used in Van Til's critique and comparative materials)**
 - Impeccability of Christ - discussion vs Barthian Christology (compare Barth, Church Dogmatics on the sinlessness and freedom of Christ).
 - Rahner's Rule and Barth's reformulation - methodological contrast (see Rahner on theological method; Van Til contrasts Rahner/Barth approaches).
 - Analogia entis vs analoga fidei - Thomistic tradition vs Barthian corrective; Van Til assesses consequences for natural theology.
 - Baptism (infant vs believer) - ecclesial and covenantal implications; Van Til defends Reformed covenantal efficacy of infant baptism against reductive sign‑only readings.
 - Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness - Pauline eschatology used diagnostically against theological secularization.

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til's Christian critique of Barthianism seeks to recover a Scripture‑anchored, confessionally Reformed system that preserves divine revelation as the nonnegotiable presupposition for doctrine, apologetics, and church life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that apologology must begin with the self‑attesting Word of God as the governing presupposition; critique of any theological move that relativizes Scripture by appeal to neutral reason or supra‑confessional method.
 - Tight linking of epistemology and dogmatics: how one speaks of God determines ecclesial and sacramental practice.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Commends Barth's recovery of divine transcendence but corrects what Van Til sees as Barth's equivocations that erode covenantal particulars and sacramental efficacy.
 - Opposes Thomistic‑natural theological residue (analogia entis) while resisting Barthian moves that render Christian doctrine unintelligible to creedal continuity.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Application of presuppositional critique to neo‑orthodoxy: treating Barthian affirmations as having apologetic and ecclesiological consequences rather than merely doctrinal ones.
 - Framing sacramental and eschatological issues as downstream from epistemological commitments.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed circles as a principled corrective to Barthianism; used by presuppositional apologists and confessional theologians.
 - Received warily by Barthians and some neo‑orthodox scholars who regard Van Til's presuppositional demands as overly sectarian.

- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches students to trace how methodological choices shape doctrine and church practice; valuable as a case study in theological retrieval, polemic, and the integration of apologetics with systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - Van Til's method: Scripture as the necessary presupposition for intelligible theology and rational critique.
- **Analogia entis** - Thomistic "analogy of being"; Van Til defends caution about natural theology while critiquing Barth's wholesale abandonment because of practical fallout.
- **Analogia fidei** - Barthian priority of redemptive revelation; Van Til acknowledges its corrective role but warns against dislocating confessional continuity.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - Van Til interacts with Barthian Christology to safeguard both Christ's real humanity and his sinlessness without collapsing into theoretical antinomies.
- **Rahner's Rule** - Methodological principle associated with Rahner; Van Til contrasts Rahner's and Barth's formulations to expose differing epistemic assumptions.
- **Covenant baptism (infant efficacy)** - Defense of infant baptism as covenant sign and means of grace within Reformed theology against reductionist sacramental readings.
- **Believer's baptism** - Noted as a contrasting ecclesiological practice; Van Til treats the debate as symptomatic of underlying presuppositions about covenant and promise.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness** - Uses Pauline eschatology diagnostically to critique secularizing trajectories in modern theology.
- **Revelation (self‑attestation)** - Central: Scripture and the incarnate Word as the epistemic ground for truth claims.
- **Epistemology → Dogmatics** - Key axiom: epistemic starting points determinatively shape doctrinal conclusions.
- **Covenantal theology** - Framework for sacraments, church life, and theological continuity.
- **Barthianism** - For Van Til, a corrective to liberalism but a faulty alternative when it abandons confessional restraints.
- **Natural theology** - Critically engaged; Van Til repudiates unaided natural theology but permits a reformed account that recognizes creation's dependence on revelation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** resource against neo‑orthodoxy and for defense of confessional Reformed commitments.
 - As an **apologetic model** illustrating presuppositional method applied to historical theological controversies.
 - As a **didactic tool** in Christology, sacramentology, and epistemology courses to show the ripple effects of methodological choices.
