### TITLE
Commentary on Genesis (Author: Unknown)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Anonymous provenance; internal evidence and reception suggest a post-Reformation, confessional milieu that reads Genesis as foundational for systematic theology rather than merely antiquarian history.
 - Widely used in Reformed and covenantal circles on the site; readership applies it as both pastoral commentary and doctrinal synthesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Genesis is the theological matrix for the whole canon: it establishes covenantal categories (creation, fall, promise, and seed) that structure revelation, Christology, and soteriology. The commentary treats Genesis not only as history but as canonical theology that governs later doctrine.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Prefatory material defends Mosaic authorship and the canonical status of Genesis as norming Scripture.
 - Exegetical walk through Genesis with recurring theological headings: Creation and image-bearing; Covenant and command (Adam/Noah/Abraham); Sin and its juridical consequences; Promise, seed, and typology pointing to Christ.
 - Concluding sections synthesize Genesis for doctrine: covenant of works/creation, covenant of grace beginnings in promises to Abraham, and eschatological consummation.
 - Major moves:
 - Scripture establishes God as Creator and covenant Lord.
 - Adam functions as federal head; the fall entails covenantal alienation and promise of restoration.
 - Patriarchal narratives are treated as progressive revelation-typological anticipations of Christ and the church's covenant identity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Frequent engagement with canonical text (Moses/Genesis) and with patristic and Reformation themes; explicit contrast to allegorical interpreters and to modern critical minimalism.
 - Echoes of Augustine and Calvin in method and doctrinal priors are present, though no explicit single authorial lineage is claimed.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation and bibliology (authority and reading principles for Genesis)
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace)
 - Anthropology and creation (image of God, human vocation)
 - Doctrine of sin and federal headship
 - Christology and typology (seed, promise)
 - Eschatology (promise-fulfillment trajectory)
 - Providence and sacramental signs (altars, circumcision as covenant sign)
- **Closing line:** 
 - The commentary's theological center of gravity is a covenantal reading of Genesis that locates Christ and the church as the fulfillment and continuity of God's original creational and covenantal purposes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Consistent insistence that Genesis frames all subsequent doctrine: creation is covenantal, and the creation mandate is read as a covenantal commission rather than merely a moral guideline.
 - Strong articulation of Adam as federal head whose status explains corporate guilt and the necessity of a covenantal Redeemer.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects allegorical tendencies by insisting on historical-grammatical sense informed by canonical and covenantal theology.
 - Counterposes the commentary's synthetic covenantal approach to modern critical fragmentation that isolates Genesis as only ancient Near Eastern literature.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Emphasizes the term "seed" (singular corporate/Christological seed) as a canonical hinge-term linking Genesis promise to New Testament fulfillment.
 - Frames the creation mandate explicitly as a "covenantal commission," which tightens the relation between creation theology and covenant doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited across the site as a go-to exposition when Genesis is appealed for doctrinal synthesis (particularly in covenant theology, anthropology, and Christology).
 - Influential in preaching, catechesis, and systematic treatments that require a compact exegetical-theological bridge from Genesis to later doctrine.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating exegesis with systematic theology; valuable as a synthetic primer on how Genesis functions as a theological foundation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith):** Genesis presented as the origin of covenantal structures; multiple covenantal administrations (works, grace) traceable to Genesis events.
- **Federal headship (Adam/Christ):** Adam as representative; sin and merit understood corporately; Christ as the antitypical head.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Basis for human dignity, vocation, and responsibility; linked to relational and kingly functions.
- **Creation mandate / covenantal commission:** Human vocation to rule and steward creation framed as covenantal duty with divine stipulations.
- **Seed (zera):** Singular seed motif as promise-anticipation of the Messiah and corporate continuity.
- **Promise and fulfillment:** Pattern of promise (to Adam/Noah/Abraham) that is progressively revealed and typologically fulfilled in Christ.
- **Typology:** Patriarchal persons/acts read as foreshadows of Christ and covenant realities (e.g., Isaac as a sacrifice-figure).
- **Covenant of works & covenant of grace:** Genesis used to delineate the initial covenantal arrangement and the emergence of grace-promises after the fall.
- **Original righteousness/corruption:** Genesis narrative provides the paradigms for pre-fall righteousness and its loss at the fall.
- **Circumcision / signs and seals:** Early covenant signs read sacramentally as anticipatory of later covenant signs and church sacraments.
- **Genealogies / promise continuity:** Genealogies serve theological function of continuity and promise transmission.
- **Sabbath / eschatological sign:** Sabbath interpreted as creational and eschatological sign of covenant rest.
- **Providence:** God's ongoing governance is read into narrative causality and promise outcomes.
- **Use across loci:** 
 - As a definitional source for covenantal categories in systematic theology.
 - As a polemic tool against allegorical and critical denials of theological coherence in Genesis.
 - As an exegetical model for typological reading that informs Christology, anthropology, and eschatology.
