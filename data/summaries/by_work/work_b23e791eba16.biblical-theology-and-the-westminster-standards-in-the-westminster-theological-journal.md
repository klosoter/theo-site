### TITLE
**Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards** (WTJ) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed discussions linking Vosian biblical theology with confessional systematics at Westminster Theological Seminary.
 - Responds to the Biblical Theology Movement and to claims that Westminster scholasticism is at odds with redemptive-historical exegesis.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Westminster Standards presuppose and cohere with a robust biblical-theological (redemptive-historical, eschatological) framework; far from tension, there is mutual illumination.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Explains biblical theology as the ordered history of special revelation and redemption (historia salutis) culminating in Christ.
 - Demonstrates that WCF/WLC/WSC embed this structure: covenantal epochs, Christ's mediatorial work, ordo salutis grounded in union with the risen Christ, and an already/not yet eschatology.
 - Clarifies how the Standards regulate doctrinal formulations while inviting biblical-theological development rather than stifling it.
 - Addresses contested loci: merit and good works in the Covenant of Grace, covenant of works, justification and sanctification in union, Spirit's eschatological ministry, and Christ's person and work under Chalcedon.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Calvin, Reformed orthodox (e.g., Witsius, Turretin), Geerhardus Vos, John Murray, Herman Bavinck, Ridderbos.
 - In view: broader Biblical Theology Movement; modern critical proposals that detach dogmatics from canon's history; some intra-Reformed misreadings of Westminster as merely timeless propositions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and canon as epochally progressive; Covenant of Works/Grace; Trinity and pactum salutis; Christology (hypostatic union, two states and offices); Soteriology (union with Christ, justification, sanctification, adoption; ordo within historia); Pneumatology (Pentecost as eschatological hinge); Ecclesiology (means of grace in redemptive history).
- **Closing line**
 - The Standards are dogmatics in service to the Bible's redemptive history, with Christ's resurrection-Pentecost as the organizing center and union with Christ binding accomplishment to application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates Westminster's confessional precision with Vosian redemptive-historical method; ordo salutis is subordinated to, and derived from, historia salutis.
 - Centers soteriology in **union with the resurrected Christ** and the **eschatological Spirit**.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rejects a dichotomy between biblical theology and confessional systematics.
 - Counters flattening the ordo into timeless psychology; insists on the once-for-all, epochal work of Christ and Pentecost as determinative for the believer's benefits.
 - Nuances merit language: Adam's probation and Christ's obedience are covenantal and federal, not Pelagian; good works in the Covenant of Grace are non-meritorious fruits.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight coupling of Westminster's proof-texted propositions to a canonical, epochal storyline.
 - Reframing WCF's benefits of redemption under the single rubric of union with Christ, with duplex gratia (justification and sanctification) as inseparable yet distinct.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries to harmonize exegesis, biblical theology, and confessional study; supports redemptive-historical preaching.
 - Serves as a stabilizing reference amid debates on justification, union, and covenant merit.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for reading the Standards as historically textured and Scripture-saturated.
 - Provides a grammar to hold together Trinity, Christology, covenant, and soteriology without collapse or compartmentalization.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical Theology (Vosian)**
 - The ordered, epochal history of special revelation and redemption; not a rival to systematics but its historical substrate.
- **Westminster Standards**
 - WCF, WLC, WSC; confessional expressions that presuppose redemptive history and covenantal structuring.
- **Historia salutis vs. Ordo salutis**
 - Accomplishment in Christ and epochal Spirit outpouring grounds and shapes the ordered application to believers.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological reality; all benefits flow from union with the risen Lord by the Spirit.
- **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
 - Inauguration in Christ's resurrection and Pentecost; consummation awaits his return; frames assurance and sanctification.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Adamic probation unto eschatological life; federal, covenantal arrangement distinct from meritorious earning.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - One covenant administered variously; good works are evidential, Spirit-wrought fruits, not meritorious causes.
- **Merit and Good Works**
 - Christ's obedience (active and passive) is unique and saving; believers' works lack condign merit and do not ground justification.
- **Active/Passive Obedience of Christ**
 - Whole-life obedience and atoning death together secure redemption per WCF 8; applied through union.
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Chalcedonian two-natures doctrine undergirds the Mediator's once-for-all work and ongoing priestly, kingly offices.
- **Pactum Salutis**
 - Trinitarian counsel underwriting the economy of redemption; aligns Westminster's Christology and soteriology.
- **Pentecost and Pneumatology**
 - Spirit's eschatological gift seals the new age; effectual calling and sanctification are Spirit's historicized work.
- **Means of Grace**
 - Word, sacraments, prayer situated in the church's place within the unfolding history of redemption.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Adam and Christ as representative heads; frames imputation and the structure of salvation.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a conceptual pivot to read ordo salutis through union with Christ in a redemptive-historical frame.
 - As a definition source for covenantal categories consistent with Westminster.
 - As an exegetical model for integrating proof texts with canonical context.
 - As a polemical resource against bib-theology vs. confession dichotomies and merit misunderstandings.
