### TITLE
"The Historical Adam: Genesis 1-2 as the Foundation for New Testament Anthropology" - essay by Gregory K. Beale (in Four Views on the Historical Adam, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in a 2013 evangelical debate volume amid intensified discussion over the historicity of Adam because of advances in genetics, ANE studies, and new hermeneutical proposals (e.g., functional/typological readings of Genesis).
 - Beale writes from a conservative, Reformed biblical-theological perspective and as an experienced New Testament exegete concerned with canonical coherence.
- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1-2 record a historical Adam whose role as the federal/seminary head of humanity underpins the New Testament's anthropology and soteriology; denying Adam's historicity undermines core NT teaching (notably Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchor: careful reading of Genesis 1-2 as narrative history that establishes Adam's personal identity, vocation (image-bearing), and representative headship.
 - Canonical argument: NT authors (Paul, the author of Hebrews, 1 Corinthians) presuppose a historical Adam when developing doctrines of sin, death, and Christ as the second Adam.
 - Theological consequence: Adam's historical guilt and federal representation explain universal sin and the need for Christ's representative obedience; typology between Adam and Christ is real-history-based, not merely literary or functional.
 - Hermeneutical claim: a grammatical-historical and canonical reading of Scripture is required; reading Genesis non-historically disrupts the OT→NT interpretive nexus.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary non-historical readings indirectly (functional/figurative frameworks) and directly contrasts exegetical moves by those who treat Genesis as non-historical.
 - Draws on patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern Reformed treatments of federal headship and original sin for historical-theological support.
 - Uses careful exegesis of Romans 5, 1 Corinthians 15, Hebrews 2, and Genesis narrative details.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (imago Dei; human nature), original sin/seminal headship, covenantal/federal theology, Christology (Adam-Christ typology), soteriology (representative atonement), Scripture and hermeneutics (canonical reading).
- **Closing line**
 - Beale insists that Genesis 1-2 as historical narrative is indispensable: the NT's anthropology, doctrine of sin, and Christ-as-new-Adam theology collapse if Adam is reduced to a literary or non-historical construct.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Canonical-typological method: sustained focus on how NT writers read Genesis as history and employ Adam as a real historical type fulfilled in Christ.
 - Integration of OT narrative detail with NT theological usage; not merely asserting historicity but showing its necessary function for NT argumentation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters non-historical/function-only readings (which treat Genesis as primarily about roles/function) by arguing such approaches sever the OT narrative from NT doctrinal claims.
 - Challenges attempts to relocate Adamic headship to a corporate or symbolic level that denies individual historical agency.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "representative history" as a hermeneutical bridge: the historical act of Adam functions as the real foundation for covenantal and soteriological representation in the canon.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a robust exegetical defense of Adam's historicity and federal headship; frequently cited in seminary courses on Pauline theology and biblical anthropology.
 - Used polemically against literary-framework and functional ontology readings in popular and academic debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of canonical, intertextual exegesis linking OT narrative to NT theology; a compact resource for defending classical federal theology in contemporary hermeneutical disputes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historical Adam** - Adam as a concrete individual in history whose actions have real consequences for humanity.
- **Federal headship (representative headship)** - Adam as the covenantal representative whose sin is imputed to his descendants.
- **Typology / Adam-Christ typology** - Adam as a type fulfilled in Christ; typology rooted in historical reality, not mere literary echo.
- **Seminal headship / seminalism** - doctrine that Adam's sin results in a corrupted human nature transmitted to descendants; Beale treats it as consistent with federal representation.
- **Canonical reading / canonical-historical hermeneutic** - interpreting Genesis in light of its use throughout Scripture, especially in NT argumentation.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - Adam's vocation and ontology; malformation by sin explained via Adam's representative failure.
- **Original sin / universal depravity** - doctrinal consequence of Adam's fall as explained in NT texts (e.g., Romans 5).
- **Death as judicial and ontological** - death introduced through Adam's sin is both legal (condemnation) and existential (corruption).
- **Function-only / literary-framework readings** - alternative approaches that Beale critiques for detaching Genesis from historical claims.
- **Intertextual exegesis** - method of tracing OT narrative meaning through NT citations and allusions.
- **Representative history** - Beale's descriptor for the necessary historical grounding of redemptive types.
- **Grammatical-historical method** - baseline hermeneutic employed to read Genesis as historical narrative.
- **Covenantal anthropology** - view tying human nature and sinfulness to covenantal relations instantiated in Adam.
- **Recapitulation** - Christ as the new Adam who reverses Adam's representative failure.
- **Use across loci**
 - Exegetical model: cited as a model for intertextual OT→NT exegesis in courses on Pauline theology.
 - Polemic/resource: used in debates against non-historical readings of Genesis and for defending federal theology in systematic theology.
 - Definition source: referenced for clear articulation of federal headship and its canonical necessity for doctrines of sin and atonement.
