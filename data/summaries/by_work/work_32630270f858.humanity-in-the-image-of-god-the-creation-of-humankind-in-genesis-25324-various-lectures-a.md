### TITLE
**Humanity in the Image of God: The Creation of Humankind in Genesis 2:5-3:24** 
Catherine L. McDowell - selected lectures and essays (exegetical-theological study of Genesis 2-3 and the imago Dei)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary academic-theological exegesis situated in biblical-theology and systematic theology conversations. Addresses peers in Old Testament studies, theological anthropology, and pastoral theology; engages both historical readings and recent literary/canonical approaches.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Genesis 2:5-3:24 presents human beings primarily as embodied, relational, vocational bearers of the image of God; the Fall fractures that vocational-social order rather than merely producing abstract guilt. The doctrine of imago Dei must account for bodily, social, and priestly dimensions of human life.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical close reading of Genesis 2:5-25 emphasizing creation language, the formation of adam, and the establishment of human vocation (gardening, naming, rule).
 - Analysis of Genesis 3 as narrative of vocational failure: temptation, disobedience, shame, and relational rupture; curses interpreted as diagnostic of broken vocation and relationships.
 - Theological synthesis: imago Dei as composite of **embodiment, relationality, and functional stewardship**; salvation/Christology recapitulates and restores this vocation.
 - Pastoral and ethical implications drawn for anthropology, sin, and human dignity debates.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** classical theological resources (broadly Augustine/Patristic and Reformational concerns about imago Dei), major critical and literary commentators on Genesis, and contemporary theological anthropologists. Dialogue with both ontological and functional interpreters of imago Dei.
- **Doctrines treated:** creation, human nature/anthropology, sin and fall, covenantal vocation, typological and christological fulfillment (implicit recapitulation of true humanity), ethics (human dignity), sacramental/temple motifs.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The theological heart of the work is that to be made in God's image is to be an embodied, relational steward called to priestly service in creation - a vocation fractured by sin and fulfilled in God's restorative work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **vocational and priestly dimensions** of imago Dei over purely metaphysical formulations.
 - Gives sustained attention to **embodiment** (bodily language, nakedness, shame) as central to human identity rather than incidental.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back on reductive **ontological-only** readings (image as static status) and on readings that reduce imago Dei to mere capacity or function; argues for an integrated model that holds status, function, and embodied relation together.
 - Challenges overly individualistic readings by emphasizing **interpersonal and communal** structuring of the image (Eve/Adam dynamics, naming, social vocation).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses the phrase **"vocational ontology"** (implicit): the claim that human being and human calling are inseparable for biblical anthropology.
 - Reframes Genesis garden motifs as **temple-priest** paradigms - humans as caretakers within sacred space.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valuable for seminary courses on biblical anthropology and ethics; cited in debates over bioethics, human dignity, and ecological stewardship.
 - Bridges exegetical and systematic conversations, thus used by both exegetical scholars and practical theologians.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact, model exegesis linking text-critical attention with theological synthesis; useful as a case study in how Genesis informs doctrine and praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - central category; treated as embodied, relational, and vocational rather than merely ontological or functional.
- **Vocational stewardship** - human task of gardening/ruling interpreted as priestly service to creation.
- **Embodiment** - attention to body, nakedness, and shame as theological data for anthropology.
- **Relationality** - image expressed in human-to-human and human-to-God relations (e.g., naming, companionship).
- **Fall as vocational rupture** - sin described primarily as a disruption of human calling and relational ordering.
- **Eden as sacred space/temple** - garden motifs read with cultic/temple resonances; human caretakers function as priests.
- **Nakedness/shame** - signs of lost innocence and disrupted creatureliness, not merely moral symbols.
- **Curses and promise** - understood diagnostically (describe effects of broken vocation) and redemptively (point toward restoration).
- **Naming** - theological marker of human authority and relational mediation within divine ordering.
- **Priestly typology** - humans as vice-regents exercising priestly responsibility; Christ as true image/priest.
- **Christological recapitulation** - hinted as the telos: Christ restores the embodied vocational image.
- **Functional vs ontological debate** - this work models an integrated third way (status + function + embodiment).
- **Theological anthropology** - provides a template for integrating exegesis into doctrine about personhood.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 2-3 with theological sensitivity (seminars, commentaries).
 - As a **definition source** in anthropology discussions that need a nuanced imago Dei (ethics, bioethics).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates bridging environmental stewardship and human dignity (ecotheology, social ethics).
