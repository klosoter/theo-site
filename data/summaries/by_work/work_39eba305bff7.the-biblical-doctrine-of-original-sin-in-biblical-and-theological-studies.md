### TITLE
**The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin** - B. B. Warfield (Biblical and Theological Studies)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton Calvinist milieu; Warfield writing as heir to Princeton orthodoxy in dialogue with liberal theology, higher criticism, and emerging evolutionary/scientific accounts of human origin.
 - Defensive project: restate classical Reformed-Augustinian teaching against Pelagian, semi‑Pelagian, rationalist, and modernizing reinterpretations.

- **Central thesis**
 - Original sin is a real, transmitted corruption of human nature together with imputed guilt from Adam: both **inherited depravity** and **federal imputation** are biblically warranted and theologically necessary.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Genesis 3 and Paul (especially Romans 5); demonstration that Scripture teaches both propagation of a sinful nature and representation by Adam.
 - Theological synthesis: define original sin at two levels - ontological propensity (corruption of nature) and forensic status (imputed guilt).
 - Natural mechanism: argue for a real mode of propagation (historically described as seminal transmission) without reducing imputation to mere heredity.
 - Polemic phase: refute Pelagianism, Socinianism, Arminian mitigations, and modern attempts to moralize or psychologize the doctrine.
 - Pastoral/soteriological implications: show the necessity of Christ's federal headship and substitutionary atonement as remedy.

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine and Calvin as constructive predecessors; addresses scholastic exegesis; argues against Pelagius, Arminians, Socinians, and liberal critics (higher critics, moralizing theologians).
 - Conversant with contemporary philosophy and science insofar as they impinge on anthropology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology and sin (primary)
 - Soteriology (imputation, atonement, Christ as federal head)
 - Covenant theology and federal headship
 - Scripture and revelation as norm for doctrine; lesser treatment of Christology/Trinity except as related to federal truths.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield insists that a faithful biblical theology must hold both the **real corruption inherited by humanity** and the **forensic imputation of Adam's sin**, grounding human culpability and the need for Christ's redemptive headship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrative defense of both *natural* (hereditary) and *federal* (representative) aspects of original sin rather than reducing the doctrine to one pole.
 - Strong exegetical priority: Scripture interpreted within a confessional Reformed framework, not abstract metaphysics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects predecessors who separate imputation from corruption (purely forensic models) and those who reduce sin to environment, habit, or merely social conditions.
 - Contrasts sharply with Pelagianism/Socinianism by affirming innate inability and guilt prior to personal transgression.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Clear distinction between **pollutio (corruption)** and **culpa (guilt/imputation)**; careful use of terms like *federal headship* and *seminal/realistic transmission* to avoid category confusion.
 - Emphasizes "realistic" (ontological) transmission of a corrupted nature alongside forensic representation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Pillar of conservative Reformed theology and standard reference in 20th-century evangelical treatments of original sin.
 - Influenced systematic treatments in Reformed seminaries; provoked sustained debate from liberal and revisionist theologians.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary for exegetical rigor, theological coherence, and for teaching the interdependence of anthropology and soteriology; remains a primary resource where one seeks a classic Reformed defense of original sin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original Sin** - the doctrine that sin is a condition inherited by all humans from Adam, encompassing both corruption and culpability.
- **Inherited Corruption (pollutio)** - the depraved condition or proclivity toward sin transmitted in human nature.
- **Imputed Guilt (culpa / forensic imputation)** - the accounting of Adam's transgression to his descendants by virtue of federal headship.
- **Total Depravity** - the comprehensive effect of original sin upon all faculties of human nature (not absolute inability to act, but pervasive corruption).
- **Federal Headship** - Adam as representative of humanity whose act is judicially counted to his posterity; Christ as the redeeming federal head.
- **Seminal / Realistic Transmission** - the historic terminology for the natural propagation of sin in human nature (Warfield affirms a real mode without over‑specifying metaphysics).
- **Pelagianism** - the denial of original sin and human inability; primary foil in Warfield's polemic.
- **Augustinian Tradition** - theological lineage (Augustine -> Calvin -> Reformed confessions) that Warfield deploys and refines.
- **Nature vs. Guilt** - Warfield's analytic axis: keep ontological corruption and forensic guilt distinct yet related.
- **Natural Inability / Moral Inability** - language distinguishing inability arising from corrupted nature (natural) from voluntary moral impotence.
- **Representative/Forensic vs. Ontological Models** - two explanatory frames that Warfield synthesizes rather than pits against each other.
- **Romans 5 / Genesis 3 (exegetical loci)** - central biblical texts Warfield treats as primary evidence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and exegetical source on the **Nature and Origin of Sin** (clarifies transmission, corruption, and relation to human constitution).
- As a foundational polemic and doctrinal resource on **The Fall and Its Consequences** (grounds federal headship, imputation, and the necessity of Christ's redemptive headship).
