### TITLE
The Ethics of Invention: Technology and the Human Future - Sheila Jasanoff (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2016 amid rising public controversies over CRISPR, synthetic biology, climate engineering, and platform technologies.
 - Situated in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and public policy debates; addresses Western liberal democracies but uses cross-national comparisons.
 - Responds to techno-optimism, neoliberal innovation policy, and narrow risk-based regulatory frameworks.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Technological invention is not neutral: the ways societies govern, imagine, and institutionalize technologies shape what counts as human, moral, and political.
 - The central normative claim: democratic societies must cultivate an "ethics of invention" - collective, anticipatory, deliberative governance that shapes both technologies and human futures.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary governance frameworks (market-driven innovation, risk assessment, isolated bioethics) fail to address how technologies reconfigure persons, publics, and values.
 - Conceptual toolkit: develops and deploys STS concepts (co-production, sociotechnical imaginaries, civic epistemologies) to analyze cases (biotech, reproductive tech, climate interventions).
 - Prescriptive move: advocates institutional innovations - constitutionalization of science and technology, reflexive and democratic experimentalism, stronger public reasoning about collective futures.
 - Practical implications: regulatory design, public engagement, cross-cultural sensitivity, and moral imagination for alternative futures.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interlocutors across STS (e.g., Bruno Latour, J. Hansen), political theory (Habermas on public reason), bioethics traditions, and policy literature on innovation and risk.
 - Empirical cases drawn from biotechnology (GMOs, gene editing), environmental governance (geoengineering), and data/AI governance.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Jasanoff is not a theologian; doctrinal content is implicit and applied rather than exegetical. Theologically relevant themes include:
 - **Anthropology**: what counts as human, human dignity, enhancement.
 - **Providence and futurity**: human agency in shaping future worlds; limits of control.
 - **Ethics of stewardship**: creation care reframed as civic responsibility toward socio-technical systems.
 - **Sin and social order**: structural harms and moral accountability beyond individual acts.
 - Indirect engagement with eschatology (visions of human futures) and political theology (public reason, common good).

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Jasanoff compels theology to treat invention as a communal moral act: doctrines of human nature, responsibility, and hope must be rethought in light of socio-technical co-production and democratic obligations to shape human futures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Centers governance and collective imagination rather than solely individual ethics or abstract principles.
 - Moves from risk-safety calculus to questions of identity, dignity, and institutional design.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges technocratic/market-driven models that privatize decisions about technologies.
 - Critiques mainstream bioethics that isolates ethical reflection from political and cultural contexts (e.g., principlism).
 - Offers an alternative to purely precautionary or purely innovationist stances by promoting deliberative institutional reforms.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes deployment of STS concepts in normative debate:
 - **Sociotechnical imaginaries**: collective visions that justify and steer innovation.
 - **Co-production**: science and social order mutually shape one another.
 - **Civic epistemologies**: culturally specific ways publics assess knowledge claims.
 - Argues for **constitutionalization** of science and technology - embedding democratic checks and civic values into technological governance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in STS, public policy, and ethics; used by scholars of public theology, political theology, and ethics of technology.
 - Less directly cited in systematic theology but increasingly used in practical theology, ecclesial ethics, and public theology curricula.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a robust framework for interdisciplinary work linking theology, ethics, policy, and STS.
 - Equips students to analyze how technological futures are culturally produced and politically contested.
 - Useful for teaching civic responsibility, prophetic critique of technocracy, and theological reflection on human dignity in technological contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ethics of invention**
 - Normative project insisting governance of invention must be anticipatory, democratic, and value-attentive.
- **Sociotechnical imaginaries**
 - Collective visions that legitimize particular pathways of innovation and shape public expectations.
- **Co-production**
 - Mutual shaping of knowledge, technologies, and social orders; rejects strict separation of science and society.
- **Civic epistemology**
 - Culturally specific public practices for validating knowledge and expertise.
- **Reflexive governance / democratic experimentalism**
 - Iterative, inclusive governance models that learn from experiments and public deliberation.
- **Constitutionalization of science and technology**
 - Embedding democratic principles, rights, and institutional checks into technological governance.
- **Precautionary vs. innovation principles**
 - Contrasts risk-averse frameworks with pressures to accelerate innovation; Jasanoff pushes for a negotiated middle path.
- **Technocratic framing**
 - Tendency to cast issues as technical rather than political; target of Jasanoff's critique.
- **Human futures**
 - Plural, contested visions that technologies instantiate; theological stakes in hope, stewardship, and responsibility.
- **Responsibility (distributed)**
 - Ethical account that locates moral agency across institutions, designers, publics, and states.
- **Bio-objectification**
 - Ways living entities are made into objects of manipulation and governance, raising dignity concerns.
- **Moral economies of science**
 - Embedded values and interests shaping scientific agendas and innovation priorities.
- **Public reason**
 - Requirement that decisions about technologies be explained and justified in terms accessible to a plural democratic public.
- **Expertise and democratic legitimacy**
 - Tension between specialized knowledge and public accountability; Jasanoff favors accountable expertise.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for socio-technical concepts (sociotechnical imaginaries, co-production) in theological ethics.
- As a **polemic** against technocracy and market-driven bioethics in public theology and ecclesial policy engagement.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for rethinking theological anthropology, stewardship, and communal responsibility in an age of invention.
- As a **model** for interdisciplinary pedagogy linking STS, ethics, and theology in courses on technology and the human future.
