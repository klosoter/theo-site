### TITLE
Going Public: Why Baptism Is Required for Church Membership - Bobby Jamieson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed milieu addressing ecclesiology and sacramental practice. Written amid renewed intra-Reformed debate over paedobaptism vs. credobaptism and practical questions about membership, discipline, and the Lord's Table.
 - Pastoral-theological aim: equip churches to form membership policies consistent with New Testament practice and evangelical convictions about baptism.
- **Central thesis**
 - Baptism functions as the public, visible rite of initiation into the local church; therefore, baptism ought to be required for formal church membership (while carefully distinguishing baptism's sign function from saving efficacy).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical data: surveys New Testament patterns (Acts, the Gospels, Pauline practice) to show baptism consistently accompanies entry into the church community.
 - Theological framing: baptism as non-saving sign and seal that publicly identifies a believer with Christ and with the local congregation.
 - Ecclesiological implications: because baptism is the ordinary public marker of belonging, churches should require it for membership to preserve clarity for discipline, communion, and mission.
 - Pastoral/application chapter(s): how to handle converts baptized elsewhere, those hesitant about baptism, and infants raised in believing households.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interaction with both credobaptist and paedobaptist positions; appeals to New Testament exegesis, patristic and Reformation conversations about signs and membership.
 - Dialogues with contemporary Reformed writers on covenant theology and sacramental theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (church membership, discipline, sacraments as marks)
 - Sacramentology (baptism as sign/seal, not regeneration)
 - Covenant theology (boundary markers of covenant community)
 - Soteriology (regeneration vs. profession; baptism's non-saving role)
- **Closing line**
 - Baptism is the ordinary public rite that marks entrance into the visible church; requiring it for membership preserves biblical clarity, pastoral accountability, and the church's public witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linking of baptism to visible ecclesial membership rather than only to individual spiritual status; baptism treated as required public profession for full participation in church life.
 - Clear pastoral concern: membership rules are not mere legalism but instruments for discipline, neighborliness, and evangelical clarity.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Counters paedobaptist appeals that infant baptism creates automatic membership; Jamieson insists on communicative, professing membership grounded in personal profession and public sign.
 - Distinguishes from baptismal-regeneration models: affirms baptism's importance without attributing saving efficacy.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the language of "going public" - baptism as a social-professional act in the economy of the church, not merely a private spiritual event.
 - Treats baptism as an ecclesial boundary marker akin to but distinct from covenantal signs in paedobaptist schemes.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed Baptist and evangelical pastoral circles as a practical defense of conditioned membership policies.
 - Has prompted renewed conversation among Presbyterians and congregationalists about the relation of baptism, profession, and membership standards.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for pastors crafting membership covenants; clarifies biblical-theological rationale for requiring believer's baptism without resorting to sacramental absolutism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism**
 - Public initiation rite into Christian community; sign and seal of union with Christ, not the instrument of regeneration.
- **Church membership**
 - Formal local belonging with rights (communion, participation) and responsibilities (discipline, accountability).
- **Going public**
 - Jamieson's rubric: baptism as the public profession that visibly associates a person with a local church.
- **Credobaptism**
 - Position that baptism is for professing believers only; Jamieson's primary commitment.
- **Paedobaptism**
 - Infant baptism position; principal interlocutor critiqued regarding membership implications.
- **Sign vs. saving instrument**
 - Distinction: baptism as a sign pointing to gospel realities, not itself effecting conversion.
- **Household baptisms**
 - NT instances (e.g., Lydia, Philippian jailer) interpreted as belief-centered; households included believers and those within their domestic sphere, not automatic infant initiation.
- **Discipline**
 - Church practice that requires clear membership markers; baptism as prerequisite aids consistent application.
- **Profession of faith**
 - Verbal/communicative element that baptism publicly displays and that undergirds membership.
- **Covenant boundary**
 - How baptism functions relative to covenantal signs: marks entry into visible covenant community under Jamieson's reading.
- **Membership covenant**
 - Practical instrument recommended for churches to articulate baptismal requirement and pastoral exceptions.
- **Baptismal regeneration (rejected)**
 - Jamieson rejects the notion that baptism itself effects salvation.
- **Ordinary means**
 - Baptism as ordinary, normative entry rite rather than an optional extra.
- **Ecclesial visibility**
 - The social/public aspect of baptism that enables mutual recognition among churches.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional and pastoral resource for formulating membership policies requiring believer's baptism.
 - As polemic against infant-baptism-as-membership claims and against lax membership practices.
 - As an exegetical model linking baptismal practice in Acts/Paul to local congregational boundaries and discipline.
