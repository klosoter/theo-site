### TITLE
The Incarnation - Sinclair B. Ferguson (New Dictionary of Theology, ed. Sinclair Ferguson & David Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed reference work. Ferguson writes from a conservative Reformed and pastoral-theological perspective, engaging classical ecumenical Christology against modern revisionist proposals.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the classical doctrine that the eternal Son assumed a true human nature without any ontological loss to the divine nature; resist kenotic accounts that imply the Son divested essential divine attributes.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reaffirmation of Chalcedonian Christology: one Person, two complete natures (divine and human) without confusion, change, division, or separation.
 - Exegesis and theological reading of texts like John and Philippians supporting preexistence, voluntary self-limitation, and real assumption.
 - Critique of modern kenotic proposals that construe Philippians 2 as evidence of ontological divine emptying; argue kenosis must be read as voluntary self-limitation in function, not an ontological subtraction of deity.
 - Positive account of how the communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum) and the distinction of natures explain Christ's actions, suffering, and resurrection consistent with divine immutability and impassibility.
 - Pastoral-soteriological emphasis: the incarnation is Israel's and the church's basis for atoning work, mediation, and revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Appeals to Chalcedon, Athanasius, Cyril, Calvin and Reformed confessional tradition; engages broadly with 19th-20th century kenotic theorists and contemporary evangelical critiques.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (central), Trinity (economic and ontological relations), revelation (incarnational mediation and accommodation), soteriology (atonement and mediation), and aspects of divine attributes (immutability, impassibility, omnipotence).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The incarnation must be held as the eternal Son's personal assumption of human nature - a voluntary, functional self-limitation for redemptive purpose that preserves full deity and full humanity without ontological loss.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that kenosis is best understood as *functional* and *voluntary* self-limitation by the Son, not an ontological divestment.
 - Clear pastoral framing: doctrinal precision serves worship, assurance, and the efficacy of atonement.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects modern kenotic tendencies that read Philippians 2 as licensing an ontological emptying; contrasts them with Chalcedonian language and classical patristic exegesis.
 - Reframes accommodation-language (Calvinian) so accommodation does not equal abrogation of deity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes a careful functional/ontological distinction language - useful for bridging biblical exegesis and metaphysical categories without capitulating to reductionism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and broader evangelical circles as a concise, orthodox corrective to kenotic readings.
 - Frequently cited in seminary syllabi and introductory Christology resources as a clear summary of the orthodox Reformed stance.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to move from biblical texts (Philippians, John) to theological formulation while preserving ecclesial confessions; useful for polemical and pastoral contexts where kenoticism appears.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation:** The eternal Son taking to himself a truly human nature in addition to his divine nature; central redemptive event.
- **Hypostatic union:** The union of two complete natures (divine, human) in the one person (hypostasis) of the Son; preserves identity and distinction.
- **Kenosis:** Literally "emptying" (Phil 2:7); Ferguson treats it as voluntary functional self-limitation rather than ontological self-loss.
 - Contrast: *functional kenosis* (accepted) vs *ontological kenosis* (rejected).
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The ascription of properties of both natures to the one person; explains how the divine Son can suffer and die according to his human nature.
- **Divine immutability / impassibility:** Attributes affirmed and protected against kenotic accounts that would imply essential change or suffering in the divine nature.
- **Preexistence / eternal Son:** The Son's personal existence prior to the incarnation; grounds for understanding incarnation as assumption, not becoming God.
- **Two natures / two wills (Dyothelitism):** Acceptance that Christ possesses two willing capacities corresponding to his two natures, safeguarding full humanity without splitting the person.
- **Accommodation:** God's self-revelation in ways suited to human understanding and weakness; not a subtraction of divine reality.
- **Mediation:** Christ as sole mediator who unites God and humanity by virtue of his two natures united in one person.
- **Soteriology (atonement):** The incarnation's necessity for representative obedience and substitutionary suffering enacted by the God-man.
- **Functional self-limitation:** Key terminus to describe how the Son refrains from independent exercise of some divine prerogatives without ceasing to be divine.
- **Philippians 2 exegesis:** Used as primary locus classicus; read Christ's "emptying" within kenosis-as-submission framework rather than ontic deprivation.
- **Use across loci:**
 - Definition source for an orthodox Reformed account of incarnation and hypostatic union.
 - Polemic and corrective against modern kenoticism; used in dogmatic arguments defending divine immutability.
 - Exegetical model for reading Philippians 2 and Johannine high Christology within systematic theology.
