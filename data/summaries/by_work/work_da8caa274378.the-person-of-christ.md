### TITLE
**The Person of Christ** - Stephen R. Holmes and Murray Rae

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary theological retrieval situated within late 20th-early 21st century anglophone systematic theology and historical theology.
 - Engages patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern resources to address renewed interest in precise Christological language after modern critiques (historical-critical Jesus research, process theology, social trinitarianism).
 - Aimed at advanced students and pastors seeking a concise, theologically robust account of Christ's personhood.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The central concern is to articulate a coherent, biblically rooted, and historically responsible account of the person of Christ that preserves both full divinity and full humanity without collapsing the distinction of natures or severing their union.
 - The book frames this as solving the perennial tension between ontology (what Christ is) and relational/ethical implications (what Christ does for salvation and the church).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-theological diagnosis: surveys classical articulations (patristic debates through Chalcedon; later medieval and Reformation appropriations), noting recurrent errors (Arianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism, modern reductions).
 - Biblical-theological exposition: reads key New Testament christological texts (e.g., John, Pauline corpus, Hebrews, Synoptics) for the interplay of divine and human predicates.
 - Systematic construction: defends a Chalcedonian framework updated by careful reflection on personhood, will, and action - including:
 - Affirmation of the hypostatic union as the primary explanatory category.
 - Distinction and appropriate communion of properties (communicatio idiomatum) without confusion.
 - Defense of dyothelitism (two wills) as soteriologically necessary.
 - Practical corollaries: implications for atonement, mediation, the sacraments, Christology in preaching and pastoral care.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic authorities: Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria, Augustine.
 - Chalcedonian tradition and subsequent ecumenical formulations.
 - Reformation figures (e.g., Luther, Calvin) for soteriological and sacramental emphases.
 - Modern interlocutors: Karl Barth, Pannenberg, Moltmann, feminist and social-trinitarian critiques, and historical Jesus scholars.
 - Scripture as normative and decisive, interpreted via the tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (primary), Trinity (implications and interrelations), incarnation, atonement, soteriology, revelation, ecclesiology (mediator role), and doctrinal method.

- **Closing line**
 - The book insists that a properly balanced, historically conscious Chalcedonian Christology remains indispensable: the mystery of the hypostatic union is both doctrinal guardrail and pastoral resource for understanding Christ as divine Savior and genuine human Mediator.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes *personhood* language over mere metaphysical schema: Christ's identity as a hypostasis governs the integration of divine and human predicates.
 - Stresses theological anthropology - why Christ's full humanity matters not only ontologically but for redemption and the sanctification of human nature.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern reductionisms that domesticate Jesus either as purely moral exemplar or merely a religious genius.
 - Pushes back on some recent "social" Christologies that overly personalize the divine persons at the expense of Chalcedonian categories.
 - Nuances radical kenotic proposals by defending meaningful divine agency within the economy of the Incarnation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines application of communicatio idiomatum: offers pragmatic rules for attributing properties to the person of Christ that prevent category mistakes while allowing theological speech about "God suffering" without theological collapse.
 - Frames dyothelitism in relational and soteriological terms - not merely metaphysical necessity but as required for genuine obedience and redemptive action.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical seminaries for clarity and balance; used as a course text for intermediate/advanced Christology.
 - Appreciated by ecumenical theologians for its responsible retrieval of Chalcedon while engaging modern concerns.
 - Criticized by some process and radical feminist theologians for retaining classical metaphysical commitments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise model of constructive retrieval: historically informed, biblically attentive, and doctrinally conservative without being apologetically closed.
 - Helpful for pastors, preachers, and teachers needing a disciplined account linking doctrine to worship and ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - Christ as one hypostasis in two natures; central explanatory category used to protect unity and distinction.
- **Chalcedonian Formula** - Normative touchstone; authors adopt and reapply its two-nature, one-person claims.
- **Two Natures (Dyophysitism)** - Full divine and full human natures maintained without confusion or division.
- **Two Wills (Dyothelitism)** - Affirmed as necessary for genuine human obedience and salvific action.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - Carefully qualified: allows attribution of human and divine predicates to Christ while avoiding category error.
- **Kenosis** - Treated critically: explicated as self-limitation within divine agency, not loss of deity.
- **Personhood / Hypostasis** - Emphasized over abstract "nature" talk; person is the locus of action and identity.
- **Incarnation** - The decisive event for covenantal reconciliation; theological center linking ontology and soteriology.
- **Atonement / Mediator** - Christ's personhood grounds both the objective achievement (satisfaction/substitutional themes) and relational mediation.
- **Christological Heresies** - Arianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism used diagnostically to delimit orthodox options.
- **Scriptural Christology** - New Testament texts function as normative corrective to abstract metaphysics.
- **Trinitarian implications** - Christology is developed in dialogue with doctrine of God; relational language and personhood cross-inform both loci.
- **Historical Jesus vs. Christ of Faith** - The book navigates historical-critical insights without reducing the confessional Christ.
- **Soteriological Anthropology** - Christ's full humanity as normative for human restoration.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise definitional source for seminary courses on Christology and systematic theology.
 - As a polemical resource against reductive modernist and postmodern Christologies.
 - As an exegetical-model demonstrating how to read New Testament christological texts within the theological tradition.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking doctrine of God, incarnation, and practical pastoral theology (preaching, sacraments, ethics).
