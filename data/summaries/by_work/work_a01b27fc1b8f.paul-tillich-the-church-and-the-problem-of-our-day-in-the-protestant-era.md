### TITLE
Paul Tillich, "The Church and the Problem of Our Day" (essay in The Protestant Era, 1948)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Protestant theology (post‑WWII, rise of secularization, modern mass society).
 - Tillich writing as an existentialist Protestant theologian operating in the interstices of liberalism and neo‑orthodoxy; part of the project of diagnosing modern culture and the church's vocation within it.
- **Central thesis**
 - The church must be reunderstood not as a closed institutional fortress nor as a purely inward spiritual fellowship, but as a dialectical sign and instrument of the ultimate (divine) reality in a secularized age-mediating judgment and promise while resisting both ecclesial idolatry and privatized religion.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modernity has fragmented the authority of traditional ecclesiastical forms; the church faces loss of function and credibility.
 - Critique of two extremes:
 - The exclusive institutionalism that identifies the church with visible structures and claims coercive authority.
 - The purely spiritual/invisible idealism that reduces the church to an inner state or private fellowship.
 - Positive proposal:
 - Reclaim the **visible-invisible** distinction as dialectical: the church is both visible (historical community, sacraments, institutions) and invisible (depth of faith, presence of Christ).
 - The true church manifests as a symbolic‑existential presence-it is the presence of the New Being and consequently an agent of judgment (condemnation of idolatry) and promise (reconciliation).
 - Practical implication: churches must pursue authenticity, prophetic witness, and cultural engagement, not retreat or triumphalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages implicitly with Schleiermacher (subjective religion), liberal Protestantism, and elements of neo‑orthodoxy (e.g., Barth) though Tillich distances himself from Barthian exclusivism.
 - Draws on existentialist philosophy and his own method of correlation (culture's questions ↔ Christian answers).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (primary), with implications for revelation, Christology (presence of Christ as ground of church), soteriology (new being), sacramentality (symbol and efficacy), and the theology of culture/secularization.
- **Closing line**
 - Tillich centers the church as a dialectical, symbolic presence: neither merely visible institution nor mere invisible feeling, but the concrete mediator of the divine judgment and promise in a secular age.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Ecclesiology as existential and symbolic: the church's identity is determined by its participation in the "New Being" rather than by bureaucratic continuity or private piety.
 - Stress on the church's twofold task-judgment and promise-situating ecclesial mission within cultural critique and reconciliation.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects Schleiermacher's privatizing tendencies by insisting on public, historical manifestation.
 - Critiques institutional triumphalism common in traditional ecclesiology and the retreating privatism of some liberal churches.
 - Unlike Barth's more confessional, revelation‑centered ecclesiology, Tillich offers a correlated, culture‑embedded account that keeps existential human questions in view.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reworked **visible/invisible** distinction into a nondualistic dialectic: visibility is necessary but never exhaustive of the church's reality.
 - Use of "symbol" and "sign" language for ecclesial presence-church as "sign and instrument" of ultimate concern.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in mid‑20th century Protestant theology, especially among theologians sympathetic to theology of culture and existential concerns.
 - Less accepted by strict confessional or neo‑orthodox circles but used by progressive and ecumenical theologians to argue for engaged, prophetic ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a resilient framework for thinking the church's public role under secularization.
 - Useful corrective to both institutionalism and privatism; valuable for ecclesiological teaching, pastoral strategy, and theology of culture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible Church**
 - The historical, institutional, sacramental community-necessary locus of witness but not identical with ultimate reality.
- **Invisible Church**
 - The depth reality of the church as grounded in the presence of Christ and the "New Being"; not merely subjective feeling.
 - Relation: Tillich insists on a dialectical unity-visibility expresses but does not exhaust invisibility.
- **Symbol / Sign**
 - Church as a mediating symbol that participates in and points to the ultimate; symbols disclose spiritual reality.
- **Ultimate Concern**
 - The orienting center of human existence; the church mediates access to the ultimate.
- **New Being**
 - Soteriological term: the state of redeemed existence realized in Christ and manifested in the church.
- **Judgment and Promise**
 - Twin functions of the church: to critique idolatry (judgment) and to offer reconciliation (promise).
- **Secularization / Culture**
 - The sociological context that displaces traditional ecclesial authority; demands a theology of cultural engagement.
- **Institution vs. Community**
 - Tension: institutions provide order and continuity; community is authentic relational existence; both are necessary.
- **Ecclesial Authenticity**
 - Measure of church faithfulness: fidelity to the presence of the New Being in practice and witness.
- **Correlation Method**
 - Tillich's methodological posture: theology answers existential cultural questions-applied to ecclesiology here.
- **Prophetic Witness**
 - The church's role in publicly confronting cultural idols and articulating hope.
- **Sacramentality**
 - Sacraments as visible‑efficacious signs of invisible grace; part of the visible/invisible mediation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a nondualistic visible/invisible ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic** against both ecclesial triumphalism and privatizing religion.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theology of culture and public theology, informing pastoral strategy and ecumenical conversation.
