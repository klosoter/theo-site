### TITLE
Philipp W. Rosemann, Peter Lombard (Great Medieval Thinkers) - Focus: **Communicatio idiomatum** in Lombardian Christology and sacramental theology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 12th-century scholastic milieu; Peter Lombard (c. 1100-1160), bishop of Paris. 
 - The Sentences (Libri Quattuor Sententiarum) becomes the medieval standard textbook for theological instruction.
 - Rosemann (modern historian of medieval thought) situates Lombard as a compiler-systematizer whose method shaped later scholasticism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Lombard seeks to reconcile authoritative patristic corpus into a coherent pedagogical whole, with special attention to how divine and human properties are attributed to Christ - the problem addressed by **communicatio idiomatum** (the exchange/attribution of properties between natures in the one person of Christ).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Rosemann unfolds Lombard's method and theological content by tracing the structure of the Sentences:
 - Book I: God and the Trinity - foundations of personhood and properties.
 - Book II: Creation, sin, grace - anthropological presuppositions for incarnation.
 - Book III: Incarnation and Christology - central locus for communicatio idiomatum.
 - Book IV: Sacraments and eschatology - practical consequences of Christ's person and actions.
 - Major moves on communicatio idiomatum:
 - Distinguish person vs. nature: Lombard emphasizes attribution of predicates primarily to the person.
 - Use patristic authorities to justify ascribing divine attributes (omnipresence, omnipotence) to the incarnate Christ while retaining human properties.
 - Apply communicatio to sacramental efficacy: presence, promise and the transfer of grace in sacraments derive from the person of Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Extensive patristic corpus (Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Gregory), plus contemporary scholastic interlocutors.
 - Rosemann highlights Lombard's reliance on auctoritas as method: compilation, selective harmonization, and dialectical questions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology (hypostatic union), incarnation, communicatio idiomatum, sacraments (especially Eucharist), grace and merit, ecclesiology as mediated by sacramental presence.

- **Closing line**
 - Lombard, as Rosemann shows, is the pivotal medieval systematizer whose treatment of **communicatio idiomatum** anchors a pedagogical Christology that makes the person of Christ the theological hinge between divine act and human salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Lombard's pedagogical ordering: doctrinal statements are framed as disputable sententiae rooted in authoritative citation rather than purely speculative synthesis.
 - Emphasis on the primacy of the person for predicate transfer - attributes are attributed to Christ principally through personhood, not by confusion of natures.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - More methodical and pedagogically oriented than earlier patristic expositions; less metaphysical speculation than later high scholasticism (e.g., Aquinas), yet creates conceptual room for it.
 - Contrasts with purely Augustinian devotional Christology by juridically and scholastically structuring Christological attributions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of **communicatio idiomatum** as a working analytic tool across loci (not merely as a Christological footnote).
 - Formalization of sententiae as a didactic unit that invites disputation and glossing.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard textbook status: became the scaffold for theological education until the late medieval period.
 - Shaped Aquinas, Bonaventure, medieval disputation culture, and later Reformation debates (Lutherans and Reformed theologians appealed to or reacted against Lombardian formulations concerning predicate transfer and sacramental presence).

- **Enduring value**
 - For teaching: exemplary model of medieval method, use of authority, and the interface of Christology and sacramental theology.
 - For research: a concentrated locus for studying how medieval theology negotiated personhood, nature, and attribution - especially via **communicatio idiomatum**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sententiae** - Lombard's unitized theological propositions gathered from authoritative writings; pedagogical and disputational backbone.
- **Libri Quattuor (Four Books)** - structural outline: Trinity; Creation/grace; Incarnation/Christology; Sacraments/last things.
- **Auctoritas** - appeal to patristic authority as theological proof-text; methodologically central.
- **Persona (person)** - the primary locus to which predicates are attributed in Christological formulae.
- **Natura (nature)** - divine and human natures distinguished; predicates belong properly to natures but are communicable to the person.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - doctrine of mutual attribution of properties between Christ's two natures via the single person; used by Lombard to justify ascribing divine actions/attributes to the incarnate Christ and to ground sacramental presence.
 - Practical use: grounds statements that Christ is both omnipotent (divine) and suffers (human) without confusion of natures.
- **Hypostatic union** - technical schema for the union of two natures in one person; Lombard's practical application rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Sacrament (sacramentum)** - visible sign and efficacious instrument of grace; efficacy rooted in the person and acts of Christ as treated under communicatio.
- **Predicate transfer** - the logical-theological mechanism by which properties move from nature to person and vice versa in Christological statements.
- **Disputational method** - question-and-answer format that shapes theological reasoning and ambiguity permitting later elaboration.
- **Theological pedagogy** - Lombard as model for curricular formation of theologians.
- **Exegetical-aetiology** - use of scripture and patristic texts to justify doctrinal placements in the Sentences.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a primary definition source for medieval Christology and the operative formulation of **communicatio idiomatum**.
 - As a polemical resource in debates on sacramental presence and predicate attribution (medieval and Reformation controversies).
 - As an exegetical-model and pedagogical exemplar for the structure and method of scholastic theology.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking personhood, natures, and sacramental efficacy in systematic treatments.
