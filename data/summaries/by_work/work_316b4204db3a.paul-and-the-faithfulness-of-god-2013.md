### TITLE
**Paul and the Faithfulness of God (2013)** - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Volume 4 in Wrights Christian Origins and the Question of God; post-New Perspective maturation, engaging Second Temple Judaism and Greco-Roman philosophy; contributes to debates on justification, empire, apocalyptic, and the shape of Pauline theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** **Gods covenant faithfulness** has reached its intended goal in **Israel's Messiah and the Spirit**, reconstituting the **one people of God** and inaugurating **new creation**; Paul reframes **monotheism, election, and eschatology** around Jesus' lordship, thereby redefining justification, ecclesiology, and mission.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Method/worldview:** Critical-realist, narrative approach; Paul as an ancient Jew reshaping symbols and praxis; theology as the rearticulation of **monotheism, election, eschatology**.
 - **God and the Messiah:** **Pistis Christou** as the **faithfulness of the Messiah**; **righteousness of God** as covenant faithfulness; Jesus' death/resurrection as the decisive exodus-exile resolution.
 - **People of God:** **Justification** as the courts declaration of covenant membership in the present; Spirit as badge of identity; **works of the law** as Jewish boundary markers now relativized in the Messiah.
 - **Eschatology/new creation:** Resurrection as the engine of **inaugurated eschatology**; church as **new temple** and **polis**; cosmic scope of reconciliation; future judgment **according to works** cohering with present justification.
 - **Philosophy and empire:** Paul offers a **Jewish-messianic philosophy** rivaling Stoicism/Epicureanism and **announces Jesus as Lord** over against Caesar.
 - **Israel and the nations:** Romans 9-11 as Gods **irrevocable election** fulfilled in the Messiah with future hope for Israel; unity of Jew and Gentile as the covenant climax.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Second Temple corpus (Torah, Prophets, Psalms; Qumran; Wisdom of Solomon; 4 Ezra), **Philo** and **Josephus**; Greco-Roman moralists (Seneca, Epictetus), Stoics/Epicureans; modern scholars: **E. P. Sanders**, **J. D. G. Dunn**, **Richard Hays**, **John Barclay**, **J. Louis Martyn** (apocalyptic), with critiques of classic Lutheran readings and some Reformed construals.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Revelation and Scripture** (Pauls rereading of Israel's story); **God/monotheism**; **Christology** (Messiah/Lord); **Pneumatology**; **Ecclesiology** (temple/polis); **Soteriology** (justification, participation, election); **Anthropology and sin** (idolatry, distorted vocation); **Eschatology** (resurrection, judgment, new creation).
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is **the one faithful God crafting a renewed human family in the Messiah by the Spirit for the sake of the worlds new creation**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Triad of **monotheism, election, eschatology** as the grammar of Pauls thought.
 - **Justification** as ecclesial and forensic membership-declaration, not the mechanism of transfer-righteousness.
 - **Pistis Christou** as **Messiahs faithfulness**, grounding believers faith and status.
 - **Church as temple/polis**, a public, political reality under Jesus Lordship.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against the **introspective conscience** model and a purely ordo salutis frame; for a **historia salutis** narrative.
 - Nuances Reformation readings of **imputation** and **righteousness of God**, locating righteousness primarily in **Gods covenant fidelity**.
 - Balances **apocalyptic disjunction** with Israel-continuity; resists both quietist and over-realized eschatologies.
 - Pushes beyond empire-critique caricatures while maintaining a real **anti-idolatrous imperial challenge**.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Fresh worldview** method; **temple-ecclesiology**; **virtue redefined** in the Spirit; **renewed image-bearing** as vocation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - **Reformed** responses mixed: appreciation for biblical-theological scope and ecclesiology; critique on justification (e.g., charges of undercutting imputation/assurance). Some Federal Vision advocates appealed to aspects of Wright, though Wright does not endorse FV distinctives.
 - Widely influential in Pauline studies, mission theology, and political theology; catalyzed debates with Piper, Schreiner, Barclay, and apocalyptic Paul scholars.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Integrates exegesis, history, and theology; offers a **coherent Pauline metanarrative**; pedagogically useful for eschatology, ecclesiology, and Pauls doctrine of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faithfulness of God (dikaiosyne theou):** Gods covenant fidelity to promises, revealed in Jesus and the Spirit.
- **Pistis Christou:** Read as **faithfulness of the Messiah**, the basis and model of believers faith.
- **Justification:** Present, forensic declaration of covenant membership; grounded in the Messiah; to be vindicated in the future judgment.
 - Contrast: not the infusion of virtue nor primarily imputed moral substance; it is status-in-court.
- **Works of the Law:** Boundary markers (circumcision, food laws, calendar) that cannot define the renewed people in the Messiah.
- **Election:** Reconfigured around the Messiah; **one worldwide family of Abraham** by faith and Spirit.
- **Monotheism redefined:** The one God known in and through Jesus and the Spirit; anti-idolatry at the core of sin-diagnosis.
- **Eschatology (inaugurated):** Resurrection launched new creation; already/not-yet frames sanctification and mission.
- **New Creation:** Cosmic horizon of salvation; church as advance sign and instrument; not escape to heaven.
- **Church as Temple/Polis:** Indwelt by the Spirit; publicly visible social order under Jesus Lordship.
- **Participation in the Messiah:** Union-with-Christ language as vocational and transformative, not collapsing into mere moralism.
- **Image-bearing/vocation:** Salvation restores human vocation to reflect Gods wise rule into creation.
- **Apocalyptic:** God's decisive invasion in the Messiah without jettisoning Israels story.
- **Final Judgment according to works:** Coheres with present justification; Spirit-produced life as evidence.
- **Pauline philosophy:** A rival moral-intellectual vision to Stoicism and Epicureanism, centered on the Messiah.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for justification, righteousness of God, pistis Christou.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Romans, Galatians, and 1 Corinthians on ecclesiology and empire.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for eschatology (resurrection, new creation) and anthropology (image-bearing).
 - As a **polemic resource** against individualistic or disembodied soteriology and against flattening ordo salutis frameworks.
