### TITLE
"The Idea of Revelation and Theories of Evolution" - B. B. Warfield (reprinted in Selected Shorter Writings). 
Context: Princeton Reformed theology, turn of 20th century; engagement with Darwinian biology, rising historical-critical Biblical scholarship, and defense of Scripture's authority.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century American conservatism: scientific advances (Darwin, paleontology) pressuring traditional readings of Genesis 1-11; Warfield writes to vindicate orthodox doctrine against both naturalistic science and liberal abandonment of revelation.
 - Milieu: Princeton theology's commitment to propositional revelation and inerrancy, but with rigorous engagement with contemporary science.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: The doctrine of revelation properly understood does not require rejection of evolutionary theory; science and Scripture occupy distinct epistemic spheres. Revelation (special) teaches religious truth; natural science discloses God's ordinary works. Conflict arises only when either domain oversteps its competence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define revelation: insistence on propositional content in special revelation while acknowledging modes of accommodation.
 - Distinguish general vs special revelation:
 - General revelation (natural theology, science) reveals God's power/order but cannot impart salvific truth.
 - Special revelation (Scripture) communicates saving truth and authoritative doctrine.
 - Analyze Darwinian theory: treat evolution as a scientific hypothesis not intrinsically atheistic; evaluate theological implications only where theory claims to displace divine agency.
 - Exegetical point on Genesis 1-11 and Days of Creation:
 - Argues the biblical text must be read according to its literary intent; literal 24-hour day reading is not mandatory for affirmation of creation doctrine.
 - Urges restraint: Scripture is not a scientific textbook; Genesis conveys theological truths about God as Creator, not scientific mechanics.
 - Synthesis: permit theistic evolution as a legitimate working hypothesis provided one preserves doctrine of God's governance and Scripture's authority.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Scientific: Darwin and contemporary evolutionary biologists (as representatives of naturalistic explanations).
 - Theological/scientific mediators: Asa Gray (theistic evolutionists), liberal critics who subordinate revelation to modern science, and strict literalists/fundamentalists within Protestantism.
 - Intellectual opponents: militant atheists and capitulating liberal theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), inspiration and inerrancy, creation and providence, hermeneutics of Genesis 1-11, anthropology (origins of man implicitly), and the proper relation of theology to natural science.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center of gravity: maintain robust confidence in Scripture's revelatory authority while granting science liberty to explicate God's ordinary works - an ordered reconciliation of faith and empirical inquiry.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, methodical distinction between spheres of knowledge: theology handles divine saving truth; science handles empirical mechanisms.
 - Defense of inerrancy coupled with hermeneutical modesty about non-doctrinal biblical details.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects naive literalism that forces Genesis into scientific claims (Days of Creation debate).
 - Opposes liberalism that reduces Scripture to moral/philosophical wisdom by insisting on propositional revelation for salvation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operationalization of **general vs special revelation** as normative grid for assessing conflicts.
 - Use of **accommodation** to explain how Scripture can teach theological truth without teaching modern science.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among conservative and neo-evangelical circles as a precedent for engaging evolution without surrendering orthodoxy.
 - Rejected by later fundamentalists who insisted on young-earth literalism; criticized by some for insufficiently literalist stance.
 - Important historical resource for contemporary evangelical attempts to articulate theistic evolution or evolutionary creation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches a durable methodological model for theologians: preserve doctrinal essentials, respect scientific autonomy, and refine hermeneutics of formative biblical texts (Genesis 1-11).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation**
 - Special revelation: propositional, salvific, authoritative (Scripture).
 - General revelation: God's self-disclosure in nature; epistemically limited.

- **General and Special Revelation**
 - Warfield's pivot: both authentic but distinct; conflict only when one claims competence of the other.

- **Inerrancy**
 - Scripture without error in its authoritative teaching; Warfield defends propositional inerrancy while allowing nontechnical statements to reflect authors' literary modes.

- **Accommodation**
 - Biblical accommodation explains Scripture's use of phenomenological or culturally framed language without endorsing scientific claims.

- **Theistic Evolution / Evolutionary Creation**
 - Evolution accepted as God's method of providentially bringing about biological diversity, contingent upon preserving divine causality and purpose.

- **Science and Scripture (Genesis 1-11)**
 - Scriptural passages (esp. Genesis 1-11) read primarily for theological truth about Creator and covenantal order, not as a natural-history manual.

- **Days of Creation**
 - Warfield allows non-literal or framework/analogical readings; days need not be 24-hour periods to sustain doctrine of divine creation.

- **Authority**
 - Distinction between Scripture's authority in religious matters and science's authority in empirical descriptions.

- **Methodological Autonomy**
 - Science and theology operate by distinct methods and criteria; each has legitimate jurisdiction.

- **Providence**
 - God's ongoing governance compatible with evolutionary processes.

- **Hermeneutic Restraint**
 - Rule: interpret Genesis according to redemptive-theological intent, not forced by modern scientific categories.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the operational distinction between general and special revelation.
 - As a **polemic** against both naturalistic scientism and theological capitulation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-11 that preserves doctrine while permitting scientific hypotheses (e.g., evolution) as descriptive mechanisms.
