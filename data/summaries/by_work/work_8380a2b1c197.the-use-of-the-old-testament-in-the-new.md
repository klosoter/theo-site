### TITLE
**The Use of the Old Testament in the New** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Product of late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship addressing crises in OT-NT relations: reaction against reductive form-criticism, hyper-skeptical history-of-religions approaches, and against free-form allegorical typology.
 - Writes from a confessional Reformed perspective, in dialogue with Geerhardus Vos (redemptive-historical method), Herman Ridderbos, and with awareness of canonical criticism (Brevard Childs) and modern critical scholarship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament authors legitimately and theologically read the Old Testament as centered on Christ: OT texts find their fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus through a Spirit-wrought, apostolic interpretive act that is both historically grounded and theologically authoritative.
 - Problem addressed: how to account for NT "fulfillment" claims without collapsing biblical authorial intention, inventing allegory, or reducing prophecy to mere incidental correspondence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological foundation:
 - Asserts the unity of Scripture and the covenantal, promise-fulfillment pattern of redemptive history.
 - Emphasizes the role of the Spirit and apostolic authority in disclosing fuller, Christ-centered meaning.
 - Hermeneutical principles:
 - Distinguishes predictive prophecy from typology and insists on objective correspondences between type and antitype.
 - Advocates canonical reading but within a christocentric, confessional hermeneutic (analogy of faith).
 - Exegetical exemplars:
 - Uses NT readings of Psalms, Isaiah, and key prophetic texts to show how apostles declare fulfillment, not merely allude.
 - Theological implications:
 - Connects hermeneutics to doctrines of revelation, inspiration, covenant, and Christology; guards the coherence of redemptive-historical preaching.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Affirmative affinities: Geerhardus Vos (typology/redemptive history), Herman Ridderbos.
 - Critical interlocutors: liberal/form-critical scholarship, some uses of Brevard Childs (canonical method) and modern skeptics about predictive prophecy.
 - Reformed confessional sources implicitly operative (Westminster tradition).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration; biblical authority.
 - Covenant theology (unity of the covenant of grace; promise-fulfillment motif).
 - Christology (Christ as center and fulfillment).
 - Prophecy, apostolic authority, pneumatology (Spirit's role in interpretation).

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin locates the theological center of gravity in a Spirit-authorized, covenantal reading: the NT's use of the OT is authentic, objective fulfillment of God's promise in Christ, mediated by apostolic proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that NT fulfillment is not eisegesis but Spirit-wrought, apostolic exegesis anchored in redemptive-historical reality.
 - Typology is treated as historically grounded, objective correspondence (type/antitype), not merely illustrative or allegorical.
 - Emphasizes the covenantal promise-fulfillment pattern as the primary grid for OT-NT continuity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back simultaneously against:
 - Liberal critics who reduce prophecy to contemporaneous concerns or accidental correspondence.
 - Romantic or free allegorists who read arbitrary typologies into the text.
 - Overly formal canonical critics who decouple apostolic interpretive authority from confessional commitments.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuances of "fulfillment" as both an event in redemptive history and as apostolic theological interpretation.
 - Recasts typology in service of a confessional, pneumatological hermeneutic rather than as a purely literary device.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read and taught in Reformed seminaries; often cited in courses on biblical theology and hermeneutics.
 - Influenced contemporary conservative evangelical treatments of OT-NT relations and typological preaching.
 - Provoked engagement from canonical critics and historical-critical scholars over claims about apostolic interpretive authority.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust, theologically integrated model for connecting OT texts to Christ and the NT witness.
 - Serves as a corrective to both skepticism and loose allegorizing-helpful for preachers, exegetes, and systematic theologians.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology** - historical persons/events in Israel that foreshadow Christ; objective correspondence, not mere illustration.
- **Fulfillment (pleroo)** - OT promises/events consummated in Christ; both an eschatological event and apostolic interpretive declaration.
- **Promise-fulfillment pattern** - the covenantal axis through which redemptive history advances and OT meaning is realized in Christ.
- **Apostolic authority** - the normative interpretive function of the NT authors, enabled by the Spirit, for reading the OT.
- **Analogy of faith** - hermeneutical principle: Scripture interprets Scripture within the unity of redemptive revelation.
- **Canonical reading** - attention to how the OT functions within the canon as read and applied by the NT.
- **Predictive prophecy vs. typological reference** - distinction maintained: some texts are predictive, some are typical; both can be legitimately seen as fulfilled in Christ.
- **Pneumatological hermeneutic** - the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling the apostles to discern fuller meaning in the OT.
- **Redemptive-historical method** - reading Scripture as an unfolding covenantal drama culminating in Christ.
- **Sensus plenior (implicit caution)** - Gaffin allows fuller divine meaning disclosed in NT but restrains speculative uses ungrounded in apostolic testimony.
- **Inspiration / revelation** - presupposed unity and divine authorship that permits legitimate NT reapplication of OT texts.
- **Christocentric reading** - central rule: Christ as interpretive key to OT meaning.
- **Type / antitype** - technical pair describing prefigurement relations; Gaffin defends objective, historically anchored relations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed typology and promise-fulfillment hermeneutics.
- As a **polemic** against liberal form-criticism and against indiscriminate allegorical readings.
- As an **exegetical model** in preaching and biblical-theological courses, demonstrating principled OT-to-NT connections.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking systematic theology (covenant, Christology, inspiration) with biblical hermeneutics.
