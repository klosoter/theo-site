### TITLE
Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free - Anthony Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written from a mid-20th-century Reformed perspective addressing academic and church audiences familiar with Protestant confessions.
 - Engages post-Reformation exegetical tradition while reacting to modern historical-critical pressures and rising debates about Pauline Judaism and the New Perspective on Paul.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's gospel is fundamentally about an inner liberation - the human heart set free from sin, law‑condemnation, and the tyranny of the flesh - effected historically in Christ and applied by the Spirit. The theological problem is to account for how forensic justification, covenantal belonging, and progressive sanctification cohere without collapsing historia salutis into an abstract or purely sequential ordo salutis.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Paul's language and metaphors (justification, freedom, adoption, union with Christ).
 - Historical grounding: Christ's death and resurrection as the decisive acts in salvation history (historia salutis).
 - Application and appropriation: faith and the Spirit as the means by which believers experience freedom (ordo salutis considered but subordinated to history).
 - Pastoral implications: assurance, holiness, and the church's life flow from union with Christ rather than mere moralism or legalism.
 - Final synthesis: Paul integrates forensic and participatory dimensions so that justification is not merely declared but experienced in the transformed heart.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Apostle Paul (primary interlocutor via canonical letters).
 - Reformation authorities (Luther, Calvin) for doctrine of justification; patristic sources for union motifs.
 - Contemporary critics and exegetes (historical-critical scholars; early articulations of a New Perspective) as objects of correction.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as normative for Paul), Christology (atoning death and resurrection), Trinity (Spirit's role in appropriation), justification (forensic and covenantal), sanctification, union with Christ, election, covenant theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema centers Pauline soteriology on Christ's historical work made personally effective by the Spirit so that justification and sanctification form one redeemed story: the heart set free.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that Paul's primary concern is *inner liberation* - freedom of the heart - rather than abstract doctrinal formulas divorced from spiritual transformation.
 - Balanced insistence: forensic justification remains essential but is never isolated from participatory union with Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Paul to either pure forensicism (solely legal declaration) or to purely covenantal/communal categories that marginalize imputation.
 - Pushback against approaches that overly prioritize a rigid ordo salutis sequence; favors anchoring sequence within the unfolding historia salutis.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates older pietistic language (heart, freedom) within rigorous systematic theology, insisting theological terms must map onto spiritual reality.
 - Encourages speaking of justification as both declarative and dynamically efficacious because of union with Christ.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for pastoral clarity and doctrinal balance; used in seminary courses on Pauline theology and soteriology.
 - Influential as a corrective to polarizing readings (legalistic vs. purely participatory) and as a bridge for pastoral theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable synthesis of exegetical sensitivity and systematic coherence; useful for teaching how justification, sanctification, and assurance interrelate in pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration of righteousness; affirmed as central but presented as inseparable from union with Christ and the believer's new life.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive transformation of the heart; the experiential outworking of the freedom won in Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The pivotal Pauline category linking Christ's historical acts to believers' present status and experience.
- **Imputation**
 - Righteousness of Christ credited to believers; defended against reduction to mere metaphor.
- **Faith (pistis)**
 - Instrumental and personal trust that appropriates Christ; faith is both trust and covenantal belonging.
- **Freedom / liberation**
 - Heart-set-free motif: freedom from law's condemnation, sin's bondage, and death's fear.
- **Law**
 - Functionally interpreted as both guide and indictment; law exposes sin and drives the need for Christ's liberating work.
- **Spirit**
 - Agent of appropriation, new life, and assurance; mediates the moral and experiential reality of justification.
- **Historia salutis**
 - The historical sequence of God's saving acts (Christ's death and resurrection) that ground all soteriological claims.
- **Ordo salutis**
 - The theological ordering of salvation's application; treated carefully so it does not supplant or distort the historical event.
- **Atonement / Redemption**
 - Christ's substitutionary death as decisive purchase and release from bondage.
- **Adoption**
 - Covenantal status resulting from justification; emphasizes relational incorporation into God's family.
- **Flesh vs Spirit**
 - Pauline contrast explaining ongoing moral struggle and the Spirit's renewing power.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a balanced definitional source for teaching Pauline soteriology that connects forensic and participatory models.
 - As a polemical resource against both reductionist forensic-only readings and New Perspective over-corrections that neglect imputation.
 - As an exegetical model emphasizing canonical Paul and pastoral implications rather than abstract systematization.
