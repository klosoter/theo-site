### TITLE
Compendium Theologiae Christianae and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th century Reformed scholasticism (Turretin 1623-1687). Geneva as a confessional Calvinist center reacting to Arminianism, Amyraldianism (hypothetical universalism), Socinianism, and Roman Catholic claims.
 - Works function as systematic textbook (Compendium) and pastoral-catechetical summary (Catechism) for training ministers and catechumens within an orthodox Calvinist academy milieu.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate, defend, and systematize classical Reformed orthodoxy against perceived errors on sin, grace, revelation, and the Spirit; to supply a compact, scholastic exposition of doctrine suitable for disputation and pastoral instruction.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Ordered scholastic presentation: loci communes (God, Scripture, Trinity, Christ, covenant, salvation, church, sacraments, last things).
 - Precise definitions followed by syllogistic proofs from Scripture and patristic/reformed authorities.
 - Polemical sections targeted at Remonstrants, Socinians, Thomists (notably on analogia entis), and enthusiasts (on gifts).
 - Emphasis on biblical normativity: theology must be subordinate to Scripture (analogia fidei) and guided by confessions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine, Calvin, Reformers; contemporaries/opponents: Arminians/Remonstrants, Amyraut, Socinians, Roman Catholic scholastics (countering analogia entis), and later charismatic claims as they arise in reception.
 - Uses Scripture as ultimate norm, with heavy reliance on Reformed confessions and scholastic method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology:** inspiration, authority, inerrancy of Scripture; canon and interpretation.
 - **Trinity and Christology:** orthodox formulations, communicatio idiomatum, two natures.
 - **Soteriology:** total depravity, election, effectual calling, justification, sanctification.
 - **Pneumatology:** regeneration, indwelling, ordinary vs extraordinary gifts, cessation of prophetic/apostolic revelations.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** covenantal signs, pastoral ministry, discipline.
 - **Eschatology:** general resurrection and final judgment.

- **Closing line**
 - A rigorously biblical, confessional, and scholastic statement of Reformed orthodoxy that defends Augustinian soteriology and the priority of the analogia fidei against both semipelagian and ontological-analogical rivals.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Combines compact catechetical clarity with rigorous disputational method: usable both for pulpit/catechism and for seminary disputation.
 - Strong stress on the primacy of Scripture over metaphysical analogies (firm analogia fidei stance).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Explicit polemic against Remonstrant/Amyraldian mitigations of particular redemption and against Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian tendencies.
 - Rejects Thomistic analogia entis (analogy of being) as opening speculative metaphysics into doctrine; insists on analogy of faith (doctrine shaped by Scripture).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not innovative in creation of new doctrines, but systematizes Reformed categories with careful terminological precision (e.g., clear distinctions between regeneration, conversion, and sanctification; between ordinary and extraordinary gifts).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative text for later Reformed academies (notably influence on Princeton and American classic Reformed theology).
 - Employed by confessional Protestants as a standard refutation of Arminianism and for defending inerrancy and cessationism in later debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogical clarity for teaching loci; polemical resource against errors on sin, grace, and revelation; a reliable map for classical Reformed pneumatology and bibliology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia fidei**
 - Theology subordinated to Scripture; truth known by revelation shapes theological analogies.

- **Analogia entis**
 - Rejected ontological analogical reasoning (Thomistic); seen as speculative and dangerous to sola Scriptura.

- **Total depravity**
 - Human inability to effect salvation; central rebuttal to Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian claims.

- **Effectual calling / regeneration**
 - Monergistic operation of the Spirit that secures conversion; regeneration precedes and enables faith.

- **Indwelling of the Spirit**
 - Real presence at regeneration; grounds sanctification and assurance, distinct from transient charismatic phenomena.

- **Inspiration and inerrancy**
 - Strong affirmation of verbal/ plenary inspiration and propositional inerrancy as normative for doctrine and practice.

- **Cessationism (ordinary vs extraordinary gifts)**
 - Distinguishes ordinary gifts (preaching, sacraments, Scripture) from extraordinary revelatory gifts; argues extraordinary sign gifts ceased with apostolic age.

- **Predestination / Particular redemption**
 - Defends particular (definite) atonement and unconditional election against Remonstrant modifications.

- **Scholastic method / loci**
 - Systematic loci form, precise definitions, disputation model for clarity and polemic.

- **Covenant theology**
 - Treats covenant as structuring salvation history; sacraments as covenantal signs and seals.

- **Catechetical compression**
 - The Catechism component reduces scholastic loci into concise forms for pastoral use.

- **Use in contemporary theology**
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulas (e.g., inerrancy, predestination).
 - As a **polemic** tool against Arminianism, modern analogia entis appeals, and charismatic claims (cessationist citation).
 - As an **exegetical-model** for doctrinal loci that prioritize Scripture and confessions.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pneumatology and bibliology debates-especially where historic Reformed positions are appealed to.
