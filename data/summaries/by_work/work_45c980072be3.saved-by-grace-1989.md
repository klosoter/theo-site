### TITLE
Saved by Grace (1989) - Anthony A. Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1989 by Eerdmans; Hoekema writes from mid-20th-century Reformed Protestantism (Calvin Theological Seminary). The book functions as a popular yet theologically careful soteriology for pastors, students, and laity amid late-20th-century debates over assurance, grace, and human responsibility.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Salvation is the sovereign gift of God effected and applied by grace in every stage - calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification - while preserving genuine human responsibility and experiential assurance.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes biblical and Reformed foundations for salvation as entirely by grace.
 - Distinguishes objective elements (Christ's redemptive work, justification) from subjective application (calling, regeneration).
 - Treats the ordo salutis while warning against collapsing it into historia salutis; affirms both definitive and progressive elements of sanctification.
 - Applies doctrine to pastoral concerns: assurance, perseverance, evangelical mission, and ethical fruit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Draws on classic Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster Confession), Kuyperian and neo-Calvinist reflections, and engages common 20th-century interlocutors - Arminian critiques, existential concerns about assurance, pietistic emphases on sanctification.
- **Doctrines treated:** Election, calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification (definitive and progressive), adoption, perseverance, glorification, common and preparatory grace, final judgment and eternal states; also touches Christology and biblical revelation insofar as they ground soteriology.
- **Site usage (5 focused topics in this work):**
 - **Final Judgment and Eternal States:** Hoekema affirms definitive eschatological differentiation - believers receive glorification and eternal life; unbelievers face condemnation - as the consummation of soteriological history.
 - **Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis:** Explicitly distinguishes the historical accomplishment of salvation in Christ (historia) from the logical/experiential ordering of applied salvation in the believer (ordo), warning against conflating the two.
 - **Sanctification Definitive and Progressive:** Argues for a twofold understanding - Christians are definitively sanctified in status, yet sanctification is progressively worked out in practice by the Spirit.
 - **Common Grace and Preparatory Grace:** Affirms common grace as God's restraining and enabling presence in the world and describes a form of preparatory grace that can lead unbelievers to the gospel without effectual salvation.
 - **Regeneration and Effectual Calling:** Treats regeneration as a sovereign, Spirit-wrought new birth that precedes or accompanies faith (depending on logical ordering) and grounds effectual calling as the Spirit's inward summons that results in conversion.
- **Closing line:** Hoekema centers the book on the sovereignty of saving grace - fully gratuitous, instrumentally received by faith, and effectually applied by the Spirit throughout the believer's life toward final glorification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Balances strong Reformed doctrines of sovereignty with pastoral attention to assurance and moral urgency.
 - Clear bifurcation of definitive (positional) and progressive (experiential) sanctification to avoid antinomian or perfectionist errors.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against simplistic ordo applications that make the logical sequence determinative of historical events (resists conflating ordo with historia).
 - Counters both hyper-Calvinist fatalism and semi-Pelagian overemphasis on preparatory human response.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not radical innovations, but precise clarifications: a disciplined use of "preparatory grace" distinct from effectual prevenient grace; consistent pairing of objective and subjective dimensions of salvation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and by pastors for clear, accessible soteriological instruction; positive reception for pastoral tone and systematic clarity.
 - Criticized by some for limited engagement with contemporary continental theology and for modest ecumenical interaction.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Useful as a compact, pastorally oriented Reformed soteriology that integrates doctrine and application; especially valuable where pastors need clear language on assurance, sanctification, and the Spirit's work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Grace (saving):** Gratuitous favor of God accomplishing salvation; operative in every stage.
- **Effectual Calling:** The Spirit-wrought inward summons that results in conversion; distinguished from external proclamation.
- **Regeneration:** The Spirit's sovereign new birth producing spiritual life; grounds faith and repentance.
- **Ordo Salutis:** Logical ordering of salvation's applied elements (calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification); used carefully as analytic tool.
 - Contrast: **Historia Salutis** - the historical, accomplished work of Christ; Hoekema insists on distinguishing the two.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration by God on Christ's merit; objective center of salvation.
- **Sanctification (definitive vs progressive):**
 - **Definitive:** Positional holiness in Christ (status).
 - **Progressive:** Ongoing moral/personal transformation by the Spirit (process).
- **Common Grace:** God's general goodness restraining sin and enabling cultural good; distinct from saving grace.
- **Preparatory Grace:** Non-saving Godly influences that prepare some for gospel hearing; not effectual unto salvation.
- **Final Judgment & Eternal States:** Consummation where believers are glorified and unbelievers are condemned; the eschatological fulfillment of soteriology.
- **Perseverance:** The Spirit-enabled continuation of the elect in faith and obedience to final glorification.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral outworking of doctrine - confidence based on objective grounds (Christ's work) and subjective witness (Spirit).
- **Adoption & Glorification:** Family status and ultimate consummation of salvation.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed soteriological categories (effectual calling, regeneration, sanctification).
 - As a **didactic/pastoral model** for teaching assurance and progressive sanctification.
 - As a **polemic resource** against conflating ordo and historia and against both semi-Pelagianism and hyper-Calvinism.
 - As an **exegetical-conceptual pivot** for locating objective vs subjective dimensions of salvation in systematic theology.
