### TITLE
**Confessing God: Essays in Christian Dogmatics II** (mid-2000s) - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Post-Barth, postliberal milieu; evangelical-catholic ressourcement in Anglophone dogmatics.
 - Responds to historicist hermeneutics and correlational theologies; retrieval of scholastic principia within a Barthian-evangelical register.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Dogmatics is an act of confessing the triune God**, a sanctified science whose principia are given in **revelation** and whose exercise is ecclesial and scriptural. The object (God who reveals) governs the method, scope, and canons of theology.
- **Core argument / structure** (across essays)
 - **Nature and task of theology**: Theology is holy reasoning, an act of repentant intellect under the gospel, oriented to praise and edification of the church.
 - **Theological method (principia; theology as science)**: Principium essendi (God) and principium cognoscendi (Gods self-revelation in Word and Spirit; Holy Scripture) order theology; theology is a science only as it shares in the order of grace.
 - **General and special revelation**: Knowledge of God is ectypal, granted by the triune God; special revelation in Christ and Scripture heals and directs creaturely reason; general revelation is real but read rightly only within special revelation.
 - **Canon and tradition**: The canon is dogmatically located as the Spirit-given instrument of divine self-communication; tradition is ministerial, normed by Scripture within the churchs confessing life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Retrieval: Augustine, Aquinas (scientia, principia), Calvin, Turretin (archetypal/ectypal), Bavinck.
 - Dialogues/critiques: Barth (governance by the object), Lindbeck/Frei (culture-linguistic gains yet limits), Pannenberg and correlational/foundational models, modern historicism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general/special), **Scripture and canon**, **Tradition and rule of faith**, **Trinity**, **Creation/providence** (as context for revelation), **Sanctification** (of reason), **Ecclesiology** (church as location of dogmatics).
- **Closing line**
 - Theology is **sanctified, churchly confession**: reason made serviceable by the Spirit to speak after God of God from Gods own self-gift in the gospel.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as **holy reason** under divine sanctification; intellectual asceticism as methodological posture.
 - Strong form of **object-governed method**: the gospel establishes its own rationality and criteria.
 - **Principia** retrieval without rationalist foundationalism; principled dependence on revelation and Scripture.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against historicism and hermeneutical reduction: Scripture is not merely witness traditions but **instrument of revelation**.
 - Against correlational and experiential theologies: resists making culture, consciousness, or praxis co-principles of dogmatics.
 - Against solo Scriptura: affirms **tradition as ministerial**, located within the rule of faith and churchly confession.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Phrases like **theological theology**, **sanctification of reason**, **dogmatic location of the canon**, **repentant thinking**.
 - Recasting **general revelation** as read from within the light of Christ rather than a neutral preamble.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries for method and prolegomena; shaped Anglican-Reformed dogmatics.
 - Catalyzed retrieval work on principia and theological exegesis; interlocutor for Vanhoozer, Websterian students, and analytic-dogmatic discussions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact orientation to **nature and task of theology**, principia, and Scripture-tradition dynamics.
 - Pedagogically potent for framing courses on **revelation**, **canon**, and **method**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principium essendi / cognoscendi**: God as the being-principle; Gods self-revelation in Word/Spirit (and Scripture) as the knowing-principle for theology.
- **Theological theology**: Dogmatics whose method and matter are determined by God, not by external disciplines.
- **Sanctification of reason**: Intellectual regeneration by the Spirit, fitting reason for the gospel.
- **Archetypal / ectypal knowledge**: Gods self-knowledge vs. creatures graced participation in it; guards humility and dependence.
- **General and special revelation**:
 - General: creaturely signs of God, truly revelatory but suppressed/distorted in sin.
 - Special: Christs self-gift through Scripture by the Spirit, norming and healing all knowing of God.
- **Canon**: Spirit-formed set of texts serving as instrument of revelation and norm of teaching; dogmatically located within Gods communicative economy.
- **Tradition (ministerial)**: Churchs handed-on teaching under Scripture; authoritative as service, not as co-norm.
- **Rule of faith**: Concise, ecclesial summary that guides reading of Scripture and guards confession.
- **Scripture as instrument**: Text in the Spirits hands, effectual in creating and ruling the churchs knowledge of God.
- **Dogmatics as science**: Scientia ordered by its divine object and principles, not by autonomous method.
- **Confession**: Public, ecclesial speech-act acknowledging Gods truth; both doxological and doctrinal.
- **Object-governed method**: Methods receive their form from the gospel; the object sets the rules.
- **Repentant thinking**: Intellectual posture of contrition and receptivity before God.
- **Ecclesial location of theology**: Theology belongs to and serves the churchs worship, mission, and catechesis.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for principia and the nature/task of theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for aligning general/special revelation and theological exegesis.
 - As a **polemic resource** clarifying Scripture-tradition relations and resisting correlationalism.
 - As a **teaching scaffold** for courses on prolegomena, canon, and dogmatic method.
