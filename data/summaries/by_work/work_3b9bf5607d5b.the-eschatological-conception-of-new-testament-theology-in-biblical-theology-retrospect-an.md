### TITLE
The Eschatological Conception of New Testament Theology - Gregory K. Beale (in Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Anglo-American biblical-theological conversation; reaction to fragmentation of NT studies and to programmatic proposals (e.g., Dodd, Bultmann, Cullmann, Ladd, Wright).
 - Moves within canonical and typological approaches to Scripture; dialogue with historical-critical and systematic theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament as a coherent theological corpus is best read under an **eschatological conception**: eschatology (realized and future) is the primary organizing theological category that unites NT authors and shapes their use of the OT.
 - Problematizes approaches that treat eschatology as marginal or merely chronological.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Show NT authors consistently read the OT typologically and eschatologically, interpreting figures/events as **types** whose fulfillment is realized in Christ and anticipates cosmic consummation.
 - Establish the **inaugurated-but-not-yet** pattern across NT corpora (Paul, Hebrews, John, Revelation):
 - Present fulfillment in Christ and Spirit (salvation, kingdom, temple).
 - Future consummation in resurrection, new creation, and cosmic renewal.
 - Demonstrate theological unity through canonical continuity: OT promises (e.g., covenant, temple, creation) find eschatological recapitulation rather than complete replacement.
 - Apply to specific loci:
 - **New Heavens and New Earth**: Revelation and prophetic citation (Isaiah) show continuity with OT hope-renewal, not mere displacement of creation.
 - **Resurrection and New Creation**: Paul and Johannine texts link bodily resurrection with inaugurated new creation (1 Cor 15; Rom 8; John 5-11; Rev 21-22).
 - **Individual and Cosmic Eschatology**: Beale synthesizes personal resurrection and corporate/cosmic consummation-individuals are restored as members of redeemed creation, not isolated immortals.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Dodd (realized eschatology), Cullmann (already/not yet), G. E. Ladd (inaugurated eschatology), J. Kadane/Käsemann, N. T. Wright (points of agreement and divergence).
 - Extensive OT background, intertestamental literature, canonical NT witnesses (Paul, Hebrews, John, Revelation).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (individual and cosmic), Christology, resurrection, new creation, covenant, canon, typology, temple motif, pneumatology, soteriology, ecclesiology.

- **Closing line**
 - Beale advances that an **eschatological, typological, canonical hermeneutic** best explains NT theology: Christ is the center of fulfilled promise whose ministry inaugurates cosmic renewal that will be consummated in the new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong canonical-typological hermeneutic: OT events/persons function as eschatological types fulfilled in Christ.
 - Emphasis on **cosmic scope** of salvation-restoration of creation (not merely individual immortality).
 - Integration of realized and future eschatology into a coherent theological matrix.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against simplistic readings of Dodd (over-realized) and strict bifurcation in Cullmann: insists on sustained interplay of "already" and "not yet."
 - More canonical and OT-centric than some N. T. Wright readings; highlights temple/creation motifs more systematically.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Eschatological conception" as programmatic organizing principle for NT theology.
 - Reframing typology not as merely rhetorical but as **theological-canonical** hermeneutic informing doctrine.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical and Reformed biblical-theological work; cited in studies on Revelation, Pauline theology, and new creation debates.
 - Critiques focus on perceived overemphasis of typology or underplayed diversity among NT authors; still influential as exegetical model.

- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies a disciplined, text-sensitive framework for linking OT promise to NT fulfillment and for teaching the unity of redemptive-historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological conception**: The claim that eschatology organizes NT theology; method for reading NT and OT together.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: The kingdom and new age are begun in Christ/Spirit but await consummation.
- **Realized eschatology**: Present, proleptic experience of eschatological realities (salvation, Spirit, kingdom).
- **New creation / new heavens and new earth**: Cosmic renewal language (Isa 65-66; Rev 21-22) treated as covenantal fulfillment of creation promises.
- **Resurrection**: Bodily eschatological transformation tied to new-creation consummation (1 Cor 15; Rom 8).
- **Typology (canonical-typological hermeneutic)**: OT persons/events as divinely instituted foreshadows whose meaning is eschatologically fulfilled in Christ.
- **Temple motif**: Jesus and the church as fulfillment of temple/body/temple-cosmos themes pointing to restored creation.
- **Continuity and discontinuity**: Balanced account-substantial continuity of God's purposes (creation, covenant) with discontinuous consummation in Christ.
- **Cosmic eschatology**: Redemption that includes the entire created order, not merely individual souls.
- **Individual eschatology**: Personal resurrection/participation in the redeemed community within the renewed cosmos.
- **Canon as hermeneutical grid**: The OT and NT form a theological conversation that must be read together.
- **Kingdom of God**: eschatological rule inaugurated by Christ and expressed in both present and future dimensions.
- **Consummation**: Final realization of God's purposes-resurrection, judgment, new creation.
- **Apocalyptic imagery**: Viewed as theological-symbolic language that conveys real future transformation, anchored in OT prophecy.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definitional source** for the claim that eschatology is the organizing principle of NT theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for canonical-typological interpretation (esp. on Revelation, Paul, Hebrews).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over new creation vs. soul-only eschatology and individual vs. cosmic redemption.
