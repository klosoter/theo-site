### TITLE
Outlines of Theology - A. A. Hodge (Princeton, 1886; lectures)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century Old Princeton milieu; son and successor of Charles Hodge; product of seminary lecture course turned manual.
 - Reaction to rising German higher criticism, liberal theology, and various nineteenth-century heterodox proposals in America.
 - Intended as a concise systematic textbook for seminary instruction and pastoral formation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To present a compact, logically ordered, biblically grounded systematic theology that defends and explicates historic Reformed (Westminster) doctrine against modern error.
 - Assumes Scripture as the ultimate rule of faith and seeks to show coherent doctrinal unity across loci.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prolegomena: revelation, Scripture, inspiration, canonicity, and theological method (theology as a science grounded in divine authority).
 - Theology Proper: existence, attributes, and the Trinity.
 - Anthropology: creation, image of God, fall, original sin, total depravity.
 - Christology and Atonement: person of Christ, two natures, obedience and substitutionary (penal) atonement.
 - Soteriology: effectual calling, justification by faith alone (imputed righteousness), adoption, sanctification, perseverance.
 - Covenant Theology and Federal Headship: covenants of works/grace, corporate aspects of sin and salvation.
 - Ecclesiology & Sacraments: nature of the church, means of grace, baptism and Lord's Supper as signs/ seals of the covenant.
 - Eschatology: resurrection, final judgment, eternal state (treated succinctly as concluding loci).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Reformed confessions (Westminster Standards), patristic and Reformational sources, and contemporary Princeton writing.
 - Polemical interlocutors include German higher critics, Unitarian and liberal theologians, and heterodox American movements.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, and inerrancy of Scripture; doctrine of God; Trinity; creation and providence; sin and fall; covenant theology; Christology; atonement (penal substitution); soteriology (justification, sanctification, perseverance); ecclesiology; sacraments; eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - A compact, scholarly defense and systematic articulation of historic Reformed orthodoxy that privileges Scripture as the controlling principle and seeks doctrinal coherence across all loci.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Concise scholastic clarity**: compresses complex loci into clear, lecture-shaped theses useful for teaching and examination.
 - **Biblical-legal idiom**: stresses law/gospel contrasts, federal headship, and forensic categories (imputation, justification).
 - **Methodological insistence**: theology conceived as a rigorous science subordinate to Scripture.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - More compact and programmatic than Charles Hodge's larger Systematic Theology, aimed at pedagogical economy.
 - Explicitly counters liberalizing tendencies (denial of supernatural revelation, moral influence theories of atonement) and the subjectivism of Schleiermacherian approaches.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not an innovation generator so much as a synthesizer: refines and popularizes Princeton scholastic terminology for use in classrooms and pastoral formation.
 - Emphasizes the vocabulary of **federal** relations (covenant, representation, imputation) as the organizing principle for soteriology and anthropology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Presbyterian and Reformed seminaries and churches as a succinct textbook and lecture guide.
 - Cemented A. A. Hodge's reputation as a clear expositor; helped perpetuate Princeton theological norms into late 19th/early 20th centuries.
 - Later critics (neo-orthodox, liberal) faulted its apparent rationalism or juridical stress; proponents value its pedagogical utility and fidelity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Excellent for exam prep, pastoral syllabi, and quick reference to classical Reformed positions; valuable as a clear statement of confessional commitments and method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture / Revelation** - Scripture as propositional, sufficient, and authoritative rule for faith and life; revelation both general and special.
- **Inspiration / Inerrancy** - Plenary inspiration; Bible trustworthy and without error in its autographs; foundation for theological certainty.
- **Theology as science** - Systematic theology conceived as a disciplined, orderly inquiry under Scripture's rule.
- **Trinity** - One God in three persons; relational and economic perfections emphasized for redemption history.
- **Covenant (federal theology)** - Central organizing category: covenant of works and covenant of grace; corporate and representative aspects of human standing.
- **Original sin / total depravity** - Fall corrupts nature, will, and ability; human inability necessitates divine sovereign grace.
- **Union with Christ** - Central soteriological reality linking imputation, justification, sanctification, and adoption.
- **Justification (forensic)** - Imputation of Christ's righteousness received by faith alone; legal acquittal before God.
- **Atonement (penal substitution)** - Christ's obedience and suffering satisfy divine justice; objective, substitutionary efficacy.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive transformation by Spirit through means of grace; distinguished from justification.
- **Church & sacraments** - Visible/invisible church tensions handled within confessional formulations; sacraments as covenant signs and seals.
- **Providence** - God's governance upholding creation while permitting secondary causes and human responsibility.
- **Eschatology** - Resurrection, judgment, and eternal states taught as final certainties, closing the systematic sequence.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: concise affirmations of classic Reformed positions for exam answers and catechesis.
 - As **polemic**: brief, rhetorically effective refutation of liberal and heterodox alternatives.
 - As an **exegetical-model adjunct**: supplies theological categories (covenant, imputation) that shape exegesis and homiletics.
