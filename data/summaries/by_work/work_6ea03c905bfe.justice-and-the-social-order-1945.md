### TITLE
Justice and the Social Order (1945) - Emil Brunner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the immediate aftermath of World War II amid reconstruction debates (1945). Emerges from European neo-orthodox theology and a broader Protestant attempt to re-articulate a Christian social ethic in response to totalitarianism, economic collapse, and moral relativism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian faith supplies the only adequate foundation for a just social order; neither unregulated market individualism nor utopian socialism can ground human dignity and social justice without reference to revelation and the Creator-ordained moral order.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Modern ideologies (liberal individualism, Marxist collectivism, state absolutism) fail because they ignore sin, interpersonal vocation, and the created ordering of human life.
 - Foundations: Justice must be rooted in God's ordering of creation (a created normativity that is known in part by creation but fully by revelation).
 - Institutions: Family, church, economy, and state have distinct roles; the state has responsibility to secure justice but must not usurp the church or civil society.
 - Praxis: Christian social policy requires a balance - protection of personal rights and property, promotion of social welfare, and legal frameworks that restrain evil and cultivate solidarity.
 - Appeal: The church is a prophetic community that calls secular institutions back to the God-given norms that undergird social order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages implicitly and explicitly with contemporary political ideologies, with theological interlocutors such as Karl Barth (contrast on natural theology and the role of revelation in ethics) and with Protestant social ethicists; draws on biblical categories, classical natural-law motifs, and modern social analysis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (priority for social norms), anthropology (sin and personal responsibility), law (divine/created law vs. positive law), ecclesiology (prophetic role of church), polity (state authority and limits), ethics (justice, stewardship, solidarity).
- **Closing line:** Brunner argues that a biblically grounded theology of creation, sin, and revelation provides the only coherent basis for a just social order in which institutions serve human dignity rather than dominate it.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on a theologically grounded social order rather than merely pragmatic or ideological solutions.
 - Emphasis on personal sin alongside social structures - justice must address both individual culpability and institutional harms.
 - Balances respect for private property and market functions with robust commitments to social welfare and legal restraint of abuses.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal Protestant optimism about progress by reasserting the persistence of sin and need for normative divine guidance.
 - Distinguishes Brunner from Barth: more open to a human point of contact with God in creation (partial natural knowledge) which supports social ethics without reducing it to mere natural law.
 - Critiques socialist reductionism that subsumes the person into class and liberalism that sacralizes the market or individual autonomy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-articulation of "order" (sociale Ordnung) with theological categories: creation order, law, and vocation rather than purely sociological descriptions.
 - Use of personalist language to reframe social policy: institutions exist for persons, not persons for institutions.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely read in mid-20th-century Protestant circles as a key neo-orthodox contribution to social ethics.
 - Influenced post-war debates on welfare, Christian engagement with the state, and ecumenical social teaching; critiqued by both Marxist thinkers and strict libertarians.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating doctrinal theology with concrete social policy.
 - Useful for courses in political theology, social ethics, and church-state relations as a nuanced alternative to both doctrinal quietism and political accommodationism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justice:** Normative ordering of human relations grounded in God; both individual righteousness and societal structures required.
- **Social order (sozialen Ordnung):** The arrangement of institutions (family, economy, state, church) oriented by divine norms.
- **Revelation:** Ultimate source for social norms; partial knowledge in creation but decisive guidance comes from God's self-disclosure.
 - Contrast: Brunner allows a "point of contact" in creation for natural knowledge, unlike Barth's strict rejection.
- **Created order / ordination:** God's structuring of social life that secures duties, rights, and institutional boundaries.
- **Law (divine vs. positive):** Distinguishes divine/created law as moral horizon from positive law as concrete legal enactment that should reflect it.
- **Sin (personal and structural):** Human failure that operates in persons and institutions; explanation for persistent injustice.
- **State:** Legitimate authority tasked with upholding justice, restraining wrong, but limited so as not to become an idol or totalitarian.
- **Church:** Prophetic community calling the social order back to God's norms; not to be conflated with political power.
- **Property & stewardship:** Property rights are real but conditioned by stewardship and social responsibilities.
- **Solidarity:** Ethical imperative grounded in the imago Dei and communal vocation of humans.
- **Personalism:** Person-centered ethical lens that resists collectivist reduction and atomistic individualism.
- **Subsidiarity (implicit):** Preference for lower-order institutions to fulfill social functions when capable; state intervenes when justice requires.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a neo-orthodox approach to political theology and social ethics (bridging doctrine and policy).
- As a **polemic** against both unbridled capitalism and reductive socialism, supplying theological critique of modern ideologies.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in church-state relations courses to discuss limits of state authority and prophetic role of the church.
