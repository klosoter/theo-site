### TITLE
The Grace and Duty of Being Spiritually Minded - John Owen (mid-17th c., English Puritan/Reformed)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in the English Puritan milieu of the 1650s-1660s, amid debates over spiritual life, church order, and the place of experiential religion in Reformed theology.
 - Owen writes as a pastor-theologian deeply engaged with covenantal and experiential piety; Scripture and the Reformed confessional tradition are primary authorities.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Spiritual mindedness is both a supernatural grace and a Christian duty.** True spiritual life consists in the mind set upon the Spirit and Christ, which is produced by the Holy Spirit and expressed in mortification, communion with God, and practical holiness.
 - Owen addresses the problem of nominal Christianity: people who profess religion but live carnally, lacking the indwelling Spirit's orientation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition: what it is to be "spiritually minded" (orienting affections, thoughts, and life toward God and heavenly things).
 - Grounding: the necessity of regeneration and the indwelling Spirit as the cause and sustainer of spiritual mindedness.
 - Duties and evidences: practical implications-mortification of sin, devotion to the means of grace (Word, prayer, sacraments), love to Christ and others.
 - Distinctions: contrasts between true spiritual mindedness and mere external religiosity, enthusiasm, or antinomian licence.
 - Pastoral extrapolation: how ministers and disciples are to cultivate and judge spiritual life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture is Owen's chief source; he reads Pauline categories (the mind of the Spirit, mortification) through Puritan/Calvinist lenses.
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with contemporary Puritans and tendencies: pastoral pushback against formalism, enthusiasm, and antinomian interpretations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (progressive holiness), indwelling of the Holy Spirit, mortification, union with Christ, assurance, means of grace.
 - Secondary interaction with soteriology and pastoral theology: how justification relates to life after conversion.

- **Closing line**
 - Owen's center of gravity: spiritual mindedness is the Spirit-wrought, Christ-centered orientation of heart and life that both evidences and advances sanctification; it is simultaneously a divine gift and a commanded exercise.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The sustained pairing **"grace and duty"** - Owen insists believers must regard spiritual mindedness as bestowed by God yet actively required of them.
 - Strong focus on the affections and the direction of the mind (not merely external conformity): sanctification as reorientation of heart toward heavenly objects.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **formalism**: rebukes mere outward religious observance devoid of inward spiritual life.
 - Against **enthusiasm and antinomianism**: rejects unregulated feelings as proof of spirituality and also rejects licence as genuine spirituality.
 - Balances divine sovereignty (Spirit as efficient cause) with human responsibility (diligence in mortification and use of means).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise treatment of "spiritual mindedness" as a technical pastoral-theological category linking inner disposition, evidence of grace, and ethical demand.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed pastoral and devotional literature; adopted by later evangelical and Puritan-influenced movements as a key text on sanctification.
 - Frequently cited for pastoral counseling on assurance, mortification, and devotional life.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary for integrating rigorous doctrinal theology (Spirit, union with Christ) with concrete pastoral direction for the Christian life.
 - Useful for teaching sanctification that resists both moralism and antinomian slackness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spiritual mindedness**
 - Orientation of the mind and affections toward God, Christ, and heavenly realities; both gift and duty.

- **Grace**
 - The Spirit's sovereign work producing spiritual faculties and desires; the source of true spiritual mindedness.

- **Duty**
 - The believer's calling to exercise and cultivate spiritual affections (mortification, prayer, meditation).

- **Mortification**
 - Active putting to death of sin as evidence and instrument of spiritual mindedness.

- **Indwelling Holy Spirit**
 - The internal cause of spiritual mindedness; enables understanding, desire, and power to obey.

- **Sanctification (progressive)**
 - The ongoing transformation effected by the Spirit in which spiritual mindedness is both a mark and a means.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The theological ground of spiritual life; spiritual mindedness flows from vital union and communion.

- **Means of grace**
 - Word, prayer, sacraments as instrumental to cultivating and evidencing spiritual mindedness.

- **Assurance**
 - Spiritual mindedness provides evidence for assurance; Owen ties inward experience to objective promises without making experience normative for justification.

- **Carnality / flesh**
 - The opposing category: ruling sin and worldly affections that obstruct spiritual mindedness.

- **Affections**
 - Central locus of Owen's pastoral concern: love, delight, loathing of sin-these are assessed for spiritual health.

- **Practical holiness**
 - Outworking of spiritual mindedness in daily life, duties, and relationships.

- **Spiritual gifts**
 - Treated subsidiarily: spiritual gifts are to be ordered by sanctification and used in humility; gifts without spiritual mindedness may be vain.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for sanctification and the experiential marks of grace.
- As **polemic** against formalism, enthusiasm, and antinomian tendencies.
- As a **pastoral-exegetical model** for instructing believers in mortification, means of grace, and assurance.
