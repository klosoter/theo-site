### TITLE
In the Fullness of Time: An Introduction to the Biblical Theology of Acts and Paul - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed biblical theology, emerging from conservative Princeton-Vosian tradition; corrective to both reductive historical-critical and purely systematic readings of Scripture.
 - Engages contemporary Pauline scholarship and exegetical debates (apocalyptic readings, New Perspective tendencies) from a confessional Reformed standpoint.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The apostolic proclamation in Acts and Paul must be read as a unified, covenant-historical announcement: God has acted "in the fullness of time" in Christ (death, resurrection, exaltation) to fulfill Israel's promises and inaugurate the eschatological order.
 - Theological problem addressed: how to keep biblical-historical specificity (resurrection as decisive, eschatological arrival) while integrating systematic doctrines (covenant, justification, Spirit) without collapsing continuity or severing history from theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical baseline: Paul and Luke-Acts share the same kerygmatic center - Christ crucified and raised as the fulfillment of Scripture and the inauguration of the eschaton.
 - The resurrection is the decisive eschatological event that grounds Christian identity, justification, Spirit-bestowal, and new-creation hope.
 - The church is not a novel replace­ment of Israel but the covenant-historical continuation and expansion of Israel's eschatological promise.
 - Systematic implications: covenantal framework integrates Paul's soteriology (forensic/positional) with inaugurated eschatology (already/not yet), locating the Spirit's work within historical fulfillment.
 - Methodologically: sustained interplay of careful exegesis and doctrinal reflection; resists treating biblical theology as merely descriptive or historical sociology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformed predecessors (Vos, Murray, Calvin) for covenantal and theological method.
 - Converses with contemporary Pauline scholars (apocalyptic interpreters, New Perspective advocates) and with Luke-Acts scholarship.
 - Uses Scripture as primary source; secondary engagement spans both conservative and critical scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (promise/fulfillment motif)
 - Covenant theology (continuity between Israel and church)
 - Christology (death, resurrection, exaltation as center)
 - Eschatology (inaugurated eschaton; already/not yet)
 - Justification (its relation to resurrection and covenant)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as eschatological gift and presence)
 - Ecclesiology and mission (church as covenant community and witness)

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's theological center of gravity: the historical resurrection in Christ is the covenantal fulcrum - the decisive, eschatological act by which God completes Israel's promises and inaugurates the new creation now awaiting consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on the resurrection as the doctrinal and hermeneutical lodestone for reading Paul and Acts; not secondary to ethics or social formation but constitutive of Christian truth.
 - Strongly covenantal reading of apostolic proclamation that preserves continuity with Israel while maintaining the distinctiveness of Christ's fulfillment.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that either privatize Paul's thought into personal mysticism or reduce it to socio-religious praxis.
 - Pushes back against extremes of the New Perspective and purely apocalyptic readings that isolate justification from covenantal promise and resurrection-historical grounding.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-emphasizes the phrase and motif of "fulness of time" as theological key: a single locus where history, promise, and eschatological action converge.
 - Frames Pauline theology as a theologically coherent continuation of apostolic kerygma rather than a discrete, systematized theodicy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries as a bridge between exegesis and systematic theology; influential among scholars defending a covenantal, resurrection-centered Paul.
 - Cited in debates over Pauline eschatology, justification, and Luke-Acts continuity; respected for clarity and theological seriousness even by some who disagree.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating biblical-historical fidelity with doctrinal theology; particularly valuable for courses on Pauline theology, biblical theology, and Reformed doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fulness of Time**
 - God's appointed eschatological moment - convergence of promise and fulfillment in Christ's life, death, resurrection, and exaltation.
- **Kerygma**
 - Apostolic proclamation centered on Christ's death and resurrection as fulfillment of Scripture.
- **Resurrection (Christological/eschatological)**
 - The decisive inaugurated-eschatological event that grounds justification, new creation, and Spirit-bestowal.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology / Already-Not-Yet**
 - The kingdom and new creation have been inaugurated in Christ but await consummation; Gaffin stresses the historical present reality of the inauguration.
- **Covenant Continuity**
 - The church as the covenantal continuation and expansion of Israel's eschatological hope; continuity without collapsing typological distinctions.
- **Justification (forensic within covenant)**
 - Tied to the resurrection-event and covenantal fulfillment; forensic declaration embedded in redemptive-historical context.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit as promise/guarantee)**
 - Spirit is the eschatological gift signaling and effecting the new covenant life now.
- **New Creation**
 - Eschatological horizon shaped by resurrection; present reality and future consummation.
- **Scripture as Promise-Fulfillment**
 - Reading Paul and Luke as exegetes of Scripture's promised consummation in Christ.
- **Acts-Paul Continuity**
 - Luke's narrative and Paul's letters as complementary witnesses to the same apostolic kerygma.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a **definition source** for a covenantal, resurrection-centered reading of Paul and Acts.
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductionist New Perspective and apocalyptic-only interpretations.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating kerygma, historical grounding, and doctrinal reflection in courses on biblical and systematic theology.
