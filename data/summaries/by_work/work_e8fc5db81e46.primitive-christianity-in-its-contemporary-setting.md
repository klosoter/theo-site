### TITLE
Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Interwar German theology (1920s-1930s); Bultmann situated within liberal-critical New Testament scholarship, influenced by form criticism and existentialist philosophy (notably Heidegger and Kierkegaard). Concerned with communicating the early Christian kerygma to a modern, scientifically minded culture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Primitive Christian proclamation (the kerygma) must be reinterpreted for the modern existential conscience by removing mythological categories that obstruct the existential encounter with Christ. Historical-metaphysical questions are subsidiary to the proclamation's existential demand.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose: Modernity cannot accept the mythic world-picture (miracles, cosmology, eschatological fixtures) that framed primitive Christian language.
 - Method: Employ form criticism (Sitz im Leben) to distinguish the early Church's preaching from the historical Jesus and to classify traditions by function.
 - Hermeneutic move: Demythologize - translate mythic language into existential categories that disclose human being-in-the-world and the demand of faith.
 - Theological aim: Preserve the kerygma's existential power (judgment, grace, call to decision) without committing to premodern cosmology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Wrede, Schweitzer, tradition-critical scholars; philosophical interlocutors include Heidegger and Kierkegaard; polemically contrasted with conservative historicism and metaphysical theologies (including some aspects of Barthianism and confessional reactions).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (as existential event), Christology (distinction between historical Jesus and kerygma), soteriology (faith as existential encounter rather than forensic status), eschatology (reinterpreted existentially), anthropology (existential unity vs speculative dualisms), sacraments (as proclamation-signs), canon and tradition (subject to form-critical testing).
- **Closing line:** The work centers the early proclamation as an existential event that must be liberated from mythic trappings so that primitive Christianity can speak decisively to the modern conscience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Demythologization** as a systematic theological task rather than mere historical criticism.
 - Prioritizing the **kerygma** (proclamation) over historical verification as the locus of theological meaning.
 - Use of **Heideggerian existential categories** to render gospel claims intelligible in modernity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Against liberal historicism that reduces Christianity to ethical teachings; against conservative literalism that insists on mythic-historical ontology.
 - Contrasts with sacramental and covenantal traditions that ground doctrine in objective, historical-covenantal acts (e.g., Federal Vision critiques).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Popularized the vernacular theological programmatic term **demythologizing**, integrated form-critical tools with existential hermeneutics, and reframed Sitz im Leben as theological rather than merely historical.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in mid-20th-century Protestant biblical theology and homiletics; shaped much NT scholarship and liberal Protestant preaching.
 - Received strong criticism from confessional and Reformed circles for undermining historicity (Adam, Resurrection) and sacramental realism; also prompted constructive responses emphasizing the importance of history for doctrine.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Provokes rigorous questions about the relation of history, myth, and proclamation; offers a durable hermeneutical model for translating ancient faith into contemporary existential categories while forcing careful engagement with claims about Adam, sacraments, and Trinitarian ontology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologization:** Method of translating mythic language into existential categories so modern listeners grasp the kerygma's demand.
- **Kerygma:** The early Christian proclamation (center of Bultmann's theology); theological meaning resides here rather than in mythic cosmology.
- **Form criticism / Sitz im Leben:** Tools for identifying the function and community context of Gospel traditions.
- **Historical Jesus vs. Kerygma distinction:** Separates the historical life of Jesus (a historical inquiry) from the Church's interpretive proclamation.
- **Existential interpretation:** Reading NT claims as existential calls on human existence (decision, guilt, grace), influenced by Heidegger/Kierkegaard.
- **Myth (primitive cosmology):** Regarded as culturally conditioned language that must be reinterpreted for modern thought (e.g., miracles, Adam, cosmic eschatology).
- **Revelation-as-event:** Revelation understood primarily as contingent encounter (kerygmatic event) rather than propositional metaphysical content.
- **Sacraments as proclamation-signs:** Tend toward a symbolic/existential reading; downplays sacramental ontology as automatic means of grace.
- **Adam / Federal-headship:** Reads Adam narratives as mythic expressions of human condition rather than straightforward historical-federal headship; thus problematic for doctrines dependent on Adam's historicity.
- **Eschatology (existentialized):** Future-oriented language reframed as present existential judgment and demand.
- **Trinity and relational language:** Bultmann avoids speculative ontology; tends to focus on the economic (proclamatory) relations, undermining metaphysical claims used in Eternal Functional Subordination debates.
- **Canon & tradition:** Tradition is critiqued and reconstructed via critical-historical methods rather than received uncritically.
- **Anthropology (unity over trichotomy):** Emphasizes human existence as an existential unity rather than speculative trichotomy.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for demythologization and existential hermeneutics in biblical studies.
 - As a **polemic** against literalist historicism on topics like Adam, creation days, sacramental realism, and forensic models of justification.
 - As an **exegetical model** for form-critical reconstruction of Gospel traditions and for homiletical renewal seeking contemporary existential resonance.
