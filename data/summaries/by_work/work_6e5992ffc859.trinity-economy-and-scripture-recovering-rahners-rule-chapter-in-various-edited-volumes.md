### TITLE
Trinity, Economy, and Scripture: Recovering Rahner's Rule - Scott Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century debate over relations between the immanent and economic Trinity; engages retrievalist currents in Reformed theology and ongoing conversation with Karl Rahner and Karl Barth.
 - Situated in systematic-theological reflection attentive to classical orthodoxy, contemporary analytic concerns, and the authority of Scripture.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Swain argues for a principled recovery of **Rahner's Rule** (the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa) reformulated so that it is faithful to Scripture, avoids speculative metaphysics, and preserves the Trinitarian distinctions against modalism and reductionism.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Rahner's original formulation and its theological attraction as a restraint on speculative separation of "God in himself" from "God for us."
 - Presentation of Barth's critique and reformulation (stress on revelation in Jesus Christ as the decisive locus where immanent and economic coincide).
 - Proposal for a Reformed retrieval:
 - Treat Rahner's Rule as a *hermeneutical and methodological principle* anchored in Scripture rather than as metaphysical identification.
 - Insist that the identity between immanent and economic Trinity is known only mediately in the economy, especially in Christ, without collapsing the internal relations.
 - Show how Scripture functions as the faithful witness that grounds lawful inference from economy to immanence.
 - Implications drawn for doctrines of revelation, Christology, and the doctrine of Scripture.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Karl Rahner (Rule), Karl Barth (critique/reformulation), contemporary Reformed systematicians (including Swain's own interlocutors).
 - Secondary: patristic and scholastic resources appealed to for classical constraints; Scripture as primary locus.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs economic), revelation, Christology (Christ as center of economy), doctrine of Scripture (as witness and norm), theological method (rule-making vs metaphysical speculation).

- **Closing line**
 - Recovering Rahner's Rule, rightly canonical and Christocentric, yields a disciplined theological posture: what God is in himself is accessible only in God's gracious economy of self-revelation in Christ, and Scripture is the faithful rule that secures that correlation without metaphysical overreach.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats Rahner's Rule as a *hermeneutical rule* constrained and qualified by Scripture rather than as a free-standing metaphysical axiom.
 - Recasts the economy/immanence correlation in explicitly Christocentric and soteriological terms that fit Reformed commitments.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Rahner when his language risks uncritical identification that invites modalistic readings or speculative metaphysics.
 - Agrees with Barth's emphasis on revelation in Christ but resists Barthian antimetaphysical radicalism that severs legitimate theological inference from the economy to the immanent God.
 - Reconciles a tension: preserves Barthian insistence on revelation while rescuing Rahner's constructive methodological insight.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames Rahner's insight as a *canonical-rule* for theological inference: Scripture-mediated, Christ-centered, and prophylactic against both speculative ontologizing and reductionist readings.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in Reformed circles seeking a middle path between Barthian disclosure-only models and speculative Thomistic appropriation of Rahner.
 - Influential for systematicians wanting a disciplined way to speak about God-in-himself without detaching doctrine from the biblical narrative.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a usable methodological template for teaching and constructing Trinitarian theology that honors scriptural epistemic limits while enabling responsible theological claims about God's inner life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The heuristic that the economic Trinity and the immanent Trinity are correlative; Swain advocates a Scripture-normed recovery.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed in the history of salvation (works, missions, words, especially in Christ).

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God in his intra-divine life (relations of Father, Son, Spirit) - knowable only mediately according to Swain.

- **Barth's reformulation**
 - Emphasis that Jesus Christ is the decisive revelation; Swain affirms the christocentrism but insists on Scripture as rule for inference.

- **Scripture as witness and rule**
 - Scripture functions as the normative medium that authorizes inference from economy to immanent reality.

- **Revelation-mediated knowledge**
 - Knowledge of God is always conditioned by the mode of divine self-disclosure; claims about immanence must be tied to revelation.

- **Christocentrism**
 - Centrality of Christ in grounding the identity between economy and immanence.

- **Anti-speculative restraint**
 - Methodological caution against metaphysical extrapolation about God's inner life beyond what revelation warrants.

- **Analogy/Mediate epistemology**
 - How finite creatures analogically and mediately know the Trinity through economic signs.

- **Modalism vs. orthodox distinction**
 - Tension addressed by safeguarding distinctions among Persons while affirming economic-immanent correlation.

- **Canonical hermeneutic**
 - Reading theological rules through the canon so that doctrinal inferences remain ecclesially accountable.

- **Theological method (rule-making)**
 - Use of theological "rules" as guarded heuristics rather than ontological pronouncements.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source**: supplies a disciplined way to state Rahner's Rule for systematic theology classes.
- As a **polemic/reconciling resource**: mediates between Barthian disclosure models and Rahnerian identification in debates over revelation and metaphysics.
- As an **exegetical model**: models how to ground dogmatic claims about God's inner life in biblicalChristological witness.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula on Trinity, revelation, and doctrine of Scripture - bridging historical theology and contemporary constructive work.
