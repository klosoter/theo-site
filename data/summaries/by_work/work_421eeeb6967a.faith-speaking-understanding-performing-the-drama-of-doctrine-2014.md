### TITLE
**Faith Speaking Understanding: Performing the Drama of Doctrine** (Kevin J. Vanhoozer, 2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2014 amid renewed debates over theological method in evangelical and Reformed circles: recovery of doctrinal retrieval, pushback against anti-propositional narrative theology, and engagement with analytic philosophy of language (Austin, Searle).
 - Vanhoozer writes as a Reformed systematician attentive to ecclesial practice, hermeneutics, and apologetics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Doctrine is best conceived as a *performative, theatrical script*: theological propositions are true insofar as they function as verbal acts that enable the church to speak, worship, and act rightly before God and the world. Faith both speaks and understands; doctrine is a public, performative grammar for Christian life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Critique of two unhelpful poles - empty ritualism/anti-intellectual pietism and sterile propositionalism detached from practice.
 - Part II: Theoretical foundation - adapts speech-act theory to theology: locution (propositions), illocution (doctrinal commitments), perlocution (transformative effects in community and world).
 - Part III: Ecclesial and ethical implications - doctrine as script that trains embodied agents (congregations as performers), integrates worship, preaching, mission.
 - Part IV: Methodological consequences - a theology that is both cognitively responsible and practically formative; doctrine serves epistemic practices rather than merely representing facts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages J.L. Austin, John Searle (speech-act theory), Hans Frei, Richard B. Hays, Karl Barth, John Calvin, and contemporary analytic theologians.
 - Dialogues with narrative theologians and opponents of propositional truth while reclaiming propositional content as performative.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (Scripture as authoritative script), doctrine (nature and function), Trinity and Christology implied as shaping performance, ecclesiology and ethics, implicit anthropology (human agency and embodiment).

- **Relation to cited topical emphases**
 - **Human Nature / Psychosomatic Unity:** Emphasizes humans as embodied agents; doctrine shapes both speech and bodily practices (worship, sacrament, habitus), integrating mind and body in formation.
 - **Nature and Task of Theology:** Recasts theology as ecclesial, public, and performative - theology's task is to provide the script that forms believing communities.
 - **Epistemology / Knowledge of God:** Moves epistemology from mere propositional belief to practice-centered knowing: doctrines epistemically empower believers to know and participate in God's reality.

- **Closing line**
 - Theology is not mere information but a performed grammar: beliefs are scripts that train embodied communities to enact and thereby know the truth of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Locates doctrinal authority and truth in speech-act efficacy within ecclesial performance rather than in detached propositional content alone.
 - Strong integration of analytic speech-act theory with classic Christian doctrinal commitments.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges anti-propositional narrative theology by defending propositional content, but reconceives propositionality as performative rather than merely representational.
 - Counters purely cognitive or privatized piety by insisting on public, embodied practices as constitutive of theological truth.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Doctrine as script" and the systematic use of **locution/illocution/perlocution** as theological categories.
 - Emphasis on **performance** (ecclesial enactment) as criterion of doctrinal fruitfulness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals and Reformed scholars seeking a middle way between propositionalism and anti-propositionalism.
 - Adopted in homiletics, liturgical theology, and practical theology conversations; cited in debates on theological method and analytic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological framework that links doctrinal truth, ecclesial practice, and theological epistemology; valuable for teaching doctrine as formative practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Doctrine as script**
 - Doctrinal formulations function like scripts that guide Christian speech and action in worship and mission.

- **Speech-act theory (locution / illocution / perlocution)**
 - Locution: propositional content; Illocution: performative force (what doctrine does); Perlocution: effects produced in believers and world.

- **Performative propositionalism**
 - A term to capture Vanhoozer's stance: doctrines are propositional but their truth is bound up with performative ecclesial consequences.

- **Ecclesial performance**
 - The church as the stage where doctrine is enacted; practices (liturgy, preaching, sacraments) instantiate doctrinal truth.

- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Humans understood as integrated body-soul agents; doctrine shapes embodied habits and virtues, not just beliefs.

- **Practical epistemology / knowing by doing**
 - Knowledge of God includes participatory, practice-based knowing; doctrine equips believers for epistemic engagement with God.

- **Scripture as authoritative script**
 - Scripture provides the canonical script that orients doctrinal speech-acts and ecclesial formation.

- **Hermeneutical responsibility**
 - Theology requires faithful interpretation and faithful performance; textual understanding and communal enactment are inseparable.

- **Doxological center**
 - Theology aims at right worship and praise; doctrine's telos is doxological formation.

- **Authority and accountability**
 - Doctrinal claims are accountable to ecclesial practices and public witness; truth is tested in communal enactment.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for doctrine as performative (systematics, ecclesiology).
 - As a **polemic** against both anti-propositional narrative theology and sterile propositionalism (theological method).
 - As an **exegetical/practical model** for homiletics, liturgy, and formation: showing how Scripture-driven doctrine shapes embodied Christian practice.
