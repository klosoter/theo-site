### TITLE
**The Reformed Doctrine of Total Depravity** - Anthony Hoekema (collection of articles); focus: Nature and Origin of Sin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; Hoekema taught at Calvin Theological Seminary and wrote for an ecumenically aware, confessional Reformed audience.
 - Responds to modern revisions of sin (liberal optimism, existentialist anthropology) and to Arminian/Pelagian and some "soft" evangelical treatments that minimize original sin.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Human nature is radically fallen: sin is universal in scope, total in effect on the faculties, and originates in the historical fall of Adam with consequences transmitted to all his offspring; therefore only sovereign grace can restore.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of biblical data (esp. Genesis 3; Romans 3, 5; Psalm 51) establishing universality and depth of sin.
 - Theological analysis of the nature of the fall: what was lost (integrity of the imago Dei) and what became corrupted (will, intellect, affections, body).
 - Discussion of origin and transmission:
 - Corporate/federal headship of Adam as the biblical frame for solidarity.
 - Transmission by natural generation producing inherited corruption (not merely imitation).
 - Distinction between inherited corruption and personal culpability while maintaining real culpability in divine reckoning.
 - Doctrinal consequences: moral inability, bondage of the will, need for prevenient/sovereign grace, and Christ as federal Second Adam.
 - Pastoral and ethical implications: guilt, social effects, responsibility, and the urgency of gospel reliance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics (Kuyper, Bavinck).
 - Opponents/critiques: Pelagius/Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, Arminian tendencies, modern liberal anthropology; occasional engagement with Barth and contemporary theologians who recast sin.
 - Scriptural loci: Genesis, Romans, Psalms, Pauline and Wisdom literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology, original sin, imago Dei, federal headship, sin and guilt, moral inability, grace, Christology (Second Adam), atonement and justification (implications).
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema centers the doctrine on the inescapable dependence of fallen humanity on sovereign redemptive grace: total depravity necessitates total grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear insistence on both the *totality* and the *realism* of sin: all faculties affected, and corruption is truly transmitted by natural human generation within Adam's covenantal headship.
 - Pastoral clarity: theological precision is tied to pastoral urgency-doctrine framed to underline gospel necessity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects liberal and optimistic anthropology that relativizes sin; pushes back against Pelagian/Arminian minimizations by reaffirming moral inability without denying human responsibility.
 - Nuances classical scholastic formulations by distinguishing inherited corruption from the metaphysics of guilt while still affirming federal imputation as biblically warranted.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes clear operational distinctions: *inherited corruption* versus *personal sin*, *federal* versus *seminal* headship, and *total inability* as moral incapacity rather than mere disability.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminary instruction and evangelical systematic treatments on sin; valued for balanced confessional fidelity and pastoral application.
 - Served as a corrective in dialogues with Arminian and liberal interlocutors; less influential among theologians who reject federal imputation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, pastorally sensitive, and theologically robust account of original sin useful for preaching, catechesis, and systematic loci on anthropology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total depravity** - The whole person (mind, will, affections, body) is affected by sin; not annihilation but pervasive corruption.
- **Original sin** - The condition and corruption originating from Adam's fall that all humans inherit.
- **Inherited corruption** - The transmission of a sinful nature through natural generation; distinguishes the ontological reality from mere imitation.
- **Federal headship** - Adam as covenant representative whose act has covenantal consequences for his descendants; key biblical mechanism for solidarity.
 - Contrast: *seminal headship* (biological/semen-based explanation) - Hoekema gives priority to covenantal/federal language while acknowledging biological aspects.
- **Imputation** - Divine reckoning of Adam's offense and/or Christ's righteousness; Hoekema affirms imputation but clarifies guilt vs. corruption distinctions.
- **Moral inability / total inability** - The lost capacity to seek God or secure salvation apart from divine grace.
- **Imago Dei (fallen)** - The image of God is marred, not erased; capacity for relational knowledge and accountability remains but is distorted.
- **Personal sin vs original guilt** - Personal acts of sin build on inherited corruption; Hoekema preserves personal responsibility while defending corporate guilt in divine judgment.
- **Prevenient grace vs sovereign grace** - Hoekema rejects Arminian-style prevenient grace that renders humans capable; insists on sovereign, effective grace as the remedy.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism** - Opposed models that minimize the extent and effects of original sin; used as polemical foils.
- **Romans 5 exegesis** - Hoekema models a federal reading: Adam's one trespass and Christ's one obedience function covenantally for many.
- **Common grace** - Acknowledges non-salvific restraints and blessings that do not remove total depravity.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for the locus of sin/anthropology in Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a polemic against Pelagianism/Arminian softening of depravity and as an exegetical model for Romans 5 (Adam-Christ parallel).
 - As a practical conceptual pivot linking anthropology to soteriology: total depravity as the necessary premise for doctrines of grace, atonement, and justification.
