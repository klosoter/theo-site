### TITLE
The Person of Jesus Christ (1912) - H. R. Mackintosh

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1912 amid early 20th-century debates on incarnation and modern biblical scholarship. Scottish Reformed theological milieu; dialogue with recent German "kenotic" proposals and with historical-critical exegesis of Philippians 2.
 - Reaction to liberal theological tendencies which proposed radical reinterpretations of divine attributes in the incarnation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defends the classical Christian claim that in the incarnation the Son does not cease to be God; the "self-emptying" (kenosis) of Philippians 2 must be understood without implying an ontological loss or alteration of the divine nature.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful reading of Philippians 2 balanced with Johannine and Pauline high Christology.
 - Philosophical-theological clarification: distinguishes possession of divine attributes from exercise; differentiates ontological change from voluntary self-limitation.
 - Dogmatic application: reaffirms Chalcedonian formulation - one Person (hypostasis) with two complete natures (divine and human) - and resists interpretations that imply a change in the divine essence.
 - Pastoral and apologetic implication: preserves Christ's sufficiency for salvation and revelation while accounting for genuine human experience (suffering, growth, dependence).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with: German kenotic theologians (the late-19th / early-20th-century movement), patristic witnesses, Reformation confessions and some contemporary British and German scholarship on Christology.
 - Implicit contrasts with proponents who read kenosis as ontological subtraction of divine attributes.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central): incarnation, pre-existence, humiliation, exaltation.
 - Trinity (economic vs. immanent distinctions), divine immutability/impassibility, communicatio idiomatum (exchange of properties).
 - Soteriology implicitly-how the person and work of Christ effect salvation.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Mackintosh locates the truth of the incarnation in the paradoxical union of full deity and full humanity: the Son voluntarily refrains from the external exercise of divine prerogatives in the economy without undergoing ontological diminution.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful analytical distinction between *possession* and *exercise* of divine attributes: Christ retains all divine being while voluntarily limiting the outward exercise of certain attributes in the incarnate life.
 - Strong stress on maintaining Chalcedonian categories as necessary guardrails for biblical exegesis.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects kenotic formulations that construe Philippians 2 as proof that the Son surrendered or ceased to be divine in essence.
 - Contrasts with naturalistic or reductionist tendencies in some liberal theologies that treat the incarnation as mere moral influence or as an abandonment of divine properties.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Refines kenosis language by translating it into terms of **economic self-limitation** rather than **ontological subtraction**.
 - Emphasizes the interplay of *hypostatic union* and *functional subordination* without collapsing person into nature.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative and confessional Reformed teaching as a balanced corrective to speculative kenotic theories.
 - Influential in British and Scottish theological education for clarifying methodological relations between exegesis and dogma.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for reconciling serious biblical attention to Phil. 2 with orthodox metaphysical commitments; pedagogically strong for courses on classic Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis** - central exegetical motif (Philippians 2:7); Mackintosh treats it as voluntary self-limitation in the economy, not loss of divinity.
- **Philippians 2:7** - primary text; read in light of the whole New Testament high Christology.
- **Hypostatic Union** - one Person with two natures; used as the primary doctrinal framework to avoid ontological confusion.
- **Chalcedon / Chalcedonian definition** - normative standard; invoked to guard against dysergias in doctrine.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - discussed to explain how divine and human predicates apply to the one Person without mixture or confusion.
- **Divine immutability / impassibility** - affirmed in essence; Mackintosh allows for economic manifestations that involve true human passibility.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity** - distinction used to interpret kenosis as economic action within salvation history rather than change in the immanent being of God.
- **Possession vs. exercise of attributes** - key analytic pair: Christ possesses divine attributes but voluntarily refrains from exercising certain prerogatives in the incarnate state.
- **Humiliation and exaltation** - twofold kenotic schema: genuine human humiliation, followed by resurrection and vindication consistent with retained deity.
- **Ontological kenosis (critique)** - labeled as problematic when it entails loss of divine nature; Mackintosh rejects this as theologically untenable.
- **Functional kenosis (qualified acceptance)** - permitted when it denotes relational/operational subordination within the incarnate economy.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for orthodox limits on kenotic interpretation (economic self-limitation, not ontological subtraction).
- As a **polemic** against radical kenotic theologies in early 20th-century scholarship.
- As an **exegetical model** balancing Philippians 2 with Johannine and Pauline high Christology to sustain classical Christological formulations.
