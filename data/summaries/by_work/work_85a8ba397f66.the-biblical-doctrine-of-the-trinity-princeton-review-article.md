### TITLE
**The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity** - Charles Hodge (Princeton Review article)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Reformed theology; Princeton School; conservative reaction to Enlightenment and liberalizing trends in German theology and rationalist reductions of dogma. Published in the Princeton Review as a statement of confessional orthodoxy and as polemic against speculative theology that divorces doctrine from Scripture.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Trinity is a revealed, biblical doctrine: God is one in essence and three in persons. Any true doctrine of God must arise from Scripture and preserve unity of substance while affirming real distinctions of persons; avoid both Sabellianism (modalism) and Tritheism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture as primary and sufficient ground: Hodge insists biblical testimony establishes Christ's deity and the Spirit's divinity alongside the Father.
 - Logical delimitation: Defines terms (substance/essence, person/hypostasis, relation), then demonstrates how they cohere without contradiction.
 - Refutation of errors:
 - Against modalism: persons are not mere modes or successive manifestations.
 - Against tritheism: there is one divine essence, not three gods.
 - Relation of immanent and economic Trinity:
 - The immanent (ontological) Trinity has real internal relations; these relations are the ground for the economy of salvation.
 - The economic Trinity (God's revelation in redemptive acts) is not merely functional masking of an impersonal monad; revelation discloses real personhood.
 - Practical consequences: Trinity as basis for worship, Christology, atonement, and the doctrine of the Spirit in sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Relies on Scripture, the Nicene and Athanasian formularies, patristic witnesses (Athanasius, Augustine), and Reformed tradition (Calvin, later Princeton theologians). Opposes modern rationalists and modalists; situates against German speculative tendencies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Core: Trinity (primary), with implications for revelation, Christology (deity and person of Christ), the Holy Spirit, and soteriology (atonement and application).
- **Closing line**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity is a biblically revealed mystery that must be confessed as the one God in three real, eternal persons - the indispensable theological center for correct worship, Christology, and salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on Scripture as final arbiter: theology must not ground the Trinity in speculative metaphysics detached from revelation.
 - Careful terminological discipline: distinguishes essence vs person and relation vs operation to avoid equivocation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both historic modalism (Sabellianism) and modern tendencies to either dilute personal distinctions (overly functional views) or to fragment the Godhead into three gods (tritheism).
 - Contrasts with German idealist or rationalist attempts to deduce divine plurality from logical categories rather than from revealed relations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No radical neologisms; rather, Hodge systematizes classic patristic and scholastic vocabulary with Reformed exegetical emphasis, making the classical terms accessible and serviceable for Protestant confessional use.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in American Reformed circles; reinforced Princeton theology's confessional and biblical epistemology. Used as a corrective against 19th-century liberal revisions and as a teaching resource in seminaries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact defense of classical Trinitarian orthodoxy grounded in Scripture; valuable as a polemical model and as a pedagogical primer on balancing ontological and economic aspects of the doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity** - One God in three persons; central dogma defended as biblical revelation.
- **Person (hypostasis)** - Real, distinct subsistent centers of consciousness within the divine being; not mere modes.
- **Essence / Substance (ousia)** - The one divine nature shared by the three persons; unity that prevents tritheism.
- **Relation of origin** - The internal relations (begetting, procession) that distinguish persons without implying inferiority.
- **Ontological (immanent) Trinity** - The inner life and relations of the Godhead; persons are really distinct in themselves.
- **Economic Trinity** - The way God reveals himself and acts in history (Father sending Son and Spirit) - known to us through Scripture.
 - Contrast: Hodge insists economic revelation discloses, but does not merely create, ontological realities.
- **Modalism (Sabellianism)** - Error that confuses persons with successive modes; primary target of Hodge's refutation.
- **Tritheism** - Error of treating the persons as three separate gods; rebutted by appeal to divine unity.
- **Perichoresis / Mutual indwelling** - Interpenetration and unity of persons (Hodge uses functional equivalents even if not technicalized).
- **Revelation (Scriptural epistemology)** - The only legitimate ground for the doctrine; doctrine must follow biblical testimony, not speculative metaphysics.
- **Nicene and Athanasian creeds** - Authoritative formulations repeatedly appealed to as faithful summaries of biblical teaching.
- **Atonement & Christology** - Trinity as the theological framework enabling a coherent doctrine of the Incarnation and redemption.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for ecclesiastical and confessional formulations of Trinity and personhood.
 - As **polemic** against modalism, rationalist reductions, and tritheism.
 - As an **exegetical model**: method of deriving Trinitarian doctrine from Scripture rather than abstract metaphysics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting doctrine of God with Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology.
