### TITLE
**Future Grace** - John Piper (1995). Evangelical Reformed pastoral-theological treatment of sanctification that situates present holiness in the reception of God"s promised future grace.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century American Reformed evangelicalism; pastorally aimed at congregations shaped by revivalist and therapeutic trends.
 - Part of a broader Piper corpus stressing God-centered Christian living (cf. Desiring God).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The central claim: **sanctification is the present appropriation of God"s promised future grace by faith**. Christians grow in holiness not primarily by mustering willpower or subjective experience, but by believing and living on God"s promissory word of future favor.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: many Christians either strive under moralism or expect instantaneous power; both misunderstand the gospel and the means of growth.
 - Positive proposal:
 - God has promised future grace (final salvation, glorification, progressive transformation).
 - Those promises are the means by which the Spirit sanctifies believers now: when Christians take hold of promised future good, faith functions to receive present sanctifying grace.
 - Practical implications: preaching promises, cultivating faith, assurance, and perseverance.
 - Pastoral application: prayer, Scripture, gospel sermons, and faith-shaped affections are the instruments through which future grace becomes present power.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed tradition implicitly (Calvinist soteriology, Puritan spirituality); engages contemporary pastoral issues more than systematic controversies.
 - Implicit contrasts with pietistic/victorious living movements and with legalistic or moralistic piety.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (central), justification and union with Christ (soteriological framework), perseverance, faith, eschatology (future grace), means of grace (promise, Word, Spirit), assurance.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: **God"s promised future favor is not merely a future hope but the present instrumental means by which the Spirit produces holiness in believers who receive those promises by faith.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Coined and popularized the phrase and programmatic emphasis "future grace" as the primary means of sanctification.
 - Makes the promises of God (eschatological assurances) the active, present means of sanctifying power rather than subjective experiences or ethical resolve.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects moralistic and self-effort approaches by relocating the initiative and power in God"s future-given grace.
 - Pushes back against forms of "victory" teaching that emphasize present experiential power before grounding in the promissory character of God"s work.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Treats "promise" as an operative theological category in sanctification (promise-as-means), not merely as future information.
 - Stresses faith as receptive, expectant action that makes future grace efficacious now.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in late-20th and 21st-century Reformed evangelicalism and pastoral ministries.
 - Adopted in preaching, discipleship, and counseling circles as a corrective to moralism and therapeutic Christianity.
 - Criticisms: some argue Piper underplays practical disciplines, corporate practices, and the necessity of mortification; others find his emphasis clarifying and pastoral.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise theology of motivation and means for holiness that links soteriology and eschatology.
 - Valuable for pastors and mature students as a model of biblical pastoral theology uniting doctrine and practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Future grace**
 - The promised eschatological favor of God that believers may receive in the present by faith; central operative category.
- **Promise**
 - God"s declarative pledges (Scripture) that function as means, not only future assurances.
- **Faith (as receiving)**
 - Active reception of promises; faith is the instrument by which future grace becomes present sanctifying power.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive transformation effected by receiving future grace in union with Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Soteriological basis: promises pertain to believers in Christ and are received in that union.
- **Justification / Assurance**
 - Justification grounds hopeful expectation; assurance is fostered by trusting promises which secure perseverance.
- **Perseverance**
 - Seen as the outworking of God"s future-oriented promises being received over time.
- **Means of grace**
 - Reoriented: Word, promise, Spirit, and faith are emphasized as the channels of future grace now.
- **Motivation by hope**
 - Christian obedience is primarily motivated by confident hope in future grace rather than guilt or self-centered goals.
- **Eschatology (practical)**
 - Future realities (glorification) function as present causes of holiness.
- **Antinomianism (addressed)**
 - Piper denies that emphasis on promise dispensers laxity; proper reception of promise produces obedience.
- **Moralism (corrected)**
 - Distinguishes gospel-motivated obedience from law-driven self-effort.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for a Reformed, promise-centered account of sanctification and pastoral motivation.
- As a **pastoral-exegetical model** for preaching Romans/Philippians and for counseling toward assurance and perseverance.
- As a **polemic resource** against moralistic, experiential-only, or purely programmatic approaches to holy living.
