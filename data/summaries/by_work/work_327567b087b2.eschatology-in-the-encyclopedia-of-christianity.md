### TITLE
Eschatology - Anthony A. Hoekema (Encyclopedia of Christianity)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; concise encyclopedia treatment drawing on Hoekema's broader work (notably The Bible and the Future). Aimed at a general scholarly readership seeking an overview of biblical and doctrinal eschatology within a Protestant, Reformed framework.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Biblical eschatology must hold together the present, realized reign of Christ and the unequivocal future consummation - the Parousia is delayed not through human error but by divine patience so that gospel mission and repentance may occur; theological systems that separate Israel/Church or reduce the future promise are judged deficient.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of New Testament teaching about Christ's return (Parousia), resurrection, judgment, kingdom and new creation.
 - Historical-theological summary of interpretations (early church, Augustine, Reformation, modern dispensational and premillennial movements).
 - Systematic synthesis in a covenantal/amillennial register: present reality of Christ's reign, future bodily resurrection and consummation, critique of literalist millennial chronologies.
 - Specific attention to the problem of the *delay of the Parousia* - scriptural explanation (e.g., 2 Peter 3) of divine forbearance and mission-driven postponement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Pauline eschatology, Johannine passages, Revelation), early church fathers, Augustine, Reformation confessions, contemporary premillennialists/dispensationalists; frequent cross-reference to his own systematic exposition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (return as the Lord-Christ), Trinity (role of God's will/patience), soteriology (already/not-yet salvation), covenant theology (continuity of people of God), resurrection and immortality, final judgment, new creation, ecclesiology insofar as mission and waiting are church tasks.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Eschatology is the Christian synthesis of present redemption and future consummation: Christ reigns now, will return bodily to judge and renew, and the apparent delay of His coming is explicable as divine patience directed toward repentance and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong articulation of the *delay of the Parousia* as a theological datum - not an embarrassment but providential patience (drawing explicitly on 2 Peter 3 and Pauline anticipatory language).
 - Balanced stress on both *realized* and *future* dimensions: the kingdom is present in Christ yet awaits full manifestation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Clear corrective to dispensational premillennialism: rejects rigid Israel/Church divide, postponement of ultimate promises to an earthly millennial kingdom, and hyper-literal prophetic schemas.
 - Nuances beyond naïve imminence rhetoric: while affirming Christ's imminent return, Hoekema insists on the theological reasons for delay and the church's mission responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not an originator of "already-not-yet" language but consolidates the term into a concise, covenantal polemical framework suitable for systematic theology and pastoral teaching.
 - Uses the category of divine *forbearance/patience* as the central interpretive key for the delay motif.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and broader evangelical circles as a reliable, concise summary of classic Reformed eschatology.
 - Served as an accessible bridge between academic treatments and pastoral application; contrasted frequently with dispensationalist primers in seminary curricula.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Excellent concise entrée to Reformed eschatology and the problem of the delayed Parousia; valuable for sermon preparation, classroom overviews, and as a compact corrective to popular futurist distortions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia (Second Coming):** Central eschatological event; bodily return of Christ to judge and consummate salvation.
- **Delay of the Parousia:** Theologically explained as divine patience/forbearance to allow repentance and missionary expansion (cited to 2 Peter 3 and Pauline motifs).
- **Already-not-yet:** The tension between present aspects of the kingdom and its future consummation; organizing interpretive principle.
- **Millennium / Amillennialism:** Hoekema favors a non-literal/more covenantal reading, critical of dispensational literalism.
- **Kingdom of God:** Present reality in Christ's reign and future consummation in new creation.
- **General Resurrection:** Future bodily resurrection of the dead as decisive eschatological act.
- **Final Judgment:** Universal, public, and definitive judgment tied to Christ's return and consummation.
- **New Creation / Consummation:** Renewal of cosmos; ultimate goal of eschatology where redemption's effects are universalized.
- **Imminence:** Affirmed, but qualified by theological explanation for apparent delay.
- **Divine Patience / Forbearance:** Key interpretive category explaining delayed Parousia and motivating mission.
- **Intermediate State:** Conscious existence between death and resurrection; continuity with final hope.
- **Eschatological Hope:** Christian hope centered on resurrection, renewal, and vindication in Christ.
- **Covenant Framework:** Interpretive grid for continuity of promises and people of God across history.
- **Mission and Witness:** Practical implication of the delay - urgency for proclamation.
- **Use across loci:**
 - Definition source and concise summary for Reformed eschatology in systematic theology courses.
 - Polemic resource against dispensational premillennial schemes and literalist prophetic readings.
 - Exegetical model for reading delay passages (2 Pet 3; Pauline juxtaposition of imminence and patience) and for linking mission with eschatological expectation.
