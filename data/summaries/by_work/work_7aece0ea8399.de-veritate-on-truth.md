### TITLE
De Veritate (On Truth) - Anonymous

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Likely a late medieval or early-Reformation scholastic tract attributed to an anonymous author within the Latin theological tradition. Reflects interaction with Augustine, Anselm, and scholastic disputational methods; circulated in manuscript traditions and cited in later bibliological and soteriological debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Truth is ontologically grounded in God and epistemically accessible to humans only through a mingling of created reason and divine grace; Scripture functions as the normative instrument for knowledge of divine truth and for sanctification within the covenant of grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definitions and metaphysics of truth: correspondence and truth as participation in the divine intellect.
 - The knowability of God: arguments for divine knowability tied to created analogies and prevenient/common grace.
 - Scripture and truth: claims for inspiration/inerrancy as guarantors of propositional access to God.
 - Soteriological consequences: how truth informs justification, good works, and merit within the covenant of grace; distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification.
 - Practical theology: implications for the task of theology, preaching, and pastoral assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Frequent appeal to Augustine and patristic authorities; dialectical engagement with scholastic formulations (Aquinas-style causalism and nominalist challenges); implicit reply to emerging Reformation concerns about Scripture and grace.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration, epistemology (knowledge of God), covenantal soteriology (justification, sanctification), common/preparatory grace, and the nature and task of theology.
- **Closing line (theological center):** Truth is both the attribute of God and the covenantal medium by which God heals human ignorance - known truly only where divine revelation and grace intersect with created reason.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Integrates epistemology and soteriology: knowing God is framed as an element of covenantal restoration rather than a purely intellectual act.
 - Stresses **preparatory/common grace** as enabling natural knowledge of God without equating it to salvific knowledge.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - More cautious than some scholastics about unaided reason's reach; more optimistic than strict voluntarist or radical nominalist accounts about the analogical knowability of God.
 - Counters extremes that separate justification and moral renewal by arguing that truth both declares (forensic justification) and forms (sanctification) the believer.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses a covenantal frame for epistemic categories (e.g., "covenantal truth" as a locus where revelation, promise, and ethical transformation meet).
 - Distinguishes sharply between **definitive sanctification** (status before God) and **progressive sanctification** (ethical formation), tying both to the believer's possession of truth.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in later bibliological debates as a compact defense of Scriptural authority and inerrancy; used by both confessional Reformed writers and medieval commentators.
 - Cited by pastoral theologians for its approach to assurance and the pastoral use of truth.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a concise model linking doctrine of God, epistemology, and pastoral theology; useful for bridging historical scholasticism and confessional Reformed concerns.
 - Valuable pedagogically for showing how ontology, revelation, and ethics can be integrated in a single theological treatment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Truth (veritas):** Ontological property grounded in God; human truth is participation in divine intellect.
- **Correspondence/Participation:** Twofold account - truth as correct representation and as creaturely participation in divine reality.
- **Knowability of God:** Claim that God is knowable analogically through creation and specially through revelation.
- **Common/Preparatory Grace:** Non-saving gifts that prepare the mind for reception of saving truth.
 - Contrast: common grace permits reason; prevenient grace enables receptivity to revelation.
- **Inspiration / Inerrancy:** Scripture as divinely guaranteed truth-bearer; used to secure propositional knowledge of God.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The relational framework in which truth effects both justification and sanctification.
- **Justification / Merit:** Forensic declaration dependent on truth (promised/declared); good works described as non-meritorious yet instrumentally required within covenant life.
- **Definitive vs. Progressive Sanctification:** Definitive = believer's status before God; Progressive = ongoing moral formation; both grounded in truth's possession.
- **Nature and Task of Theology:** Theology defined as ordered knowledge of God for worship and holiness; task includes guarding truth and guiding life.
- **Epistemic Humility:** Affirmed as a moral and theological posture; acknowledges limits of reason while insisting on genuine knowledge through grace.
- **Pastoral Use of Truth:** Truth is not merely doctrinal but curative and formative.
- **Analogical Knowledge:** Knowledge of God via similarity without identity; resists both univocity and complete ineffability.
- **Revelation-Proposition Link:** Scripture furnishes propositional truths that mediate divine knowledge.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for covenantal and epistemic terms (useful in bibliology and theology proper).
 - As a **polemic resource** defending Scripture's authority against sceptical or nominalist tendencies.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for connecting doctrinal truth to sanctification and pastoral assurance.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the integration of epistemology and soteriology in Reformed curricula.
