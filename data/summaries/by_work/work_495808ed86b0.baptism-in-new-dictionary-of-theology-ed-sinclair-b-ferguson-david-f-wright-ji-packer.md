### TITLE
Baptism - Sinclair B. Ferguson (entry in New Dictionary of Theology, eds. Ferguson, Wright, Packer)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical milieu; the New Dictionary of Theology (1988) aimed to supply concise, confessional summaries for pastors and students within conservative Protestantism. Ferguson writes from a Reformed-paedobaptist perspective shaped by covenant theology and pastoral pastoral-practical concerns.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Baptism is the covenant sign and seal of the gospel that marks incorporation into Christ and the visible covenant community; it should be understood and practised in continuity with Old Testament circumcision and the Reformed confessions, while refusing both sacramental automatism and reduction to mere symbol.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition of baptism as a sacrament: visible sign instituted by Christ, signifying spiritual realities (union with Christ, cleansing, new life).
 - Exegesis and typology: baptism linked to circumcision (Colossians 2:11-12), New Covenant household practice in Acts, and the Great Commission (Matt 28:18-20).
 - Subjects: defense of infant baptism on covenantal grounds - children of believing parents are included as covenant members; critique of strict believer-only models that sever NT practice from covenant continuity.
 - Mode: treatment of immersion vs sprinkling/affusion - symbolic meanings (death/ resurrection; cleansing) considered, but mode is secondary to sacramental function and covenantal form.
 - Efficacy: baptism is not an automatic instrument of regeneration; it is a sign and seal that may accompany and confirm God's promised grace, calling for faith and parental/ communal responsibility.
 - Pastoral implications: administration, catechesis, and the evangelical obligation to call baptized persons to personal faith.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Matt, Acts, Romans, Colossians), Augustine and Calvin implicitly as sacramental authorities, Reformed confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg), and contemporary interlocutors - Baptists/Anabaptists and sacramental critics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sacramentology, covenant theology, ecclesiology (visible church membership), Trinitarian baptismal formula, soteriology (union with Christ, regeneration), typology (circumcision).
- **Closing line:** Ferguson locates baptism centrally as the covenantal sign and seal of union with Christ and membership in the visible church - a means appointed by Christ that requiresed pastoral catechesis and faith even as it resists both magic and reductionist symbolism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced Reformed sacramental realism:** Affirms that baptism is a real, divinely-appointed sign and seal without endorsing Roman notions of ex opere operato; holds a middle path between sacramentalism and mere memorialism.
- **Covenantal continuity emphasized:** Strong stress on continuity with circumcision - infants of the covenant are properly baptized, not as regenerated persons but as covenant members with attendant promises and obligations.
- **Pastoral-polemical tone:** Fergusons writes pastorally but squarely addresses Baptist critiques, insisting that household baptisms and covenant logic better account for NT practice than strict credobaptism.
- **Mode secondary:** While recognizing the theological value of immersion imagery (death/ resurrection), Ferguson does not make immersion the decisive norm - permitting affusion/sprinkling within the Reformed tradition.
- **Efficacy nuance:** Clear distinction between sign/seal and conferment of grace; baptism witnesses to and seals God's promise, and is often associated with grace (and sometimes regeneration), but does not mechanically effect salvation.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a concise, balanced summary; influential among Presbyterian and Reformed pastors for teaching infant baptism; critiqued by Baptist scholars for its covenantal presuppositions.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as an accessible, modestly technical primer that integrates biblical exegesis, confessional commitments, and pastoral application - valuable for teaching, preaching, and ecumenical discussion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism (sacrament):** Visible sign and seal instituted by Christ that signifies union with Christ, cleansing, and entrance into the covenant community.
- **Sign and seal:** Distinction - a sign points to a spiritual reality; a seal confirms God's promise to the believer/covenant member.
- **Covenant of grace:** Framework for understanding subjectivity (infant inclusion) - baptism parallels circumcision as the covenant sign for the people of God.
- **Infant baptism (paedobaptism):** Justified by covenant continuity, household baptisms, and Reformed confessional practice; infants are baptized as covenant members, not as regenerated persons.
- **Believer's baptism (credobaptism):** Treated as a rival position; Ferguson critiques its severing of NT practice from covenantal typology.
- **Mode (immersion vs affusion/sprinkling):**
 - Immersion: underscores death/ resurrection symbolism.
 - Affusion/sprinkling: linked to cleansing imagery and accepted within Reformed praxis; mode is subordinate to sacramental meaning.
- **Efficacy / instrumental vs declarative:** Baptism is an appointed means through which God confirms promises; efficacy is covenantally bound and spiritually mediated, not automatic.
- **Circumcision typology:** OT sign that grounds NT infant baptism and covenant continuity (Col 2:11-12).
- **Household baptisms:** NT data point (Acts) used to justify infant inclusion and family-level covenant administration.
- **Union with Christ:** Central theological effect signified by baptism (death to sin, new life).
- **Regeneration:** Related but not identical to baptism - baptism often accompanies but does not guarantee regeneration.
- **Visible church / membership:** Baptism marks entrance into the visible covenant community with attendant duties and catechesis.
- **Westminster/Heidelberg confessional backing:** Ferguson appeals to these for doctrinal framing and pastoral practice.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Definition source and concise confessional summary for ecclesiology and sacramentology.
 - Polemic resource in debates with Baptists and Anabaptists; supplies covenantal counter-argument.
 - Exegetical-model reference for household baptisms, circumcision typology, and pastoral implications in preaching and catechesis.
