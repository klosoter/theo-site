### TITLE
**God Without Measure: Working Papers in Christian Theology, Vol. 1: God and the Works of God** 
John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century retrieval of classical theism within anglophone dogmatics; post-Barthian yet corrective of modern historicism and relational theism; situated in the British evangelical and wider ecumenical academic theology milieu.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reconstitute Christian theology as a holy science ordered by God himself; articulate the divine perfections (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) such that God in se is the principled ground of God ad extra; resist collapsing God into history or mutual affectivity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Methodological re-foundation:** Theology has principia in God (principium essendi) and in God-given media (principium cognoscendi: Word and Spirit through Scripture), making theology a graced, scientific contemplation of God (cf. Webster, God Without Measure, 1: Principia).
 - **Divine perfections retrieval:** Rehearsal and defense of classical attributes as evangelical grammar safeguarding the distinction and ordered relation of Creator and creature; insistence that opera ad extra are indivisa and manifest, not constitute, who God is.
 - **God and works of God:** From perfections to economy: creation, providence, and salvation are external works of the perfect, simple, immutable, impassible God whose life is from himself (cf. Webster, God Without Measure, 1: Life in and of Himself).
 - **Sanctification of reason:** Theological intelligence is regenerated for contemplation and confession; metaphysical tools are ministerial, not magisterial.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture; Augustine and Aquinas; Reformed scholastics (e.g., Polanus, Turretin); Barth as proximate interlocutor; critical engagement with modern process, open, and relational theisms; careful use of classical metaphysics under evangelical rule.
- **Doctrines treated:** Doctrine of God (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility; perfection and blessedness); Trinity and the relation of processions to missions; creation and providence; revelation and Scripture; theological method and science.
- **Closing line:** Theology begins and ends in God without measure, whose perfect life grounds and orders all his works.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **God as principium:** Strong articulation of principium essendi and cognoscendi centering the triune God and his self-communicative address.
 - **Holiness of theology:** Theology as a sanctified habit of mind under the Word; spiritual and scientific without romanticism.
 - **Attributes as evangelical grammar:** Perfections expounded as good news shaping creaturely judgment and worship.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - **Against historicism/relationalism:** Rejects models that posit divine becoming, passibility, or constitutive relation to creation.
 - **Nuancing Barth:** Receives Barth on God s freedom and self-sufficiency while reasserting stronger classical claims about immutability and simplicity.
 - **Metaphysics chastened by gospel:** Uses metaphysical idiom ministerially; refuses both metaphysical abstinence and domination.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Sanctification of reason** and **theological judgment** as habits; **evangelical metaphysics**; careful deployment of **negative theology** within a positive dogmatic frame.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Catalytic for Protestant classical-theist retrieval in Reformed and evangelical circles; widely assigned in prolegomena and doctrine of God seminars; influences methodological discussions about Scripture, participation, and principia.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clear, teachable grammar for divine perfections; a model of chastened dogmatic method; portable theses that re-center loci on God s self-existence and perfection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity (a se):** God s life from himself; underwrites non-competitive causality in creation and grace; guards gratuity of all opera ad extra.
- **Simplicity:** God is not composed; attributes name the one divine perfection; secures indivisibility of external works and resists partitioning God into parts or acts.
- **Immutability:** Unchange in being and purpose; the condition of God s faithful, free action toward creatures.
- **Impassibility:** No passions suffered; divine love is pure act, not reactive affect; enables rather than negates compassion ad extra.
- **Perfection/Beatitude:** God s plenitude and blessedness; evangelical note that God needs nothing and so gives freely.
- **Actus purus:** God as pure actuality; correlates with simplicity and immutability to explain the non-competitive generosity of God s agency.
- **Opera ad extra indivisa:** The external works of the Trinity are undivided, yet appropriations instruct pedagogy while preserving unity.
- **Processions and missions:** Eternal relations ground temporal sendings; economy reveals, not constitutes, who God eternally is.
- **Principium essendi:** The triune God as the ontological ground and end of theology and of all that is.
- **Principium cognoscendi:** God s self-communication by Word and Spirit in Scripture as the cognitive ground of theology.
- **Sanctification of reason:** Regeneration of intellect for rightly ordered contemplation and judgment.
- **Theology as science:** A disciplined habit ordered by its principia, ends, and object; scientia subalternata to God s self-knowledge.
- **Divine names:** Scriptural names as authorized predicates, disciplined by the Creator-creature distinction and analogical use.
- **Convenientia (fittingness):** Judgments of coherence between divine perfections and works, avoiding speculation detached from revelation.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a definition source for classical attributes and their evangelical stakes (cf. Webster, God Without Measure, 1: Life in and of Himself).
 - As a methodological anchor for prolegomena on principia and theology-as-science (cf. Webster, God Without Measure, 1: Principia).
 - As a conceptual pivot in Trinity, creation, and providence to relate processions to missions under opera ad extra indivisa.
