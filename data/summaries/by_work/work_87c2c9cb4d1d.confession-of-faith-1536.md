### TITLE
**Confession of Faith (1536) - John Calvin**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Composed in the early Reformation milieu (1530s); contemporaneous with Calvin's first edition of the Institutes (1536).
 - A working confession for nascent Reformed congregations and civic authorities negotiating liturgy, doctrine, and church order amid conflict with Roman Catholicism and radical reformers.
 - Written when Calvin was shaping a systematic Reformed identity that appealed to both Scripture and historic creeds.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a compact, scripturally grounded statement of Christian truth that defends evangelical doctrines (justification by faith, authority of Scripture) and orders the church against perceived errors of Rome and sectarian excesses.
 - To reconcile fidelity to the Ecumenical Creeds with Reformed reinterpretation of disputed loci (e.g., the Holy Spirit and the Filioque, sacraments, ecclesial authority).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Opening affirmation of the one God and of Christ, with explicit reference to the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds as normative confession.
 - Exposition of key soteriological principles: human sin, justification by faith alone, righteousness imputed, and effectual calling.
 - Treatment of the Holy Spirit and Trinitarian relations, including the Spirit's procession and relation to Father and Son.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: nature of the church, baptism, and the Lord's Supper as signs and seals, and the role of discipline and ministers.
 - Practical conclusions on worship, rites, and rejection of papal claims.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis is primary; appeals to the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds.
 - Polemical engagement with Roman Catholic theology (papal authority, sacramentalism), Lutheran sacramental formulations, and Anabaptist ecclesiology.
 - In dialogue with contemporaries like Bucer, Oecolampadius, and indirectly with Luther and Zwingli on Eucharistic questions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority and sufficiency)
 - Trinity (including the Spirit's relation to Father and Son)
 - Christology (two natures, mediatorial work)
 - Justification and sanctification
 - Predestination (emphasized as sovereign election)
 - Sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper)
 - Church, ministry, and discipline

- **Closing line**
 - A succinct Reformed synthesis: Scripture and historic creeds held as normative, justification and sovereign grace at the center, sacraments as signs not meritorious, and orderly church government as essential to faithful witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on **sola Scriptura** and the priority of Scripture over ecclesiastical tradition, while retaining the Ecumenical Creeds as useful summaries.
 - Clear articulation of sacraments as **signs and seals** that confirm God's promise rather than conveying inherent merit.
 - Emphasis on **discipline and visible church order** as necessary for gospel purity.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Roman sacramentalism and papal supremacy; disputes Lutheran language of corporal presence in the Eucharist, favoring a spiritual real presence mediated by the Spirit.
 - Opposes Anabaptist rejection of visible church structures and lax discipline.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic coupling of creedal fidelity with Protestant sola principles-treating creeds as subordinate summaries rather than independent authorities.
 - Use of covenantal language and picturing sacraments as covenant seals in nascent Reformed theological vocabulary.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Helpful in consolidating early Reformed identity; influenced later Geneva polity and continental Reformed confessions.
 - Served as a theological benchmark for ministers and magistrates negotiating church reform.
 - Cited by later Reformed confessions (e.g., Consensus Tigurinus, Second Helvetic) and by Calvin's own later works (expanded Institutes).

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as an early model of marrying creedal continuity with Reformation convictions.
 - Useful in teaching how to defend traditional creeds while reinterpreting contested dogmas (notably Trinitarian language around the Spirit and Filioque).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ecumenical Creeds**
 - Embraced as normative summaries of apostolic faith; subordinated to Scripture but retained for public confession and unity.
- **Filioque**
 - Treated with caution: Calvin affirms the Spirit's relationship to Father and Son in a way consonant with Western practice but grounds the claim scripturally, avoiding metaphysical excess.
- **Sola Scriptura**
 - Scripture as the final norm; tradition valued insofar as it conforms to Scripture.
- **Sola Fide (Justification by faith)**
 - Central soteriological statement: righteousness imputed through faith, not by works or sacramental merit.
- **Predestination**
 - Sovereign election as doctrinally significant and pastoral, explaining assurance and perseverance.
- **Sacraments as Signs and Seals**
 - Baptism and the Lord's Supper confirm God's promises; sacramental efficacy dependent on the Spirit, not on physical elements.
- **Real Presence (spiritual)**
 - Rejects corporal presence; affirms spiritual communion with Christ mediated by the Spirit.
- **Church Discipline**
 - Discipline and orderly governance necessary for the purity and witness of the church.
- **Visible/Invisible Church**
 - Distinction upheld: visible church is local, disciplined, and sacramental; invisible church known to God alone.
- **Magistrate and Church**
 - Cooperation of civil authorities and church authorities in upholding public religion.
- **Idolatry**
 - Critique of images and sacerdotal practices that obscure Christ's sole mediatorship.
- **Word and Sacraments**
 - Joint instruments of grace; Word primary, sacraments confirm the Word.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for early Reformed doctrine and practice, especially in Geneva.
 - As a **polemic** against Roman sacramentalism and sectarian excesses (Lutheran and Anabaptist contrasts).
 - As an **exegetical model** for applying creedal language to Scripture-driven theology and for treating contested terms like Filioque within a Reformed framework.
