### TITLE
**The Doctrine of Justification by Faith - John Owen**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-17th-century English Puritan/Reformed milieu. Owen writes amid post-Reformation controversies (Roman Catholic claims of meritorious works, Remonstrant/Arminian objections, Socinian denials of substitution), and internal Protestant disputes (Antinomian laxity, pastoral anxieties about assurance).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Justification is a forensic act of God by which sinners are declared righteous solely on the ground of Christ's righteousness imputed to them and received by faith; human works and inherent righteousness do not constitute the ground of acquittal.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of biblical language of justification and righteousness; critique of competing readings.
 - Analysis of the nature of faith as the instrumental, receiving means (distinct from meritorious works or inherent righteousness).
 - Detailed account of Christ's obedience (both active and passive) and its imputation to believers as the meritorious ground.
 - Distinction between justification (legal declaration) and sanctification (habitual, transformative righteousness) with careful pastoral implications for assurance.
 - Replies to Romanists, Remonstrants, Socinians, and Antinomians, defending forensic imputation and denying justificatory efficacy to human righteousness or repentance-as-merit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture; Calvin and Reformed scholastics; explicit polemic against Roman Catholic theology, Socinian deniers of substitution, Remonstrant/Arminian modifications, and Antinomian abuses.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (justification, sanctification), Christology (substitution, active/passive obedience), covenant theology (federal relations), imputation, faith and repentance, assurance.
- **Closing line:** Owen centers the doctrine: **Justification is God's forensic declaration grounded in Christ's active and passive obedience imputed to the believer and received by faith alone; repentance and sanctification follow as necessary fruits and evidence, not as the ground of acceptance.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - A robust insistence on the imputation of **both** Christ's active obedience (perfect law-keeping) and passive obedience (suffered obedience/death) as jointly constituting the ground of justification.
 - Faith defined sharply as the instrumental receiver of imputed righteousness, not as a meritorious or contributing work.
 - Careful pastoral framing: assurance flows from objective imputation rather than subjective perfection.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic merit-theory by denying infused or cooperative merit as ground of justification.
 - Opposes Socinian rejection of substitution and Remonstrant dilution of forensic imputation.
 - Counters Antinomian tendencies by maintaining law's role as normative while denying its ability to justify.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precise operationalization of "active" vs "passive" obedience in the structure of justification; nuanced use of "alien" (imputed) righteousness versus "proper" (inherent) righteousness.
 - Distinctive taxonomy separating forensic declaration, imputation, and sanctification that becomes a model for later Reformed formulations.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Deep influence on later Reformed orthodoxy and evangelical soteriology; frequently cited in debates about imputation and federal theology.
 - Used in pastoral and polemical contexts to defend sola fide and to teach assurance without moral complacency.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplary combination of biblical exegesis, doctrinal precision, and pastoral concern; remains a primary resource for study of imputation and the relation of justification to sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration by God that a sinner is righteous on Christ's ground, not by inherent merit.
- **Imputation:** The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; central mechanism for justification.
 - **Alien righteousness:** Christ's righteousness given (imputed) to the believer.
 - **Proper/inherent righteousness:** Sanctification-produced righteousness within the believer (distinct, subsequent).
- **Faith:** Instrumental means of receiving justification; not meritorious, but necessary and vital (see Faith And Repentance).
- **Repentance:** Duty and necessary evidence of a believer's response; not the causal ground of justification but partnered with faith as a dispositional proof (see Faith And Repentance).
- **Active obedience:** Christ's lifelong perfect law-keeping; imputed to secure believers' positive righteousness before God (see Christs Active And Passive Obedience).
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death to bear penalty; imputed as the satisfaction for sin (see Christs Active And Passive Obedience).
- **Substitution:** Christ standing in the sinner's place, bearing penalty and rendering obedience; nexus of satisfaction and imputation.
- **Forensic/Declarative language:** Legal metaphors Owen uses to preserve God's just procedure in justification.
- **Covenant of Works/Grace (federal theology):** Federal framing that locates Christ as federal head satisfying the Law and fulfilling covenant obligations.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive internal renewal; distinct from and subsequent to justification, yet necessarily joined in the believer's experience.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral corollary: certainty of acceptance rests on Christ's objective righteousness imputed, not on subjective perfection.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a primary **definition source** for imputation, active/passive obedience, and forensic justification in Reformed theology.
 - As a **polemic and exegetical model** against Romanist, Socinian, and Remonstrant positions and as a theological pivot in teaching the relation of faith, repentance, and union with Christ.
