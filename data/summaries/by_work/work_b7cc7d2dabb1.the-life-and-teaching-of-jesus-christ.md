### TITLE
The Life and Teaching of Jesus Christ - James S. Stewart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century British/Scottish evangelical scholarship and pastoral ministry. Stewart writes as a pastor-scholar aiming to bridge devotional preaching and critical gospel study amid reactions to liberal historical criticism and existentialist theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Gospel of Jesus is best understood as a living, personal encounter that forms a present, transforming union between believer and Christ; historical study must serve the church's proclamation and the believer's union with Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Portrait of Jesus built from the Synoptic and Johannine witness, emphasizing both historicity and existential relevance.
 - Treatment of Jesus' words and deeds as revelation that summons a response of faith, repentance, and participation.
 - Repeated move from exegesis of scenes/parables to pastoral implications - ethics, discipleship, and the believer's life in Christ.
 - Integration of Christology with soteriology: the person of Jesus is the ground of union, the cross and resurrection are the means, and abiding/participation is the ongoing reality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary reliance on the canonical Gospels and Pauline themes (esp. motifs of participation); interacts implicitly with contemporary critics (historical-critical scholars and existential interpreters) and draws on patristic and Reformed intuitions without exhaustive systematic engagement.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Christology** (person and work), **Union with Christ**, **Soteriology** (participation, redemption), **Revelation**, **Incarnation**, **Kingdom of God**, **Ethics/Discipleship**, sacramental pointers to means of grace (pastoral, not systematic).
- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** Jesus Christ is not merely a subject of study but the living center in whom believers participate and by whom the life of the church and the moral life of the disciple are formed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the existential, participatory reality of Christian life - union with Christ is practical, immediate, and ethically formative rather than an abstract doctrinal category.
 - Pastoral exegetical method: literary/symbolic reading of Gospel scenes that quickly turns to spiritual application.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters liberal tendencies to reduce Jesus to an ethical teacher by insisting on the ontological reality of Christ's person and work.
 - Avoids a purely propositional or scholastic Christology; resists sterile doctrinalism that divorces belief from life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses relational and participatory language ("living in," "abiding," "sharing the life of Christ") to make the abstract notion of union with Christ vivid and pastoral.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read among mid-century British evangelical pastors and students for its sermonic tone and theological sobriety.
 - Influenced subsequent homileticians and pastoral theologians who seek to integrate biblical scholarship with congregational proclamation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies a balanced model for pastors and scholars: rigorous attention to Gospel text coupled with pastoral imagination about union and discipleship.
 - Serves as a corrective to both dry historicism and sentimental pietism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Central category - described as a present, participatory reality whereby believers share in Christ's life, death, and resurrection; grounds ethical transformation.
 - Relation to Pauline language: Stewart reads Paul's participatory verbs as theological keys, not merely doctrinal abstractions.
- **Incarnation:** The decisive revelation of God; Jesus' person is the locus of encounter that enables union.
- **Abiding/Participation:** Practical terms for ongoing Christian life - staying in Christ, receiving and displaying his life in works.
- **Kingdom of God:** Presented as both present demand and future hope, realized in the life and teaching of Jesus and in the community that participates in him.
- **Revelation:** Jesus as the living Word - revelation that elicits faith and transforms the believer's status into participation.
- **Discipleship/Ethics:** Ethics flow from union - moral exhortation is grounded in identity (in Christ) rather than legalism.
- **Cross and Resurrection:** The means that effect and secure union; cruciformity and hope are inseparable in the believer's life.
- **Person of Jesus/Christology:** Emphasis on the relational, personal access to Christ as the decisive theological starting point.
- **Preaching/Proclamation:** Methodological focus - scholarship serves proclamation and pastoral formation.
- **Faith as Encounter:** Faith is described as responsive relation, a present meeting that effects union.
- **Means of Grace:** Sacraments and Word as practices that deepen abiding (treated pastorally rather than systematically).
- **Pastoral Exegesis:** Reading aimed at spiritual formation; text-to-life movement.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a pastoral, relational understanding of Union with Christ (prefers participatory, experiential language).
- As a **polemic** against both liberal reductionism and cold scholasticism; advocates a middle path of living theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching the Gospels - close reading of narrative with immediate pastoral application.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on Christology and spiritual theology where union is taught as formative for ethics and ministry.
