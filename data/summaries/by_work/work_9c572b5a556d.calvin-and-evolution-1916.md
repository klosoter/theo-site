### TITLE
**Calvin and Evolution (1916) - B. B. Warfield**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1916 during the high era of Princeton theology; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed scholar grappling with Darwinian science and rising modernism.
 - Context: post-Darwinian biology, intra-evangelical tension that would culminate in the 1920s fundamentalist-modernist controversies.
 - Movement: Princeton/New School Reformed orthodoxy attempting synthesis of confessional theology and competent modern science.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Warfield argues that Darwinian evolution as an empirical scientific theory is not inherently hostile to orthodox Calvinistic doctrine; what is hostile is "evolutionism" - the metaphysical naturalism that excludes God.
 - Key doctrinal problem: Can Genesis (esp. Genesis 1 and the genealogical narratives in ch. 11) be read in a way that preserves scriptural authority while allowing evolutionary explanations of biological origin?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes levels: scientific hypothesis (empirical), philosophical interpretation (metaphysical), and theological doctrines (revelation, providence).
 - Claims Calvin's hermeneutical principles permit non-literal readings where Scripture's intention is not scientific exposition.
 - Presents God as the **primary cause** who institutes natural laws and **secondary causes**; evolution can be one of those secondary causal processes.
 - Rejects materialistic evolutionism while affirming that accepted scientific claims about development need not impugn divine creation or providence.
 - Emphasizes limits of Scripture's purpose: revelation aims at salvation and moral truth, not to deliver technical scientific theories.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: John Calvin (hermeneutical exemplar), Charles Darwin (scientific exemplar), and contemporary critics within Protestant circles (fundamentalists wary of Darwin).
 - Warfield engages Scripture (particularly Genesis 1 and Genesis 11), patristic and Reformation precedents on accommodation, and contemporary scientific literature.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (scope and limits of Biblical teaching)
 - Creation and providence (primary vs secondary causation)
 - Hermeneutics of Genesis (literalism vs accommodation)
 - Indirectly: theological anthropology and teleology through discussion of origins

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center: God sovereignly ordains natural processes (including evolution as a lawful secondary cause) without surrendering divine providence or the authority of Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear operational distinction between "evolution" (scientific claim) and "evolutionism" (atheistic/philosophical creed).
 - Stress on **secondary causes**: God acts providentially through law-like processes, allowing compatibility with scientific explanations.
 - Use of Calvin as a hermeneutical precedent for allowing non-scientific intent in Genesis.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both naive literalists (who read Genesis as a scientific text) and uncritical modernists (who assume science must displace doctrine).
 - Opposes the secularization of evolutionary theory while rejecting anti-intellectual fideism.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Refines and popularizes the primary/secondary cause schema within evangelical engagement with science.
 - Clarifies "accommodation" as a biblical hermeneutical principle with implications for Scripture-science conflict.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among later conservative scholars who sought a principled theistic-evolutionary stance (e.g., select 20th-century evangelical scientists and theologians).
 - Criticized by fundamentalists for perceived concession to Darwin; later eclipsed in some circles by stricter creationist movements, but continues to inform moderate conservative approaches.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact theological template for reconciling classical theism with evolutionary biology.
 - Remains a key historical exemplar of confessional engagement with modern science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theistic evolution**
 - Evolutionary processes accepted as God's ordained secondary causes for biological diversity.
- **Evolution (scientific) vs. Evolutionism (philosophical)**
 - Scientific = empirical hypothesis; Philosophical = metaphysical naturalism denying divine agency.
- **Primary cause**
 - God as the ultimate agent sustaining and ordering creation.
- **Secondary causes**
 - Natural laws and processes through which God ordinarily acts (e.g., natural selection).
- **Accommodation**
 - Calvinian principle that Scripture condescends to human understanding; basis for non-literal readings where appropriate.
- **Hermeneutical intent**
 - Distinguishes authorial purpose (theological/moral) from incidental scientific detail.
- **Inspiration / scope of Scripture**
 - Scripture's authority affirmed for faith and practice; not a repository of scientific minutiae.
- **Phenomenal language**
 - Use of everyday language in Scripture not intended to teach technical cosmology.
- **Providence**
 - Divine governance compatible with operation of natural laws.
- **Special creation**
 - Warfield nuanced: affirms divine origin of creation while allowing God's method to include natural processes.
- **Teleology**
 - Maintains purposive direction under God despite mechanistic explanations in science.
- **Genesis 1**
 - Read as theological proclamation of God's sovereignty rather than a technical natural-history account.
- **Genesis 11**
 - Engages genealogical/historical claims critically with regard to historiographical intention.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing theistic evolution from metaphysical evolutionism in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against atheistic readings of Darwin and against simplistic literalism in biblical interpretation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis with attention to authorial intent and accommodation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in doctrine of providence to integrate natural laws with divine causality.
