### TITLE
Commentary on the Psalms (Author: Unknown) - Anonymous patristic/medieval commentary emphasizing Christological, Trinitarian and devotional reading of the Psalter.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Anonymous work preserved in medieval manuscript traditions; style and theological presuppositions place it within the late patristic to early medieval milieu (4th-9th c.). Combines patristic sources (e.g., Origenic allegory, Augustinian pastoral tone) with a liturgical/devotional use.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Psalter is a unified locus of divine self-revelation that is properly read as Christological prophecy and Spirit-animated prayer; Scripture accommodates divine transcendence by employing human language and typological figures so that God is both knowable and supremely other.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Sequential psalm-by-psalm exegesis with alternating emphases:
 - **Historical-literal foundation**: initial sense grounded in Davidic or cultic setting.
 - **Typological/Christological fulfillment**: primary theological reading interprets persons, events, and motifs as foreshadowing Christ and the Church.
 - **Pneumatic application**: the Holy Spirit as active interpreter and inspirer-psalms function as instruments of sanctification.
 - **Devotional-liturgy**: application to prayer and corporate worship.
 - Hermeneutical principle: **accommodation + incarnational analogy** - God condescends linguistically and structurally (types) as God condescended in the Incarnation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit dialogue with Origen (allegory and typology), Augustine (God's knowability, internal witness), Jerome and later monastic exegesis; counters purely historical-critical or strictly allegorical readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (Scripture as God's self-disclosure by accommodation)
 - **Christology** (Messianic fulfillment of typological nodes in Psalms)
 - **Trinity** (person and deity of the Holy Spirit; Spirit as speaker and sanctifier in psalms)
 - **Knowledge of God** (existence and knowability via accommodated revelation)
 - **Typology and fulfillment** (OT/NT continuity)
- **Site usage - explicit topical references**
 - Person And Deity Of The Holy Spirit: treats psalms where the Spirit is named or implied as divine agent of prophecy and prayer.
 - Existence And Knowability Of God: uses psalms as demonstration that God can be known through accommodated speech and covenant revelation.
 - Christ In OT And NT: reads messianic psalms as prophecy fulfilled in Christ.
 - Typology And Fulfillment: develops a rule for types - historical event + divine intention + eschatological fulfillment in Christ/Church.
 - Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy: advances the analogy between Scripture's accommodation and the Incarnation as hermeneutical principle.
- **Closing line**
 - The anonymous Commentary locates the Psalter at the intersection of Trinitarian revelation, Christ-centered typology, and Spirit-wrought devotion: Scripture speaks humanly so that God may be truly known and God incarnately fulfilled.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presents **incarnational analogy** as primary hermeneutic: just as the Word became flesh, revelation becomes "human" in language and type.
 - Strong pneumatological reading: the Spirit is both the Psalmist's inspirer and the Church's interpreter; psalms are presented as Spirit-formed speech.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Balances Origenic allegory with historical sense; resists allegory that detaches types from their canonical-literal anchors.
 - Distinguishes itself from later rationalist readings by insisting on theological rather than merely moral or historical ends.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes "accommodation + typology" into an integrated exegetical rule: accommodation justifies anthropomorphic and cultic language; typology secures fulfillment in Christ.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Used in medieval monastic exegesis and devotional lectionaries; indirectly shaped later patristic citations in Eastern and Western traditions. Attracts Reformation and post-Reformation interest for its typological readings, though often reinterpreted.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact model for reading Psalms as simultaneously prophetic, liturgical, and pneumatic - valuable for homiletics, sacramental theology, and Trinitarian readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psalter** - canonical collection read as theological unity and liturgical manual.
- **Accommodation** - God's condescending use of human words and cultural forms to communicate truth.
- **Incarnational analogy** - the thesis that Scripture's accommodation mirrors the Incarnation; central hermeneutical principle.
- **Typology** - historical persons/events as divinely intended foreshadowings fulfilled in Christ or the Church.
 - Contrast: typology is anchored to history (not free allegory).
- **Messianic Psalm** - any psalm read as predicting or prefiguring Christ's person and work.
- **Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit** - psalms depict the Spirit as speaker, inspirer, and divine agent; used to argue pneumatological personhood and deity.
- **Existence and Knowability of God** - psalms as experiential and propositional evidence for God's existence and knowability through revelation.
- **Revelation** - Scripture as God's self-disclosure mediated by accommodation and Spirit.
- **Christ in OT and NT** - hermeneutic principle that OT texts, especially psalms, find their proper telos in Christ's person and work.
- **Typology and Fulfillment** - doctrine that OT types reach eschatological completion in NT realities.
- **Exegesis (historical-literal + spiritual)** - dual-move method: secure literal sense, then articulate theological/spiritual fulfillment.
- **Liturgical/Devotional Use** - psalms function as instruments of sanctification and congregational prayer.
- **Hermeneutical Rule** - explicit guide: literal-historical -> typological-fulfillment -> pneumatic application.
- **Canonically governed reading** - readings must be shaped by the canonical place of Psalms within Scripture and Trinitarian confession.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the incarnational-accommodation model of revelation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating historical sense, typology, and pneumatology in psalm interpretation.
 - As a **polemic tool** against purely literalist or purely allegorical readings by insisting on a mediated, Christ-centered canonical approach.
