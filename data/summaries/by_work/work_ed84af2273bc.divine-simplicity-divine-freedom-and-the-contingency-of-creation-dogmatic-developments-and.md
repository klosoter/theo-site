### TITLE
**Divine Simplicity, Divine Freedom, and the Contingency of Creation: Dogmatic Developments and the Legacy of Reformed Orthodoxy** - Richard A. Muller (Calvin Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Scholarly retrieval of seventeenth-century Reformed orthodoxy within the larger post-Reformation scholastic milieu. Engages the scholastic toolkit as it was taken up by Reformed theologians to solve tensions between classical metaphysics (simplicity) and concerns about God's freedom and creatorial contingency.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reformed orthodox theologians preserved classical **divine simplicity** while developing technical distinctions (notably **absolute** vs **relative** attributes and concepts of divine power) that allowed them to account for God's **freedom** and the genuine contingency of creation without collapsing into atheistic or determinist implications.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of medieval and Reformation antecedents that defined the conceptual resources (simplicity, distinctions of attributes, notions of divine power).
 - Close reading of representative Reformed orthodox sources showing:
 - how they *rejected* a real composition of divine essence (holding simplicity), yet
 - how they *employed* distinctions (logical, conceptual, modal) to predicate multiple attributes and to ground God's free choice.
 - Assessment of how these moves preserve both metaphysical unity and doctrinal commitments about divine freedom and creatorial contingency.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages scholastic background (Aquinas and medieval categories) and major Reformed orthodox figures as exemplars of the development (e.g., Polanus, Turretin, other confessional scholastics), with implicit contrast to modern critiques that either deny simplicity or over-intellectualize God's freedom.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (absolute and relative), divine simplicity, divine will and power (potentia absoluta / potentia ordinata), creation and contingency, and implicit issues in providence and decree.
- **Closing line**
 - Reformed orthodoxy sustained a robust synthesis: affirming **divine simplicity** while deploying careful conceptual distinctions to safeguard **divine freedom** and the genuine **contingency of creation**-a legacy of theological sophistication often overlooked in modern readings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes the *nuanced* scholastic methods within Reformed theology rather than caricatures of mechanistic determinism or metaphysical naivete.
 - Stresses the functional role of **distinguishing predicates** (how we speak of God) rather than positing ontological composition.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that claim Reformed orthodoxy either abandoned classical simplicity or else made God a deterministic cause of every event; shows they used categories (e.g., absolute/ordained power) to preserve contingency.
 - Distinguishes Reformed usage from Thomistic or late medieval accounts that might conflate real distinctions with simplicity-destroying compositions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies deployment of **absolute vs relative attributes** as operative tools for predication without postulating multiple principles in God.
 - Reframes potentia-absoluta / potentia-ordinata discussions as part of a coherent account of divine freedom compatible with simplicity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in modern historiography and constructive theology for rehabilitating the complexity of Reformed scholastic thought; used by scholars who seek to bridge historical theology and contemporary metaphysical debates about God's simplicity and freedom.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a tested historical model for reconciling classical metaphysical commitments with pastoral and confessional needs about God's choice and creatorial contingency; valuable for doctrinal reconstruction and teaching historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God's lack of real parts or composition; foundational metaphysical axiom in the account.
- **Divine Freedom**
 - The capacity of God to choose; here defended as compatible with simplicity.
- **Contingency of Creation**
 - The doctrine that creation is not metaphysically necessary; God could have refrained from creating.
- **Absolute Attributes**
 - Attributes predicated of God insofar as they flow from His essence (emphasized as intrinsic and non-relational).
- **Relative Attributes**
 - Attributes predicated in relation to creatures or acts (e.g., Creator, Redeemer); allow predication without implying multiplicity in God.
- **Real Distinction vs Logical Distinction**
 - Reformed orthodoxy favors **logical/conceptual distinctions** among attributes, avoiding a real, composition-implying distinction within God.
- **Potentia Absoluta**
 - God's absolute power - what God could do in principle (supports divine freedom).
- **Potentia Ordinata**
 - God's ordained power - what God has chosen to do under ordained law or decree (grounds providential order).
- **Predicative Language**
 - How theological language functions to speak of one simple God across multiple attributes.
- **Reformed Orthodoxy / Confessional Scholasticism**
 - The historical-theological framework Muller's study rehabilitates and analyzes.
- **Decree / Will (Divine)**
 - Discussed as compatible with simplicity: decrees are acts of the one will without implying parts in God.
- **Sovereignty vs Contingency**
 - The balance Reformed orthodox theology sought to maintain; sovereignty does not entail metaphysical necessity of creation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for historiography of Reformed doctrine on attributes and power.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates seeking models that reconcile divine simplicity with freedom and contingency.
- As a **polemic resource** against simplistic modern readings that either abandon simplicity or make God deterministically efficient.
