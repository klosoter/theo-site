### TITLE
The Foundation of Augustinian-Calvinism - Ken Wilson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed theological project situating classical Calvinism within its historical root in Augustine; aimed at seminary students and pastors engaged in debates with Arminian, Molinist, and neo-Pelagian currents. Moves across historical-theological exegesis and doctrinal synthesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Calvinism properly understood is an organic development of Augustine's doctrine of sin, grace, and providence; the chief problem addressed is how divine sovereignty and human responsibility cohere in salvation without collapsing into fatalism or Pelagianism.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Stage 1: Diagnosis - Augustine's confrontation with Pelagian anthropology establishes human will as incapacitated by sin (scriptural and pastoral evidence marshalled).
 - Stage 2: Solution - Augustine's doctrine of grace (effectual, gratuitous, sovereign) as the only coherent response; rejection of semi-Pelagian mitigations.
 - Stage 3: Reception - Calvin assimilates Augustine, systematizing soteriology and covenantal contours; Wilson traces terminological and theological continuity (not mere citation).
 - Stage 4: Application - Implications for ecclesiology, sacramentology, pastoral care, and apologetics vs. modern libertarian accounts of freedom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary: Augustine (Confessions, On Grace and Free Will, On the Predestination of the Saints), John Calvin (Institutes, Commentaries).
 - Secondary/interlocutors: Pelagius, Semi-Pelagians, Arminius, Erasmus, later Reformed figures (e.g., Beza, Turretin), contemporary critics (Molinists, compatibilist debates).
- **Doctrines treated:** Sin and human nature (original sin, depravity), grace (prevenient vs efficacious), predestination and reprobation, justification (forensic justification), union with Christ, covenant theology (covenant of works/grace), freedom and the will, providence, pastoral theology.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Wilson contends that the heart of Augustinian-Calvinism is the insistence that salvation is initiated, executed, and secured by God's free decrees and efficacious grace while Scripture's moral demands remain binding - a synthesis that preserves divine glory and human culpability without equivocation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong recovery of Augustine as the *substantive* theological foundation for Calvin rather than an occasional source; emphasizes Augustine's pastoral context as shaping doctrinal priority.
 - Presents effectual grace as the normative interpretive key for Pauline soteriology, not merely one theological option.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against portrayals of Augustinian-Calvinism as mechanical determinism; reframes the tradition in terms of relational union with Christ and covenantal fidelity.
 - Critiques semi-Pelagian and Arminian mitigations for conflating moral responsibility with meritorious capacity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Introduces a working distinction between **foundational sovereignty** (God's priority in salvation) and **functional responsibility** (human moral accountability) to avoid binary traps.
 - Recasts "irresistible grace" language to emphasize God's transforming work of the will rather than coercive metaphors.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Useful in conservative Reformed seminaries as a clarifying primer tying patristic and Reformation traditions; cited in recent debates on Calvinist identity and pastoral practice.
 - Limited traction outside confessional Reformed circles but respected for careful historical argumentation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact bridge between patristic theology and Reformed systematic theology; valuable for courses on soteriology, history of doctrine, and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination:** Divine eternal decree electing some to salvation; treated as logically prior to any human response.
- **Reprobation:** Complementary decree concerning those not elected; discussed with moral and pastoral sensitivity.
- **Original sin (total depravity):** Human will radically affected by Adam's fall, incapable of seeking God unaided.
- **Grace (efficacious vs prevenient):**
 - **Efficacious grace:** Grace that actually accomplishes what it intends (Wilson argues Augustine/Calvin endorse this).
 - **Prevenient (weak) grace:** Early grace-terminology critiqued as insufficient to secure conversion in Augustinian reading.
- **Bondage of the will:** Augustinian account of will enslaved to sin until liberated by divine action.
- **Irresistible grace (persuasive reformulation):** God's renewing action that reliably results in repentance and faith; Wilson softens coercive imagery.
- **Forensic justification:** Declarative act of God accounting righteousness to believers; central to Calvin's legal soteriology.
- **Union with Christ:** Ontological and covenantal bond making elect participation in Christ's benefits effective.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** Structural scheme for understanding covenantal historiography and soteriology.
- **Divine sovereignty vs human responsibility:** Wilson's foundational/function distinction mediates traditional tensions.
- **Compatibilism:** Philosophical-theological stance that human freedom and divine determinative causality are compatible; favored framework.
- **Common grace:** Non-saving blessings restrained by providence; distinguishes from saving efficacious grace.
- **Pastoral theology:** Practical outworking of doctrine in preaching, assurance, and discipline.
- **Historical continuity:** The claim that Augustine is the decisive antecedent to Calvin, not a later scholastic development.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Augustinian roots of Reformed soteriology in courses and syllabi.
 - As a **polemic tool** against Arminian and semi-Pelagian readings of grace and human will.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Ephesians) through an Augustinian-Calvinist lens.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in covenant theology discussions tying anthropology to ecclesial practice.
