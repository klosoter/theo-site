### TITLE
**James Bannerman - The Westminster Confession of Faith (exposition and commentary)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th-century Scottish context (Free Church tradition emerging from the Disruption), within a revival of confessional Reformed theology and ecclesiastical controversy over state interference, episcopal claims, and Catholic-Protestant polemics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To expound, defend, and apply the Westminster Confession as the coherent theological and ecclesiastical standard for Reformed churches, especially on the nature, unity, and governance of the Church epitomized in the article on the **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church**.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical foundation: situates the Confession within the Westminster Assembly and Reformed tradition to show continuity with Scripture and early Reformation theology.
 - Doctrinal exegesis: clause-by-clause exposition of key chapters emphasizing Scripture's authority, covenant theology, and ecclesiology.
 - Polemic and pastoral application: refutes Roman Catholic claims (papal jurisdiction, sacramentalism) and Erastian/state encroachment; applies confessional principles to 19th-century church life, discipline, and ministry.
 - Ecclesiological synthesis: argues for a single visible church defined by true preaching, sacraments rightly administered, and lawful discipline - the marks that instantiate the *One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church* in the Reformed idiom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Westminster divines (historical commission and writers), Calvin and Reformed scholastics, Anglican and Roman Catholic opponents, contemporary Scottish ecclesial actors and legal-political controversies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, covenant theology, Trinity and Christology (as background), justification, predestination, sacramental theology (baptism, Lord's Supper), church (visible/invisible), ministry and ordination, discipline, and worship.
- **Closing line:** Bannerman reads the Westminster Confession as the faithful theological map whereby the Church, under Christ, is preserved in unity, truth, and covenant life against both clerical absolutism and state domination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the *catholicity* of the Reformed church: catholic not as Roman institutional identity but as universal fidelity to apostolic truth and sacraments.
 - Balanced account of visible and invisible church: visible unity grounded in objective marks (preaching, sacraments, discipline) rather than mere institutional or bureaucratic unity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Opposes Roman Catholicism by denying papal infallibility and exclusive jurisdiction; opposes Erastianism by defending ecclesiastical independence from civil magistracy.
 - Corrects overly voluntaristic understandings of church membership by appealing to covenant and corporate identity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rearticulates "marks of the church" in distinctly confessional language for modern ecclesial disputes; integrates Westminster formulations with pastoral concerns about congregational life and discipline.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Free Church and broader Presbyterian theology as an exemplar of confessional exposition; used as a pastoral-theological handbook for church courts and seminary instruction.
 - Cited in later debates on confessional subscription, church-state relations, and sacramental practice.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of historical-theological exegesis of a confession; valuable for seminarians studying Reformed ecclesiology, church polity, and confessional hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church:** Bannerman reads this as the universal church's unity in truth and sacramental life under Christ, not as Roman institutional identity.
- **Visible church:** The external, observable body marked by right preaching, sacraments, and discipline.
- **Invisible church:** The spiritual company of the elect known fully only to God.
- **Marks of the church:** Preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and exercising of church discipline - the objective criteria for identifying the true church.
- **Catholicity (Reformed sense):** Universality grounded in apostolic doctrine and sacramental continuity, not in Roman jurisdiction.
- **Confessional standard / subordinate standard:** The Confession as a subordinate norm to Scripture, binding in doctrine and ecclesiastical practice within Presbyterianism.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Scripture as the supreme rule for church doctrine and government; the Confession explicates but does not supersede Scripture.
- **Covenant theology:** Framework for corporate identity, sacraments, and continuity between Testaments - key to understanding baptism and membership.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** Means of grace instituted by Christ; correctly administered in the visible church and interpreted sacramentally but not meritoriously.
- **Church discipline:** Essential for preserving purity and mark of the church; safeguards doctrine and moral life against corruption.
- **Ministry / Ordination:** Ordered ministry with elders and ministers as means for preserving doctrine and administering sacraments; office distinct from papal or state offices.
- **Erastianism:** State control of church affairs - Bannerman's polemical foil advocating ecclesiastical independence.
- **Confession as hermeneutical lens:** The Confession interprets contested biblical texts for doctrine and polity.
- **Unity (organic vs. institutional):** Bannerman stresses organic unity in truth and communion over mere institutional consolidation.
