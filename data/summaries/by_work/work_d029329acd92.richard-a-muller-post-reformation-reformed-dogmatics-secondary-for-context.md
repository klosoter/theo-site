### TITLE
Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for context)
- Reference points used here: **Sanctification: Definitive and Progressive** (PRRD, treatment of soteriology/covenant union) and **Atonement: Necessity, Extent, and Theories** (PRRD, treatment of Christology/soteriology).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Scholarly, late 20th/early 21st-century project recovering and reinterpreting 16th-18th century Reformed scholastic theology.
 - A corrective to caricatures of Reformed orthodoxy as dry scholasticism; situates doctrine within confessional, pastoral, exegetical, and polemical contexts.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reformed orthodoxy is historically coherent and theologically nuanced; doctrines commonly reduced in modern summaries (e.g., "limited atonement", sanctification) must be recovered in their historical categories and argumentative contexts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological method: careful reading of primary sources, doctrinal loci, and the controversies that shaped formulations.
 - Major moves:
 - Reconstruct the conceptual vocabulary of post-Reformation Reformed theologians.
 - Distinguish forensic/legal categories from mystical/participatory ones (e.g., justification vs union with Christ).
 - Trace development and diversity within Reformed thought on atonement and sanctification, showing both consensus and legitimate disagreements.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with Reformed scholastics (e.g., Cocceius, Voetius, Turretin), earlier Reformers (Calvin, Bucer), and intermediate figures (Amyraut, the Remonstrants as foil).
 - Dialogue with modern interpreters of Calvinism and with historians of doctrine.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (union with Christ, justification, sanctification), atonement (necessity, extent, theories), covenant theology, Christology (active/passive obedience), justification forensic categories, pneumatology as related to progressive sanctification.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Muller's central claim: Reformed dogmatics as developed after the Reformation is best understood as a coherent, nuanced system that balances forensic/definitive formulations with experiential/participatory claims-especially visible in treatments of atonement and sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence on recovering historical categories and technical vocabulary rather than imposing modern heuristics.
 - Emphasis on the interplay between forensic (positional) and transformative (progressive) elements in Reformed soteriology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges simplistic presentations of "limited atonement" and shows the breadth of Reformed positions (e.g., Amyraldian adjustments, federalist formulations).
 - Rectifies modern reductions that pit scholastic precision against Calvinist pastoral piety.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates terms such as "definitive sanctification" and "union with Christ" as central organizing categories rather than peripheral jargon.
 - Clarifies the distinction between Christ's active and passive obedience in connection with necessity and extent of the atonement.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed historical theology; used as a primary reference for seminars and doctoral work.
 - Influenced contemporary debates on atonement extent, the role of scholasticism in Reformed theology, and the theology/praxis interface.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides dense, source-rich reconstructions that function both as a historiographical corrective and as a theological resource for nuanced doctrinal recovery.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definitive sanctification**
 - Positional holiness granted in union with Christ; forensic and covenantal designation of believers as sanctified.
- **Progressive sanctification**
 - Ongoing internal renewal (mortification and vivification) by the Spirit; ethical and experiential outworking of definitive sanctification.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central nexus for justification, sanctification, and adoption; source of imputation and sanctifying life.
- **Active and passive obedience**
 - Active: Christ's fulfilling of the law; Passive: Christ's suffering and death. Both are treated as necessary for satisfaction and justification.
- **Necessity of the atonement**
 - Discussed as necessary within divine economy for reconciling justice and mercy; Muller's history shows varied emphases on metaphysical vs legal necessity.
- **Extent of the atonement / definite vs limited atonement**
 - Historical nuance: Reformed authors articulated "particular" or "definite" atonement but with terminological and theological diversity (Amyraldian deviations noted).
- **Penal substitution / satisfaction theories**
 - Muller's account situates penal imagery within broader satisfaction and covenantal frameworks rather than reducing Reformed thought to a single mechanical model.
- **Federal headship / covenantal representation**
 - Adam and Christ as covenant heads; key to understanding imputation of sin and righteousness.
- **Imputation (of sin and righteousness)**
 - Forensic transfer rooted in covenantal and representative structures; linked to justification and to debates over sanctification.
- **Mortification and vivification**
 - Terms capturing the negative and positive movements in progressive sanctification rooted in Spirit-work and union.
- **Amyraldianism**
 - Historical position that modifies extent and order of decree and atonement; used as a touchstone for intra-Reformed debate.
- **Forensic justification**
 - Legal declaration distinct from sanctifying reality yet inseparable in the believer's status and life.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **historical-theological definition source** for careful use of Reformed technical vocabulary.
 - As a **polemic and corrective** against modern caricatures of Calvinism (esp. on atonement and sanctification).
 - As an **exegetical-model resource** showing how doctrinal loci emerge from Scripture reading shaped by covenantal categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary soteriological debates, supplying nuanced alternatives to reductive formulations.
