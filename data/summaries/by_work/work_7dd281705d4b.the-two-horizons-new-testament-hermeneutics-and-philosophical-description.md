### TITLE
The Two Horizons: New Testament Hermeneutics and Philosophical Description - Anthony C. Thiselton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** First published in 1980 (subsequent expanded editions); arises within late 20th-century evangelical scholarship wrestling with historical-critical method, linguistic philosophy, and continental hermeneutics. Thiselton writes as a New Testament scholar conversant with Gadamer, Ricoeur, Austin/Searle and contemporary analytic philosophy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Hermeneutical understanding of the New Testament requires bridging two horizons - the historical horizon of the text and the contemporary horizon of the reader - through disciplined philosophical description and a theological/pneumatological appropriation that secures revelation and authority.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Critique of naive historicism and naive literalism: neither exhaustive historical reconstruction nor uncritical reception suffices.
 - Adoption of philosophical hermeneutics and speech-act theory to describe how texts function as communicative acts with illocutionary force.
 - Elaboration of how understanding is formed in a communal, linguistic, and historical nexus (the hermeneutical circle and fusion of horizons).
 - Theological reclamation: the Holy Spirit as decisive in revelation/illumination, enabling the Scripture to be performatively authoritative and not merely historically informative.
 - Practical ramifications for exegesis, doctrine, ethics, and preaching.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Hans-Georg Gadamer (fusion of horizons), Paul Ricoeur (interpretation), J. L. Austin and John Searle (speech-act theory), Ludwig Wittgenstein (language games), critics of evangelical methods and traditional historical-critical scholars.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration, the role of the Holy Spirit (illumination and reception), Scripture authority, hermeneutical epistemology, community and ecclesiology, aspects of Christology implied by Scripture's performative speech.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Interpretation of Scripture is a disciplined fusion of historical-critical description and theological reception in which the Holy Spirit enables Scripture to be both historically intelligible and liturgically/ethically authoritative for the believing community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The metaphor of **two horizons** as a descriptive-normative device that integrates historical distance with contemporary appropriation.
 - Strong use of **speech-act theory** to account for the performative power of biblical texts (not merely propositional content).
 - Explicit insistence that hermeneutics must be both philosophically informed and theologically accountable - theology shapes criteria for understanding.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects historical-critical reductionism by refusing to separate meaning from performative force and ecclesial reception.
 - Distances itself from purely relativistic reader-response approaches by reasserting objective referentiality via historical exegesis and pneumatological guarantee.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic pairing of philosophical description and theological appropriation.
 - Operationalizing the "fusion of horizons" in practical exegesis and preaching.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Highly influential in evangelical and Reformed hermeneutical curricula; frequently cited as a model that integrates continental hermeneutics with conservative theological commitments.
 - Stimulated further work on pneumatological hermeneutics and on speech-act-inspired models of biblical authority.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a robust methodological framework for seminary courses in biblical interpretation.
 - Continues to serve as a bridge text for those seeking to bring contemporary philosophy into conversation with orthodox doctrines of revelation and Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Two horizons:** The historical horizon of the text and the contemporary horizon of the reader; understanding arises in their interaction.
- **Fusion of horizons:** The mediated convergence where past meaning and present questions meet; not erasure of historical distance but mutual enrichment.
- **Philosophical description:** Detailed analytic account of linguistic, cognitive, and social conditions of understanding before normative theological claims are applied.
- **Hermeneutical circle:** The iterative process where parts and whole inform one another; Thiselton emphasizes disciplined movement rather than vicious relativism.
- **Speech-act theory:** Scripture functions as performative language (illocutionary and perlocutionary effects), informing doctrine of authority and reception.
 - **Illocutionary force:** The text as doing something (commanding, promising, witnessing), not merely stating facts.
- **Pneumatological illumination:** The role of the Holy Spirit in enabling the church to hear, trust, and be transformed by Scripture; the Spirit is the theological guarantor of appropriation.
- **Historical-critical description:** Necessary analytic reconstruction of authorial intent and context as prerequisite for responsible interpretation.
- **Objective/subjective poles:** Balance between objective referential content and the subjective horizons of readers - Thiselton defends a responsible middle way.
- **Normative appropriation:** The process by which understanding becomes theological conviction and ecclesial practice under the Spirit.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Reconceived in light of performative speech-acts and Spirit-enabled reception rather than mere propositional inerrancy.
- **Communal hermeneutics:** Emphasis on the church as the interpretive community where Scripture is heard and acted upon.
- **Ethical-linguistic nexus:** How textual meaning translates into moral and communal formation through speech-act consequences.
- **Disciplined description vs. theological appropriation:** Two stages - first map the conditions of meaning, then acknowledge theological claims (including pneumatology) that authorize reception.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for integrating philosophical hermeneutics into biblical studies.
- As a **polemical corrective** against both historical reductionism and subjective relativism.
- As an **exegetical model** that justifies using speech-act theory and communal reception in preaching and doctrine.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for pneumatological approaches to illumination and ecclesial interpretation.
