### TITLE
**Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism - Sinclair B. Ferguson (chapter in Reformation Worship, ed. Gibson & Earngey)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed engagement with historical soteriology and its implications for worship practice; contribution to an edited volume focused on Reformation patterns of worship and doctrine.
 - Ferguson writes from a conservative Reformed/Augustinian perspective, addressing both historical theology and contemporary pastoral concerns.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The decisive theological and pastoral importance of accepting an Augustinian understanding of sin and grace: refusal of Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian tendencies that make human will the initiating cause of salvation.
 - Implication: correct doctrine of grace shapes worship, sacraments, preaching, and pastoral practice.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Define Pelagianism and Semi‑Pelagianism clearly and show their respective diagnostic errors regarding human nature and the initiation of salvation.
 - Present Augustine's corrective: human bondage to sin, divine initiative in regeneration, and the necessity of prevenient (sovereign) grace.
 - Connect Augustinian soteriology to worship: how a doctrine of grace informs the content and posture of congregational worship, the sacraments, and preaching.
 - Counter contemporary softening of Augustinian claims (quiet synergism, moralistic rhetoric) with scriptural and historical evidence and pastoral consequences.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: Pelagius, semi‑Pelagian proponents (e.g., John Cassian as a reference point), Augustine.
 - Reformation interlocutors: Calvin and Luther as heirs of Augustinian emphases.
 - Modern interlocutors: broadly addresses contemporary theologians and pastors who drift toward semi‑Pelagian formulations (no exhaustive modern bibliography in the chapter, emphasis is doctrinal and pastoral).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin, human will and freedom, depravity and bondage of the will, grace (prevenient and efficacious), regeneration, justification by faith, sacraments as means of grace, the relation of doctrine to worship.

- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity**
 - Ferguson insists that **Augustinianism-God's sovereign initiating grace-is foundational for right worship and pastoral life; to dilute it is to undercut both biblical soteriology and the health of congregational practice.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong linkage of soteriology to worship practice: doctrine of grace is not abstract but determines how a congregation prays, sings, receives sacraments, and preaches.
 - Careful pastoral tone: shows consequences of doctrinal error for pastoral confidence and evangelism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Distinguishes sharply between Pelagian denial of original sin and semi‑Pelagian attempts to preserve human initiative; argues both ultimately undermine sola gratia.
 - Contrasts Augustinian monergism with modern "soft" synergisms that presume human ability to initiate conversion.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not novel in coinage, but clarifies and operationalizes terms (e.g., prevenient grace as truly sovereign, not merely enabling human decision).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical teaching as a succinct corrective to semi‑Pelagian drift; cited in pastoral and worship renewal contexts.
 - Valued for clarity and pedagogical utility rather than for groundbreaking historical revision.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Excellent compact resource for teaching the historical problem, the theological stakes, and the pastoral implications of doctrines of grace; useful in seminary and congregational education.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism**
 - Denies original sin's decisive impact; affirms human ability to choose God unaided; seen as the extreme denial of need for grace.

- **Semi‑Pelagianism**
 - Affirms human responsibility but locates initial move toward God in the fallen will; criticized for attributing the initiative to humans and thus undermining monergism.

- **Augustinianism**
 - Emphasis on human bondage to sin, divine initiative in regeneration, and God's sovereign, enabling, and effectual grace as the source of salvation.

- **Prevenient grace (as used)**
 - Grace that precedes and enables conversion; Ferguson insists on its sovereignty and efficacy (not merely neutral enablement).

- **Monergism**
 - Doctrine that God alone effects regeneration; central to Ferguson's corrective against semi‑Pelagian synergy.

- **Synergism**
 - The idea that human will cooperates in initiating salvation; treated as a theological error when it claims prior human initiative.

- **Total depravity / bondage of the will**
 - The condition that renders the fallen human will unable to rightly seek God without divine intervention.

- **Regeneration**
 - God's sovereign act that creates faith and spiritual life; distinguished from human decision.

- **Justification by faith**
 - Affirms that right standing before God is granted by grace and received through faith, not by initial human merit or decision.

- **Sacraments as means of grace**
 - Worship elements (e.g., baptism, Lord's Supper) presented as instruments by which divine grace works, not merely human responses.

- **Worship as dependent response**
 - Worship characterized as the creaturely response to God's initiating grace, not as the occasion for self‑generated spiritual ascent.

- **Pastoral confidence**
 - The pastoral implication that ministers preach and administer sacraments trusting God's sovereign work rather than human ability.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source:** Clear, concise definitions for Pelagian, semi‑Pelagian, and Augustinian positions in classroom and pulpit.
- **Polemic:** Employed in apologetic and polemical contexts to resist theological drift toward human‑initiated salvation.
- **Exegetical model / conceptual pivot:** Used as a theological lens for reading biblical texts on sin, grace, and conversion; serves as a pivot for choosing monergistic pastoral practices.
