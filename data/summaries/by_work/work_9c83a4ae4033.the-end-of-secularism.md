### TITLE
The End of Secularism - Hunter Baker

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / Publication Context:** 
 - Early 21st‑century Anglo‑American public theology and legal debate over religion in the public square. Engages the collapse of confidence in the classic secular public order amid culture‑war flashpoints (religious liberty suits, moral legislation debates, pluralism pressures).
 - Situated inside conservative Protestant legal and political thought with practical concern for litigation, institutions, and public policy.

- **Central Thesis / Doctrinal Problem:** 
 - Secularism as a governing public philosophy is no longer viable; its internal inconsistencies and the renewed visibility of religious commitment mean the real contest is over what will replace secular neutrality - not whether religion will reappear in public life.
 - The doctrinal problem: how Christian truth‑claims and ecclesial identity may rightly shape public life without surrendering religious liberty or succumbing to secular privatization.

- **Core Argument / Structure (major moves):**
 - Diagnosis: surveys intellectual, legal, and cultural strains that undermine secularist assumptions of neutrality and privatization of religion.
 - Critique: exposits philosophical roots of secularism (liberal neutrality, public reason) and shows their practical failure and coercive tendencies.
 - Positive proposal: sketches a public theology and civic posture that reclaims Christian moral reason (often via natural law and historical Christian polity resources) while defending conscience and institutional pluralism.
 - Practical implications: strategy for litigation, civic formation, church engagement, and policy advocacy to shape institutions post‑secularism.

- **Figures / Sources / Interlocutors Engaged:** 
 - Critical engagement with modern secular theorists and liberal political philosophy (public reason and neutrality), plus legal precedents and culture‑war commentators. Appeals to historical Christian thinkers as corrective resources (classical natural law and confessional Protestant traditions).

- **Doctrines Treated:** 
 - **Revelation and natural theology:** role of divine law and moral reason in public argument. 
 - **Law and political theology:** sovereignty, legitimacy of civil magistrate, and limits of state neutrality. 
 - **Ecclesiology:** public role of the church and institutional formation. 
 - **Religious liberty and conscience:** robust defense of freedom for public witness.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - The work centers on reclaiming a Christ‑shaped public reason that resists secular privatization and affirms the church's vocation to shape civic orders through truth, conscience, and institutions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:** 
 - Treats the decline of secularism as an opportunity rather than merely a threat - reframes the conversation from defense of privilege to constructive public theology and institutional engagement. 
 - Stresses the institutional and legal tactics necessary for theological claims to bear civic fruit, not merely rhetorical apologetics.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals:** 
 - Rejects naïve secular neutrality (Rawlsian-style public reason) as both impossible and coercive; argues that pretending neutrality masks substantive moral commitments and often silences religious speech. 
 - Contrasts with accommodationist models that confine religion to private conscience; instead advocates for principled public witness grounded in historic Christian moral resources.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Popularizes the phrase **"end of secularism"** as descriptive and prescriptive - a diagnostic term for a transition and a rallying concept for public theological strategy.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Resonated in conservative Reformed and evangelical legal and political circles as a manifesto for renewed public engagement. Influential for activists, pastors, and Christian legal scholars seeking alternatives to secular accommodation. Less persuasive to secular liberal and pluralist theorists.

- **Enduring value:** 
 - Provides a compact, practice‑oriented model linking theology to law and civic strategy; valuable for teaching public theology, ecclesiology in a plural society, and the theology of religious liberty.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Secularism:** the political and cultural stance separating religion from public authority; diagnosed as declining and morally incoherent. 
- **End of secularism:** Baker's central phrase indicating a political‑cultural transition and an opportunity for public theology. 
- **Public reason (critique):** the liberal demand for justificatory neutrality; critiqued as inadequate and often hostile to substantive religious claims. 
- **Natural law:** invoked as the bridge between Christian moral truth and civic argumentation. 
- **Religious liberty:** framed as both protective right and means for robust public witness. 
- **Conscience:** emphasized as a moral locus that resists state coercion and grounds civil disobedience claims. 
- **Ecclesial formation / institutionalism:** language emphasizing churches and Christian institutions as formative forces for public life. 
- **Neutrality (state):** problematized - argued to be a myth or covert value choice rather than an objective stance. 
- **Public theology:** Baker's programmatic field for reconstructing Christian civic presence. 
- **Political theology:** analytic lens for diagnosing regimes and proposing alternatives rooted in doctrine and law. 
- **Practical legal strategy:** attention to litigation and policy as means to shape post‑secular public order. 
- **Moral argumentation:** insists on moral intelligibility grounded in theological anthropology.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **polemic** against liberal political neutrality and the privatization of religion. 
 - As a **practical manual** for Christian legal and civic engagement - used in courses and strategy circles on religious liberty and public theology. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and political theology debates about post‑secular public life.
