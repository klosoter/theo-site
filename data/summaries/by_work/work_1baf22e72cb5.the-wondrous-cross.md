### TITLE
The Wondrous Cross - Stephen R. Holmes

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Anglican-Reformed theological milieu (late 20th-early 21st century). Written for a readership bridging academic theology, preaching pastors, and informed laity interested in a robust, church-shaped reflection on the cross.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The cross is the central, multi-dimensional locus of Christian theology: it must be read simultaneously as divine judgment and divine love, as the decisive victory over evil and the sacrificial means of reconciliation; readers who reduce the cross to a single function impoverish Christian doctrine and practice.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Begins with a retrieval of the biblical and historical centrality of the cross in Christian worship and doctrine.
 - Surveys major atonement models (expiation/propitiation, penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral influence) and resists exclusive reduction to one account.
 - Reframes atonement within a Trinitarian and covenantal horizon so that Father, Son and Spirit coherently account for sending, accomplishing, and applying salvation.
 - Moves from doctrinal description to ecclesial and pastoral implications: preaching, sacraments, discipleship, and the ethics of cross-shaped living.
 - Concludes with practical theological applications for preaching Holy Week and for shaping congregational life around cross-centred worship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical and Protestant figures (Augustine, Anselm, Calvin), modern critics and constructive theologians (Anselmian and penal-substitution debates, Gustav Aulén, Karl Barth, contemporary evangelical scholarship), and biblical witness across Gospels and Pauline soteriology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (incarnation, obedience, sufferings), soteriology/atonement (expiation, propitiation, substitution, victory), Trinity (sending and application), sacramentology (Eucharist as cross-shaped remembrance), ecclesiology and discipleship (cruciform formation).
- **Closing line:** The cross, properly understood, is the Trinitarian centre that simultaneously reveals God's righteous judgment and reconciling love and thereby reshapes doctrine, worship and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the **multi-functionality** of the cross: refuses to prioritize a single theory of atonement and insists on their theological complementarity.
 - Reinforces a **Trinitarian reading** of atonement so that Father, Son and Spirit are not secondary addenda but constitutive to the meaning of the cross.
 - Connects atonement doctrine to **liturgical and pastoral praxis**, not merely abstract systematics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects pietistic or modern theological tendencies that sentimentalize the cross (moral-influence reduction) or that privatize atonement apart from cosmic victory (Christus Victor).
 - Offers a measured critique of unnuanced penal-substitutional defenses, pressing for careful biblical grounding while retaining its theological purchase.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses phrases like **"cross-shaped reading"** and **"multi-modal atonement hermeneutic"** to describe an integrative approach.
 - Emphasizes **soteriological reciprocity**-how divine initiative and human participation are held in tension without collapsing into works-righteousness.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed-Anglican circles for balancing confessional commitments with pastoral concern; used by preachers for Holy Week formation.
 - Cited in broader evangelical and academic discussions as a corrective to both reductionist evangelical and overly metaphorical liberal accounts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact primer linking biblical exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral application; useful in seminary modules on atonement and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement:** Central theological category; treated as multi-faceted rather than monolithic.
- **Penal substitution:** Presented as biblically grounded but theologically contextualized; not the sole explanatory model.
- **Christus Victor:** Recuperated as an essential motif emphasizing cosmic defeat of evil.
- **Expiation / Propitiation:** Technical terms retained to articulate how sin is dealt with both legally and relationally.
- **Trinitarian atonement:** Framework insisting Father's sending, Son's accomplishing, Spirit's applying work together.
- **Cruciform discipleship:** Ethical outworking emphasizing imitation of Christ's self-giving in community.
- **Sacramental memory:** Eucharist and liturgy as primary loci where the cross is enacted and applied.
- **Narrative hermeneutic:** The cross interpreted within the gospel story, not isolated doctrinal speculation.
- **Soteriological reciprocity:** The interplay of divine initiative and human response in salvation.
- **Holy Week theology:** Practical, liturgical reading of the Passion narratives for preaching and formation.
- **Cosmic reconciliation:** The universal scope of Christ's victory against evil and death.
- **Moral influence (critique):** Treated as partial; useful but insufficient to account for biblical data.
- **Judgment and love (paired motif):** Persistent dialectic Holmes insists must be held together.
- **Pastoral hermeneutics:** Methodological note: doctrine aimed at the church's life, not merely academy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for an integrative, Trinitarian understanding of atonement in seminary courses.
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductionist atonement theories without rejecting their legitimate insights.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching Holy Week and shaping Eucharistic theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions linking doctrine and discipleship (cruciform ethics).
