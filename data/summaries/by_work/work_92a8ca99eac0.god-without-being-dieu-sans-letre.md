### TITLE
God Without Being (Dieu sans l'etre) - Jean‑Luc Marion

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th‑century continental theology and phenomenology (French context). Original French publication early 1980s; English availability widened in subsequent decades. Emerges amid debates over Heideggerian ontology, Husserlian phenomenology, and a renewed interest in apophatic theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must renounce classical onto‑theology that treats God as a highest being; instead God must be understood as the *excessive giver* who appears without being reducible to Being. Epistemologically: knowledge of God is not mastery by predication but reception of an overwhelming gift.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of onto‑theology: modern metaphysics and even some theology posit God as the supreme "being" (the highest ens), which reduces God to an object of ontology.
 - Reformulation of phenomenology: Marion redirects phenomenology from intentionality-to-object toward a phenomenology of *givenness* - how phenomena present themselves by giving rather than by being intended.
 - Introduction of the "saturated phenomenon": some phenomena (most centrally, God, but also love, the face, history) exceed the capacity of our concepts and intentions; they give more than can be retained or circumscribed.
 - Theological consequence: God is encountered as a saturated phenomenon - a gift that resists being subsumed under ontological predicates; revelation is an event of giving, not a disclosure of divine being.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Heidegger (onto‑theology critique), Husserl (phenomenology), Kant (limits of reason), Aquinas and classical metaphysics, Levinas (the face and ethical demand), Augustine and patristic/apophatic traditions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, negative (apophatic) theology, epistemology of God‑knowledge, the nature of the divine manifestation (theophany), and implicitly trinitarian language insofar as gift and giving gesture toward relation.
- **Closing line**
 - Theology must begin from the event of God's self‑giving - an excess that resists ontological capture - so that knowing God becomes receptive witness to a saturated, apophatic revelation rather than the projection of being.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places *givenness* (donation) at the center of theological epistemology; prioritizes the phenomenological category of the saturated phenomenon as theological method.
 - Moves from "God is" to "God gives" - a shift from metaphysical predicate to eventive relation.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects Heideggerian and classical metaphysical tendencies by arguing that reducing God to Being is idolatrous: it domesticates the divine within human conceptual limits.
 - Distinguishes his approach from simple existentialism or pure nihilism by insisting on the positive presence of gift without ontological committal.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Saturated phenomenon" - phenomenon whose intuition overflows conceptual determination.
 - Reworking of "givenness" as primary phenomenological datum for theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence in continental theology, contemporary French Catholic thought, and phenomenological approaches to religion; significant for scholars interested in apophatic theology and philosophy of religion.
 - More limited uptake in analytic or classical systematic circles, where ontology and propositional predication remain dominant.
- **Enduring value**
 - Heuristic for thinking revelation and religious experience beyond propositional metaphysics; a corrective to theological naturalism and to epistemologies that make God an inferable object.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Onto‑theology**
 - The fusion of ontology and theology that treats God as the highest being; Marion argues this is a category mistake when applied to the divine.
- **Givenness (donation)**
 - The phenomenological priority of being given to consciousness; for Marion, the primary mode of divine disclosure.
- **Saturated phenomenon**
 - Phenomenon that exceeds the intentional capacity of the subject; key example: God, but also love, the face, historical events.
 - Contrast: ordinary phenomena fit intentional schemas; saturated ones overwhelm them.
- **Phenomenology of givenness**
 - Methodological stance: attend to what is given rather than impose predicates or reductionist accounts.
- **Apophatic / negative theology**
 - Marion revives apophaticism: when the divine is encountered, it cannot be fully named or assimilated by ontology.
- **Excess / overflow**
 - The characteristic of divine revelation: it gives more than the concept can hold.
- **Call / appeal**
 - The mode in which God solicits the subject; involves response rather than objectification.
- **Idolatry of being**
 - Marion's term for theological or philosophical practices that make an idol of ontological predication.
- **Phenomenon vs. object**
 - Shifts theological attention from objectified being to eventive manifestation.
- **Theophany**
 - Event of divine appearance understood through givenness, not ontic attribution.
- **Intention (phenomenological)**
 - Traditional intentionality reinterpreted: intention is often incapable of fully determining saturated phenomena.
- **Glory / donatio**
 - The theological categories Marion uses to express how God gives himself beyond being.
- **Receptivity**
 - The epistemic posture required to encounter saturated phenomena: passive‑active openness to gift.
- **Excessive appearing**
 - Synonym for saturated phenomenon; appearance that breaks conceptual limits.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in epistemology and theology to reframe knowledge of God from predication to reception.
- As a **polemic** against natural theology and onto‑theological reductions.
- As an **exegetical/heuristic model** for reading revelation, mysticism, and apophatic traditions.
