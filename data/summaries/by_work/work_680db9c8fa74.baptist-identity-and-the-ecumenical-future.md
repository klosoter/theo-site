### TITLE
**Baptist Identity and the Ecumenical Future - Steven R. Harmon**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th-century conversation: American and global Baptist encounter with the post-war ecumenical movement (World Council of Churches, national councils of churches) and growing interlocution between evangelicals and mainline Protestants.
 - Theological milieu: tensions between confessional particularism in many Baptist streams and the pressing institutional and missional questions raised by ecumenical collaboration.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can Baptists retain essential elements of their identity (believer's baptism, congregational polity, religious liberty conviction) while responsibly participating in an ecumenical future that seeks visible unity and cooperative mission?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: sketches the historical formation of Baptist distinctives and how they predispose Baptists toward both suspicion of centralized ecclesial authority and openness to voluntary partnerships.
 - Theological reframing: argues for a model of Baptist identity that is robustly particular (doctrinal and polity markers) yet hospitable to catholicity grounded in baptismal fellowship and common witness.
 - Practical proposals: offers principles for mutual recognition (especially of baptism), criteria for intercommunion and partnership, and frameworks for theological education that cultivate ecumenical competencies while preserving confessional integrity.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial implications: discusses implications for congregational decision-making, denominational cooperation, and mission strategy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogue partner: the wider ecumenical movement (institutional actors and ecumenical theology).
 - Internal interlocutors: conservative/particularist Baptists (including isolationist/landmark tendencies) and more ecumenically disposed Baptists.
 - Scripture, historical Baptist confessions, and contemporary ecumenical documents serve as primary source pools (treatment is theological-historical rather than distant dogmatic).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (visible vs. invisible church, markers of the church)
 - Sacramental theology (baptism as ordinance vs. sacrament; baptismal recognition)
 - Authority and Scripture (role in shaping identity and ecumenical judgments)
 - Polity and covenant (congregational autonomy, church covenant)
 - Mission and unity (relation of unity to witness)
- **Closing line**
 - Harmon locates the center of gravity in a **Baptist catholicity**: a self-aware particularity that sees its baptismal confession and congregational life as a contribution to, not an obstacle against, the church's ecumenical future.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses _baptismal fellowship_ as the decisive theological resource for Baptist engagement with the ecumenical movement rather than mere institutional compromise.
 - Recasts congregational autonomy as a locus of responsible discernment for ecumenical commitments, not automatic isolation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against two extremes:
 - Landmarkism/isolationism that treats other Christians as non-church.
 - Assimilative ecumenism that would subsume Baptist convictions for the sake of visible unity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the vocabulary of **Baptist catholicity** and **baptismal recognition** as key operational concepts for negotiating mutual belonging without doctrinal dilution.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but recurrently cited in Baptist seminary curricula and in denominational task forces on ecumenical relations.
 - Appreciated by ecumenical partners as a clear account that neither capitulates nor reflexively withdraws.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a pragmatic-theological bridge for Baptists trying to participate in ecumenical life: useful as a classroom text, a denominational policy guide, and a conciliatory argument in intra-Baptist debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptist identity** - composite of believer's baptism, congregational polity, religious liberty, and scriptural authority.
- **Baptist catholicity** - Harmon's key term for being authentically Baptist while recognizing belonging to the universal church.
- **Believer's baptism** - treated as central, both a marker of membership and the theological basis for mutual recognition across traditions.
- **Baptismal recognition** - criteria and procedures for accepting other traditions' baptisms without abandoning Baptist convictions.
- **Congregational polity** - reinterpreted as responsible discernment for ecumenical engagement rather than reflexive independence.
- **Visible vs. invisible church** - used diagnostically to balance doctrinal clarity with ecclesial humility in ecumenical contexts.
- **Sacrament/ordinance distinction** - Clarifies Baptist sacramental minimalism while allowing for meaningful shared rites.
- **Religious liberty** - maintained as both historical Baptist testimony and a theological principle shaping modes of ecumenical cooperation.
- **Ecumenical partnership** - practical categories for mission, ministry, and intercommunion governed by negotiated principles.
- **Theological humility** - a normative disposition recommended for ecumenical dialogue and mutual recognition.
- **Confessional minimalism** - avoiding exhaustive doctrinal tests as a way to enable partnership without capitulation.
- **Mutual recognition** - operational phrase for accepting other Christians as brothers and sisters for cooperative action.
- **Mission as unity's test** - the idea that cooperative witness provides pragmatic grounds for closer relationships.
- **Polity thresholds** - practical limits on how far congregational decisions can authorize intercommunion or union.
- **Receptive ecumenism (implicit)** - an orientation of learning from others that Harmon advocates implicitly through practice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "Baptist catholicity" and baptismal recognition in denominational statements.
 - As a **polemic** against isolationist/landmark positions while refusing wholesale assimilation.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** in seminary courses on ecclesiology and ecumenism, guiding policy formation on intercommunion and partnership.
