### TITLE
God, Freedom, and Evil (1974) - Alvin Plantinga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 1974 amid mid-20th-century analytic philosophy of religion. Reaction to J. L. Mackie and other proponents of the logical problem of evil. Helped revive serious analytic theodicy/defense work in anglophone theology and philosophy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The supposed *logical* inconsistency of (1) God is omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good; and (2) evil exists is refuted. Plantinga advances the *Free Will Defense*: it is logically possible that God could not create a world with free creatures who never choose evil.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies distinction: **defense** (showing consistency) vs **theodicy** (attempting to show God has morally sufficient reasons).
 - Formalizes the logical problem of evil and shows where the argument fails by introducing libertarian free will and **transworld depravity**:
 - If creatures have libertarian freedom, God cannot guarantee that every free creature always chooses rightly without removing freedom.
 - *Transworld depravity* = for some possible persons, in every feasible world in which they are free, they at least once choose wrongly; hence God cannot actualize a world with those persons free and morally perfect.
 - Uses modal language (possible worlds) to make the compatibility claim precise without claiming an actual theodicy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: J. L. Mackie and analytic opponents of theism; engages with classical Theism and emergent Molinist proposals; draws on modal logic and libertarian accounts of freedom.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence and divine foreknowledge are treated indirectly: foreknowledge does not negate libertarian freedom, so providential sovereignty can coexist with creaturely freedom.
 - Theodicy and divine justice: distinguishes juridical concerns from the logical coherence argument.
 - Implicitly touches on doctrines of creation and human agency; not a systematic treatment of Trinity or Christology.
- **Closing line**
 - The book's theological center of gravity: **God's omnipotence and goodness are logically compatible with the existence of evil provided creatures have genuine libertarian freedom; this blocks the logical problem without supplying a full theodicy.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Introduction and systematic use of **transworld depravity** and rigorous modal framing to dissolve the logical problem.
 - Strong insistence on distinguishing *logical* impossibility from *explanatory* insufficiency (i.e., defense vs theodicy).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct rebuttal of Mackie-style claims that evil renders theism logically incoherent.
 - Contra deterministic or compatibilist responses: Plantinga relies on libertarian freedom rather than compatibilist redefinitions of freedom.
 - Positions himself as an alternative to Molinist strategies while engaging with their vocabulary.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematized the Free Will Defense in modal/possible-worlds terms; coined and popularized **transworld depravity** as a theological-philosophical concept.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely regarded as the decisive refutation of the classical logical problem of evil in analytic philosophy of religion; sparked decades of literature on the evidential problem and on freedom and providence.
 - Influenced both Reformed and broader evangelical theologies; accepted as a standard text in graduate seminars on theodicy and analytic theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of clarity and method: separates logical coherence questions from evidential ones and supplies tools (modal analysis, freedom talk) that remain foundational for contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free Will Defense**
 - Plantinga's central move: freedom can make the coexistence of God and evil logically possible without providing reasons God might have for permitting evil.
- **Transworld Depravity**
 - For some possible persons, every world in which they are significantly free contains at least some morally bad choices.
- **Possible Worlds**
 - Modal framework used to show what God could or could not actualize given creaturely freedom.
- **Logical Problem of Evil**
 - The thesis Plantinga aims to refute: that God and evil are logically incompatible.
- **Evidential (or Probabilistic) Problem of Evil**
 - Distinct from the logical problem; Plantinga concedes this remains an open, empirical-theological challenge.
- **Defense vs Theodicy**
 - **Defense**: demonstrates logical possibility of God+evil; **Theodicy**: attempts to give morally sufficient reasons for God permitting evil.
- **Libertarian Free Will**
 - Non-deterministic account of freedom necessary for Plantinga's defense; creatures could do otherwise in genuinely open alternatives.
- **Divine Foreknowledge & Providence**
 - Treated so far as compatible with libertarian freedom; God's foreknowledge does not entail coercion or elimination of alternative possibilities.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism**
 - Plantinga engages Molinist vocabulary (counterfactuals of freedom) but ultimately emphasizes transworld depravity as showing limits to what God can actualize without violating freedom.
- **Divine Justice / Theodicy**
 - Plantinga's method: does not repair the evidential/theodical task but shows justice/evil debates cannot rest on logical impossibility.
- **Counterfactuals of Creaturely Freedom**
 - Concept relevant to Molinist responses; Plantinga interacts with it but uses his own modal resources.
- **Actualization of Worlds**
 - God's choice of a world constrained by libertarian freedom; explains why God might not actualize a world without moral evil.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the modern Free Will Defense and transworld depravity.
 - As a **polemic** that neutralizes classical logical objections to theism and reframes debates toward evidential/theodical questions.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in treatments of providence and divine foreknowledge, especially in discussions comparing classical theism, Molinism, and libertarian accounts of freedom.
