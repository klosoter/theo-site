### TITLE
**The Unfolding Mystery: Discovering Christ in the Old Testament** (1988), Edmund P. Clowney

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical Reformed resurgence in biblical theology and redemptive-historical preaching (Vosian stream at Westminster Seminary).
 - Responds to moralistic preaching, atomistic historical criticism, and rigid Israel-church disjunctions.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Old Testament, by God-given design, progressively reveals Christ through promises, covenants, symbols, and typological patterns that climax in Jesus and shape the church's identity.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Creation to Patriarchs:** Adam as protological type of Christ; Noah and re-creation; Abrahamic promise (seed, land, blessing) as gospel beforehand.
 - **Exodus and Sinai:** Passover-lamb and new exodus trajectory; Moses as mediator-prophet anticipating the greater Prophet.
 - **Conquest to Kingship:** Joshua as rest-bringer; judgeship exposes need for king; Davidic covenant and Son of David typology.
 - **Temple and Priesthood:** Tabernacle-temple as dwelling of God, fulfilled in Christ's person and church as temple.
 - **Wisdom and Writings:** Wisdom embodied in the Messiah; bridegroom-bride theme; suffering-righteous paradigm.
 - **Prophets and Exile:** Servant of the Lord, new covenant, Spirit outpouring, and eschatological kingdom realized in Christ.
 - **Reading strategy:** Christ-centered preaching through text-rooted typology, not free allegory; promise-fulfillment with eschatological escalation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Vos, Calvin, Bavinck, Ridderbos; engages dispensational readings and historical-critical skepticism; aligns with Reformed confessional hermeneutics.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and canon;** **covenant** (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New); **kingdom of God**; **Christology** (last Adam, Prophet-Priest-King); **ecclesiology** (one people of God); **sacramentology** patterns; **eschatology** (already-not yet).
- **Center of gravity**
 - Christ is the covenantal and kingdom center who gathers the one people of God through the promised, typologically prefigured redemption. [Christ In Ot And Nt]

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Pastoral, sermon-shaped biblical theology that insists every major OT locus bears a Christward trajectory when read canonically.
 - Typology governed by authorial and canonical control: repetition with escalation, offices united in Christ, and temple-presence climactic in him. [Typology And Fulfillment]
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against moralism: OT texts are not primarily character lessons but stages in redemption.
 - Against allegory: figures signify by covenantal patterns, not free associations.
 - Against hard Israel-church bifurcation: one covenantal people under the messianic kingdom, now constituted as the church. [Church And Kingdom]
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **unfolding mystery** to capture progressive revelation (Eph 3) with typological crescendo.
 - Emphasis on **new exodus**, **temple-presence**, and **eschatological rest** as structuring lines.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Formative for Reformed homiletics; foundational for later Christ-centered preaching (e.g., Greidanus, Keller; uptake alongside Goldsworthy).
 - Widely used in seminary curricula and pastor training; accessible gateway to Vosian biblical theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - A lucid template for moving from OT text to Christ without hermeneutical shortcuts; equips preachers and catechists to trace covenantal unity and kingdom fulfillment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-historical preaching**: Sermons trace God's saving acts culminating in Christ rather than isolate moral exempla.
- **Biblical theology**: Diachronic, covenantal reading that follows the canon's storyline from promise to fulfillment.
- **Typology**: God-ordained correspondences between persons/events/institutions and Christ, marked by repetition and escalation; distinct from allegory.
 - Contrast: **Allegory** reads behind or beneath the text; typology grows from textual and historical patterns.
- **Promise and fulfillment**: Prophetic-typological pledges realized in Jesus' person and work, with an already-not yet structure.
- **Covenant**: Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic converge in the New Covenant; unify Scripture's plot and people.
- **Kingdom of God**: God's reign mediated through his anointed; arrives in Christ and extends through the church's mission.
- **People of God**: One covenant family across epochs, reaching climactic form as Christ's church.
- **Temple-presence**: God dwelling with his people; fulfilled in Christ and the Spirit-indwelt church.
- **Prophet-Priest-King**: Threefold office concentrated in Jesus; OT figures adumbrate facets.
- **New exodus**: Deliverance motif from bondage to kingdom freedom, realized in Christ's cross and resurrection.
- **Son of David**: Messianic kingship fulfilling 2 Sam 7; frames gospel Christology.
- **Suffering Servant**: Vicarious suffering and vindication paradigm in Isaiah, realized in Jesus.
- **Last Adam**: Christ as head of a new humanity, restoring image, dominion, and rest.
- **Wisdom Christology**: Christ as wisdom of God; Proverbs and Job refracted through him.
- **Bridegroom-Bride**: Covenant love symbol fulfilled in Christ and the church.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source:** Clarifies typology vs allegory and promise-fulfillment.
 - **Exegetical model:** Guides sermon development from OT to Christ with covenantal controls.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Integrates kingdom and church within one redemptive storyline.
 - **Polemic aid:** Counters moralism and strict Israel-church dualism with canonical unity.
