### TITLE
**Communion with God (1657)** - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Mid-17th century English Reformed orthodoxy (post-Westminster, Cromwellian Interregnum). Pastoral-experiential Puritanism engaging Roman Catholic sacerdotalism, emergent Socinian anti-Trinitarianism, and radical sects (Quakers). Scholastic precision in service of devotional practice.
- **Central thesis:** Believers have **distinct, covenantal communion** with each divine Person in the one God: with the **Father in love and adoption**, with the **Son in grace and mediation**, and with the **Spirit in consolation and sanctification** (2 Cor 13:14; 1 John 1:3). This communion is the end of redemption and the form of Christian life.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Biblical foundation:** Exegesis of 2 Cor 13:14; 1 John 1:3; Rev 3:20 to ground personal, not merely essential, fellowship.
 - **With the Father:** Lover and fountain of adoption; He gives the Son, accepts believers in Him. Our return: filial love, trust, evangelical obedience; cultivation of **assurance** against servile fear.
 - **With the Son:** Mediator whose **active and passive obedience** secure justification; union with Christ; His advocacy; we answer with faith, delight, imitation, and use of ordinances.
 - **With the Spirit:** Indwelling Sanctifier who **regenerates, seals, is earnest and unction**, distributes **spiritual gifts**, and consoles; we are warned not to grieve or quench Him; walk in step for holiness and perseverance.
 - **Ecclesial frame:** Communion is personal and corporate; the **one holy catholic apostolic church** is the society gathered to enjoy God through Word, prayer, and sacraments; the Supper exhibits and strengthens communion with Christ and one another; ministry serves this end and marks the true church by gospel, sacraments, and discipline.
 - **Pastoral casuistry:** Diagnoses spiritual desertion, temptation, legal vs evangelical obedience; directs souls to Christ for **assurance and perseverance** through means of grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture as norm; Reformed catholic tradition (Calvin, Perkins, Ames). Engages Socinians on Trinity and mediation; Rome on sacerdotal mediation; mystical undifferentiated union; antinomian neglect of duty.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Trinity**, revelation and the Spirit's testimony, **covenant of grace**, **union and justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification and gifts**, **perseverance**, **Christ's obedience and intercession**, **church and ordinances**.
- **Center of gravity:** Trinitarian communion as the telos of salvation, shaping the habits of faith, love, and obedience in the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Distinct communion with each divine Person without dividing the essence.
 - Experiential Trinitarianism: doctrinal precision fuels devotion and practice.
 - Communion defined as **mutual communication** of love, grace, and consolations.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against **Socinianism**: affirms personal distinctions, Son's satisfaction, Spirit's indwelling.
 - Against **Roman sacerdotalism**: no creaturely mediators; ordinances serve, not supplant, immediate communion with God in Christ.
 - Against **mystical undifferentiation**: rejects collapsing the Persons in devotion.
 - Against **antinomianism**: insists on evangelical duties flowing from union with Christ.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves:**
 - Appropriation in devotion: Father-love, Son-grace, Spirit-consolation.
 - Distinction between **legal obedience** and **gospel obedience**.
 - Rich pneumatological vocabulary: sealing, earnest, unction; grieving vs quenching.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in Reformed spirituality; mediated to modern readers via Packer and Banner of Truth.
 - Resource for contemporary Trinitarian devotion, assurance, and pneumatology.
 - Informs Puritan ecclesiology centered on communion through means of grace.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A template for catechesis in personal and corporate piety.
 - Pastoral handbook for assurance, perseverance, and sanctification.
 - Doctrinal anchor for Christ's mediation and the Spirit's indwelling work.
