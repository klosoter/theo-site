### TITLE
The Church: Sacramental or Social? - Peter J. Leithart, First Things (2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary American ecclesial debate (mid-2010s). Published in First Things, addressing Protestant and broader Christian readers unsettled by declining institutional affiliation, the rise of "network" or social models of church, and liturgical/sacramental renewal movements within conservative Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis:** The church is fundamentally **sacramental** (a visible, instituted body in which Christ is really present through rites and offices), not reducible to a merely **social** association or voluntary network; treating the church principally as a social phenomenon distorts its identity and pastoral life.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary tendencies reduce the church to a social group-an association for mutual aid, moral influence, or social engagement-undermining claims about sacraments, priesthood, and instituted means of grace.
 - Theological counter: a sacramental ecclesiology affirms Christ's real presence in Word and sacrament, the constitutive role of baptism and Eucharist, and the church as the Body of Christ rather than a voluntary society.
 - Implications: worship, ministry, discipline, and pastoral care flow from sacramental identity; ecclesial authority and visible markers (offices, sacraments) are constitutive rather than optional.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** draws on classical patristic and magisterial sources (implicitly Augustine, Luther, Calvin), contemporary Reformed critics of sacramentalism and social-church advocates. Engages polemically with modern voluntaristic and sociological accounts of ecclesial life.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (visible/invisible church distinction), sacraments (baptism, Eucharist), Christology (presence of Christ in the church), covenantal belonging, ministry and office, means of grace.
- **Closing line:** The church's identity is sacramental presence and instituted communion with Christ; to treat it merely as social organization is a doctrinal demotion with pastoral and spiritual costs.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Insists on **sacramental realism**: sacraments are efficacious means by which the risen Christ is truly present to his people, grounding ecclesial existence.
 - Reframes visibility: the church's visible marks are not social effects but sacramental signs that constitute ecclesial being.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against **voluntaristic Protestantism** that treats church membership as optional affiliation and ministry as primarily social/therapeutic.
 - Challenges sociological ecclesiology that reads church identity in terms of function, activity, or network rather than instituted means of grace.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes language of **presence** and **institutedness** over sociological categories; advocates seeing "visible" not merely as empirical membership but as sacramental visibility.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Resonated with liturgical and sacramental-minded Protestants (Reformed and Anglican) seeking resources against ecclesial consumerism.
 - Provoked pushback from those emphasizing social witness or pragmatic ministry models; used in debates over polity, church planting, and sacramental practice.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Useful corrective to reductionist ecclesiology; supplies a compact, rhetorically sharp defense of sacramental church that is pedagogically effective for seminarians and pastors confronting secularizing trends.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacramental ecclesiology:** the view that the church's being is mediated and sustained by the sacraments; sacraments as constitutive, not merely symbolic.
- **Social ecclesiology / social model:** conception of church as voluntary association, social network, or moral-influence organization - the view Leithart critiques.
- **Visible church:** in Leithart's usage, the church made manifest in rites, offices, and communal worship where Christ is present; visibility is sacramental, not just demographic.
 - Contrast: the classic Protestant contrast of visible vs. invisible church is reframed to stress instituted visibility.
- **Invisible church:** the spiritual reality of the elect and Christ's body; Leithart maintains the reality but resists letting it privatize or negate sacramental visibility.
- **Means of grace:** Word and sacrament as channels through which God communicates saving presence; central to Leithart's argument.
- **Eucharistic presence:** the notion that Christ is really present in the Lord's Supper; key to Leithart's sacramental emphasis.
- **Baptismal incorporation:** baptism as the sacrament that constitutes entrance into the church; baptismal belonging trumps voluntarist membership.
- **Instituted church / institutedness:** the idea that Christ established visible structures (orders, sacraments) that define the church's form and authority.
- **Voluntarism:** the theological-social tendency to make church membership a matter of individual choice and preference; targeted as problematic.
- **Priesthood and office:** the significance of ordained ministry as an office tied to sacramental administration and ecclesial continuity.
- **Covenantal belonging:** the church as covenant community, membership grounded in divine promise enacted in baptism and catechesis.
- **Sacramental realism vs. symbolicism:** opposition to purely memorialist or symbolic renderings of sacraments.
- **Pastoral implications:** worship, discipline, catechesis, and formation flow from sacramental identity rather than social programming.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against social/voluntaristic ecclesiologies in contemporary Protestant debates.
- As a **definition source** for sacramental ecclesiology in Reformed and Anglican teaching, informing worship, polity, and catechetical instruction.
- As a **conceptual pivot** to reorient pastoral formation toward sacramental practices (baptismal catechesis, Eucharistic centrality).
