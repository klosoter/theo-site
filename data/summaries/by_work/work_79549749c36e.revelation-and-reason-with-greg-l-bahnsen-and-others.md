### TITLE
Revelation and Reason (with Greg L. Bahnsen and others) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed apologetic renewal; response to rising evidentialist and natural‑theological approaches within evangelicalism.
 - Work emerges within the Van Tillian presuppositional school and catalyzes later development by students (notably Greg L. Bahnsen).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Scripture (special revelation) must be the epistemic presupposition for true rationality; reason without revelation is unintelligible for knowledge of God or the world.**
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Critique of neutrality: there is no non‑theistic neutral ground for rational discourse; all thought rests on presuppositions.
 - Transcendental move: only the Christian theistic worldview renders intelligible the preconditions of rationality (laws of logic, uniformity, meaning).
 - Revelation/reason relation: general revelation (natural world, conscience) is real but insufficient for salvific knowledge; special revelation is propositional, covenantal, and authoritative.
 - Epistemic dependence on the Spirit: true appropriation of revelation requires Holy Spirit illumination and testimony.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Polemics aimed at classical and evidential apologists, natural theology proponents, and rival Reformed systems (e.g., Gordon Clarkism in some contrasts).
 - Engages scriptural exegesis, Reformed confessions, and philosophical categories (epistemology, metaphysics).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **General and Special Revelation** (distinction and relation)
 - **Role of the Holy Spirit in Revelation and Illumination**
 - Epistemology (noetic effects of sin, self‑attesting revelation)
 - Common grace, inspiration, divine authority, apologetics methodology
- **Closing line**
 - The work's center of gravity: **Scriptural revelation, ratified by the Spirit, is the ontological and epistemological foundation that makes rational discourse and Christian knowledge possible.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong antithesis: an absolute epistemic divide between Christian and non‑Christian worldviews.
 - Insistence that Scripture is self‑attesting (its truth is witnessed by the Spirit), not chiefly proven by neutral evidence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects the classical evidentialist schema that attempts to prove God from neutral facts; rejects the idea of a purely autonomous reason able to validate theological truth apart from revelation.
 - Distinguishes itself from Clarkian rationalism by grounding rationality in the triune God rather than abstract logic alone.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the **presuppositional method** and an early operational form of the **transcendental argument** for theism.
 - Treatment of "warranted epistemic circularity" - arguing that all ultimate commitments are circular at the foundational level, and Christian commitment is uniquely rational.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Polarizing: seminal for Reformed presuppositionalists (Bahnsen, Frame, Poythress) and widely critiqued by evidentialists and many philosophers for alleged circularity and method.
 - Enduring influence in conservative Reformed seminaries and in contemporary apologetics curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the theological stakes of epistemology; provides a robust framework for thinking about how revelation, reason, and Spirit‑work interrelate in Christian knowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - method that begins with Christian revelation as the necessary presupposition for intelligible thought.
- **Antithesis** - fundamental, pervasive division between Christian and non‑Christian worldviews.
- **Transcendental argument** - the claim that the possibility of logic, morals, and science presupposes the Christian God.
- **General revelation** - God's self‑disclosure in nature and conscience; true but non‑saving and insufficient without special revelation.
 - Relation: serves to indict and restrain but not to regenerate or give saving knowledge.
- **Special revelation** - Scripture's propositional disclosure of God's redemptive acts; authoritative and self‑attesting.
- **Self‑attestation (of Scripture)** - Scripture bears internal testimony to its own truth, enabled by the Spirit.
- **Holy Spirit - illumination/testimony** - Spirit is necessary to effectually apply revelation to the mind and conscience; not merely corroborative but constitutive of saving knowledge.
- **Noetic effects of sin** - sin corrupts human cognition so that non‑regenerate reason is epistemically compromised regarding God.
- **Common grace** - restraining and enabling non‑Christian intelligibility without removing ultimate epistemic dependence on revelation.
- **Warranted circularity** - defense of a circular but unavoidable epistemic structure where Christian theism is the only non‑question‑begging ultimate ground.
- **Ultimate authority** - Scripture as the final epistemic court of appeal for doctrines and method.
- **Epistemological antithesis** - the practical outworking of the antithesis in knowledge claims and argumentation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and foundational text for presuppositional apologetics and the presuppositional method.
- As a **polemic** against evidentialist and natural‑theological approaches in systematic theology and apologetics courses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on epistemology of religion, demonstrating how revelation, the Spirit, and reason are interrelated in Reformed thought.
