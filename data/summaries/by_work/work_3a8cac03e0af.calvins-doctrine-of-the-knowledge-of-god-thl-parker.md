### TITLE
Calvin's Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (T.H.L. Parker) - John Calvin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation Geneva; Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536, expanded 1559) is the locus classicus.
 - Calvin writes within Protestant polemic vs. Roman Catholic scholasticism and in conversation with late medieval Augustinianism and Luther.
 - Pastoral-intent: doctrine written for church teaching and Christian consolation as much as for academic debate.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can finite, sinful humans know the infinite God truly? Calvin answers: there is a natural sense of the divine (general revelation), but true, saving knowledge of God comes only by the Word in Christ (special revelation); knowledge of God is relational and redemptive, not merely speculative.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes two kinds of knowledge of God:
 - **Natural (general) knowledge**: creatures perceive effects and so can infer divinity, but sin corrupts this and leaves judgment darkened.
 - **Saving (special) knowledge**: arises from the external Word and Spirit, granting a true knowledge rooted in Christ.
 - Epistemic moves:
 - From God's works to God's existence (conscience and creation witness), yet this is inadequate for knowing God's character or will.
 - Scripture and the incarnate Word disclose God's name, will, and saving purposes-only here is knowledge personal and sufficient.
 - Anthropomorphic and analogical language is accommodated to human experience while guarding divine transcendence (attributes spoken analogically).
 - Recurrent methodological principles: accommodation, analogical predication, priority of revelation over autonomous natural theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Rome (scholastic natural theology), Luther (shared emphases but distinct formulations), classical Augustinian tradition, and contemporaries like Bucer and Calvin's Geneva colleagues.
 - Parker (modern interpreter) emphasizes Calvin's textual exegesis and systematic moves.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Christology (incarnational access to God), Trinity (distinctions preserved in knowledge), anthropology (corruption of cognition), divine attributes and providence, faith as trusting knowledge.

- **Closing line**
 - Calvin centers the knowledge of God in a redemptive, Word-informed union with Christ: true knowledge is relationally given by God, not achieved by autonomous human intellect.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Knowledge of God is primarily salvific and covenantal, not merely intellectual; epistemology subserves soteriology.
 - Strong stress on the Spirit's role in making the Word effective-knowledge as gift and communion, not mere assent.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with medieval/Scholastic tendencies to ground theology on an autonomous analogia entis (an intrinsic resemblance between God and creature). Calvin resists any natural theology that claims unmediated access to God's essence.
 - Differs from radical fideism by still granting a legitimate, albeit limited, natural knowledge of God (sensus divinitatis and witness of creation).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Elevated use of **accommodation** and **sensus divinitatis** as hermeneutical and epistemic principles.
 - Operationalizes **analogia fidei** (knowledge measured and mediated by revealed faith) over an ontological analogia entis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped Reformed scholastic formulations of divine knowledge and attributes; influenced later Reformed epistemology and Barthian recoveries of revelation-priority.
 - Continues to inform pastoral theology, preaching, and confessional formulations on God's knowability.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a corrective to both unchecked natural theology and mere fideism; exemplary for teaching the interplay of exegesis, doctrine, and piety.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sensus divinitatis**
 - Calvin's term for a created, universal disposition by which humans have an awareness of God; impaired by sin but not obliterated.
- **General revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure in nature and conscience; provides witness but not salvific knowledge.
- **Special revelation (Word/Christ)**
 - Scripture and the incarnate Word as the decisive means for true, saving knowledge of God.
- **Accommodation**
 - God condescending in speech and forms of revelation to finite human capacities; crucial for Calvin's hermeneutic.
- **Analogia fidei**
 - Knowledge and language about God governed by the content of revelation and faith; Calvin's corrective to analogia entis.
 - Relation to Analogia Entis: Calvin rejects any autonomous ontological analogy (analogia entis) that grounds theology in creaturely being; insists that analogy must be anchored in God's self-revelation (analogia fidei).
- **Analogia entis (critique)**
 - The medieval idea that creatures resemble God in being; Calvin warns it risks projecting creaturely categories onto God and bypassing revelation.
- **Simplicity**
 - God's unity of being; Calvin affirms that divine attributes are not separable parts of God.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; Calvin uses this to stress radical divine otherness and freedom from creaturely contingency.
- **Immutability**
 - God's unchangeableness in essence and covenant faithfulness; Calvin balances immutability with God's dynamic action in history.
- **Impassibility**
 - Calvin's careful usage: God does not have passions like creatures (no change of essence), yet God genuinely enters covenantal relations (language of love/anger accommodated).
- **Faith**
 - Not mere assent but trusting knowledge formed by the Word and Spirit; faith is the means by which knowledge becomes salvific.
- **Word as instrument**
 - The preached/written Word is the ordinary instrument of the Spirit for imparting knowledge of God.
- **Natural theology (limited)**
 - Calvin allows for limited natural theology (effects-to-cause reasoning) but denies its sufficiency for saving knowledge.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source on Reformed epistemology: clarifies limits and tasks of natural vs special revelation.
 - As a polemic against analogia entis and scholastic natural theology: defense of revelation-priority (analogia fidei).
 - As an exegetical model: integrates close biblical exegesis with systematic claims about divine attributes and the knowledge of God.
