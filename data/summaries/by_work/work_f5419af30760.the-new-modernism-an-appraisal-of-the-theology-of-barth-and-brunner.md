### TITLE
The New Modernism: An Appraisal of the Theology of Barth and Brunner - Cornelius Van Til (critique of neo‑orthodoxy; presuppositional polemic)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century polemic within Reformed theology against neo‑orthodoxy (Barthian and Brunnerian streams). Van Til writes from the Orthodox Presbyterian / presuppositional tradition seeking to expose continuities between neo‑orthodoxy and modernism.
 - Engages ongoing disputes over revelation, natural theology, and the epistemological status of Scripture after WW II.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth and Brunner represent a "new modernism": despite rhetorical opposition to liberalism they retain modernist assumptions (autonomy of reason, neutral common ground) that undermine the Reformed confession of Scripture as the self‑attesting, propositional Word of God.
 - Primary problem: whether there is a neutral epistemic common ground for Christian and non‑Christian thought (Van Til: there is none).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: identify theological moves in Barth (dialectical revelation, Christocentrism) and Brunner (attempted bridge via natural revelation).
 - Epistemological critique: show that both fail to secure Scripture's authority without recourse to the very modernist presuppositions they claim to reject.
 - Positive alternative: sketch of presuppositional apologetics - the necessity of beginning with the triune God as the ultimate presupposition and the reality of an antithesis between believer and unbeliever.
 - Application: implications for doctrine (revelation, Scripture, natural theology) and for apologetic practice.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Main interlocutors: Karl Barth, Emil Brunner.
 - Resources marshaled: Scripture, Reformed confessional standards, classical Reformed and apologetic exemplars (e.g., Calvinian moves), Van Til's prior apologetic writings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs. general), authority/inerrancy of Scripture, epistemology of faith, Christology (as center of revelation), natural theology, law and sin, covenantal implications (unity of God's revelation).

- **Closing line**
 - A forceful defense of Reformed presuppositionalism: theological antithesis and the self‑attesting propositional Word of God are the only adequate foundations against the disguised modernism of Barth and Brunner.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Coined and sustained the label **"new modernism"** to show continuity between neo‑orthodoxy and older liberalism.
 - Stresses an **epistemological antithesis**: no neutral ground between Christian and non‑Christian thought; all thought is governed by presuppositions.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Barth's dialectical method: argues it collapses into subjectivism because it fails to affirm Scripture as propositional revelation.
 - Opposes Brunner's attempt at a "point of contact" in general revelation, charging it implicitly presupposes autonomous reason.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematically deploys the language of **presuppositions** and **self‑attesting divine revelation** as decisive epistemic categories in theology and apologetics.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among 20th‑century Reformed presuppositionalists (e.g., Bahnsen lineage); a standard polemic against neo‑orthodoxy in conservative Reformed circles.
 - Less persuasive to Barthian scholars; seen as an apologetic polemic rather than neutral exegesis of Barth.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the epistemological stakes in debates over revelation and natural theology.
 - Serves as a concise model of how presuppositional apologetics addresses theological methodology and doctrine - valuable for teaching apologetics, doctrinal theology, and polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Modernism**
 - Van Til's term for neo‑orthodoxy that preserves modernist epistemic assumptions while rejecting liberal theology's language.
- **Presuppositional Apologetics**
 - Method insisting the Christian must begin with the triune God as the ultimate presupposition; all reasoning evaluated against that standard.
- **Antithesis / No Neutrality**
 - The decisive claim that believer and unbeliever operate from mutually exclusive worldviews; there is no neutral starting point.
- **Self‑attesting (verbal/propositional) Revelation**
 - Scripture and God's Word are inherently authoritative and intelligible only by divine self‑witness, not by appeal to autonomous human reason.
- **Special Revelation vs. General Revelation**
 - Van Til: general revelation cannot serve as salvific epistemic common ground; special revelation is normative and necessary.
- **Common Ground / Point of Contact**
 - Targeted concept in Brunner; Van Til argues this presumes a falsely neutral human reason.
- **Dialectical Theology (Barth)**
 - Criticized for collapsing propositional testimony into existential encounter and for failing to ground Scripture's authority.
- **Natural Theology**
 - Rejected as a dependable bridge to faith; any usable "truth" in nature must be interpreted under Christian presuppositions.
- **Autonomy of Reason**
 - Rejected as a hidden modernist premise in neo‑orthodox attempts to negotiate revelation and human cognition.
- **Covenant (unity of revelation)**
 - Van Til's outlook tends to affirm a covenantal coherence and divine unity that undergird the Reformed reading of Scripture.
- **Epistemic Presuppositions**
 - Basic commitments that determine how evidence and argument are interpreted; central analytic tool in the book.
- **Christocentrism (critique)**
 - Van Til affirms Christocentrism but criticizes forms that make revelation primarily an existential event rather than propositional truth.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a **polemic**: primary reference for critiquing neo‑orthodoxy and defending presuppositional methodology.
 - As a **definition source**: clarifies terms like "no neutral ground" and "self‑attesting revelation."
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates between covenantal frameworks and dispensational separations: often cited by covenant theologians to defend unity of revelation and by critics of attempts (including some progressive covenantal adjustments) to mediate revelation with autonomous reason.
