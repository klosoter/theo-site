### TITLE
The Epistle to the Romans (commentary) - Patrick Fairbairn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Scottish Reformed and evangelical milieu; Fairbairn writes as a Presbyterian biblical theologian seeking to defend traditional doctrine against rising German critical and liberal readings while integrating exegetical precision with systematic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Exposition of Paul's doctrine of **righteousness and justification** as forensic imputation within a covenantal-historical framework; addressing how sin, law, and grace relate in the economy of salvation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Prolegomena: authorship, purpose, historical setting of Romans; method combines philological detail with doctrinal concerns.
 - Romans 1-3: diagnosis of human sinfulness and meaning of "righteousness of God."
 - Romans 3-5: justification by faith; Adam-Christ federal relation; union with Christ and imputation.
 - Romans 6-8: sanctification, law, and the Spirit; ethical implications of justification.
 - Romans 9-11: election, reprobation, the place of Israel in redemptive history.
 - Romans 12-16: practical exhortation and ecclesial application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive engagement with the Protestant Reformers (Calvin, Luther), patristic and medieval formulations of sin and justification, and contemporary German and British critics; Fairbairn aims to correct what he sees as destructive tendencies in rationalistic and moralizing interpretations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, justification and imputation, covenant theology (including Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace), sin and original guilt, law and grace, sanctification, election, Christology (federal headship), and soteriology.
- **Closing line:** Fairbairn reads Romans as a sustained vindication of covenantal, forensic justification grounded in Christ's federal headship, with necessary ethical and pneumatological consequences for the believer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong fusion of careful exegesis and systematic Reformed theology; Fairbairn insists that exegetical decisions must coherently fit a covenantal-soteriological horizon.
 - Clear defense of **forensic imputation** and federal headship (Adam/Christ) against moralistic or merely transformative readings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters German higher criticism and liberal moral-influence readings by upholding Pauline forensic categories and covenantal structures.
 - Refines Reformers' emphases with 19th-century exegetical exactness while resisting doctrinal dilution.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced treatment of "righteousness of God" as both covenantal status and God's saving act; integrates legal and relational language without collapsing one into the other.
 - Systematic linking of Adamic federal principle to Pauline anthropology and soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and Presbyterian seminaries for theological fidelity and pastoral clarity; regarded as a reliable conservative commentary in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
 - Later overshadowed by critical-historical and form-critical commentaries but retained as a resource for covenantal theology and preaching.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplary model of harmonizing exegesis with dogmatics; particularly useful for courses on Romans, covenant theology, and pastoral exposition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration of righteousness by God; imputation of Christ's righteousness to believers.
- **Imputation:** Transfer of guilt to Adam and of righteousness to believers in Christ; central to Fairbairn's reading of Romans 4-5.
- **Righteousness of God:** Both divine attribute and salvific provision; Fairbairn stresses its covenantal and forensic sense.
- **Faith / Pistis:** Trustful reliance that receives the righteousness imputed in Christ; treated as instrument rather than meritorious act.
- **Covenant of Works:** Pre-fall covenant with Adam requiring perfect obedience; breach explains universal condemnation and grounds need for federal representation by Christ.
 - Fairbairn uses this to explain Adam's federal headship and the legal consequences transmitted to humanity.
- **Covenant of Grace:** Divine arrangement for redemption through Christ as the new federal head; frames Paul's soteriology in Romans.
- **Federal headship (Adam/Christ):** Typological and legal connection between Adam's failure and Christ's representative obedience - explanatory center for original sin and redemption.
- **Law vs. Grace:** Law exposes sin; grace in Christ provides justification and empowers sanctification through the Spirit.
- **Sanctification / Spirit:** Ethical outworking and inner renewal following forensic justification; Spirit's role emphasized in Romans 6-8.
- **Original sin / guilt:** Transmission of Adamic sin and its legal consequences; Fairbairn defends traditional doctrine against purely social or ethical readings.
- **Election:** Divine choice compatible with universal need and particular redemption; treated pastorally and doctrinally in Romans 9-11.
- **Forensic/legal language:** Recurring methodological commitment - interpret Pauline language primarily in forensic-covenantal terms.
- **Exegesis-theology integration:** Fairbairn's hallmark - Scripture read with systematic coherency.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed doctrines (imputation, federal headship, Covenant of Works).
- As a **polemic resource** against liberal/moral-influence interpretations of Romans.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating integration of historical grammar with dogmatic theology for preaching and seminary instruction.
