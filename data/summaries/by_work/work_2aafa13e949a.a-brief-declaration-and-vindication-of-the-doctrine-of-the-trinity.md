### TITLE
**A Brief Declaration and Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity** - John Owen (17th-century English Reformed / Puritan)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑17th century English Puritan milieu; post‑Reformation confessional disputes with Socinians/Arians and contemporary modalists.
 - Intended as both learned defense and pastoral clarification for ministers and educated laity amidst rationalist and anti‑Trinitarian challenges.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the orthodox doctrine that God is one essence in three distinct persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), against denials that reduce persons to modes or deny eternal personal relations.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - 1) Diagnose errors: Socinian denial of personal distinctions; modalist collapse; rationalist reduction of mystery. 
 - 2) Scriptural foundation: adduces texts that show distinct persons and relations (eternal Sonship, procession of Spirit) and argues Scripture self‑attests its doctrine (see section on authority). 
 - 3) Ontological clarification: distinguishes *essence* (what God is) from *subsistences/persons* (who God is), using classical categories (generation, procession) to secure distinction without separation. 
 - 4) Christological consequences: affirms eternal Sonship and the hypostatic union - the Son's eternal relationship to the Father precedes and grounds incarnation and redemption. 
 - 5) Soteriological and pastoral corollaries: Trinity grounds atonement efficacy, believer's adoption, and the Spirit's application of redemption.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Opponents: Socinians (Faustus Socinus lineage), modalists, contemporary rationalists.
 - Authorities marshaled: Scripture, Church Fathers (especially Athanasius, Augustine), Reformers (notably Calvin), and scholastic categories adopted and refined.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (eternal Sonship and incarnation), Scripture (self‑attestation and authority), soteriology (atonement, adoption), anthropology and hamartiology (nature and origin of sin in relation to the persons of God).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The orthodox Trinity is both the biblical and rationally coherent framework by which God is rightly named, Christ is truly Son and Savior, Scripture reliably attests divine truth, and believers receive adoption through the distinct yet united work of the three Persons.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on precise ontological language (subsistence/person vs essence) to avoid both Tritheism and modalism.
 - Tie between internal Trinitarian relations and concrete soteriology: eternal relations ground incarnation and adoption.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - More robust rebuttal of Socinian rationalism than many contemporaries; refuses to capitulate mystery to Enlightenment reason but engages reasoned defense.
 - Reclaims patristic categories (generation, procession) while avoiding later speculations that make persons successive or created.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful deployment of "subsistence" as the primary term for personal existence in God; clarifies "order" (ordo) without implying inferiority in essence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - High authority in Reformed and Puritan circles; used as a standard concise defense of classical Trinitarianism by dissenting ministers.
 - Influenced later Reformed systematicians and evangelical defenses of the Trinity; less cited by liberal theologians but resurged in conservative Trinitarian renewal.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model combining biblical exegesis, patristic retrieval, and disciplined metaphysical clarity; valuable for teaching Trinitarian theology and defending orthodox Christology and Scripture authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity**
 - One divine essence subsisting in three distinct persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).
- **Persons (subsistences)**
 - Real centers of personal existence within the Godhead; not modes or merely relational designations.
- **Essence**
 - The common divine nature shared identically by the three persons.
- **Eternal Generation**
 - The Father's begetting of the Son as an eternal relation, securing the Son's eternal Sonship (connects to Eternal Sonship and Incarnation).
- **Procession**
 - The Holy Spirit's relation (proceeding) from the Father (and, in Western theology, the Son) as a distinct personal relation.
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**
 - Distinguishes the Son's eternal personal relation from the historical incarnation; the incarnation assumes but does not create Sonship.
- **Self‑attestation of Scripture**
 - Scripture inherently bears witness to its divine truthfulness and is competent to confirm Trinitarian doctrine (connects to Self Attestation and Authority Of Scripture).
- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture is the final rule for doctrine, reliably attesting Trinitarian revelation against human skepticism.
- **Socinianism**
 - Anti‑Trinitarian rationalist position Owen targets; denies eternal Sonship and Trinitarian persons.
- **Modalism**
 - Error collapsing persons into successive modes; Owen refutes this as incompatible with biblical personal relations.
- **Adoption**
 - Soteriological consequence: believer's adoption flows from the Trinitarian economy-Father's grace, Son's redemption, Spirit's application (connects to Adoption).
- **Nature and Origin of Sin**
 - Treated insofar as sin is a privation and rebellion against God, not originating in the divine will; Trinity is normative for holiness and moral order.
- **Atonement**
 - The Son's mediatorial work, grounded in his eternal Sonship and effected by the distinct roles of each Person.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed formulations of Trinity and eternal Sonship.
 - As a **polemic manual** against Socinianism and modalism - model for pastoral apologetics.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking scriptural proof‑texts to ontological categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Trinitarian doctrine to soteriology (adoption, atonement) and to doctrines of sin and Scripture authority.
