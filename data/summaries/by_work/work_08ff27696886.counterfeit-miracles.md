### TITLE
Counterfeit Miracles - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton-Reformed milieu. Warfield writes as a conservative systematic theologian reacting to rising Spiritualism, Irvingite and early Pentecostal claims of modern miraculous gifts, and broadly to popular infusions of experientialism into Protestant piety.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary claims to miraculous signs and wonders are not evidence of continuing apostolic authority; many such phenomena are **counterfeits**-psychological, demonic, or otherwise non-apostolic-and must be judged against the canon and the apostolic era.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Distinguishes the **nature and purpose** of apostolic miracles (authentication of revelation and office) from later alleged miracles.
 - Advances historical and theological grounds for **cessationism**: sign-gifts belonged to the foundational epoch and ceased with the close of the apostolic age.
 - Provides criteria for discerning authentic from counterfeit phenomena (e.g., conformity to apostolic doctrine, moral fruit, public and verifiable character).
 - Explores non-supernatural explanations (psychology, suggestion, fraud) and the possibility of demonic imitation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages implicitly and explicitly with Spiritualists, Irvingites, contemporary Pentecostal claims, and popular revivalists. Dialogue with earlier Reformed authorities (Princeton tradition) and critique of more experientialist modern Protestantism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and canon (authority and finality of Scripture), pneumatology (gifts and operations of the Spirit), ecclesiology (office/authentication), soteriology and sanctification insofar as claimed signs relate to holiness, and theological anthropology regarding susceptibility to deception.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Warfield's central claim: **authentic miracles are tied to apostolic revelation; modern "miracles" that contradict or bypass the apostolic testimony are to be tested, often found counterfeit, and cannot supplant the settled authority of Scripture.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes a tight link between miracle and apostolic office: miracles functioned as *credentials* for revelation and therefore lost justificatory role once the canon and apostolic foundation were complete.
 - Presents a balanced roster of naturalistic and demonic explanations rather than a single reductive account.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contra Romantic and revivalist emphases that treat present experience as equally authoritative, Warfield insists on objective apostolic norms and historical finality.
 - Offers a more empirically cautious and historically informed cessationism than some earlier dogmatic dismissals.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized use of the phrase **"counterfeit miracle"** as a technical polemical category-phenomena that mimic signs yet lack apostolic provenance.
 - Clarifies the distinction between **ordinary operations of the Spirit** (sanctification, inward renewal) and **extraordinary sign-gifts**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard reference in Reformed and conservative evangelical critiques of Pentecostalism and charismatic movements; widely cited by cessationists.
 - Criticized and engaged by continuationists and Pentecostal scholars who argue for normative ongoing sign gifts and different hermeneutics of Scripture and experience.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for historically rooted discernment theology: careful biblical exegesis, historical argument, and pastoral concern combined for assessing claimed signs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Counterfeit miracle** - phenomena that appear miraculous but lack apostolic authentication and often contradict apostolic doctrine or biblical test.
- **Sign-gifts** - miraculous gifts (tongues, healing, prophecy as apostolic authentication); Warfield argues these were foundational and temporary.
- **Cessationism** - the position that revelatory sign-gifts ceased with the apostolic age; Warfield's principal constructive assertion.
- **Continuationism** - the opposing view; treated as the primary rival and critiqued throughout the work.
- **Apostolic authentication** - the function of miracles in confirming apostolic preaching and revelation; central criterion for authenticity.
- **Discernment (test of fruit and doctrine)** - practical criteria Warfield advances: doctrinal conformity, moral fruit, public verifiability, and historical continuity.
- **Demonic imitation** - the possibility that satanic forces can simulate miraculous signs to deceive; used to caution credulity.
- **Psychological/sociological explanation** - non-supernatural accounts of ecstatic or healing phenomena (suggestion, hysteria, group dynamics).
- **Authority of Scripture** - presupposition and corrective: Scripture is the final norm against which alleged miracles must be measured.
- **Extraordinary vs ordinary Spirit operations** - distinction between foundational signs and ongoing sanctifying work of the Spirit.
- **Sanctification and gifts** - Warfield separates ethical growth from alleged sign-evidence; sanctification is normally measured by holiness, not by spectacular signs (see: Spiritual Gifts And Sanctification).
- **Pentecostalism and Reformed critique** - Warfield's text is a template for Reformed responses to Pentecostal claims (see: Pentecostalism And Reformed Response).
- **Polemic resource in debates** - frequently cited in arguments on Continuationism vs Cessationism as a canonical defense of cessationism.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional and historical source for **cessationism** (theological locus: revelation/pneumatology).
 - As a polemical framework in **Pentecostalism vs Reformed** exchanges, providing criteria for discernment and caution.
 - As an exegetical-model and pastoral manual for assessing claimed gifts in relation to **spiritual gifts and sanctification**, emphasizing biblical tests over experiential certainty.
