### TITLE
Selected articles in Princeton Theological Review - Geerhardus Vos 
(late 19th-early 20th century Princeton essays on divine attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Essays published in the Princeton Theological Review during Vos's tenure at Princeton Seminary (circa 1880s-1910s). The milieu: conservative Reformed scholarship reacting to nineteenth‑century liberal theology, historicist biblical criticism, and rising interest in philosophical theology.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** To defend and re-articulate classical theistic attributes (notably **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility**) in a way that is both biblically grounded and philosophically coherent - avoiding caricatures from metaphysical abstraction and from modern "God‑becoming" proposals.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: survey biblical language (Hebrew/Greek idioms, anthropomorphic and anthropopathic texts) to determine the scriptural warrant for each attribute.
 - Philosophical clarification: explicate what each attribute means logically (e.g., denial of composition for simplicity; self‑existence for aseity).
 - Doctrinal integration: show how attributes cohere with covenantal and redemptive‑historical motifs - i.e., divine immutability does not render God inert in history.
 - Polemic moves: critique modern tendency to anthropomorphize God or to posit creaturely temporality into the divine being (process thought, certain forms of Schleiermacherianism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture; Reformers (Calvin); patristic and scholastic treatments (Augustine, Aquinas); contemporaries at Princeton (Warfield) and opponents in liberal theology (Schleiermacher, Ritschlian trends, early process intimations). Philosophical touchstones include classical metaphysics of being and causation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (listed above), revelation (how attributes are disclosed), covenantal action (relation of immutability to redemptive acts), Christology implicitly (impassibility vs. the passion of God in the incarnate Word).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Vos insists that the classical theistic attributes must be preserved and reinterpreted in biblical‑theological terms so that God remains both metaphysically God and historically the covenantal Actor.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Applies a distinctly **biblical‑theological** method to what often had been treated as abstract metaphysics: attributes are read through the story of revelation rather than abstracted from it.
 - Holds tension: preserves **metaphysical integrity** (simplicity, aseity) while insisting on **real temporal action** in history (God acts without undergoing ontological change).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal theologies that make God essentially changeable or merely moral ideal by reasserting divine transcendence and self‑existence.
 - Challenges scholastic excesses by refusing sterile abstraction divorced from Scripture and pastoral concerns.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuances of **impassibility**: distinguishes impassibility as absence of ontological suffering from the experiential scriptural language of divine grief and covenantal pain (thus protecting both God's immutability and the reality of God's relational involvement).
 - Emphasizes covenantal **relationality** without collapsing aseity into creatureliness.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in later Reformed and conservative evangelical treatments of divine attributes; served as a corrective resource against both liberal anthropomorphism and mechanistic scholasticism.
 - Cited by mid‑20th century Reformed theologians as a model for integrating biblical exegesis and dogmatics.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A compact model for students who must negotiate biblical language, historical theology, and philosophical coherence when treating God's attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Simplicity:** God is not composed of parts; attributes are identical with divine being rather than separable faculties. Vos: maintain biblical testimony without collapsing relational language.
- **Aseity:** God's self‑existence; God's existence is grounded in Godself, not contingent causes. Used to defend divine sovereignty and the Creator-creature distinction.
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo ontological change; Vos stresses distinction between God's unchangeableness in essence and genuine economic acts in history.
- **Impassibility:** God cannot be subject to suffering in a way that compromises divine being; yet Scripture attributes sorrow and anger in covenantal, relational terms.
- **Anthropomorphism / Anthropopathism:** Human language about God's body or emotions; Vos argues for literal yet analogical reading-language registers real divine acts without implying creaturely limits.
- **Covenantal action:** Framework to interpret attributes functionally - God's immutability is compatible with covenantal responsiveness.
- **Redemptive‑historical reading:** Method that grounds attribute‑language in God's acts in salvation history rather than purely abstract metaphysics.
- **Divine personality:** Affirmation that attributes indicate personal agency capable of relation, speech, and covenant.
- **Eternality vs temporality:** Distinction underscoring God's timelessness (or sovereign lordship over time) while allowing real temporal actions.
- **Revelation:** Criterion for assessing philosophical claims about God; Scripture shapes correct metaphysical conclusions.
- **Theodicy/Passion of God:** Vos's schema supplies resources to speak of God's "sorrow" at sin without denying impassibility.
- **Exegetical method:** Close reading of biblical texts to support or limit philosophical formulations of attributes.
- **Polemic function:** Used as corrective against process theology and liberal reductionisms.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical attributes in Reformed dogmatics classes (concise, exegetically informed).
- As a **polemic** against theologies that make God essentially mutable or passible.
- As an **exegetical model** linking redemptive‑historical data to systematic categories, serving as a conceptual pivot between biblical studies and dogmatics.
