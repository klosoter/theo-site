### TITLE
**What Is Faith?** by J. Gresham Machen (1925)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written amid the Presbyterian fundamentalist-modernist controversy; Princeton Old School milieu; reply to Protestant liberalism, pragmatism, and pietistic subjectivism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian faith is not bare will or moral uplift but a Spirit-wrought trust grounded in knowledge of divinely revealed, historically anchored truth, centering on the person and finished work of Christ as attested in Scripture and confessed by the church.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Faith and knowledge:** Refutes the wedge between fact and value. Faith involves cognition; doctrine is the content that faith receives.
 - **Authority of revelation:** Scripture, as God-breathed and self-attesting, normatively delivers the gospel facts and their meaning.
 - **Person of Christ:** True faith rests in the incarnate Son, affirming the hypostatic union per Chalcedon; the object of faith is a divine Redeemer, not a mere teacher.
 - **Work of Christ:** Emphasis on substitutionary atonement, resurrection, and the once-for-all accomplishment that faith receives.
 - **Faith, repentance, and salvation:** Faith is the instrument of justification and is inseparable from evangelical repentance, opposed to Pelagian self-reliance; regeneration undergirds faith.
 - **Church, creed, and proclamation:** The one, holy, catholic, apostolic church conserves and proclaims doctrine; creeds confess the public content of faith; the means of grace serve faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Ritschl, Harnack, Schleiermacher, Wilhelm Herrmann, Kant, William James; aligns with Augustine, Calvin, Warfield, Hodge; appeals to the Westminster Standards and the Council of Chalcedon.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (self-attestation, inspiration, canon), Christology (two natures, deity), Soteriology (justification by faith, repentance, regeneration), Sin (original sin vs. Pelagianism), Ecclesiology (church catholic, apostolicity, confessionalism).
- **Closing line:** Faith rests in and receives Christ crucified and risen as offered in the Word, so that doctrine and history are the lifeblood of Christian trust.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Objectivity of faiths object:** Faith looks outward to Christ and gospel facts, not inward to experience.
 - **Doctrine as life:** Belief that doctrine is not optional theory but the necessary content of saving faith.
 - **Historicity of the gospel:** Salvation hinges on events (incarnation, cross, resurrection) interpreted by Scripture.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **liberal moralism** (reducing faith to ethics) and **subjectivism/mysticism** (making faith a feeling).
 - Against **pragmatism** (truth as utility) and **Kantian reductions** (religion within moral bounds).
 - Against **Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian** accounts of faith as autonomous choice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies the classic triad **knowledge, assent, trust**, insisting all three are biblically necessary.
 - Connects **self-attestation of Scripture** with the churchs confessional witness, without collapsing Scripture into tradition.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became a staple in Reformed seminaries (notably Westminster) as a companion to Christianity and Liberalism.
 - Shaped evangelical defenses of inerrancy and historic orthodoxy; a counter to experiential and therapeutic accounts of faith.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of integrating Bibliology, Christology, and Soteriology around the question of faith.
 - Provides a durable polemic and pastoral clarity for preaching, catechesis, and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (knowledge, assent, trust):** Cognitive reception of gospel truth, hearty agreement, and personal reliance on Christ.
 - Distinguishes faiths act from its **object** (Christ) and its **fruit** (obedience).
- **Object of faith:** The person and work of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture, not faith in faith or in moral ideals.
- **Revelation:** Gods self-disclosure culminating in Christ and inscripturated in Scripture; necessary for saving knowledge.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture:** Scripture bears divine authority intrinsically; the Spirit confirms its truth to the believer.
- **Inspiration and inerrancy:** God-breathed origin of Scripture ensures trustworthy, truthful doctrine and history.
- **Canon and tradition:** The church recognizes, not creates, Scripture; creeds serve Scripture by summarizing its teaching.
- **Hypostatic union:** Christ is one person in two natures, divine and human, without confusion or division.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** 451 statement safeguarding the two-natures doctrine; underwrites the reliability of Christs saving work.
- **Substitutionary atonement:** Christ bears sin in the place of his people; faith receives this finished work.
- **Justification by faith:** Righteousness of Christ imputed; faith as instrument, not merit.
- **Repentance:** Evangelical turning from sin inseparable from faith, distinct from works-righteousness.
- **Regeneration (new birth):** Sovereign work of the Spirit enabling faith; refutes Pelagian autonomy.
- **Pelagianism/Semi-Pelagianism/Augustinianism:** Competing accounts of sin and grace; Machen sides with Augustinian inability and grace.
- **One, holy, catholic, apostolic church:** The churches unity and mission to guard and proclaim apostolic doctrine; creeds as public confession.
- **Means of grace:** Word and sacraments as instituted supports of faiths growth and assurance.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - **Definition source** for faiths nature and its relation to repentance and justification.
 - **Polemic** against liberalism, pragmatism, and Pelagianism across Bibliology, Christology, and Soteriology.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking Scriptural authority to Christs person and work in ecclesial proclamation.
 - **Teaching aid** for catechesis on creed, canon, and the gospel as historical doctrine.
