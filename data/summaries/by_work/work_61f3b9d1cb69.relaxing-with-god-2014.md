### TITLE
**Relaxing with God (2014) - Andrew S. Farley**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2014 within an evangelical, pastoral milieu shaped by reaction to legalism and performance-driven Christianity.
 - Author Andrew S. Farley is a pastor and popular-level theologian known for earlier works promoting assurance and a "grace-centered" gospel (e.g., The Naked Gospel).
 - Audience: lay and pastoral readers seeking relief from guilt-driven sanctification.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christians are invited to *rest in the finished work of Christ* for sanctification; holiness is secured primarily by trusting positional realities in Christ rather than by moral striving.
 - Sanctification should be understood primarily as a *definitive*, present reality to be embraced, not chiefly as a program of progressive moral effort.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary Christian life is dominated by striving, guilt, and legalism-producing burnout rather than transformation.
 - Theological correction: biblical teaching (esp. Pauline texts) emphasizes union with Christ, positional realities, and rest; these realities are meant to be received rather than manufactured.
 - Practical application: spiritual rest-trust, relaxed faith, reliance on the Spirit-produces growth more reliably than will-power or law-keeping.
 - Pastoral moves: case studies, pastoral counsel, and exhortations to practice "relaxation" as spiritual discipline.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with mainstream evangelical teaching on sanctification; implicitly critiques "Lordship Salvation" and legalistic pietism.
 - Uses Pauline exegesis (Romans, Galatians, Colossians), pastoral anecdote, and experiential theology more than systematic theological sources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (definitive vs. progressive)
 - Justification and assurance
 - Union with Christ
 - Work of the Holy Spirit (sanctifying and indwelling)
 - Practical ethics and repentance (reframed as restful trust)

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically centered on the claim that authentic holiness flows from resting in Christ's accomplished work and embracing positional realities, rather than from strenuous moral effort.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral and rhetorical emphasis on *relaxation/rest* as the central spiritual posture for sanctification.
 - Treats definitive (positional) sanctification as practically primary-believers are to live from what God has already done.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to legalistic and performance-oriented sanctification models (e.g., common forms of Lordship Salvation and moralism).
 - Contrasts with approaches that foreground progressive sanctification as primarily human effort aided by grace.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes phrases like "relaxing with God," "restful sanctification," and frames sanctification as a matter of reception rather than production.
 - Reframes obedience and repentance as actions flowing out of rest, not prerequisites for acceptance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in lay and pastoral contexts craving assurance and relief from guilt; produced notable traction among readers dissatisfied with effort-heavy spirituality.
 - Criticized by some Reformed and evangelical theologians for potentially underemphasizing mortification, spiritual discipline, and the normative role of progressive obedience.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable pastoral corrective to legalism; a helpful resource for assurance, pastoral counseling, and motivating trust.
 - Useful conversation partner in theological debates over how to balance definitive and progressive aspects of sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Relaxing with God**
 - Central metaphor and proposed spiritual practice: trusting and resting in Christ for daily holiness.
- **Rest**
 - Spiritual posture; derived from Sabbath/rest typology and Pauline language of rest in Christ.
- **Definitive Sanctification**
 - Positional, once-for-all reality in which believers are set apart in Christ; emphasized as currently applicable.
- **Progressive Sanctification**
 - Ongoing process of moral and spiritual growth; treated as dependent fruit of resting, not primarily an achievement by effort.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The relational ground for definitive sanctification; the source of positional realities and spiritual rest.
- **Positional Reality**
 - Doctrine that believers are already righteous/holy in Christ, a reality to be appropriated by faith.
- **Grace (as empowerment)**
 - Emphasized as the enabling reality that sustains sanctification through rest rather than through human striving.
- **Effortless Christianity (relational)**
 - Provocative shorthand used: spiritual growth occurs as one rests and trusts rather than through performance-based striving.
- **Assurance**
 - Strong emphasis: resting posture secures assurance by reliance on Christ's completed work.
- **Lordship Salvation (critique)**
 - Implicitly critiqued - the book opposes views that make submission and moral striving primary evidences for salvation.
- **Mortification / Vivification**
 - Treated but reframed: mortification of sin is a byproduct of resting and Spirit-work, not mainly human effort.
- **Repentance**
 - Reinterpreted as turning to trust in Christ's work rather than primarily turning away by resolve.
- **Sanctifying Work of the Spirit**
 - Presented as the operative means by which restful trust yields transformation.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for discussions distinguishing definitive and progressive sanctification (prefers the primacy of definitive).
 - As a **polemic** against legalism and Lordship-style sanctification models.
 - As a **pastoral/exegetical model** emphasizing Pauline texts that speak of rest, union, and positional realities; useful in counseling and assurance-focused teaching.
