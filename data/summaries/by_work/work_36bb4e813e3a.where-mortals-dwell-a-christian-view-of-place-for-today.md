### TITLE
Where Mortals Dwell: A Christian View of Place for Today - Craig Bartholomew

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published in the early 21st century amid renewed theological interest in ecology, urban studies, and public theology. Responds to modern/globalized tendencies toward uprootedness and the privatization of faith; situated within broadly Reformed/biblical-theological conversations about vocation and cultural engagement.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Christians must recover a robust theological account of *place* - the God-given, creaturely contexts in which human beings are called to dwell, work, and bear witness. Contemporary placelessness undermines vocation, neighborliness, and faithful stewardship.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Establishes *place* as a theological category rooted in creation, covenant, and the tabernacle/temple narratives. 
 - Argues that God's presence (dwelling) shapes human vocation: tending, keeping, and cultural formation (dominion reinterpreted as care-filled stewardship). 
 - Critiques modern tendencies (global capitalism, secularization) that erase local rootedness and shared practices. 
 - Proposes ecclesial and social practices (hospitality, liturgy, covenantal commitments) that re-create sustaining places in anticipation of eschatological consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Primarily biblical texts (Genesis, Exodus/temple traditions, incarnation and Pauline ethics), the Reformed covenantal tradition (e.g., Calvinist emphases on vocation and common grace), and contemporary theological and cultural critics addressing globalization and environmental concerns.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Creation and creational order; incarnation (God-with-us / dwelling); covenantal structuring of human life; vocation and dominion; ecclesiology (church as place-making); eschatology (future consummation shaping present practice); implicit Trinitarian orientation to relationality and gift.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Theologically faithful living is place-making: Christians are summoned by the triune God to dwell responsibly in created locales, cultivating practices that manifest God's presence now and point toward the eschatological place where God will dwell fully with mortals.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Places theological priority on *place* (not merely space, location, or environment) as formative of identity, ethics, and worship. 
 - Recasts *dominion* as stewardship and cultural creativity grounded in creatureliness and neighborliness rather than domination or exploitation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against theological tendencies that abstract humans into disembodied subjects (modern individualism) and against secular accounts that treat place as merely instrumental. 
 - Corrects readings of vocation that neglect local rootedness and communal practices, offering a corrective to both privatized piety and uncritical cultural accommodation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Treats *dwelling* as a central theological verb - ecclesial and cultural acts make and sustain places. 
 - Introduces a practical-theological nexus: liturgy, hospitality, and vocation as concrete means of place-making.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Appreciated in Reformed and evangelical circles for integrating biblical theology with cultural engagement; used in environmental theology, urban theology, and Christian public theology courses. 
 - Influenced discussions on how churches embody faith in local contexts and resist placeless market forces.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a durable framework for connecting doctrine (creation, incarnation, eschatology) to ethics and praxis. 
 - Serves as a conceptual bridge between biblical theology and concrete pastoral/urban practices.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Place:** Theologically charged locale where creaturely life, relationships, and divine presence converge; more than geographic space. 
- **Dwelling:** Active verb signifying God's presence (tabernacle/incarnation) and human practices that receive and respond to that presence. 
- **Vocation:** Calling to embodied, local tasks - not only personal career but communal stewardship of place. 
- **Dominion:** Reinterpreted as faithful stewardship and cultural creativity that serves neighbors and creation. 
- **Cultural mandate:** The mandate to steward and cultivate creation, contextualized in covenantal responsibility and neighbor-love. 
- **Creational order:** The givenness and limits of creaturely life that shape responsible place-making. 
- **Incarnation:** God's dwelling among humans as the paradigmatic model for sanctified presence in place. 
- **Tabernacle/Temple motifs:** Biblical loci demonstrating God's commitment to inhabit and order place; templates for ecclesial place-making. 
- **Placelessness:** Modern condition of uprootedness and mobility that fragments identity and communal responsibility. 
- **Hospitality:** Practice that re-creates place by opening space for neighbor and stranger, central to Christian witness. 
- **Liturgy:** Ecclesial practice that forms communal memory and anchors people in place. 
- **Neighbor:** Ethical correlate to place; local relationality that constrains and shapes vocation. 
- **Eschatology (place-oriented):** Future consummation or renewed creation that informs present place-formation and hope. 
- **Stewardship:** Practical outworking of dominion and vocation in care for land, culture, and institutions.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition source** for "theology of place" and place-oriented Christian ethics. 
- As a **polemic** against placeless modernity, privatized religion, and exploitative versions of dominion. 
- As an **exegetical model** linking biblical temple/tabernacle and incarnation motifs to contemporary social practices. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching vocation, cultural engagement, environmental stewardship, and urban ministry.
