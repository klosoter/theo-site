### TITLE
What Christians Ought to Believe: An Introduction to Christian Doctrine Through the Apostles' Creed - Michael F. Bird

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical Protestant context (21st-century Australian/Anglo-American theological world).
 - Aimed at catechesis and introductory seminary-level instruction; bridges biblical scholarship, church history, and pastoral theology.
 - Ecumenical posture: uses the Apostles' Creed as a common doctrinal road-map across historic Christian traditions.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Apostles' Creed provides a compact, historically rooted, biblically faithful scaffold for teaching core Christian doctrine; creed shapes belief, worship, and ethical formation.
 - Addresses contemporary confusions (e.g., about the Trinity and Christ) by recovering creedal grammar and testing modern proposals (notably debates over eternal functional subordination).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Walks phrase-by-phrase through the Creed, unpacking biblical texts, patristic and reformational exegesis, and systematic implications.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish biblical and historical warrant for each creedal clause.
 - Differentiate immanent (inner) Trinity language from economic (works of God) language.
 - Apply creed to contemporary doctrinal disputes (e.g., EFS) and pastoral questions.
 - Method: historical-theological exegesis + pastoral application; conservative-ecumenical tone rather than sectarian novelty.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic voices (Athanasius, Cappadocians), Reformers (Calvin), modern systematicians and popular evangelicals.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include proponents and critics in the Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) debate (e.g., proponents like Bruce Ware and critics like Kevin Giles or scholars defending Nicene formulations).
 - Scripture is primary; secondary conversation with systematic theology and recent scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs. economic), Christology (incarnation, two natures, states of humiliation/exaltation), soteriology (atonement, justification, forgiveness), Spirit (person and work), ecclesiology (church as body), sacramental signs, resurrection and eternal life, basic eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - A creedal, biblically rooted catechesis: the Apostles' Creed is presented as the concise grammar Christians ought to learn, confess, and employ to resist error and nourish faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Uses the Apostles' Creed as primary organizing principle rather than a topical systematic order - fosters doctrinal memory and ecumenical continuity.
 - Strong insistence on reading doctrinal claims within both biblical witness and the church's historical teaching.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against theological moves that read role differentiation within the economy as grounds for ontological subordination within the immanent Trinity (i.e., critiques EFS when it implies eternal ontological inequality).
 - Emphasizes the Nicene insistence on co-equality and consubstantiality while allowing ordered roles in the economic Trinity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Accessible reframing of classical terms (e.g., translating perichoresis and eternal generation into pastoral language for lay catechesis).
 - Integrates contemporary Protestant concerns (gender complementarian debates, church practice) with creedal formulations without collapsing one into the other.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as an accessible intro in evangelical churches and classrooms; praised for clarity and fidelity.
 - Received critically among some conservative circles when addressing EFS and hierarchy issues - valued by those seeking a Nicene corrective to modern hierarchical readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable catechetical model: teaches how to read Scripture through creedal categories.
 - Helpful corrective on Trinity debates; balances pastoral application with historical-theological fidelity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Apostles' Creed** - doctrinal skeleton; organizing catechetical tool for systemic exposition.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's self-revelation in history (Father sending Son, Spirit applying redemption); Bird emphasizes role-distinction here.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God in himself; Bird defends Nicene co-equality and rejects ontological subordination.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - the claim that Son is eternally subordinate in role; Bird critiques formulations that convert economic role into ontological inequality.
 - Distinguishes acceptable talk of **ordered relations** in the economy from unacceptable claims of **eternal ontological subordination**.
- **Eternal Generation** - classical doctrine used to account for Son's relation to Father without implying inferiority; Bird affirms its theological usefulness.
- **Perichoresis / Mutual Indwelling** - relational language to express Trinitarian unity without hierarchy.
- **Incarnation / Hypostatic Union** - two natures, one person; Bird explains creedal phrases (born of the Virgin, suffered under Pontius Pilate) in historical-theological context.
- **Atonement language** - penal substitution affirmed within a multi-faceted account (also attends to Christus Victor and exemplar motifs).
- **Resurrection / Bodily Life Everlasting** - creedal promise of bodily resurrection; Bird stresses eschatological hope as pastoral anchor.
- **Church / Body of Christ** - ecclesiology as corporate participation in creedal life; sacraments/signs treated pastorally.
- **Creedal Grammar** - phrase-by-phrase doctrinal literacy; central pedagogical device.
- **Catechesis** - primary use: teaching foundational doctrine to both lay and ministerial audiences.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and catechetical source** for introductory doctrine courses and church instruction.
- As a **polemic resource** in Trinity/EFS debates - a Nicene-informed corrective to claims of eternal ontological subordination.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture through creedal phrases, integrating patristic and Reformation readings into pastoral theology.
