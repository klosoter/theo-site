### TITLE
Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach to the Sciences - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed evangelical milieu. Poythress writes as a philosopher-theologian responding to widespread secularization of science, pervasive scientism, and a Christian academy seeking integration.
 - Draws on a Kuyperian-Reformed heritage (creation-regained, common grace) and contemporary debates in philosophy of science and apologetics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Science must be consciously **redeemed** by a God-centered framework: scientific practice and theory should be governed by biblical theology (creation, providence, covenant, Christ's lordship), rather than by implicit naturalism or the presumed neutrality of methods.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern science has been shaped by **methodological naturalism** and secular philosophies that either exclude God or relegate him to the margins (deistic two-books bifurcation or outright scientism).
 - Prescription: a threefold corrective methodology:
 - **Theological correction** - theological categories (creation, common grace, imago Dei, providence, revelation) must orient the scientist's worldview and goals.
 - **Historical correction** - historicize science: recognize how Christian theology and social contexts have shaped scientific development and how scientific presuppositions change.
 - **Philosophical correction** - analyze and critique philosophical underpinnings of science (epistemology, metaphysics of laws, models) and propose alternatives coherent with Christian doctrine.
 - Practical ramifications: scientific theories and models are instruments within God-ordained regularities; Christians should participate in science, reforming practices and interpretations without conflating biblical exegesis with technical scientific method.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Critiques of **scientism** and methodological naturalism; dialogues with mainstream philosophers of science (e.g., methodological positions such as realism vs instrumentalism).
 - Reformed interlocutors: appeals to Kuyperian and Bavinckian categories (common grace, sovereignty), and to broader evangelical thought on faith/science.
 - Engages contemporary scientists and theologians implicitly where they represent secularizing tendencies or contrasting models of integration.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (as sustaining ground for nature and intelligibility)
 - **Providence** and regularity (laws as expressions of divine ordinance)
 - **Imago Dei** and human cognitive capacity (basis for rational inquiry)
 - **Common grace** (grounds for genuine, non-salvific knowledge in non-Christians)
 - **Revelation / authority of Scripture** as normative for ultimate questions
 - **Christology / Lordship of Christ** as centralizing principle for redemption of intellectual life

- **Closing line**
 - Science must be reclaimed not by anti-intellectualism but by re-centering scientific practice within a biblically informed, theologically rich view of creation under Christ's lordship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on *explicit* theological grounding for scientific practice rather than mere private faith of scientists; theology is epistemically formative, not merely personal.
 - Balances affirmation of scientific competence (common grace) with critique of its metaphysical pretensions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects naive "two-books" approaches that treat nature and Scripture as parallel but autonomous repositories of truth; warns this easily produces deism or compartmentalization.
 - Contrasts with anti-scientific pietism and with secular scientism that denies theological claim on intellectual life.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "redeeming" as a mediate, constructive project - transforming scientific aims, interpretive frameworks, and institutional practices without rejecting technical methodologies.
 - Emphasizes the notion of **models as provisional instruments** within a theological horizon rather than ultimate ontologies.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical academic circles as a programmatic statement for integration; valued as a theological corrective in Christian higher education and by Christian scientists.
 - Critically received by some philosophers of science and scientists who see theological overlay as either unnecessary or insufficiently technical; applauded by those seeking a coherent confessional framework for science.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable, serviceable framework for teaching, ecclesial formation of scientists, and curriculum design in Christian institutions.
 - Maintains practical usability: neither naïvely combative nor uncritically accommodating to secular science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered approach**
 - Science organized and interpreted in light of divine revelation and doctrine; theology shapes aims and presuppositions.

- **Redeeming**
 - Transforming scientific practice and interpretation rather than abandoning or uncritically affirming it.

- **Methodological naturalism**
 - The procedural exclusion of theological causes in scientific method; critiqued as metaphysically loaded when treated as worldview.

- **Scientism**
 - Philosophical claim that science is the only or principal source of reliable knowledge; targeted as an intellectual rival.

- **Common grace**
 - Doctrine explaining why non-Christian science can yield true knowledge; grounds cooperation and shared epistemic fruit.

- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - Basis for human rationality and moral responsibility in scientific inquiry; provides dignity and limits for reductionism.

- **Laws of nature**
 - Understood as regularities instituted and sustained by God (divine ordinance), not autonomous impersonal forces.

- **Two-books doctrine (reworked)**
 - Scripture and creation both convey truth; Poythress rejects a simplistic bifurcation and insists on theological synthesis.

- **Models & instruments**
 - Scientific theories as provisional tools with limited domains, to be evaluated within theological commitments.

- **Theological correction / historical correction / philosophical correction**
 - The tripartite methodological strategy for redeeming science.

- **Christ's lordship**
 - Center of integration: all intellectual disciplines are under Christ's authority and telos.

- **Epistemic humility**
 - Promotes caution regarding metaphysical extrapolations from empirical science.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological guide** in philosophy of science courses within Christian institutions (definition of proper presuppositions).
- As **polemic** against scientism and naive two-books separations in apologetics and theology.
- As a **pedagogical model** for forming Christian scientists-integrating doctrine with practice and ethics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in doctrine of creation and common grace discussions, providing language for cooperation with secular science while maintaining theological distinctives.
