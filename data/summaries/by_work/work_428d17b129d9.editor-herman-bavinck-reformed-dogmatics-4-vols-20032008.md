### TITLE
**Herman Bavinck, Reformed Dogmatics (4 vols., English ed. 2003-2008), ed. John Bolt**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Dutch Reformed theology by Herman Bavinck (1854-1921); English edition edited and introduced by John Bolt and published in the early 21st century, renewing anglophone access to Bavinck's systematic synthesis.
 - Milieu: response to nineteenth-century liberalism, Dutch Neo-Calvinism, and the need to integrate confessional Reformed theology with modern science and philosophy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - A comprehensive, Christ-centered Reformed dogmatics that upholds historic confessions while arguing for a responsible engagement between revelation and reason; treats how God relates to creation via common and special grace.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Organized across traditional loci: prolegomena (revelation and Scripture), doctrine of God and Trinity, creation and providence, anthropology and sin, Christology and redemption, application (soteriology, church, sacraments), and eschatology.
 - Major moves:
 - Ground doctrine firmly in Scripture and confessional tradition.
 - Demonstrate a coherent relationship between natural knowledge of God and special revelation.
 - Define and defend **common grace** and **preparatory grace** as theological keys to explain non-redemptive goodness in the world.
 - Offer a pastoral and philosophical articulation of the covenantal relation between God and creatures.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture and medieval-Reformation sources (notably Calvin); dialogue with Kuyper and the Dutch Neo-Calvinists; engagement with modern philosophy, science, and liberal theology; anticipatory contrasts with later reactions (e.g., Barthian critiques).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, Trinity, God and attributes, creation, providence, **common grace/preparatory grace**, sin and total depravity, Christology (incarnation, two natures), atonement, election and calling, church and sacraments, last things.

- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck's dogmatics centers on a **God-who-relates**: a confessional, Christocentric synthesis that affirms both the distinctiveness of special revelation and the theological significance of general/common grace for understanding the non-redemptive order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Balanced insistence on both general revelation/natural theology and the primacy of special revelation; careful nuance in the doctrine of **common grace** and its subcategory **preparatory grace**.
 - Personalist tone: God's relation to the world is described in relational, covenantal terms rather than abstract metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects rigid scholastic abstraction by integrating living pastoral concerns; refines Kuyperian emphases without abandoning Neo-Calvinist commitments.
 - Differs from Barthian critiques by retaining constructive natural theology and affirming non-redemptive revelation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic theological development and application of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** as explanatory categories for cultural good and the preparation of sinners for the gospel.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Renewed international influence after Bolt's edition: standard reference in Reformed seminaries and for anglophone historical theology; stimulated renewed debate on common grace and natural theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of confessional fidelity integrated with intellectual engagement; indispensable for teaching covenantal and Reformed systematic theology and for debates on the scope of grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace**
 - The non-saving favor of God given to all creation that restrains sin and enables cultural good; central in Bavinck's account of God's relation to the world.

- **Preparatory grace**
 - A subset of common grace: providential influences that **prepare** sinners for the gospel without effecting saving union; important for missions and conversion theology.

- **Special grace**
 - Saving grace given in Christ by the Spirit; distinct from common/preparatory grace.

- **General revelation (natural theology)**
 - God's self-disclosure in creation and conscience; has cognitive value but cannot replace Scripture for salvation.

- **Covenant (pactum)**
 - Relational framework for divine-human interaction; used to interpret election, calling, and ecclesial life.

- **Scripture / revelation**
 - Authority and norm for doctrine; Scripture mediates saving knowledge and grounds dogmatic claims.

- **Person and Decree of God**
 - Emphasis on God's personhood and eternal counsel; sovereignty exercised pastorally and covenantally.

- **Christology (incarnation & atonement)**
 - Two-nature doctrine with an objective accomplishment of redemption and subjective application by the Spirit.

- **Providence**
 - God's governance that preserves creation, orders history, and accomplishes both common and redemptive ends.

- **Sin and total depravity**
 - Comprehensive corruption of the image of God, necessitating divine initiative in salvation.

- **Church and Sacraments**
 - Visible covenant community, sacraments as means of grace within a Reformed ecclesiology.

- **Eschatology**
 - Consummation of covenant promises and restoration of creation in Christ.

- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for terms like common/preparatory grace and covenantal relations.
 - As a **polemic and constructive resource** against both liberal theology and overly skeptical anti-natural theology positions.
 - As an **exegetical-model and conceptual pivot** for integrating doctrine, hermeneutics, and cultural engagement in Reformed teaching and scholarship.
