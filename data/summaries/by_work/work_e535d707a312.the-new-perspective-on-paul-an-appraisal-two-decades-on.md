### TITLE
The New Perspective on Paul: An Appraisal Two Decades On - Robert H. Gundry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th-early 21st century scholarly debate following E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and N. T. Wright. Gundry writes as an established evangelical New Testament exegete addressing two decades of NPP scholarship and its reception in confessional circles.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The New Perspective recovers important historical insights about Second Temple Judaism but, as applied to Paul, it frequently misreads key Pauline categories and undermines classical doctrines of forensic justification and original sin.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Survey of NPP origins and principal claims (Sanders: covenantal nomism; Dunn: redefinition of "works of the law"; Wright: covenantal framework of justification). 
 - Close exegetical examination of core Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians, Philippians) to test NPP assertions about vocabulary and intent. 
 - Semantic and syntactical analysis of disputed terms (e.g., dikaiosyne, ergon/ergazomai, nomos, pistis/pistis Christou). 
 - Theological assessment: consequences for soteriology, imputation, and the forensic language of justification. 
 - Methodological critique: overreliance on sociological analogies and insufficient attention to canonical theological coherence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Primary interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright. Secondary engagement with Krister Stendahl, contemporary exegetes and patristic/Second-Temple Jewish texts used by NPP advocates.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Justification (forensic vs. covenantal readings), covenant theology vs. covenantal nomism, Pauline Christology (Adam-Christ typology), original sin/anthropology, law and grace, ecclesial boundary markers.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Gundry affirms the NPP's historical corrective but insists that faithful exegesis of Paul preserves the Reformation insight of forensic justification and the doctrine of imputed righteousness as central to apostolic soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Persistent insistence on the forensic and legal idiom in Paul as doctrinally decisive, not merely rhetorical. 
 - Careful syntactic and lexical work linking Pauline usage to theological claims (e.g., how dikaiosyne functions in argument). 

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Concedes NPP's retrieval of Jewish context but corrects NPP tendency to minimize universal sin and divine righteousness language in Paul. 
 - Challenges the reduction of "works of the law" to only boundary markers, arguing for a multifaceted Pauline polemic that includes human inability and legal culpability.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Proposes a calibrated hermeneutic that integrates social-historical findings without displacing canonical-theological categories (a corrective synthesis rather than wholesale replacement).

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited in conservative and Reformed critiques of NPP; used as a standard contemporary evangelical reassessment. 
 - Received coolly by many NPP proponents who see Gundry as insufficiently appreciative of sociological readings.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models disciplined exegetical engagement with broad historical scholarship. 
 - Serves as a concise resource for rearticulating traditional doctrines in dialogue with current scholarship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP):** scholarly movement reinterpreting Paul in light of Second Temple Judaism (Sanders, Dunn, Wright). 
- **Covenantal Nomism:** Sanders' description of Judaism as covenant-grace with law as boundary-marker and means of covenant maintenance. 
- **Works of the Law (ergon nomou):** contested phrase - NPP stresses boundary-marker sense; Gundry argues for broader legal/merit implications in Paul. 
- **Justification (dikaiosis/dikaiosyne):** Gundry defends a primarily forensic/declarative reading against covenantal-social readings. 
- **Forensic/Declarative Justification:** the legal declaration of righteousness by God through faith (imputation), central to Gundry's critique. 
- **Imputed Righteousness:** doctrine that righteousness is reckoned to believers; Gundry contends NPP risks sidelining this. 
- **Pistis / Pistis Christou:** debates over "faith in Christ" vs. "faithfulness of Christ"; Gundry generally favors readings preserving Protestant soteriology. 
- **Nomos (Law):** treated as both boundary marker and covenantal burden; Gundry resists exclusive boundary-marker reduction. 
- **Adam-Christ Typology:** Gundry stresses Paul's recourse to Adamic sin and representative heads as proof of universal culpability. 
- **Second Temple Judaism:** background material that NPP emphasizes; Gundry accepts its value but urges careful weighing against Pauline theology. 
- **Antinomianism:** potential pastoral/theological risk Gundry sees if NPP minimizes law's role and the reality of sin. 
- **Pauline Soteriology:** Gundry insists on continuity with classical Reformation categories when interpreting Paul.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **polemic** resource in debates over justification and NPP. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for combining lexical/syntactical analysis with theological concerns. 
 - As a **definition source** for conservative readings of key Pauline terms. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching surveys that contrast NPP claims with Reformation theology.
