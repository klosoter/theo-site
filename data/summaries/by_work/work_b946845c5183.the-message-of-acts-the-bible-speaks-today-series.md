### TITLE
The Message of Acts (The Bible Speaks Today series) - John Stott

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical commentary (IVP/BST series; c. 1990), written by John R. W. Stott, an Anglican evangelical leader shaped by Reformed evangelical theology and pastoral concerns.
 - Written amid debates with secular-critical scholarship and intra-evangelical disputes over the charismatic movement and the role of the Spirit in the church.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Acts narrates the Spirit-empowered, apostolic advance of the risen Christ through witness and mission, producing a disciplined, missionary church. Stott seeks a balanced interpretation of the Spirit (including the Baptism of the Holy Spirit) that avoids both charismatic excess and rationalistic neglect.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preface and theological orientation: Luke as historian-theologian; Acts as bridge from Gospel to Pauline mission.
 - Structural reading follows Luke-Acts narrative arcs:
 - Promise and Pentecost (Acts 1-2): inauguration of the Spirit and mission.
 - Jerusalem church and witness (3-7): evangelism, conflict, martyrdom.
 - Outreach to Judea and Samaria (8-12): gospel crosses social/ethnic boundaries.
 - Pauline missionary expansion (13-21): mission strategy, gospel vs. culture tensions.
 - Journey to Rome (21-28): gospel to the imperial center.
 - Recurrent emphases: kerygma (proclamation), kairos of the Spirit (power), community ethics, and evangelistic praxis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Luke-Acts; principal figures discussed: Peter, Stephen, Philip, Paul, Barnabas, James.
 - Secondary interlocutors: contemporary scholars and movements - conservative exegesis, charismatic proponents, and historical-critical debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Holy Spirit (including Baptism of the Holy Spirit and filling), ecclesiology, mission theology, apostolic authority, conversion/regeneration, sacramental practice (baptism), Christology (resurrection as foundation), and inclusion of Gentiles (Jerusalem Council).
- **Closing line**
 - Acts, for Stott, is the authoritative narrative of how the resurrected Lord, by his Spirit and through apostolic witness, builds a mission-minded church committed to proclamation, holiness, and orderly life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balanced pneumatology: insists on both normative presence of the Spirit for all believers and caution about identifying specific experiential tokens (e.g., tongues) as normative evidence.
 - Mission-centered exegesis: reads every episode as missionary strategy and implication rather than antiquarian history.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters Pentecostal/charismatic readings that treat Spirit-baptism as a separate, subsequent normative experience for empowerment expressed primarily by tongues.
 - Counters minimalist readings that reduce Acts to sociological development without theological center (Stott re-centers resurrection and Spirit).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frequent pairing of **"Word and Spirit"** as complementary powers for mission and fruitfulness.
 - Clear distinction between *baptism of the Spirit* (broad, inaugural work of God associated with conversion and incorporation) and *filling* (repeatable empowerment for service).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in mainstream evangelicalism as a sober, pastoral, and evangelistic commentary; used heavily in preaching and seminary instruction.
 - Critiqued by some charismatics for perceived underemphasis on ongoing charismatic gifts; praised by cessationist/moderate evangelicals for tempering excesses.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of expository preaching-theology that ties careful exegesis to contemporary mission; durable as a pastoral-theological resource on Spirit, church, and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Stott: principally an act of incorporation into Christ and gift of the Spirit at conversion; not necessarily a distinct, subsequent normative experience marked by tongues. (Site usage: engages the topic "Baptism Of The Holy Spirit".)
- **Filling of the Spirit**
 - Distinct from baptism; repeatable experience of empowerment for ministry and witness.
- **Pentecost**
 - Inaugurates the church's mission; paradigmatic model for Spirit-and-Word action.
- **Word and Spirit**
 - Twin engines of mission: proclamation (kerygma) empowered by the Spirit.
- **Kerygma / proclamation**
 - Central content of apostolic ministry; Acts interpreted as evangelistic roadmap.
- **Witness / martyrdom**
 - Witness is both verbal and sacrificial; martyrdom evidences the Spirit's sanctifying work.
- **Signs and wonders**
 - Attested as adjuncts to proclamation: confirmatory but not primary criteria for faith.
- **Church / ekklesia**
 - A missionary, disciplined community marked by order, teaching, fellowship, and outreach.
- **Apostolic authority**
 - Luke portrays apostolic decisions (e.g., Jerusalem Council) as normative for church unity and mission.
- **Conversion / regeneration**
 - Linked with reception of the Spirit; conversion is not solely intellectual assent but Spirit-wrought life-change.
- **Gentile inclusion / Jerusalem Council**
 - Crucial for understanding mission: gospel transcends ethnic boundaries under Spirit-guided apostolic leadership.
- **Order / discipline**
 - Stott emphasizes orderly worship and church life as evidence of apostolic pattern.
- **How this work is used**
 - As an exegetical and homiletical model emphasizing mission-driven reading of Acts.
 - As a moderate-pneumatological reference in debates over Spirit baptism and charismatic practice.
 - As a pastoral resource for church order, evangelism strategy, and teaching on the Spirit's normative work.
