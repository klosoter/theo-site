### TITLE
Dynamics of Faith - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar (1950s) Protestant theological landscape; Tillich as a leading figure in liberal/neo‑orthodox and existential theology.
 - Cultural milieu: existentialism, secularization, crisis of meaning after WWII and during the Cold War; dialogue with modern philosophy (Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Hegel) and social theory (Marx, Freud).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned**: an existential act in which a person's ultimate concern (that which gives ultimate meaning and ground of existence) claims the whole person.
 - Problem addressed: how to define authentic religious faith in a modern, critical age without reducing it to mere assent, sentiment, or objective propositions.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Analytic definition of faith distinguished from belief, knowledge, and opinion.
 - Examination of types of faith: idolatrous vs. authentic; personal vs. literalistic; subjective vs. objective.
 - Faith and doubt: doubt is intrinsic and can coexist with authentic faith; faith is dynamic, not static.
 - Role of symbols and myths: religious language is symbolic and participates in the reality it points to; literalizing symbols destroys their function.
 - Salvation and soteriology reframed: salvation as restoration of the individual's relation to ultimate concern, producing the courage to be.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Kierkegaard on subjectivity/faith, Hegelian categories, existential analysis (Heideggerian terminology at times), and critiques/contrasts with Karl Barth (revelation emphasis), Rudolf Bultmann (demythologizing), and liberal historicism.
 - Uses biblical materials as symbolic carriers rather than strict propositional texts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Soteriology**: salvation as existential reconciliation to ultimate concern.
 - **Bibliology**: scripture as symbolic witness rather than literal deposit of propositions.
 - **Theology Proper**: God as ultimate ground/Being‑itself implied throughout.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments**: communal structures as contexts for faith formation (treated more pastorally than sacramentally technical).
 - **Christology & Trinity**: present indirectly via symbols and existential claims rather than systematic dogmatics.
- **Closing line**
 - Tillich centers theology on **faith as the existential, ultimate concern that grounds human existence and enables the courage to be**, reframing salvation, scripture, and doctrine in symbolic-existential terms.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **"Ultimate concern"** replaces propositional definitions of faith-faith is ontological and existential rather than merely cognitive.
 - Faith as a **state** or act that includes and transcends belief, will, and emotion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects both **fideism** (faith as blind assent) and **rationalism** (faith reducible to assent to propositions).
 - Distinguishes his position from Barth's revelation‑centered objectivism by stressing the human existential situation and the symbolic mediation of divine reality.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear deployment of **symbolic language theory** (symbols participate in the reality they signify).
 - Systematic use of existential categories (anxiety, estrangement, courage) to articulate doctrinal themes.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in mainline Protestant theology, pastoral theology, and theological education; used as a bridge between existential philosophy and systematic theology.
 - Criticized by conservatives for relativizing propositional revelation and by radical critics for insufficiently social or political reading.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust, serviceable framework for thinking of faith in pluralistic, secular contexts and for pastoral application where existential questions dominate.
 - Continues to function as a conceptual pivot between doctrine and human existential concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith** - the existential state of being ultimately concerned; not merely assent to propositions.
- **Ultimate concern** - that which demands total surrender and gives ultimacy to a person's life.
- **Belief vs. faith** - belief: cognitive assent; faith: total orientation of existence (belief can be component of faith).
- **State of being grasped** - faith as being claimed by that which gives ultimacy (passive and active dimensions).
- **Symbolic language** - religious language that points beyond itself and participates in meaning; literalism is a category error.
 - Contrast: literal/propositional reading vs. symbolic/participatory reading.
- **Doubt** - intrinsic to authentic faith; a dynamic tension that clarifies rather than negates faith.
- **Idolatry (as false faith)** - when finite objects are made ultimate; critique of substitutional loyalties.
- **Salvation** - restoration of orientation to ultimate concern; existential reconciliation and the "courage to be."
- **Revelation as event** - revelation occurs in the interaction between human questions and the answer of the ultimate; not merely a historical deposit of propositions.
- **Courage to be** - correlated existential fruit of true faith (closely linked in Tillich's broader corpus).
- **Correlational method** - theological method tying existential questions to theological answers (used to bridge philosophy and theology).
- **Myth vs. symbol** - myth gives narrative shape; symbol mediates reality; both must be reinterpreted, not simply eliminated.
- **Ground of Being / Being‑itself** - God described in ontological terms, often indirectly in Dynamics but central to Tillich's metaphysics.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary soteriology and pastoral theology (faith as ultimate concern).
 - As a **polemic** against both fideism and literalist biblical readings in bibliology and ecclesiology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture and Christian symbols symbolically rather than propositionally.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theology proper and ethical pastoral practice, linking existential human questions to doctrinal claims.
