### TITLE
Did the First Christians Worship Jesus?
James D. G. Dunn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century British New Testament scholarship (1970s-1980s); product of Dunns broader work on early Christology (e.g., Christology in the Making).
 - Situated within debates over origins of Christian worship and continuity with Jewish monotheism.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Yes**: earliest Christians did worship Jesus. This worship is best understood as a response to Jesus' resurrection and exaltation, mediated by the Spirit, and compatible with Jewish monotheism because it treats Jesus as God's appointed, vindicated agent rather than as a rival deity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of early Christian practice and texts for functional evidence of worship (prayer, invocation, hymns, doxologies, liturgy).
 - Exegetical focus on Pauline and pre-Pauline materials that show corporate worship patterns (e.g., confession, hymnic material, uses of Kyrios).
 - Theological framing: resurrection as the decisive event that confers Lordship; Spirit as the ongoing presence enabling veneration and communion.
 - Methodological move: distinguish **functional worship** (what early Christians did) from later metaphysical theological formulations (how later theologians explained it).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages historical-critical tradition on early Christology (responses to minimalist readings that deny early Jesus-devotion).
 - Dialogues implicitly with scholars like Harnack (who minimized early worship), Bultmannian existential readings, and anticipates/contrasts with later emphases from Hurtado and Bauckham.
 - Uses Pauline letters, early creedal fragments, liturgical traces, and Gospel early traditions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (origin and form of early devotion)
 - **Resurrection and New Creation** (central to vindication and Lordship)
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit's role in presence, adoption, and worship)
 - **Worship, monotheism, and Trinity** (implicit: how devotion to Jesus functioned within Jewish monotheism; proto-trinitarian patterns)
- **Closing line**
 - Dunn's theological center of gravity: **worship of Jesus grew organically from the resurrection-exaltation event and the Spirit-mediated presence of the risen Lord, producing a high functional Christology that remained embedded in Jewish monotheism.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats worship as primarily a corporate, liturgical phenomenon (what communities did) rather than a strictly doctrinal or metaphysical statement.
 - Makes the **resurrection and new-creation motif** decisive: worship is granted because God has vindicated Jesus and inaugurated new creation.
 - Stresses the **Spirit's role** in making Christ present and worship-worthy within the believing community.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects earlier views that early devotion to Jesus was either absent or purely metaphorical (e.g., Harnackian minimalism).
 - Differs from some later scholars (e.g., Hurtado) by emphasizing continuity with Jewish monotheism and the transformative role of resurrection/Spirit rather than treating devotion as a novel, devotional innovation alone.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clear functional distinction between worship-practice and theological explanation; uses liturgical and confessional data as primary evidence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in New Testament Christology debates; widely cited as a moderate, historically grounded case for early Jesus-devotion.
 - Provoked further detailed work (positive and corrective) from scholars emphasizing ritual forms, iconography, and the speed/shape of devotional developments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a methodological template: read early liturgical practice and pre-Pauline confessions as primary evidence for the shape of early Christology.
 - Valuable for teaching historical-christology and for ecclesial reflection on worship's origins.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Worship (latreia / proskuneo)** - Dunn emphasizes observable liturgical acts (prayer, doxology, proskuneo) rather than later metaphysical labels.
- **Kyrios (Lord)** - Functional title used in invocation and confession; signals divine authority conferred by God's vindication.
- **Resurrection / New Creation** - Central explanatory category: resurrection vindicates Jesus and inaugurates God's new creation, which grounds worship of him.
 - (Site usage: Resurrection And New Creation)
- **Exaltation** - The post-resurrection status that makes Jesus a proper object of worship.
- **Spirit / Pneumatic presence** - The Spirit is the mechanism by which the risen Christ is present and experienced in worship and community life.
 - (Site usage: Spirits Role In Christs Ministry And Resurrection)
- **High Christology (functional)** - Early high devotion to Jesus based on function (worship, lordship) rather than late metaphysical Christology.
- **Creedal/confessional fragments** - Early formulary evidence (hymns, confessions) used as primary witness to worship practices.
- **Monotheism (Jewish continuity)** - Dunn insists worship of Jesus was framed within Jewish monotheistic commitment, not a collapse into polytheism.
- **Agent/Representative motif** - Jesus as God's agent in Israel and in new creation; worship follows from God's appointment rather than metaphysical identity claims.
- **Liturgical practice** - Primary evidence field (baptismal confession, Eucharistic hymnody, invocation).
- **Vindication / justification** - Resurrection as divine vindication that justifies elevated status.
- **Adoption / Participation** - Themes explaining believers' relationship to Christ in Spirit-enabled worship.
- **Doxology** - Used as evidence for explicit worship and as locus where Jesus receives praise.
- **Invocation / Prayer** - Practical signs of worship directed to or through Jesus in early communities.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **historical-definition source** for "worship" in early Christological studies.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and pre-Pauline liturgical material.
- As a **polemic resource** against minimalist claims denying early Jesus-devotion.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking resurrection, Spirit, and the origin of Christian worship.
