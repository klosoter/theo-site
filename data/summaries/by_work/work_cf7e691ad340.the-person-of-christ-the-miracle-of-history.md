### TITLE
The Person of Christ: The Miracle of History - Philip Schaff

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century Protestant historical theology (Schaff as Swiss‑American church historian and ecumenical Protestant).
 - Located at the intersection of confessional Christology and the rising historical‑critical method; addresses modern skepticism about the supernatural by grounding Christology in history.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus of Nazareth is an objectively historical person whose divine‑human unity (the Incarnation) is a genuine "miracle of history" that must be defended against mythicism, docetism, and reductive naturalism.
 - The anthropological question of the origin of the human soul (Traducianism vs Creationism) is treated as a subsidiary but relevant issue for understanding Christ's humanity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical reconstruction: surveys patristic, medieval, and Reformation treatments of the Person of Christ to show doctrinal continuity and development.
 - Theological analysis: emphasizes the hypostatic union (one Person, two natures) as the linchpin that preserves both full deity and genuine humanity.
 - Apologetic aim: argues that the historicity of the Incarnation is credible and indispensable for Christian doctrine and piety.
 - Anthropological excursus: examines how different accounts of the human soul (traducian vs creationist) inform soteriology and Christology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Extensive engagement with Patristic authors, medieval scholastics (verbal categories like hypostasis/physis), Reformation theologians, and contemporary critics of supernaturalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), Trinity (implications for personhood), Christian anthropology (origin of the soul), original sin, soteriology, revelation and history.
- **Closing line**
 - Schaff situates the Person of Christ as a decisive historical‑theological fact: the Incarnation is a unique historical miracle that must govern both doctrinal formulation and pastoral faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly historical method: doctrine is judged by its rootedness in the historical person of Jesus and the continuous witness of the church.
 - Balances confessional fidelity with critical historiography - neither naive pietism nor reductive rationalism.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against 19th‑century liberal tendencies that demythologize Jesus by insisting on the intelligible reality of miraculous events within history.
 - Corrects overly metaphysical treatments that detach Christology from concrete historical testimony.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses "miracle of history" as a programmatic phrase: miracles are not irrational intrusions but historically grounded divine actions that bear theological meaning.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Anglo‑American seminaries as a model of historically informed orthodox Christology; served ecumenical readers seeking synthesis of tradition and scholarship.
 - Influential in debates on the role of historical method in dogmatics and in popular defenses of the Incarnation against late‑modern skepticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, historically rich defense of the hypostatic union and shows how anthropological presuppositions (e.g., soul origin) impact but do not overturn core Christology.
 - Useful exemplar for integrating patristic resources with modern historical concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation** - God becoming man in Jesus; Schaff treats this as the primary "miracle of history."
- **Hypostatic Union** - One Person (hypostasis) with two natures; the doctrinal pivot of the work.
- **Person (hypostasis / prosopon)** - Terminology traced historically to show continuity in orthodox formulations.
- **Nature (physis)** - The distinction of human and divine natures maintained without confusion or division.
- **Miracle of history** - Schaff's phrase framing the Incarnation as historically attested and theologically decisive.
- **Anthropology (origin of the soul)** - Background category connecting human constitution to Christology.
 - **Traducianism** - The soul is transmitted by the parents; economical explanation of human generation and the transmission of sin; Schaff presents it as historically prominent and explanatorily useful.
 - **Creationism (of souls)** - Each soul is specially created by God; preserves divine sovereignty and immediate creation; Schaff shows why many orthodox theologians preferred it while noting its tensions with natural generation.
- **Original sin** - Explored as an implication: how sin transmits bears on which anthropological view is held.
- **Patristic testimony** - Schaff's methodological axis: authoritative witness shaping later dogma.
- **Kenosis** - Briefly treated in relation to Christ's self‑emptying and the mystery of genuine human limitation with divine fullness.
- **Historical testimony / apologetic** - Schaff's appeal to credible historical evidence against mythicist readings.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for hypostatic union and historically grounded Christology.
- As a **polemic** against both rationalist demythologizing and metaphysical abstractions that detach doctrine from history.
- As an **exegetical-historical model** for integrating patristic witness with modern critical concerns and for framing subsidiary debates (e.g., traducianism vs creationism) in service of Christological coherence.
