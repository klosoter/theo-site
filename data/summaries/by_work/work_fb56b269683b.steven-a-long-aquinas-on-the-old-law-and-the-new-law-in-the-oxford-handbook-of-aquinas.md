### TITLE
Steven A. Long, "Aquinas on the Old Law and the New Law" (in The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas) - chapter treating Thomas Aquinas's account of law, law-fulfillment in Christ, and the relation of Mosaic and Gospel norms.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary secondary study within a major Oxford Handbook (21st century). Situates Aquinas in scholastic, patristic, and biblical-theological conversation. Engages medieval categories (moral/ceremonial/judicial law) against modern covenantal and ethical readings.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To explicate Aquinas's coherent account of the Old Law and the New Law, showing how the Mosaic Law is related to natural law, how the New Law perfects but does not abolish the moral order, and how Christ effects fulfillment via grace and sacrament.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Presents Aquinas's threefold taxonomy of the law (moral, ceremonial, judicial) and traces differing fates for each under the Gospel. 
 - Argues New Law (lex nova) is primarily an interior, gracious law of charity that perfects the natural/moral law rather than contradicting it. 
 - Explains Aquinas's role for Christological fulfillment and typology: ceremonial elements prefigure sacraments and are abrogated in juridical application while moral precepts remain and are elevated. 
 - Connects Aquinas's legal categories to sacramental theology and the end (beatitude) toward which law rightly directs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Aquinas's own Scriptural exegesis, Augustine, Gratian, Lombard, Aristotle (natural law background), and later reception by scholastics. Chapter also frames Aquinas against modern covenantal thinkers (notably Klinean covenant emphases) and newer ethical discussions (notably frameworks labeled "intrusion ethics").
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation, law (natural and positive), grace, virtue and habit (charity), Christology (fulfillment motif), typology and sacrament, moral theology, and ecclesial mediation of law.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - Aquinas presents the New Law as the interiorizing, grace-giving perfection of a law grounded in nature and fulfilled in Christ - juridical elements give way to sacramental and moral transformation rather than simple legal repeal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Law conceived not merely as external command but as formative habit/virtue (the New Law as infused charity) that reorders will and directs to final beatitude. 
 - Careful threefold legal taxonomy tied to differing destinies under the Gospel (ceremonial abrogation, moral permanence and perfection, judicial contingency).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Contrasts with readings that collapse Old and New into continuity or antithesis only; Aquinas holds both continuity (natural law) and discontinuity (ceremonial/judicial changes). 
 - Offers a corrective to Klinean covenantal reduction by not privileging covenantal categories over classical natural-law and sacramental categories - law/grace relation is mediated through Christ and ecclesial means, not strictly covenantal formulae.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reinforces the notion of the New Law as a constitutive habit (lex informata by charity) rather than only a set of new precepts; the idea of law "perfecting" nature via grace is foregrounded.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valuable in Catholic moral theology and sacramental theology; used by some Reformed scholars as a foil or resource when comparing covenantal systems and natural-law ethics. Modern handbook chapter helps bridge medieval scholastic categories and contemporary law/grace debates.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Clarifies medieval legal taxonomy, supplies a robust model for thinking about internalization of moral norms, and furnishes a historically grounded alternative to purely covenantal or purely legalistic accounts of law and Gospel.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Old Law (Lex Veteris):** Mosaic legislation as received - analyzed by Aquinas into moral, ceremonial, judicial components. 
- **New Law (Lex Nova or Lex Christi):** The Gospel-law implanted by Christ and given by grace; principally the law of charity that interiorizes obligation. 
- **Natural Law (Lex Naturalis):** Eternal law accessible through reason; moral precepts that remain normative and are perfected by the New Law. 
- **Divine Positive Law (Lex Positiva Divina):** Commands given by God that are not deducible by reason alone (e.g., ceremonial precepts). 
- **Moral/Ceremonial/Judicial distinction:** Scholastic threefold taxonomy determining what endures, is fulfilled, or is abrogated under the Gospel. 
- **Charity (Caritas):** Central operative term for the New Law - the infused habit that orders the will to God and transforms obedience. 
- **Fulfillment (Plerosis/Adimpletio):** Christ's work as bringing Mosaic typology to completion; a hermeneutical key in Aquinas. 
- **Typology/Sacramental reading:** Ceremonial law points forward to sacraments; sacramental economy mediates the New Law. 
- **Grace and habitus:** Emphasis on legal obligation becoming a stable interior disposition through grace. 
- **Law as pedagogy (Paedagogia):** Old Law functions as tutor to Christ, preparing humans for grace. 
- **Abrogation vs. Perfection:** Distinction between laws ended by the Gospel and those preserved and elevated. 
- **Klinean Covenant Theology (relation):** A covenantal framework often contrasted with Aquinas's law/grace structure; Aquinas supplies alternative categories (natural law, sacrament) that challenge strict covenantal readings. 
- **Intrusion Ethics (relation):** Aquinas's privileging of interior formation and charity offers a corrective to ethical frameworks that focus chiefly on external intrusion of law into life; he reorients ethics toward internal dispositions supported by sacrament and grace.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a historical-definition source for medieval taxonomies of law (moral/ceremonial/judicial). 
- As a polemical resource against readings that reduce law/grace to covenantal binaries (e.g., Klinean categories). 
- As an exegetical and theological model for continuity-and-fulfillment readings of Scripture (typology, Christ as fulfillment). 
- As a conceptual pivot in moral theology to argue law's interiorization by grace (useful in debates with "intrusion" or strictly externalist ethics).
