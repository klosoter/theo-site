### TITLE
**Robert W. Jenson - Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: The Triune God (1997)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century postliberal and confessional Lutheran milieu; strong engagement with Karl Barth and retrieval of classical Nicene theology for contemporary doctrine.
 - Conversation partner to analytic, Thomistic, and Rahnerian currents in continental and Anglo-American theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - The being of God is essentially **triune** and must be known through the economy (God's acts in history); doctrine must order theological claims around the triune life as revealed and enacted in salvation-history.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory move: critique of abstract metaphysics that detaches divine attributes from the triune story.
 - Recovery of Nicene-Cappadocian grammar: Persons/relation are constitutive of God's being.
 - Methodological thesis: the *economic* ordering of God (revelation, incarnation, covenant) is the decisive locus for speaking of the *immanent* Trinity.
 - Practical consequences: reinterprets traditional attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) in light of the triune narrative and Christ's suffering and resurrection.
 - Systematic implications extend to creation, revelation, Christology, and eschatology (though Christology is developed more fully in later volumes).

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary dialogue with **Karl Barth** (esp. on economy/immanent Trinity) and the Cappadocians/Augustine.
 - Critical engagement with **Karl Rahner** (and his formulative "Rahner's rule") and modern attribute-theology (Aquinas, later scholasticism).
 - Uses Scripture, creeds, and post-Nicene theologians as norms for doctrinal ordering.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (central), with sustained implications for **revelation**, **creation**, **covenant**, **Christology**, and theological method.

- **Closing line**
 - Jenson's work centers theology on the triune God whose identity is known only as the communal, historical life disclosed in revelation; doctrine is therefore a canonical, story-shaped ordering of God's triune acts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as story-centered: God's being is narrated in divine acts rather than deduced from metaphysical first principles.
 - Persons as constitutive relations: the Trinitarian persons are real relations revealed in history, not merely logical distinctions.
 - Temporal and historical weight: divine life is intelligible through God's actions in time (especially incarnation and resurrection).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - To **Rahner's Rule** (the identity of economic and immanent Trinity): Jenson follows **Barth's reformulation**, insisting the economic revelation is determinative for speaking of the immanent Trinity, but pushes Barth further by making the economy constitutive of God's being-language.
 - To classical attribute-theology: resists treating **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility** as static metaphysical absolutes detached from God's triune, self-giving life.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Story-shaped" ontology of God; doctrinal ordering that privileges narrative coherence over abstract attribute lists.
 - A pragmatic re-reading of attributes as relational and narratively conditioned.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in late-20th-century Protestant theology; revitalized Trinitarian retrieval in North American Lutheran and wider ecumenical circles.
 - Provoked critique from analytic theologians and classical metaphysicians for perceived under-specification of metaphysical claims.

- **Enduring value**
 - Strong pedagogical resource for re-centering the Trinity; stimulates fresh work on the relation of doctrine, Scripture, and history; indispensable for debates on divine attributes and the economy/immanent Trinity tension.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (Triune God)** - God is three persons who constitute one divine life; doctrine is anchored in the narrative of revelation.
- **Economic Trinity** - God as revealed in God's acts in history; for Jenson, the decisive locus for speaking of God.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inner life; Jenson aligns with Barth's move that the immanent must be read through the economic, contra an abstract identity reading.
- **Rahner's Rule** - the formula that "the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity"; Jenson critiques the unqualified identity and appeals to Barth's reformulation that revelation governs our language about the immanent life.
- **Barth's Reformulation** - Barth's corrective stressing that revelation in history shapes claims about God's inner life; Jenson adopts and radicalizes this hermeneutic.
- **Person / Persons (hypostases)** - real relations revealed historically; personhood is relational, not mere substratum plus properties.
- **Narrative / History / Economy** - central methodological category: the shape of doctrine is a canonical ordering of divine acts.
- **Simplicity** - traditional metaphysical claim reinterpreted: God's unity is not a bare static simplicity but unity in triune relationality; attribute must be measured by economy.
- **Aseity** - preserved as divine self-possession but recast: aseity coexists with constitutive self-giving within the Trinity.
- **Immutability** - Jenson resists an abstraction of unchangeability; God's character is steadfast though revealed dynamically in history (not passively timeless).
- **Impassibility** - re-evaluated in light of Christ's passion: impassibility cannot be used to deny God's participation in suffering as revealed in the crucifixion.
- **Perichoresis / relations** - mutual indwelling describes the interpenetration of persons but is read narratively rather than purely metaphysically.
- **Revelation / Scripture / Creeds** - normative sources that order doctrinal claims around the triune story.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: authoritative articulations of a narrative, Barth-shaped Trinitarian grammar.
 - As a **polemic**: corrective to Rahnerian identity-claims and to abstract attribute-theology (simplicity/immutability/impassibility).
 - As an **exegetical-model**: exemplifies reading Scripture and creedal tradition to construct systematic doctrine.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for social/narrative Trinitarian projects and debates on divine temporality and suffering.
