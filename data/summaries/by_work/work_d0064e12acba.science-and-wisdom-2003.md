### TITLE
**Science and Wisdom** (2003) - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in early 21st century amid intensified dialogue between theology and contemporary natural science (quantum physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology) and renewed hermeneutical debates over Genesis.
 - Moltmann writes from a post-war German Protestant context, shaped by his eschatological theology, ecological concerns, and prior works (Theology of Hope, Trinity and the Kingdom).
- **Central thesis**
 - Theology must recover and reclaim **wisdom (sophia)** as a distinct discipline that mediates between scientific knowledge and theological meaning; science supplies factual description, theology supplies eschatological, ethical and relational interpretation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modernity separated knowledge from wisdom; science excels at explanatory description but cannot supply existential meaning.
 - Methodological proposal: develop a **theological science** that is rigorous, dialogical with empirical science, yet oriented by eschatological hope.
 - Exegetical application: re-read Genesis 1-11 and the doctrine of Adam in light of scientific insights and theological categories (see below on Days of Creation, Historicity).
 - Epistemology: knowledge of God arises in the interplay of revelation (Christ and Spirit) and critical appropriation of natural knowledge, requiring epistemic humility.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with scientists (cosmologists, evolutionary biologists), modern philosophers of science, classical theologians (Augustine on creation-time), and contemporary theologians (Karl Barth, Hans Küng, and ecological theologians). Dialogues tacitly with Darwinian accounts and with biblical literalists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (ongoing, temporal, eschatological), **revelation** (Christ as decisive disclosure), **anthropology** (Adam: corporate/federal questions), **soteriology** (hope and future), **theological method** (theology as disciplined, scientific reflexivity), and **epistemology** (limits of scientific knowing vs. theological wisdom).
- **Closing line**
 - Moltmann centers theology as an eschatologically informed wisdom-discipline: theology does not replace science but reinterprets its findings within a hope-shaped narrative that sustains ethical responsibility and Christian meaning.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates classical "wisdom" language as the proper mediating category between empirical knowledge and theological meaning; insists theology be a science of hope rather than a merely propositional system.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both naive scientism (that science supplies ultimate meaning) and literalist biblicism (that Genesis supplies scientific historiography). Opposes any theology that isolates doctrine from the empirical world.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames theology as a **dialogical scientific discipline**: accountable to empirical data yet normed by eschatological revelation; promotes a "principia" for theology that is both critical and constructive.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received among mainline Protestant and ecotheological circles; influential in shaping constructive conversations about evolution, creation exegesis, and the role of hope in scientific-theological integration. Met with caution in conservative literalist contexts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating scientific findings with theological meaning without capitulating to scientism or fundamentalism; valuable for courses on science-and-religion, contemporary doctrine, and hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Wisdom (sophia)** - Theological capacity to integrate facts into meaningful, ethical, eschatological interpretation; contrasts with mere factual knowledge.
- **Theology as science (theological science / principia)** - Theology conceived as disciplined, methodical, dialogical with empirical science while anchored in revelation.
- **Eschatological orientation** - The future-centered prism through which creation, knowledge, and ethics are read; hope structures interpretive claims.
- **Scientism** - Critiqued stance that reduces all meaning to scientific explanation; Moltmann rejects its normative authority.
- **Revelation and Christocentrism** - Knowledge of God is grounded in the crucified and risen Christ and mediated by the Spirit; theology must remain revelatory in source and aim.
- **Epistemic humility** - A posture toward scientific claims that recognizes limits of both empirical and theological knowing.
- **Creation as process / ongoing creation** - Days of Creation read dynamically (not necessarily 24-hour chronology); creation viewed as an open, temporal, relational event and promise.
 - Relates to Days of Creation: prefers figurative/analogical readings that allow accommodation of cosmology and evolutionary narratives.
- **Historicity of Adam** - Moltmann treats Adam primarily as a theological and covenantal figure (federal headship as corporate representation) rather than insisting on lone biological historicity.
- **Federal headship** - Emphasis on corporate, symbolic, covenantal role of Adam in theological anthropology and sin/solidarity schema.
- **Genesis 1-11** - Read as theological narrative conveying origins, human vocation, sin, and promise - not as scientific primer; exegetical model encourages thematic-theological reading sensitive to historical-critical insights.
- **Science-scripture dialogue** - A model for mutual critique and enrichment: science informs biblical interpretation; theology supplies normative meaning and ethical implications.
- **Knowledge of God** - Integrative: epistemology grounded in revelation, tested by communal discernment, and informed (but not determined) by scientific knowledge.
- **Praxis and ethics** - Wisdom implies practical responsibility (ecology, bioethics) flowing from integration of scientific insight and theological vision.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for "theology as a scientific discipline" that is dialogical and eschatologically oriented.
- As a **polemic** against both scientism and literalist readings of Genesis.
- As an **exegetical model** for non-literal but theologically robust readings of Days of Creation and Genesis 1-11.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions about Adam (historicity vs. federal headship) and the epistemology of theological knowledge in the science-theology interface.
