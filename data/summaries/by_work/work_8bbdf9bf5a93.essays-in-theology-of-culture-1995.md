### TITLE
Essays in Theology of Culture (1995) - Robert W. Jenson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century postliberal/neo-orthodox conversation; Jenson writing from a Lutheran systematic perspective attentive to contemporary culture, modern philosophy (Hegel, Heidegger), and Barthian retrieval.
 - Responds to debates about theology's public role, modernity, and the adequacy of classical theism for cultural engagement.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must understand God and culture in light of the triune God's self-revealing historical action; classical abstract formulations of divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) require reinterpretation so doctrine can account for God's temporal acting in history and the church's cultural vocation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology of culture framed by the economy of the Trinity: God's identity is not a static metaphysical substratum but disclosed and constituted in the divine life as Trinity and in the sending/mission of the Son and Spirit.
 - Major moves:
 - Diagnose the limits of classical theistic semantics when brought to bear on cultural theology (e.g., God as abstract "ground" versus historical Lord).
 - Re-articulate attributes relationally: preserve theological stakes (sovereignty, faithfulness) while reading simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility through the narrative of Christ.
 - Show how a Trinitarian, Christ-centered theology equips the church to critique, transform, and interpret cultures without collapsing into accommodation or abstraction.
 - Method: theological-historical retrieval + constructive redefinition; critical engagement with modern philosophers and theologians.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Aquinas (divine attributes), Karl Barth (influence on economy/immanent Trinity relations), Hegel (modernity and culture), J. Moltmann and process/"suffering-God" streams (contrast/critique), Tillich and neo-orthodox cultural theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (incarnation as disclosure of God), revelation, providence and covenantal faithfulness, eschatology as interpretive horizon for culture, and explicit treatment of attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility.

- **Closing line**
 - Jenson insists that a credible theology of culture must be anchored in the triune, historically acting God: divine attributes must be read through the narrative of the Son and Spirit so that God remains sovereign and faithful without becoming an inert metaphysical absolute.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly narrative and Trinitarian: doctrine is first and primarily about the God who acts in history (the economy) and secondarily about metaphysical abstraction.
 - Balances fidelity to classical categories with constructive revision: keeps the theological "weight" of attributes while resisting their decontextualized, static deployment.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against classical abstract metaphysics: rejects reading attributes as divorced from God's relational, temporal self-disclosure.
 - Against truncations of Barth/Moltmann: affirms God's transcendence and aseity (contra some readings of a wholly "passible" God) while insisting on genuine divine involvement and suffering in Christ (countering strict impassibility).
 - Against process theology: rejects notion that God changes in essence; instead presents change as relational/historical without ontological instability.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Relational reading of classical attributes - e.g., **simplicity** as coherence of the divine life disclosed in Trinity, not as an abstract lack of internal distinction divorced from relations.
 - Use of "economy-first" hermeneutic to reframe metaphysical predicates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in postliberal and ecumenical systematic theology circles for bridging classical and contemporary concerns.
 - Influential for theologians rethinking divine attributes in light of Christology and cultural engagement; critiqued by some Thomistic and classical-theist scholars for attenuating metaphysical precision.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust model for integrating doctrine and cultural theology: keeps doctrinal seriousness while enabling theological critique of modernity and culture.
 - Useful pedagogically for teaching how doctrine informs public theology without capitulating to either metaphysical abstraction or secular reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (economy/immanent relation)** - central hermeneutic key: God's being is disclosed in the sending of Son and Spirit; doctrinal claims must be read through this economy.
- **Simplicity** - retained but reframed: not mere lack of composition but the coherence of divine life as manifested in triune relations.
- **Aseity** - affirmed: God's self-existence remains nondependent; Jenson however emphasizes aseity alongside God's free self-giving in history.
- **Immutability** - nuanced: God's faithfulness and identity are stable; divine "change" is understood relationally (in action) rather than ontologically altering the divine essence.
- **Impassibility** - qualified rejection: Jenson resists rigid impassibility; God truly suffers in the passion of the Son, yet divine essence remains the faithful source of action.
- **Economy-first hermeneutic** - method: Scripture's narrative of God's acts governs claims about God's nature.
- **Narrative theology** - theology as interpretive story anchored in the triune God's historical actions.
- **Christology (incarnation/passio)** - site where divine attributes are most plainly reinterpreted and tested.
- **Providence / covenantal faithfulness** - how God relates to culture: governance without domination, fidelity without passivity.
- **Culture** - arena of God's judgment and promise; theology interprets cultural forms in light of gospel narrative.
- **Kenosis (related use)** - Jenson uses kenotic language cautiously: affirms self-giving without implying loss of divine being.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for reading classical attributes in a Trinitarian, narrative frame.
 - As a **polemic** against abstracted classical theism and against simplistic "suffering-God" or process accounts.
 - As an **exegetical model** tying Christological texts to systematic claims about divine attributes and cultural engagement.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on doctrine and public theology - showing how doctrine shapes cultural critique and ecclesial vocation.
