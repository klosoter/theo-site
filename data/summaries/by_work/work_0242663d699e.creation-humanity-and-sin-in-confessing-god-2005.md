### TITLE
Creation, Humanity, and Sin (essay in Confessing God, 2005) - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century Reformed/Anglican theological retrieval; Webster writes within a Barthian and classical Reformed trajectory, reacting to modern naturalism, liberal theology, and reductionist anthropologies. Confessing God collects essays aimed at confessional retrieval for pastoral and dogmatic use.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Human beings are creatures whose identity, vocation, and corruption must be articulated theologically in light of God's action and eschatological purpose; anthropology cannot be framed autonomously from doctrine of God, Christology, and eschatology.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Ground anthropology in **creation ex nihilo** and the Creator/creature distinction: human being exists only by God's faithful and free act.
 - Define the **imago Dei** relationally and Christologically: human identity is constituted by relation to God and finds normative fulfillment in Christ, who is the true human.
 - Analyze **sin** as a disruption of creaturely vocation - not merely moral failure but ontological-relational estrangement rooted in rebellion against God's ordering purpose.
 - Reorient anthropology eschatologically: true human being is realized in the consummation; present existence is provisional and dependent on divine covenantal faithfulness.
 - Conclude with pastoral and ecclesial implications: theology of humanity must serve the church's proclamation and formation toward the kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth (method and Christological emphasis), Calvin (imago Dei, providence), Augustine (sin and will), selected Patristic and Reformational strands; critical engagement with modern naturalism and some contemporary analytic accounts of personhood.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation (creatio), Trinity implicitly as ground for relation, Christology (Christ as true human), eschatology (teleology of humanity), anthropology, sin (hamartia, original/structural), providence, revelation.
- **Closing line:** Human creaturehood, wounded by sin, can only be intelligibly understood and healed within the horizon of God's saving action in Christ and the eschatological fulfillment toward which creation is ordered.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that anthropology is *doctrinally derivative* - it belongs under theology of God and Christ rather than natural philosophy.
 - Presents the **imago Dei** primarily as a relational, eschatological status (fulfilled in Christ) rather than merely functional or substantial.
 - Frames sin as a perversion of vocation and relation rather than simple privation language alone; sin is relational refusal of God's ordering.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against liberal and secular accounts that treat the human as autonomous subject or biologist-reductive descriptions.
 - Reworks older Reformed emphases by re-centering Christ as the normative trope for human identity (Barthian influence) rather than locating identity in an abstract image-bearing capacity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses the language of **eschatological anthropology** to tie present creatureliness firmly to consummative destiny.
 - Emphasizes **vocation** as ontologically constitutive: to be human is to be called to relation with God and neighbor.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely respected among contemporary Reformed and Anglican theologians for theological rigor and clarity; used in advanced seminars on dogmatic anthropology.
 - Criticized by some for heavy reliance on Barthian Christocentrism at the expense of sustained engagement with social-scientific accounts or contemporary philosophy of mind.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplifies how dogmatics can reclaim anthropology from reductionism and provide a coherent, worship-shaped account of human identity for church teaching and formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation (creatio ex nihilo):** God's free origination of the world; grounds creaturely dependence and distinction from God.
- **Creaturehood:** Constitutive status of human beings - finite, dependent, gifted, and vocationed.
- **Imago Dei (image of God):**
 - Understood relationally and teleologically; realized truly in Christ, orienting ethics and ontology.
- **Eschatological anthropology:** The view that human identity is to be understood in light of ultimate consummation - present existence is provisional toward fulfillment in God.
- **Vocation:** The ontological calling of humans to be for God and neighbor; the normative shape of human life.
- **Sin (hamartia):**
 - Treated as relational rebellion and misdirection of creaturely vocation; not reducible to a set of discrete acts.
- **Original sin / corruption:** Structural consequences of communal/ancestral fall; Webster stresses relational and existential distortion rather than simple genetic determinism.
- **Christology (Christ as true human):** Christ is the exemplar and telos of human being; anthropology is christologically normed.
- **Providence:** God's sustaining, ordering activity; underwrites ethical responsibility and eschatological hope.
- **Revelation:** Scripture and Jesus as the decisive disclosure for understanding human destiny and sin.
- **Divine freedom / faithfulness:** God's free act sustains creation; faithfulness secures the possibility of restoration.
- **Ontology vs. ethics:** Webster resists reducing human issues to moralism; ontology (creature-status) frames ethical life.
- **Relational ontology:** Emphasis on persons constituted by relations (to God, others), not isolated substances.
- **Teleology:** Creation oriented toward consummation, which shapes current identity and hope.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for confessional/eschatological anthropology in Reformed dogmatics.
- As a **polemic** against naturalistic, autonomous, or reductionist accounts of human nature.
- As an **exegetical/dogmatic model** for reading Genesis and Pauline anthropology through Christological and eschatological categories.
