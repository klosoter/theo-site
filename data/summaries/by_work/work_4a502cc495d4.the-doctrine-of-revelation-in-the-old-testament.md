### TITLE
**The Doctrine of Revelation in the Old Testament** - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Reformed Princeton milieu; Vos writing as a dogmatic and biblical theologian reacting to higher criticism, romantic subjectivism, and abstract propositional models of revelation.
 - Engages both continental historical theology and Anglo‑American confessionalism; seeks to recover an organic, historical account of revelation consistent with covenant theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Revelation in the Old Testament is a historical, covenantal, Spirit‑wrought act of God that is both accommodated to human conditions and progressively culminates in Christ; Scripture is the Spirit‑witnessed record of that revelation and thereby possesses authority and truth.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Revelation is primarily an act (God disclosing Himself in history), not merely a set of propositions.
 - This act is mediated through persons (patriarchs, prophets), events (covenants, exodus, temple), and institutions; the written Scripture is the faithful, Spirit‑borne record of those acts.
 - The Holy Spirit ensures both the correctness of the prophetic utterance and the Spirit's interior testimony secures Scripture's self‑attestation to believers.
 - Accommodation explains why divine disclosure comes in finite, humanly comprehensible forms; the incarnational analogy clarifies the mode of condescension.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Calvinist tradition (Calvin, Reformed scholastics), critiques of Schleiermacherian subjectivism and liberal higher criticism; implicit conversation with contemporaries at Princeton (e.g., Warfield) and the German historical school.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (act and record), inspiration, authority/self‑attestation of Scripture, role of the Holy Spirit (revelation/illumination), accommodation and incarnational analogy, redemptive history and covenant theology, prophecy and canon formation.
- **Closing line**
 - Revelation is God's covenantal, historically‑located self‑disclosure, made intelligible by accommodation, secured and attested by the Spirit, and mediated finally and authoritatively in the Old Testament Scriptures as preparation for Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong redemptive‑historical/organic model: revelation unfolds within concrete historical events and persons rather than abstract propositions delivered apart from history.
 - Synthesizes a high view of Scripture's authority with an emphasis on the historical medium of revelation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects rationalist and subjectivist accounts that evacuate the historical concreteness of revelation.
 - Distinguishes itself from purely propositional or abstract "revelation as doctrine" approaches by insisting on act + record.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of an incarnational analogy for revelation: God's condescension in revelation parallels the logic of incarnation - divine truth clothed in human forms.
 - Sharp delineation between the revelatory act and the canonical record; both necessary for proper doctrine of Scripture.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed circles for shaping redemptive‑historical hermeneutics and for grounding a robust doctrine of Scripture that integrates history and theology.
 - Cited by later evangelical and Reformed scholars as corrective to both liberal critical and overly abstract evangelical accounts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a usable model for marrying historical exegesis with systematic doctrine; valuable for teaching on revelation, inspiration, and the role of the Spirit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (act vs. record)** - Distinguishes the divine action of disclosing from the human‑mediated written testimony.
- **Redemptive‑historical (organic) revelation** - Revelation unfolds within covenantal events and persons; history is the primary locus of revelation.
- **Self‑attestation (of Scripture)** - Scripture's authority is grounded in the Spirit's internal testimony to the believer and its coherence with redemptive history. (Site usage: Self Attestation And Authority Of Scripture)
- **Inspiration / plenary inspiration** - Prophetic utterances and the OT corpus are Spirit‑borne communications; Vos affirms objective divine truthfulness while allowing for human modes of expression. (Site usage: Inspiration And Inerrancy)
- **Inerrancy (nuanced)** - Truthfulness is maintained in the end that Scripture reliably conveys God's saving revelation; Vos resists reducing truth to modern categories of scientific description.
- **Holy Spirit (revelation & illumination)** - Spirit is active in producing prophetic speech and in later attesting Scripture to the church; illumination is necessary for the inward appropriation of revealed truth. (Site usage: Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination)
- **Accommodation** - God adapts revelation to finite human capacities, language, and cultural forms; not deception but condescension.
- **Incarnational analogy** - Revelation's mode is analogized to the incarnation: divine truth assumes human forms without ceasing to be divine. (Site usage: Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy)
- **Prophecy / prophet** - Prophecy is the living mouthpiece of the divine act in history; the prophet's words become canonical when authenticated by Spirit and community.
- **Canon / recording of revelation** - Canon is the faithful crystallization of historical revelation; distinguished from but beholden to the revelatory events themselves.
- **Covenant** - The structural frame of revelation; God's acts create and unfold covenant relations redemptively.
- **Historical realism** - Insists on objective events and persons as loci of revelation against mere subjectivism.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional source for a historical‑covenantal doctrine of revelation that preserves Scripture's authority.
 - As a polemic resource against reductionist liberal criticism and subjectivist notions of revelation.
 - As an exegetical and theological model for redemptive‑historical interpretation in preaching, hermeneutics, and systematic theology.
