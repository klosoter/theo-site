### TITLE
**Augustine - Quaestiones in Heptateuchum (Questions on the Heptateuch)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 4th / early 5th-century Latin church; post-Nicene theological milieu shaped by Augustine's controversies with Manichaeans, Donatists, and Pelagians. Works composed as exegetical-lectural notes on the first seven biblical books (Genesis-Judges), reflecting pastoral and catechetical concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Practical and theological interrogation of the Pentateuchal and early historical texts to clarify how law, promise, typology, and covenantal life point to Christ, grace, and the Church; addressing how Old Testament texts apply to Christian sacramental and moral life.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Form: a series of discrete questions and concise answers-exegetical, moral, doctrinal-rather than a continuous commentary.
 - Method: careful attention to the literal/historical sense with systematic recourse to the spiritual/typological sense; application to contemporary controversies (sin, grace, sacraments).
 - Moves:
 - Identify textual difficulty or moral question.
 - Weigh literal, allegorical, tropological (moral), anagogical senses.
 - Draw doctrinal implications for sin, law, covenant, baptism, and church order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture as primary authority; frequent implicit dialogue with Ambrose (influence on scriptural method), polemical engagement with Pelagian positions, and the broader patristic exegetical tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant and covenant continuity, law vs. gospel, typology (types and antitypes), original sin and grace, sacraments (notably baptism as sign of covenant), ecclesiology (Church as true Israel), providence and election.
- **Closing line:** A compact, pastoral exegetical corpus that reads the Heptateuch as a covenant-historical foundation interpreted Christologically and oriented toward sacramental and communal life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm insistence that Old Testament law and history must be read in light of Christ and grace while retaining the force of their literal sense.
 - Persistent link between household/child status in Israel and covenantal inclusion, prefiguring Augustinian support for infant baptism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects allegorizing excesses by valuing the literal sense but also rejects purely literalist moralizing that separates law from grace.
 - Polemical correction of Pelagian minimization of original sin and overestimation of human ability to fulfill the law without prevenient grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integration of juridical and familial imagery of covenant-covenant as binding fidelity grounded in divine promise and grace.
 - Use of typological pairings (type/antitype) to trace covenantal fulfillment in Christ and the Church.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Major source for medieval and Reformation exponents of original sin, grace, and infant baptism; Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin) draw on Augustinian lines for covenant continuity and sacramental signology.
 - Augustine's readings helped shape confessional formulations of covenant (unity of covenant themes, corporate election, infant inclusion) even when later traditions systematized them more sharply (e.g., covenant of works/grace distinctions).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of pastoral exegesis that balances literal-historical attention with typological Christocentrism.
 - Rich resource for understanding patristic roots of covenant theology, sacramental reasoning, and anti-Pelagian doctrinal structure.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heptateuch:** The first seven biblical books; Augustine uses them as the covenantal narrative matrix.
- **Quaestiones:** Episodic question-answer format emphasizing problem-centered exegesis.
- **Literal sense:** Augustine's insistence on historical meaning as foundation for further spiritual senses.
- **Spiritual/typological sense:** Reading persons, rites, and events as prefigurations of Christ and ecclesial realities.
- **Type / Antitype:** Method for linking Old Testament institutions (types) to their fulfillment (antitypes) in Christ and the Church.
- **Covenant (foedus/ testamentum):** Covenantal language deployed to explain continuity of God's promise, household inclusion, and sacramental signs.
 - Relation to confessional covenant formulations: Augustine supplies semantic and theological soil - unity of covenant themes, infant incorporation via sign (baptism/circumcision).
- **Law and Grace:** Tension resolved by Augustine in favor of law as order and teacher, fulfilled and perfected in grace.
- **Original sin / concupiscence:** Key anthropological presupposition informing Augustine's interpretation of law and need for grace.
- **Prevenient / operative grace:** Augustine's emphasis that divine grace precedes and enables any righteous response.
- **Baptism as covenant sign:** Explicitly draws continuity between circumcision and baptism; grounds infant baptism in covenant household logic.
- **Ecclesia as true Israel:** The Church is read as the locus of covenant fulfillment and continuity.
- **Typological promise/fulfillment:** Promise element in covenantal texts read forward to Christ's fulfillment.
- **Exegesis as pastoral theology:** Augustine treats textual questions as vehicles for pastoral correction and doctrinal clarity.
- Uses across loci:
 - As a definitional source for patristic grounds of covenant continuity and infant inclusion.
 - As polemic ammunition against Pelagian readings of law, sin, and human ability.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Pentateuchal narrative typologically and sacramentally.
