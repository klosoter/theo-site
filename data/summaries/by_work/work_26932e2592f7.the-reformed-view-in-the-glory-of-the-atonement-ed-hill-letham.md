### TITLE
The Reformed View - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in The Glory of the Atonement (ed. J. Hill & D. Letham)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed retrieval within broader evangelical scholarship; written amid renewed debate over atonement theory (penal substitution vs. Christus Victor vs. governmental theory).
 - Contributes to a collected volume aimed at clarifying classical doctrines of atonement for contemporary readers.

- **Central thesis**
 - The atonement must be understood within a **Reformed, covenantal, Trinitarian framework**: Christ's death is a definite, substitutionary, propitiatory satisfaction accomplished as the federal head of the elect and effectual for their justification and reconciliation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins by diagnosing theological and pastoral confusions about *necessity* and *extent* of the atonement.
 - Reaffirms classical **penal substitution**: Christ bore the penalty due to sinners, satisfying divine justice and expiating sin.
 - Locates penal substitution within **covenant of redemption** and Christ's federal headship - not as a legalistic add-on but as fulfillment of covenantal promises.
 - Explains **definite/particular atonement**: Christ's death is sufficient for all but efficient only for the elect (distinguishing sufficiency/efficacy).
 - Stresses **union with Christ** and imputation (double imputation: our sin to Christ; Christ's righteousness to believers) as central mechanics.
 - Concludes with pastoral implications: assurance, worship, and sanctification flow from the atonement's definiteness and efficacy.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Appeals to **Scripture** and Reformed confessions (Westminster, Reformed orthodox authors).
 - Dialogues with historical figures: **Anselm** (satisfaction), **Calvin** (substitution and union), and modern alternatives: **Gustaf Aulén (Christus Victor)**, governmental-theory critics, and contemporary revisionists.
 - Engages with pastoral theologians and systematicians concerned with pastoral assurance and ecclesial proclamation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (twofold obedience, substitution)
 - **Soteriology** (justification, sanctification, effectual calling)
 - **Covenant theology** (covenant of redemption, federal headship)
 - **Trinitarian sending** (Father's decree, Son's obedience)
 - **Imputation and forensic categories** (penal, satisfaction, righteousness)

- **Closing line**
 - The Reformed view: the atonement is a **definite, substitutionary, covenantal** act by which the Triune God secures redemption for his people, grounding both justification and assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates penal substitution with covenantal federalism and union with Christ, avoiding a merely transactional or abstract legal picture.
 - Emphasizes the **pastoral and assurance-bearing effects** of a definite atonement - doctrine not merely forensic but existentially consolatory.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects the governmental theory's portrayal of Christ as a public example restoring moral order without real substitution.
 - Distinguishes from a simplistic universalist sufficiency claim by clarifying **sufficient-for-all / efficient-for-elect** distinction.
 - Counters exclusive Christus Victor readings by affirming Christus Victor elements (defeat of sin and death) but within a substitutionary penal framework.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes classic terms (satisfaction, propitiation) in **covenantal and Trinitarian language** to show relational, not merely juridical, restoration.
 - Stresses **definiteness** (particularity) as theologically necessary for assurance and the coherence of redemption.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, pastoral defence of penal substitution.
 - Influential in seminary teaching on atonement, used to counter revisionist trends while engaging modern critiques.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise exemplar of how to hold together substitution, covenant, and assurance - valuable for preaching, systematic theology, and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Penal substitution** - Christ bears the penalty due sinners, satisfying divine justice.
- **Satisfaction** - The compensatory fulfilment of God's honor and righteousness by Christ.
- **Propitiation** - Christ's death turns away divine wrath by satisfying God's righteous demands.
- **Expiation** - Removal or cleansing of sin through Christ's sacrifice.
- **Federal headship (federal/representative substitution)** - Christ acts as the covenantal representative of the elect.
- **Definite/particular atonement** - The atonement is efficient for the elect; sufficient for all but effectual only for those given to Christ.
 - Contrast: sufficiency (universal provision) vs. efficiency (particular application).
- **Imputation / double imputation** - Our sin imputed to Christ; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers, ground of justification.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's life of obedience (active) + his suffering/death (passive) constitute righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Covenant of redemption** - Intra-Trinitarian agreement in which Father appoints and Son undertakes salvation for the elect.
- **Union with Christ** - The bond that makes substitutionary benefits effectual (instrumental in sanctification and justification).
- **Effectual calling** - The application of atonement benefits by the Spirit to those elected.
- **Reconciliation** - Restoration of relationship between God and elect through Christ's propitiatory work.
- **Sufficiency vs. efficiency** - Key Reformed distinction explaining universal sufficiency and particular efficacy.
- **Christus Victor (secondary use)** - Acknowledged as complementary (victory over sin/death) but not exhaustive or alternative to penal substitution.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed formulations of penal substitution and definite atonement.
 - As a **polemic** against governmental and purely Christus Victor readings while preserving victory motifs.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for preaching assurance, justification, and union with Christ in systematic theology and pastoral care.
