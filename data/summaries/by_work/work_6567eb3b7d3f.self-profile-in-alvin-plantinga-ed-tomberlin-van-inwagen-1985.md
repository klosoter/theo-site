### TITLE
"Self-Profile" - Alvin Plantinga (in Tomberlin & van Inwagen, eds., 1985)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1980s analytic philosophy of religion; anthology of autobiographical/professional sketches by prominent philosophers of religion. Plantinga situates his work within analytic epistemology, modal metaphysics, and Protestant theological commitments.
 - Intellectual milieu: reaction to J. L. Mackie and the logical problem of evil; ongoing debates with Molinists and contemporary theodicists.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A compact self-presentation of Plantinga's central philosophical-theological commitments: classical theism interpreted through analytic tools, a libertarian account of human freedom, and a methodological humility about full theodicy.
 - Core apologetic aim: defend the rationality of Christian theism in the face of the problem of evil while clarifying what a successful response (a *defense*) can and cannot do.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Brief autobiographical preface followed by a synthesis of his signature moves:
 - Affirmation of **God's omniscience and providence** while insisting that divine foreknowledge need not entail determinism (compatibility with libertarian freedom).
 - Reiteration of the **Free Will Defense**: the logical problem of evil is defeated because it is possible that every world with significantly free creatures contains some evil (introducing the notion of **transworld depravity**).
 - Distinction between **defense** (showing theism is not logically inconsistent with evil) and **theodicy** (attempts to justify God's reasons), with Plantinga emphasizing the limited ambitions of a defense.
 - Critical engagement with **Molinism / middle knowledge**: shows that appealing to middle knowledge does not automatically secure a world free of moral evil if transworld depravity obtains.
 - Concluding posture: analytic clarity + epistemic modesty - provide sober apologetic tools rather than comprehensive metaphysical explanations.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages (directly or by implication) with J. L. Mackie (logical problem of evil), Luis de Molina and contemporary Molinists (middle knowledge), William Rowe (evidential problem), William Lane Craig (Molinist defender), and the Reformed theological tradition in background.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine foreknowledge/omniscience, human libertarian freedom, the problem of evil, divine justice/theodicy, and methodological issues in natural theology and epistemology.

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Plantinga centers an analytic theism that defends God's coherence with the existence of evil by privileging libertarian freedom and epistemic humility: a defense, not an exhaustive theodicy, anchored in modal metaphysics (transworld depravity) and careful distinctions about foreknowledge and providence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Emphasis on *transworld depravity* as the key modal constraint undermining the expectation that God could actualize a world with free yet morally impeccable creatures.
 - Clear separation between what a defense can accomplish and what a theodicy purports to do - methodological restraint.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct rebuttal to the logical problem of evil (Mackie) by showing possible-world constraints; counters naïve Molinist optimism that middle knowledge automatically yields a morally optimal actual world.
 - Contrasts with evidential theodicists by refusing to offer speculative divine reasons for particular evils; instead shows *consistency* of theism with the facts.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and systematized the use of **transworld depravity** in contemporary debates.
 - Clarified and popularized the defense/theodicy distinction in pedagogy and scholarship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in analytic philosophy of religion and conservative Reformed circles; considered the decisive dismantling of the classical logical problem of evil.
 - Stimulated extensive literature on middle knowledge (pro- and anti-Molinist responses) and renewed attention to libertarian freedom in theological contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogical model for analytic theology: tightly argued, conceptually disciplined, and modest in ambition; essential reading for students of theodicy, providence, and divine foreknowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free Will Defense** - Plantinga's move to show God and evil are logically compatible by positing constraints on what a free creature would choose in any possible world.
- **Transworld Depravity (TWD)** - The modal claim that for a given free agent, in every feasible world in which they are significantly free they at least once choose wrongly; central to explaining why God could not actualize a morally perfect free world.
- **Defense vs Theodicy** - Important methodological distinction: a *defense* aims to show logical possibility; a *theodicy* attempts to justify God's reasons for permitting particular evils.
- **Divine Foreknowledge** - Affirmed as complete (omniscience) but not, on Plantinga's view, incompatible with libertarian free will when modal constraints like TWD are acknowledged.
- **Providence** - Treated as compatible with genuine creaturely freedom; God's ordering of the world must be assessed against modal limits on creaturely choices.
- **Middle Knowledge (Molinism)** - The doctrine that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; Plantinga is skeptical that it rescues God from problems posed by TWD.
 - Relation: Molinists claim middle knowledge allows God to actualize an optimal world by foreseeing free choices; Plantinga counters that TWD can block such optimization.
- **Logical Problem of Evil** - The claim that the coexistence of God and evil is logically impossible; Plantinga argues this claim is refuted.
- **Evidential Problem of Evil** - The claim that the quantity/nature of evil makes God improbable; Plantinga's defense does not fully answer evidential challenges but reframes the debate.
- **Libertarian Freedom** - Metaphysical freedom incompatible with determinism; assumed by Plantinga in his defense.
- **Omniscience / Omnipotence** - Traditional divine attributes retained, but their interaction with freedom is handled via modal and epistemic resources rather than determinism.
- **Properly Basic Belief** - Relates to Plantinga's broader epistemology: belief in God can be rationally basic, complementing his apologetic aims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Plantinga's positions on free will, TWD, and the defense/theodicy distinction.
- As a **polemic** against the logical problem of evil and as a critical interlocutor to Molinist claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and scholarship linking debates about foreknowledge, providence, and theodicy in analytic theology.
