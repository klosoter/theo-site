### TITLE
**"The Spirit in the Gospels and Acts" - Craig S. Keener (in Anthony Thiselton, ed., The Holy Spirit: In Biblical Teaching, through the Centuries, and Today, 2013)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Part of a 2013 volume addressing historical and contemporary pneumatology; interlocutes with evangelical, Pentecostal, and academic debates.
 - Milieu: renewed scholarly interest in Luke-Acts as a pneumatological narrative and ongoing controversies between **continuationism** and **cessationism** in evangelical theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Keener argues that the portrayal of the Spirit in the Gospels and Acts presents the Spirit as an active, normative, mission-empowering presence whose gifts and signs functioned to authenticate and advance the church - and that the biblical data support a posture of expectation for the continuation of charismatic ministry.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey and exegetical treatment across the Synoptics, John, and Luke-Acts:
 - Synoptics: Spirit as agent in Jesus' birth, ministry, exorcism, and teaching; prophetic continuity with Israel.
 - John: Paraclete theology and ongoing Spirit-mediated revelation and presence.
 - Luke-Acts: Detailed narrative showing the Spirit as the driving force of mission, mission expansion, apostolic ministry, and charismatic signs.
 - Historical-cultural context: Second Temple Judaism, prophetic traditions, and early Christian practice.
 - Functional conclusions: gifts (prophecy, tongues, heals, miracles) served both ecclesial formation and missionary validation; Luke-Acts portrays these charisms as normative tools for the church's life and growth.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary NT scholars (e.g., Dunn, Wright, Bauckham, B. Witherington/Bock-type commentators), early church practices, Second Temple texts, and ethnographic parallels.
 - Dialogues directly with cessationist readings that minimize sign gifts and with charismatic readings that over-privilege experiential claims without historical-critical grounding.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central), ecclesiology, revelation (prophecy, Spirit as witness), Christology (Spirit's relation to Jesus), mission/evangelism, charismatic gifts, and implications for authority and normative practice.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Gospels and Acts present the Spirit as the normative, mission-driving presence of God whose empowering gifts and signs are integrally connected to the church's identity and mission - a biblical case that undergirds a continuationist posture grounded in historical and textual exegesis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of historical-contextual detail with narrative reading of Luke-Acts; treats the Spirit's activity as both theological and pragmatic (mission-shaped).
 - Emphasis on continuity between Jewish prophetic tradition and Christian charismatic manifestations.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges readings that render the Spirit largely symbolic or confined to the apostolic era; presses against restrictive cessationist inferences from particular texts.
 - Corrects scholars who underplay the normative, ongoing function of signs in Luke-Acts by demonstrating their theological role in mission and community formation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames Luke-Acts as a pneumatological "engine" for ecclesial expansion - not merely incidental signs but constitutive of apostolic mission.
 - Distinguishes carefully between descriptive narrative reporting and prescriptive ecclesial norms, arguing Luke's descriptive claims carry normative force for mission practice.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited by continuationist scholars and pastors for exegetical support; acknowledged by many cessationist scholars for methodological rigor even where conclusions are disputed.
 - Strengthened evangelical and Pentecostal engagement with Luke-Acts as primary evidence for contemporary charismatic life.
- **Enduring value**
 - Robust blend of exegetical detail, historical breadth, and pastoral relevance; valuable as a bridge between academic exegesis and practical pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneumatology** - study of the Spirit; Keener reads Gospels and Acts as central sources for NT pneumatology.
- **Paraclete** - Johannine term for the Spirit as advocate/comforter; used to argue for ongoing revelatory presence.
- **Baptism in the Spirit** - portrayed as empowering initiation for mission; Keener links Gospel passages to Acts' experiences.
- **Charismata / spiritual gifts** - prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles; argued to be normative for the early church's mission.
 - Contrast: treated as functional and communal vs. merely individual experiences.
- **Glossolalia (tongues)** - considered a bona fide early Christian phenomenon tied to mission and witness (Acts 2, 10).
- **Prophecy** - public, community-forming speech; validated as authoritative in early church contexts.
- **Signs and wonders** - integral for apostolic validation and mission expansion in Luke-Acts.
- **Luke-Acts unity** - Keener stresses a cohesive pneumatological narrative across both volumes.
- **Descriptive vs prescriptive** - Keener argues Luke's descriptive narratives carry prescriptive implications for practice.
- **Jewish prophetic continuity** - connects Second Temple prophecy expectations with NT charisms.
- **Mission / evangelism** - Spirit is primary agent of church growth and cross-cultural witness.
- **Continuationism** - position Keener supports: charismatic gifts continue as normative potential.
- **Cessationism** - contrasted and critiqued; Keener disputes its exclusive reliance on later theological inference.
- **Normative charismatic expectation** - the conclusion Keener advances for church practice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Luke-Acts as a unified pneumatological narrative.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates over continuationism vs cessationism, favoring continuationism with grounded exegesis.
 - As a **definition source** for theological courses on pneumatology that seek historical, textual, and pastoral integration.
