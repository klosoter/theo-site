### TITLE
On the Lapsed (De Lapsis) - Cyprian of Carthage (c. 251)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Composed in the aftermath of the Decian persecution (c. 250), during the crisis over Christians who denied the faith or handed over scriptures ("traditores").
 - Cyprian was bishop of Carthage (episcopate 248/249-258). The treatise responds to local pastoral pressure and the wider Novatian schism (rigorist opposition centered in Rome, c. 251).
 - The work is pastoral-theological rather than systematic, addressing immediate ecclesial discipline.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How the Church should treat the lapsi (those who lapsed under persecution): restore them by penitential discipline under episcopal oversight rather than exclude them permanently or readmit without penance.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Opening diagnosis: the prevalence and moral seriousness of lapses; danger of schism if handled wrongly.
 - Pastoral principle: mercy guided by order - the Church must readmit penitents but only through measured penance.
 - Authority claim: bishops, as shepherds and judges, decide terms of reconciliation; their judgment preserves unity.
 - Contra-rigorists: rejects permanent exclusion (Novatianist position) as contrary to apostolic practice and charity.
 - Practical prescriptions: gradations of penance according to gravity, public confession, Eucharistic exclusion during penance, eventual full restoration.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Contemporary: Novatian and the Novatianists; Roman episcopal politics (Cornelius vs Novatian).
 - Scriptural appeals (Paul, Luke, Old Testament examples), appeal to martyrs and local tradition.
 - Implicit interlocutors: clergy and laity who either demanded extreme leniency or extreme rigor.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology: unity, authority of bishops, visible Church.
 - Soteriology and pastoral theology: repentance, penance, reconciliation.
 - Sacramental practice: exclusion from and readmission to Eucharist as disciplinary means.
 - Apostolicity as norm for practice and judgment.

- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity**
 - The Church is a merciful but ordered community whose bishops, wielding apostolic authority, mediate penance and readmission so that charity and unity are preserved without dissolving discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong articulation of episcopal jurisdiction as the decisive arbiter in cases of apostasy and penance.
 - Balances corporate responsibility and individual repentance: sin affects the Church and must be healed corporately.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct corrective to Novatianist rigorism: insists that forgiveness remains available and that exclusion is not the default.
 - Contrasts with any overly lenient practice by insisting on public, graded penance as necessary evidence of repentance.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Early systematic use of the term lapsi as a distinct pastoral category with specified canonical consequences.
 - Implicit proto-canonical method of graduated penance linked to ecclesial offices and rites.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Important source for the development of medieval penitential practice and the theology of ecclesial discipline.
 - In Roman Catholic tradition, cited for episcopal authority and the institutional mediation of reconciliation.
 - Protestant reception: valued historically for pastoral sensitivity but critiqued for ecclesial juridicism and sacramental control; Reformed writers draw on Cyprian for unity arguments but resist institutional absolution independent of Gospel proclamation.

- **Enduring value**
 - A primary text for ecclesiology (unity and authority), pastoral theology (penance), and the historical theology of church discipline; indispensable for teaching how early churches negotiated mercy and order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lapsi** - those who lapsed from faith under persecution; central pastoral category.
- **Penance (poenitentia)** - public, graded process of repentance leading to restoration.
- **Traditores** - those who delivered sacred books or compromised the faith; a subcategory of lapsi.
- **Episcopal authority / bishops as judges** - claim that bishops decide penance and readmission, preserving unity.
- **Reconciliation / absolution** - ecclesial act effected by penance and bishoply sentence, not merely private.
- **Communion / Eucharistic exclusion** - the Eucharist used as disciplinary boundary marker; withheld during penance.
- **Unity (unity of the Church)** - visible, institutional unity maintained by episcopal judgments.
- **Apostolicity** - appeal to apostolic practice as normative for discipline and mercy.
- **Rigourism / Novatianism** - position rejecting readmission of lapsi; Cyprian's primary polemical foil.
- **Martyrdom as witness** - invoked to calibrate response to lapses and to encourage steadfastness.
- **Public confession** - required as sign of genuine repentance.
- **Gradation of penance** - severity proportionate to offense; indicates an early pastoral taxonomy.
- **Corporate dimension of sin** - sin affects the whole Church and demands communal remediation.
- **Chair (episcopal seat) as locus of unity** - implicit precedence for later ecclesial arguments about office and succession.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a primary source for discussions of the **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church**: supplies an early argument that visible unity and apostolic authority (bishops) are constitutive marks of the Church.
 - As a reference for the **Nature And Marks Of The Church**: exemplifies how holiness, unity, and apostolicity function together in disciplinary practice; used polemically against sectarian rigor and as an exemplar of ordered pastoral reconciliation.
