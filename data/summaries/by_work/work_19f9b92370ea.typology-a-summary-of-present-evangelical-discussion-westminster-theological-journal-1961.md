### TITLE
Typology: A Summary of Present Evangelical Discussion - Edmund P. Clowney (Westminster Theological Journal, 1961)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1960s evangelical scholarship reacting to form-criticism, Bultmannian existentialism, and liberal reduction of typology.
 - Part of a broader mid-20th-century recovery of redemptive-historical and Christocentric hermeneutics within Reformed and conservative Evangelical circles.
 - Published in Westminster Theological Journal, reflecting Reformed/evangelical engagement with current critical debates.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Typology is a legitimate and necessary mode of biblical interpretation when properly constrained: it is historical prefiguration within redemptive history culminating in Christ and attested by the New Testament.
 - The problem addressed: how to distinguish legitimate typological reading from arbitrary allegory or the reductionist conclusions of critical scholarship.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of contemporary evangelical positions and contested issues (existence and nature of types; relation of type and antitype; criteria for validity).
 - Defense of a redemptive-historical, Christ-centered typology rooted in Scripture, especially the NT's own use.
 - Proposal of methodological criteria to guard typology from illegitimacy:
 - The type must be a historical reality.
 - Typological relation must be divinely intended or scripturally attested (preferably in the NT).
 - Fulfillment is authoritative in Christ and not merely moral or analogical resemblance.
 - Distinguishes typology from allegory and from purely typological "coincidence"; insists on exegetical restraint and doctrinal coherence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary evangelical and critical scholars (implicitly or explicitly): defenders of typology influenced by Geerhardus Vos and Reformed redemptive-historical method; critics rooted in form criticism and existential reception (e.g., Bultmannian tendencies and liberal skepticism).
 - Cites New Testament exemplars of typological reasoning (Paul, Hebrews, and Gospel fulfillment citations) as authoritative models.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics): typology as part of Scripture's self-interpretation.
 - Christology: centrality of Christ as the antitype and fulfillment of types.
 - Covenant theology / redemptive history: continuity of God's dealings across covenantal administrations.
 - Sacramentology and ecclesiology implied (types as foreshadowing covenant signs and institutions).

- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity**
 - Typology is a biblically rooted, redemptive-historical hermeneutic that reads OT persons and events as genuine prefigurations whose meaning is fixed by divine intention and consummated in Christ as attested by the New Testament.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that typology be anchored in NT attestation or clear redemptive-historical continuity rather than speculative resemblance.
 - Balances historical reality and theological meaning: types are real events/people, not mere symbols.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against allegorizing tendencies (both patristic excesses and modern voluntaristic allegory).
 - Corrective to form-critical reductionism that treats typological language as merely later theological imposition or mythic reuse.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes a working taxonomy for typology useful to evangelicals: type, antitype, fulfillment, divine intention, NT attestation - used as diagnostic tools in exegesis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in consolidating a mid-century evangelical consensus on typology within Reformed circles.
 - Helped pave the way for later redemptive-historical and covenantal hermeneutics (consonant with Vosian and later Meredith Kline / Geerhardus Vos emphases).

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Practical methodological checklist for preachers, teachers, and exegetes who wish to employ typology responsibly.
 - Serves as a concise, clarity-focused summary of evangelical positions at a pivotal moment in hermeneutical history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Type**
 - An Old Testament person, event, or institution that prefigures a later reality; must be historically real.
- **Antitype**
 - The fulfillment or reality to which the type points, ultimately found in Christ.
- **Fulfillment**
 - The consummating realization of a type in Christ; authoritative when attested by Scripture, especially the NT.
- **Redemptive history (heilsgeschichte)**
 - The theological framework that views biblical events as progressive revelations of God's saving plan culminating in Christ.
- **Divine intention**
 - The criterion that typological relation presupposes God's purposive design rather than human imagination.
- **NT attestation**
 - The strongest evidential ground for declaring a typological relationship - explicit citation or interpretive use in the New Testament.
- **Allegory**
 - Differentiated from typology as arbitrary or reader-imposed symbolism; typology is historically grounded and theologically constrained.
- **Historical reality**
 - Requirement that types be actual events/people in history, not purely symbolic constructs.
- **Analogy of faith**
 - The doctrinal safeguard: interpretations must cohere with the broader teaching of Scripture.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic**
 - Reading the OT through the lens of Christ's person and work; typology as an instrument of this hermeneutic.
- **Sacramental/ceremonial typology**
 - Types that foreshadow covenant signs (e.g., circumcision, Passover) and have sacramental significance in theology.
- **Polemic vs. reductionism**
 - Use of typology as corrective to critical positions that deny continuity or theological intention in Scripture.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - cited for concise, evangelical definitions and criteria for legitimate typology.
- **Exegetical model** - used in preaching and teaching as a methodological checklist to justify typological readings tied to NT fulfillment.
- **Polemic** - appealed to in rebuttals to allegorizing interpretive abuses and to critical scholars who deny typological coherence across redemptive history.
