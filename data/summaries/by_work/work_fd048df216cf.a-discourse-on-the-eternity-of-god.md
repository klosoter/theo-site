### TITLE
**A Discourse on the Eternity of God** - Stephen Charnock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-century English Puritan/Reformed milieu (Charnock 1628-1680). Part of his sermonic-theological corpus later collected as The Existence and Attributes of God. Written against a backdrop of post-Restoration theological controversies and rising rationalist challenges (Deism, Socinianism, novel accounts of time).
- **Central thesis**
 - God's eternity is an essential, non-temporal mode of existence that grounds and secures all other divine perfections and acts; eternity is not merely endless duration but the divine mode of being beyond succession.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and distinction
 - Distinguishes eternity from finite duration and from mere endless time; locates eternity as that which transcends succession and change.
 - Philosophical and scriptural proofs
 - Scripture passages (e.g., Psalm and prophetic attestations) read with logical argumentation to show timelessness and necessary being.
 - Rational arguments: necessity of a cause not contingent on time; incoherence of temporal dependence for God.
 - Attributes and mutual implication
 - Shows how eternity undergirds **immutability, simplicity, aseity, impassibility** and differentiates absolute from relative attributes.
 - Polemical rebuttal
 - Responds to temporalist and anthropomorphic conceptions of God, and to contemporary skeptical accounts that reduce God to a long-lived being.
 - Practical and pastoral application
 - Uses divine eternity to evoke reverence, consolation (unchanging covenant faithfulness), and the legitimacy of worship.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Heavy use of Scripture and patristic/Scholastic categories (Augustine, Anselm; echoes of Reformed scholastics such as Turretin). Critiques popular contemporaries and philosophical accounts that make God temporal.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (absolute and relative), simplicity, immutability, aseity, impassibility, providence, creation and relation to time; occasional Trinitarian implications in internal relations.
- **Closing line**
 - Charnock centers the thesis: **God's eternity is the ground of his perfection and the necessary presupposition for trustworthy providence and worship.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates pastoral sermonic tone with rigorous scholastic method: doctrine presented to foster both intellectual assent and devotional awe.
 - Strong stress on the *ontological priority* of eternity: not an attribute among others but the matrix in which attributes coherently belong.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit counter to temporalist and Deistic reductions of God (i.e., God as infinitely long but temporally successive). Opposes readings that conflate divine eternity with human duration.
 - Reframes debates within classic Reformed categories, pushing back where predecessors had allowed equivocal language about divine duration.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear pairing of **absolute vs relative attributes** to show how eternity functions differently as an absolute attribute (in God himself) than as a relative descriptor in creaturely language (See: Absolute And Relative Attributes).
 - Tactical emphasis on eternity as explanatory for **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility** rather than merely coequal formulations (See: Simplicity Aseity Immutability Impassibility).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in later Reformed devotional and systematic works; prized for its clarity and pastoral force. Influenced 18th-19th-century evangelical treatments of divine attributes and remains a touchstone in conservative orthodox circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact exemplar of how to argue metaphysically from Scripture; useful for teaching the coherence of classical theism and for polemics against modern temporalist accounts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternity**
 - Charnock: not endless temporal succession but the mode of divine being beyond time; foundational attribute.
- **Duration**
 - Finite/infinite succession in time; contrasted with eternity to highlight difference between endless time and timeless being.
- **Immutable / Immutability**
 - Unchangeableness of God's being and will; grounded in eternity and necessary for trust in providence.
- **Simple / Simplicity**
 - No composition in God's being; simplicity follows from non-temporal, necessary existence (See: Simplicity Aseity Immutability Impassibility).
- **Aseity**
 - Self-existence and independence; Charnock ties aseity to eternity as the source of divine necessity.
- **Impassibility**
 - Freedom from passible change or suffering; argued from eternity and immutability.
- **Absolute attributes**
 - Attributes intrinsic to God (eternity, simplicity, aseity); used to explain divine essence (See: Absolute And Relative Attributes).
- **Relative attributes**
 - Attributes considered in relation to creatures or acts (e.g., mercy, wrath) - derivative and intelligible only against the absolute perfections.
- **Necessary being**
 - God as metaphysically necessary; eternity is both expression and ground of necessity.
- **Succession / Timelessness**
 - Succession: temporal sequence; timelessness: absence of succession in divine life.
- **Providence**
 - God's ordering of creation; given coherence by eternal knowledge and will.
- **Creation (relation to time)**
 - Creation does not limit God's eternity; time is a created order within which creatures exist.
- **Worship / Practical Assurance**
 - The pastoral upshot: assurance of covenant faithfulness derived from divine eternity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise definition source and polemic against temporalist accounts of God's being.
 - As a model for linking metaphysical formulations (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) to pastoral and exegetical concerns.
