### TITLE
**The Inspiration and Authority of Scripture** - essays and lectures by Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed academic milieu (Westminster/Princeton-influenced), in the context of post-war debates over biblical authority, neo-orthodoxy, and modern critical challenges.
 - Addresses controversies over "inerrancy" and "inspiration" as contested in evangelical and mainline arenas; interlocutors include proponents of Warfieldian formulations and neo-orthodox critics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the authoritative, Spirit-wrought, inerrant witness to God in Christ; its authority rests not in clerical decree or mere propositionality apart from redemptive-historical reference, but in the Holy Spirit's historical work attested by Christ's resurrection and apostolic testimony.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of **verbal plenary** inspiration, qualified by an insistence on **organic inspiration** (divine superintendence that preserves human authorship, style, and historical particularity).
 - Defense of **inerrancy** understood as truthfulness in all that Scripture intends to affirm (not a carte blanche for modern historiography or scientific detail where the authors do not claim such expertise).
 - Grounding of Scripture's authority in the **resurrection** and the Spirit's role: the resurrection validates apostolic witness; the Spirit guarantees the reliability of that witness as the church's normative rule.
 - Canonical and ecclesial dimension: inspiration is tied to the church's recognition and reception of apostolic testimony into a canon that functions as the covenantal rule of faith and life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with Warfieldian inerrancy formulations, critiques of neo-orthodox reductions (Barthian tendencies), and appeals to Reformed tradition (Vos, Murray, Bavinck implicitly present in method and categories).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy/infallibility, canonicity, the work of the Holy Spirit (illumination and inspiration), Christology (Scripture's center in Christ), ecclesiology (canon as church-norm), and soteriological-historical attestation (resurrection as foundation).
- **Closing line**
 - Scripture's authority is not a legalistic propositional deposit divorced from history; rather, it is the Spirit-ensured, apostolic witness to Christ - inerrant in what it intends to affirm and normative for the church because God has attested it in redemptive history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linking of **resurrection theology** to bibliology: the resurrection is the divine attestation that secures apostolic testimony and thereby Scripture's authority.
 - Balanced insistence on **verbal plenary** while refusing mechanistic dictation models - preserves human authorship without relativizing divine authorship.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against both a brittle Warfieldism that can read inspiration as mechanical dictation and neo-orthodox positions that reduce Scripture to a mere encounter without propositional truth claims.
 - Correction of reductionist inerrancy formulations that detach authority from the redemptive-historical contours of revelation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on the term **"organic inspiration"** as an explanatory complement to "verbal plenary" - insists on living agency and historical mediation rather than static dictation.
 - Use of **resurrection-as-attestation** as a canonical warranting concept linking Christology to Scripture's normative status.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in conservative Reformed scholarship as a paradigmatic, nuanced defense of Scripture that is at once confessional and critical in method.
 - Influential in seminary teaching on bibliology; often cited by those seeking a middle path between rigid inerrancy literalism and neo-orthodox skepticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students who need a coherent, theologically rich account of inspiration that preserves divine authorship, human literary character, and ecclesial normativity.
 - Serves as a durable corrective to both anti-intellectual popularisms and overly academic reductions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration (theopneustos)** - God's Spirit as the causative agent of Scripture, preserving human authorship and linguistic variety.
- **Verbal plenary inspiration** - Affirmation that all words of Scripture are divinely authorized while acknowledging human agency in formulation.
- **Organic inspiration** - Emphasis on Spirit-led, historical, living process rather than mechanical dictation.
- **Inerrancy / infallibility** - Scripture is fully truthful in all it intends to affirm; inerrancy defined by authorial intent rather than anachronistic standards.
 - Contrast: not a license to read modern scientific or historiographical standards into ancient texts where such are not claimed.
- **Divine authorship / human authorship** - The paradoxical unity: Scripture as truly divine and truly human in its origins.
- **Authority (normative)** - Canon functions as the church's covenantal rule because God has attested it; authority grounded in redemptive history and Spirit-endorsed apostolic witness.
- **Canonicity / apostolicity** - Canon formed around apostolic testimony; apostolic witness is the principal locus of Scripture's normative claim.
- **Resurrection as attestation** - The risen Christ validates apostolic proclamation; the resurrection is the historical act that anchors bibliological claims.
- **Illumination** - Distinct from inspiration; pertains to the Spirit's work in applying Scripture to believers rather than producing the text.
- **Christological hermeneutic** - Scripture's center is Christ; interpretation must heed redemptive-historical fulfillment.
- **Propositional truth** - Scripture communicates truth-claims; Gaffin affirms propositionality within the bounds of redemptive-historical reference.
- **Accommodation** - God speaks within the cultural and linguistic constraints of human authors without compromising truth.
- **Normative ecclesial reception** - The church's recognition is the mode by which inspired writings function canonically.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a confessional, nuanced **definition source** for Reformed accounts of inspiration and inerrancy.
 - As a **polemic** resource against both neo-orthodoxy and reductive dictation models.
 - As an **exegetical-model** pivot that centers the resurrection and apostolicity in hermeneutics and canon theology.
