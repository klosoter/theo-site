### TITLE
The Centrality of the Resurrection - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., Westminster Theological Journal

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed academic milieu; response to theological trends that marginalize the historicity or bodily character of the resurrection (e.g., liberal theology, demythologizing approaches).
 - Written within a confessional Reformed framework that emphasizes covenant, union with Christ, and Pauline soteriology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The resurrection of Jesus is the linchpin of Christian doctrine: it grounds justification, vindicates Christ's person and work, inaugurates eschatological reality, and secures both definitive and progressive aspects of salvation.
 - Problem addressed: theological systems that diminish the resurrection's historical, bodily, or soteriological centrality yield distortions in Christology, eschatology, and sanctification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Paul's key texts (notably 1 Corinthians 15, Romans 4-8) present the resurrection as the decisive act that validates atonement and effects union with the risen Christ.
 - Christological implication: resurrection confirms Christ's lordship and vindication, informing doctrine of exaltation and impeccability (victorious over sin and death).
 - Soteriological consequences:
 - Justification: resurrection as God's declaration that Christ's work is accepted; believers are reckoned with Christ in his risen life.
 - Sanctification: the same resurrection life is the source of definitive status (new identity) and progressive transformation (Spirit-empowered growth).
 - Eschatological scope:
 - Individual: resurrection guarantees bodily future for believers.
 - Cosmic: resurrection is the firstfruits and pledge of renewal for creation, anchoring inaugurated eschatology against purely individualist or wholly cosmic readings.
 - Polemic: opposes reductions of resurrection to mere moral example, spiritualized experience, or myth; affirms historical, bodily, and theological concreteness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Pauline corpus (esp. Paul's theology of resurrection and union).
 - Secondary interlocutors: modern critics of historic bodily resurrection (broadly Bultmannian/demythologizing currents) and those within the Reformed tradition who underplay the resurrection's soteriological centrality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (exaltation, vindication, impeccability)
 - Soteriology (justification, union with Christ, sanctification - definitive and progressive)
 - Eschatology (individual resurrection, cosmic renewal, inaugurated eschatology)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as pledge/firstfruits linking resurrection to present sanctification)

- **Closing line**
 - The resurrection is the decisive, historical center that unifies Christology, soteriology, and eschatology: without its concrete, bodily reality Christian doctrine collapses into abstraction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on the resurrection as both definitive (ontological status in Christ) and instrumental (active source of present sanctification) rather than merely future hope or ethical exemplar.
 - Keeps close theological connection between bodily resurrection and cosmic restoration while preserving personal eschatological assurance.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic or pietistic‑influenced tendencies that spiritualize the resurrection by restoring its historical-bodily character.
 - Counters liberal/demythologizing readings that reduce resurrection to symbol or religious experience; also refines some Reformed strains that overprivilege forensic aspects at expense of participatory, incarnational realities.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the language of union with the risen Christ as the matrix that integrates justification, sanctification, and eschatological hope.
 - Reframes "firstfruits/pledge" vocabulary to bridge Pauline eschatology and present sanctification in a way that resists both purely realized and purely future models.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in late‑20th and early‑21st century Reformed scholarship as a corrective emphasizing the resurrection's doctrinal centrality.
 - Used by scholars and pastors to resist demythologizing trends and to recover a Pauline, covenantal reading of resurrection theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a succinct exegetical-theological model linking New Testament texts to systematic loci.
 - Valuable for preaching, catechesis, and theological formation that seeks a balanced, historically grounded eschatology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (historical, bodily)** - affirmed as an event in history and as bodily vindication, not merely spiritual symbol.
- **Union with Christ** - the relational matrix: believers are united to the risen Christ, which grounds justification and sanctification.
- **Justification** - connected to resurrection as divine vindication of Christ's atoning work and the believer's reckoned standing.
- **Sanctification (definitive and progressive)** - the believer's new identity (definitive) and ongoing transformation (progressive) are both rooted in the resurrected life.
- **Firstfruits / Pledge** - Spirit‑given guarantee that the resurrection inaugurates the eschatological renewal of persons and creation.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - the resurrection inaugurates the eschaton now while awaiting consummation; balances realized and future aspects.
- **Christ's vindication / exaltation** - resurrection as divine act that crowns Christ's mediatorial work and establishes his lordship.
- **Impeccability** - tied to resurrection insofar as Christ's victory over sin and death confirms his sinlessness and sovereign rule.
- **Historical witness / apostolic preaching** - stress on apostolic proclamation that centers on the crucified and risen Lord.
- **Cosmic renewal** - the resurrection is the hinge for understanding both individual bodily hope and cosmic restoration.
- **Antichrist / man of lawlessness (negative correlate)** - denial or eclipse of resurrection theology characterizes eschatological deception and theological error.
- **Pauline corpus (exegetical touchstone)** - 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 4-8 treated as primary exegesis for the thesis.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit as pledge)** - Spirit mediates the resurrection life to believers now.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what counts as a robust Reformed doctrine of the resurrection (historical, bodily, soteriologically central).
- As a **polemic** against demythologizing, spiritualizing, or reductive treatments of resurrection in modern theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts that link resurrection, union with Christ, and eschatological hope.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Christology, soteriology, and eschatology in teaching and systematic construction.
