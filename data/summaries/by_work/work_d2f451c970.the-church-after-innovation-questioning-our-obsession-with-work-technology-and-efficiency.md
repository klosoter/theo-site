### TITLE
The Church After Innovation: Questioning Our Obsession With Work Technology and Efficiency - Andrew Root

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary North American Protestant context where church leaders import Silicon Valley language (innovation, startups, metrics) into congregational life.
 - Engages the rise of ecclesial "innovation labs," church planting incubators, and managerial consulting models for ministry.
 - Situated in pastoral-theological and practical-theology debates about formation, technology, and vocational identity.

- **Central thesis**
 - The church's uncritical embrace of innovation, efficiency, and work-technology reshapes its identity away from formation, worship, and vocation into a productivity-driven enterprise; Root argues for a re-theologizing of ministry practice rooted in ecclesial practices and embodied formation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: Documents how innovation rhetoric (startups, hacks, iterative design, metrics) shapes budgets, staff roles, and theological imagination, producing a church obsessed with measurable outcomes.
 - Theological critique: Shows how this rhetoric aligns with modern capitalist and utilitarian anthropology, eroding doctrines of vocation, sacrament, and Sabbath.
 - Recovery: Proposes an alternative ecclesial grammar centered on practices (liturgical, vocational, contemplative) that form discipleship rather than optimize outputs.
 - Practical implications: Recommends reconfiguring ministry training, leadership evaluation, and congregational rhythms to resist managerialism and cultivate long-term formation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Contemporary practitioners and consultants who promote "church innovation" (implicitly and explicitly critiqued).
 - Theologians and thinkers on formation and liturgy (dialogue with pastoral theology traditions; affinity with James K.A. Smith on practices).
 - Social-theoretical resources on work, technology, and capitalism (selected cultural critics and sociologists of work).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology** (primary): what counts as church and ministry.
 - **Anthropology/vocation**: what it means to be human and called.
 - **Sacramentality and liturgy**: as formative counter-practices to efficiency.
 - **Practical theology and pastoral care**: leadership formation and congregational practices.
 - Implicit engagement with eschatology (finishing well vs. relentless productivity).

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically the book reframes church life as a practice-centered, formative vocation that resists innovation-as-efficiency and reclaims the church as an embodied counterpublic shaped by worship, Sabbath, and durable practices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats "innovation" not merely as a management fad but as a quasi-theological formation force shaping desires and imaginations.
 - Prioritizes embodied practices (Sabbath, liturgy, apprenticeship) over programmatic innovations and KPIs.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects entrepreneurial/ministry-efficiency models that equate church health with growth metrics and optimized workflows.
 - Contrasts short-term iterative planning with long-term spiritual formation and the patience of discipleship.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Names and analyzes an emergent "innovation theology" - the implicit set of beliefs about work, progress, and human flourishing embedded in contemporary church management.
 - Recasts pastoral leadership language: from CEO/manager metaphors to pastor-mentor, liturgist, and cultivator of practices.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Positively received in pastoral-theological and youth-ministry circles as a corrective to managerial trends.
 - Criticized by advocates of innovation who argue Root underestimates adaptability needs for mission in a changing cultural landscape.
 - Used in seminary courses on practical theology and congregational leadership as a counterbalance to organizational models.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes sustained theological reflection on technology, work, and ecclesial formation.
 - Durable resource for reframing ministry curricula toward practices, vocation, and liturgical imagination.
 - Serves as a touchstone for churches wanting to resist commodification and re-center worship and formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Innovation**: The cultural-managerial discourse (startups, disruption) transplanted into church life; critiqued as formative of desires.
- **Efficiency**: The metric-driven ethos that privileges measurable outputs over formative depth.
- **Metrics / KPIs**: Performance indicators used to evaluate ministry success; critiqued as inadequate for assessing spiritual formation.
- **Entrepreneurial church**: Church modeled on business/startup paradigms; contrasted with a formative ecclesiology.
- **Formation / Formative Practices**: Long-term cultivation of Christian character via liturgy, Sabbath, apprenticeship - central alternative proposed.
- **Sabbath**: As resistive practice against productivity paradigms; a theological rhythm for discipleship.
- **Vocation**: Reclaimed as identity-defining calling, not merely role for efficiency; counters utilitarian job-framing.
- **Liturgy / Worship as Practice**: Worship recentered as primary formative practice shaping desires and imagination.
- **Embodiment**: Attention to embodied practices and presence as theological corrective to virtual/tech-driven efficiency.
- **Pastoral imagination**: The vision for leadership that cultivates people rather than optimizes systems.
- **Technological formation**: The ways technologies and work-structures shape human habits and theological outlooks.
- **Consumer church**: Church-as-product logic where congregants are customers judged by satisfaction metrics.
- **Counterpublic / Ecclesial counterculture**: The church as a public shaped by alternative practices resisting dominant culture.
- **Innovation theology (term)**: Root's label for the set of implicit theological claims embedded in innovation discourse.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for critiquing "innovation culture" in ecclesiology and pastoral theology.
 - As a **polemic** against managerial, metrics-driven ministry models in clergy formation and congregational strategy.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** toward practice-theory and formation-focused curricula in seminary and lay leadership training.
