### TITLE
God's Kingdom through God's Covenants: A Concise Biblical Theology - Peter J. Gentry and Stephen J. Wellum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid the resurgence of canonical and redemptive-historical biblical theology within conservative evangelicalism.
 - Situated in the Reformed evangelical milieu; dialogue partner to both classical covenant theology and dispensationalism; closely related to the Progressive Covenantalism movement (Wellum a leading voice).
- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible's grand narrative is best organized as the unfolding of **God's kingdom through a succession of covenants**, where each covenant advances the single covenantal plan accomplished in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents a canonical, redemptive-historical survey: Adam (creation/kingdom mandate) → Noah → Abraham → Moses → David → Exilic promises → New Covenant in Christ.
 - Each covenant is analyzed for its **promise, administration, sign/ceremony, and typological fulfillment** in Christ and the church.
 - Argues for **continuity** of the covenantal promises (one redemptive plan) alongside **progressive fulfillment** (distinct administrations and stages).
 - Emphasizes canonical reading: Old Testament covenants prepare and point forward to Christ as the climactic fulfillment and inaugurator of the kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages modern biblical-theological scholars (e.g., Graeme Goldsworthy, G. K. Beale), Reformed theologians, and exegetes of covenant theology; contrasts with dispensational interpreters.
 - Uses close exegesis of key OT and NT passages (promises to Abraham, Davidic covenant, Jeremiah 31, Pauline and Johannine Christology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (progressive and covenantal), covenant theology, Christology (fulfillment motif), kingdom theology, ecclesiology (church as covenant community), eschatology (already/not yet), typology and sacramentology (OT signs as types).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - God's single covenantal purpose - to establish his kingdom - unfolds progressively through covenant administrations and finds decisive fulfillment in Christ, whose person and work both inherit and consummate the promises.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Explicitly frames the entire biblical story as **"kingdom through covenants"**, rather than covenant only or kingdom only-making the covenantal administrations the structural lenses for kingdom theology.
 - Balanced stress on **both continuity and discontinuity**: promises are continuous; administrations and forms of fulfillment are progressively new.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - **Against Dispensationalism**: rejects a sharp, ontological Israel/Church divide and periodization that severs OT promises from their fulfillment in Christ and the church.
 - **Refines (rather than rejects) classical covenant theology**: retains covenantal unity but more carefully delineates the distinctive administrations (e.g., covenant of works/creation, covenant of grace as realized in concrete historical covenants).
 - **Relation to Progressive Covenantalism**: aligns with and contributes to PCC by advancing a model that highlights progressive realization of one covenantal economy while maintaining particularity of each covenant.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes a concise taxonomy of covenants as covenantal administrations of the one redemptive covenantal plan, using kingdom as the telos to interpret each covenant's function.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a clear, compact textbook for biblical theology courses.
 - Influential in ecclesial debates over hermeneutics for Israel/church, typology, and the interpretation of covenant promises.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, pedagogical bridge between detailed exegesis and systematic theology; durable as an entry-level but theologically robust model for teaching redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant-kingdom** - the formative phrase: covenants are the means by which God builds his kingdom; kingdom is covenantal telos.
- **Covenantal administrations** - each historical covenant (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, Exilic, New) as a distinct mode of the one covenantal plan.
- **Continuity and discontinuity** - methodological principle: promises persist; administrations and fulfillment forms change.
- **Adamic covenant** - creation mandate/covenant of works as the initial covenantal framework for human kingship under God.
- **Abrahamic promises** - land, offspring, blessing reframed as covenantal seed and kingdom promise leading to Christ.
- **Mosaic covenant** - covenantal administration that governs corporate life and mediates kingdom order pre-fulfillment.
- **Davidic covenant** - the royal promise central to messianic expectation and fulfilled in Christ's kingship.
- **New Covenant** - climactic covenant where promises are consummated in Christ; inaugurated/realized eschatology emphasized.
- **Typology / promise-fulfillment hermeneutic** - reading OT persons/rites as types that find fulfillment in Christ and the church.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - canonical method stressing trajectory and fulfillment across Scripture.
- **Israel and the church** - related covenantally; the church is the community of the fulfilled promise without denying ethnic-historical significance of Israel.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - kingdom realized in Christ's first coming, consummated at his return.
- **Canon as interpretive guide** - the whole canon shapes meaning; no isolated proof-texting.
- **Progressive realization** - theological motif for how promises are progressively unfolded through administrations.
- **Use in loci**
 - As a **definition source** for a covenantal taxonomy and kingdom telos in systematic and biblical theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against dispensational separations of Israel and church and against simplistic covenant schemas.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading covenants and typology across OT and NT.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on biblical theology that bridge exegesis and dogmatics.
