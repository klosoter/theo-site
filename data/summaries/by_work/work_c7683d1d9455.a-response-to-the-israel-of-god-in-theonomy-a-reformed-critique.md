### TITLE
A Response to "The Israel of God" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late-20th-century Reformed engagement with the theonomy/Christian Reconstruction movement; written amid renewed debate over the relation of Israel and church, the role of Old Testament law, and eschatology in Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's treatment of Israel in Romans 11 must be read within covenantal and Christocentric categories; Jewish future salvation is real but is to be understood as fulfillment in Christ and as corporate continuity (not ethnic political restoration nor crude supersessionism).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - exegetical close-read of Romans 9-11 with primary attention to the olive-tree metaphor in ch. 11;
 - affirmation that Paul envisions an **ingrafting** of Jewish branches into the one covenant people, not the creation of a parallel covenantal polity;
 - insistence on **inaugurated eschatology**: the fullness of Gentiles and the eventual turning of Israel are part of salvation-historical realization already secured in Christ;
 - polemical correction of readings that either secularize Israel into national politics or treat Israel and the church as wholly separate salvific communities.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** theonomist/Reconstructionist tendencies in Theonomy volume; general interlocution with both supersessionist and ethnic-nationalistic readings of Israel (no extended engagement with dispensational minutiae, but clear corrective to extremes).
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant (continuity and fulfilment), election, ecclesiology (the one people of God), soteriology (remnant, ingrafting), eschatology (already/not-yet fulfillment), hermeneutics (Pauline typology and corporate identity).
- **Closing line:** Gaffin centers the debate on Paul's covenantal, Christ-centered reading of Israel - Jewish future salvation is a promised, covenantal ingrafting realized in Christ within the one people of God, avoiding both national restorationism and simplistic replacementism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - reads Romans 11 as a juridical-covenantal account of God's faithfulness to his elect purposes, not as a template for modern political restoration of ethnic Israel;
 - stresses the corporate, organic imagery (olive tree) to argue for continuity of God's people across epochs.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - corrects theonomist tendencies to conflate biblical Israel with contemporary nation-state formulations or to read OT law as civil blueprint tied to ethnic Israel's restoration;
 - also resists reductionist supersessionism that obliterates the specific, promised future blessing for Israel announced by Paul.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - refreshes traditional covenantal language by applying Pauline olive-tree dynamics as a model for how God preserves corporate identity through remnant and ingrafting.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - widely cited in Reformed circles as a measured corrective to both Reconstructionist overreach and naïve dispensational restorationism; valued by Pauline exegetes and covenant theologians.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - models disciplined Pauline exegesis oriented by covenant and Christology; serves as a clarifying midpoint between polar readings of Israel's future.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Olive tree / ingrafting:** central Pauline metaphor in Romans 11; used to demonstrate corporate continuity and the possibility of Jewish restoration into the one people of God.
- **Remnant:** God's elect within Israel; explains persistent Jewish faithful presence across redemptive history.
- **Ingrafting vs. grafting out:** distinctions across Paul's figure: Gentiles grafted in, natural branches broken off; Gaffin stresses the contingency and mercy of both actions as covenantal acts.
- **Covenant continuity:** thesis that God's covenant people persist as one corporate entity fulfilled in Christ, not bifurcated into competing salvific polities.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** the "already/not-yet" framework that situates Israel's future turning as eschatological fulfilment enacted in Christ's work.
- **Supersessionism (crude):** rejected when understood as erasing God's declared future for ethnic Israel; Gaffin opposes simplistic versions that deny Paul's promise of future turning.
- **Ethnic-national restorationism:** critiqued as illegitimate reading of Romans 11 when it seeks a modern political or civil restoration as scriptural mandate.
- **Election / divine faithfulness:** Paul's assurance that God has not rejected Israel ultimately; Gaffin underscores divine faithfulness as the theological backbone of Romans 11.
- **Corporate identity / people of God:** emphasis on ecclesiological unity under Christ rather than parallel covenant communities.
- **Typology:** sees OT promises typologically fulfilled in Christ; Israel's promises are realized in him.
- **Law and gospel relation:** background concern - Gaffin demurs from readings that base modern civil law programs or political aims on a literalist application of Israel's covenant law.
- **Pauline hermeneutics:** advocates reading Paul on Israel in continuity with his soteriology and Christology.
- **Future salvation of Israel:** affirmed as a theological promise in Romans 11 but interpreted spiritually and covenantally, not politically.

How this work is used across loci:
- as a **definitional source** for covenantal readings of Romans 11 and the concept of ingrafting;
- as a **polemic** against both theonomic/Restorationist political readings of Israel and crude supersessionism;
- as an **exegetical model** for integrating Pauline theology, covenant doctrine, and inaugurated eschatology in treatments of Israel's future.
