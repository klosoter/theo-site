### TITLE
The Doctrine of Scripture - Francis Turretin (with secondary reference to John Frame, The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687) wrote his Institutio Theologiae Elencticae against the backdrop of post-Reformation polemics (Arminianism, Socinianism, Roman Catholic casuistry) and the rise of Cartesian philosophy.
 - Work functions as systematic, disputational exposition defending classical Reformed orthodoxy on revelation and Scripture.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the infallible, sufficient, and authoritative Word of God by which God is known; natural knowledge of God (general revelation) is real but insufficient - special revelation in Scripture is necessary for saving knowledge and certitude.
 - The broader epistemological concern: how God is knowable and how certainty of divine truth is secured in the believer.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and nature of Scripture: divine origin, propositional content, verbal authenticity.
 - Inspiration and inerrancy: God as ultimate author; human authors true authors in their styles while divine truth is preserved (no essential error).
 - Canonicity and authority: criteria for the canon; Scripture's formal and real authority over faith and life.
 - Illumination and internal testimony: Spirit's work ensures assent and certitude to believers.
 - Relation to natural knowledge of God: clear distinction between what can be known by reason (existence, power, providence) and what requires revelation (Trinity, redemption).
 - Polemical clarifications vs. rationalist and anti-Trinitarian positions that reduce Scripture's sufficiency or certainty.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Calvin as theological ancestor; disputes with Arminians, Socinians, and Catholic scholastics; responds to Cartesian epistemology and tendencies toward rationalism.
 - John Frame cited secondarily as a modern epistemological interpreter, highlighting the doctrine of knowledge of God and the interrelation of revelation, reason, and faith.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), inspiration, inerrancy, canonicity, illumination (internal testimony of the Spirit), authority, sufficiency, perspicuity, relation of Scripture to reason and conscience.
 - Connected loci: existence and knowability of God, faith and assent, epistemic certitude, and apologetics.

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin centers the doctrine of Scripture on Scripture's divine authorship and sufficiency: God is knowable in part by creation but fully and certainly by the written Word, authenticated and secured by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precise scholastic distinctions: degrees of knowledge (natural vs. revealed), forms of authority (formal vs. real), and types of certitude (moral probability vs. fideistic certitudo).
 - Strong insistence on propositional, verbal aspects of revelation without collapsing divine authorship into mechanical dictation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - More ecclesiastically and polemically rigorous than Calvin: sharper contra-Socinian proofs for canonicity and against rationalistic reductions.
 - Corrects Cartesian tendencies by refusing to ground divine knowledge purely in autonomous reason; insists on the necessity of Spirit-witnessed revelation for saving certitude.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Functional refinement of "illumination" - not mystical intuition but Spirit-enabled assent to propositional truth.
 - Nuanced handling of inspiration that allows human stylistic diversity while maintaining plenary trustworthiness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy and seminary pedagogy (Princeton, American Reformed traditions); widely used as a polemical manual against liberalizing trends.
 - Continues to inform conservative evangelical defenses of inerrancy and the internal testimony of the Spirit.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological model for precise doctrinal formulation; resources for apologetics regarding the knowability of God and the epistemic role of Scripture; useful corrective to both fideism and rationalist epistemologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture (Scriptura)** - the written Word, divinely authoritative, propositional in content.
- **Inspiration (Inspiratio)** - God as ultimate author; human authors retain personality and style.
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture without essential error in its teaching; basis for certitude.
- **Canonicity** - criteria and vindication of the canonical books; church recognition under Spirit's guidance.
- **Sufficiency** - Scripture contains all things necessary for faith and life; supplements but does not supersede general revelation.
- **Perspicuity** - Scripture is sufficiently clear for salvation to those who use it rightly; requires the Spirit and ordinary means.
- **Illumination / Internal testimony of the Spirit** - Spirit's work enabling true assent and assurance to believers.
- **General revelation (natural knowledge of God)** - knowledge of God's existence, power, and providence available to all; foundational but not salvific or exhaustive.
 - Relation: sufficient for natural theology and moral accountability; insufficient for redemption and special truths (Trinity, incarnation).
- **Certitude (Certitudo fidei)** - doctrinal assurance; Turretin distinguishes moral probability from saving certitude grounded in Spirit-witness and evidential warrant.
- **Authority (formal vs. real)** - Scripture's formal authority as rule of faith; real authority inasmuch as it derives from divine origin.
- **Assent vs. Faith** - intellectual assent to truths and faith as trust and commitment; both aided by Spirit and evidence.
- **Accommodation** - divine condescension in revelation to human capacities without error.
- **Propositional revelation** - Turretin's preference for clear propositional content as the medium of divine self-disclosure.
- **Sensus divinitatis (implicit relation)** - background notion of an innate capacity to know God, limited by sin; informs Turretin's account of general revelation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a precise **definition source** for doctrines of inspiration, inerrancy, and canonicity.
 - As a **polemic/manual** against rationalism, Socinianism, and theological liberalism on the knowability of God.
 - As an **epistemological model** tying Scripture, Spirit, and reason together for certitude in theology.
