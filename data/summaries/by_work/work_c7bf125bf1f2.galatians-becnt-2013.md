### TITLE
Galatians (BECNT, 2013) - Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - BECNT commentary published 2013 amid intensified debate over the New Perspective on Paul (NPP). Targets both traditional forensic readings and recent NPP revisions while writing from a broadly conservative-evangelical, historically informed exegesis tradition.
 - Original epistolary context of Galatians: mid-first century Paul (commonly dated ca. 48-55 CE), conflict with Judaizing opponents over Gentile inclusion, circumcision, and law-observance demands.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Galatians defends the gospel of **justification by faith** against opponents who would reinstate law-based identity markers; Moo argues Paul's language is fundamentally **forensic** and involves **imputation** of Christ's righteousness, not merely ethnic boundary regulation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduction and situation (1:1-2:21): Paul's apostolic authority, autobiographical defense.
 - Polemic against Judaizers and theological clarification (3:1-4:31): role of promise, law, and faith; allegory of Hagar/Sarah.
 - Practical exhortation and ethical implications (5:1-6:10): freedom in Christ, life in the Spirit, fruits and community.
 - Closing doxology and final warnings (6:11-18).
 - Methodology: tight syntactical and rhetorical exegesis of Greek, careful attention to Paul's argument moves; explicit engagement with NPP claims about "works of the law."

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Paul and the Judaizing teachers in Galatia.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright and other NPP proponents; also classical commentators in BECNT tradition.
 - Uses Greco-Roman background, Jewish covenantal theology, and New Testament parallels.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Justification**, **imputation**, and **forensic language**.
 - Covenant and law (promise vs. law).
 - Christology (union with Christ; the righteousness of Christ).
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as locus of life and ethical formation).
 - Ecclesiology and identity (inclusion of Gentiles; marks of the covenant community).

- **Closing line**
 - Moo locates Galatians theologically at the defense of a forensic, imputed justification that secures Gentile inclusion and Christian freedom grounded in union with Christ and the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, sustained defense of **forensic imputation** as central to Paul's soteriology in Galatians.
 - Integrated reading: syntactic/Gk exegesis combined with theological argument rather than purely historical reconstruction.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct and detailed critique of NPP claims that Paul's justification language is primarily covenantal membership rhetoric or non-forensic. Moo argues NPP readings underplay legal imagery and the ethical-not-forensic is insufficient.
 - Counters readings that reduce "works of the law" to mere boundary markers by arguing for a broader function without abandoning forensic contours of justification.

- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications**
 - Tight distinction between **justification as forensic declaration** and **sanctification/ethical transformation**; clarifies how Paul can speak both of status (declared righteous) and transformed life (fruit of Spirit).
 - Reasserts **imputation** (Christ's righteousness accounted to believer) as exegetically warranted.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted widely in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a leading contemporary conservative commentary on Galatians.
 - Valued by scholars resisting NPP excesses; also respected by broader NT scholars for careful Greek and balanced engagement with literature.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a reliable exegetical model for combining syntactical rigor with theological commitment; strong resource for teaching justification, Pauline theology, and NPP engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - For Moo: principally a **forensic declaration** by God, central to Paul's gospel in Galatians.

- **Imputation**
 - The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; key to Moo's soteriology.

- **Forensic / forensic language**
 - Legal metaphors (declare, count, reckon) that signal courtroom-style divine action.

- **Works of the law**
 - Discussed in relation to NPP: Moo allows boundary-marker functions but insists on broader ethical/legal implications compatible with forensic justification.

- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Moo critically engages NPP figures (Sanders, Dunn, Wright), accepting some historical insights but rejecting reduction of justification to mere covenantal membership language.

- **Faith / pistis**
 - Understood as trustful reliance on Christ that grounds justification; not merely allegiance to covenant.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The relational axis that explains how believers receive Christ's righteousness and Spirit-empowered life.

- **Covenant / promise vs. law**
 - Paul's argument centers on promise to Abraham and the law's temporary role until Christ.

- **Righteousness of God**
 - Ambiguous term explored: forensic declarative sense prioritized, but relational and eschatological dimensions acknowledged.

- **Spirit**
 - Marker of inclusion and ethical transformation; evidence accompanying justification.

- **Judaizers / opponents**
 - Historical catalysts in Galatia whose demands prompt Paul's forensic defense.

- **Boundary markers**
 - Concept from NPP; Moo treats as relevant but insufficient to overturn forensic language.

- **Apocalyptic motifs**
 - Background layer in Paul's thought considered but subordinate to legal/forensic interpretation in this work.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for evangelical/Reformed articulation of forensic justification and imputation.
- **Polemic resource** against NPP readings that minimize forensic categories.
- **Exegetical model** demonstrating syntactical, rhetorical, and theological reading of Galatians for classroom and sermon preparation.
