### TITLE
The Escondido Theology: A Reformed Response to Two Kingdoms Theology - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - A late-20th-century Reformed corrective addressed to contemporary proponents of a strict Two Kingdoms model; offered from within evangelical/Reformed academic and pastoral networks.
 - Engages debates about the scope of Christ's rule, common grace, and the relation of church and culture that recur in post-Kuyperian and neo-Lutheran discussions.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Two Kingdoms thesis wrongly bifurcates Christ's rule and Scripture's authority into separate, non-overlapping realms. Frame argues for a single, comprehensive lordship of Christ such that Scripture's norms govern all human life though applied with doctrinal distinctions.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic move: characterizes two-kingdom models as a principled separation of the sacred and the secular that yields theological and ethical anomalies.
 - Theological alternative: affirms a covenantal, Christ-centered monarchy that is both universal (Christ as Lord over all) and particular (distinct offices and responsibilities in church, family, state, and culture).
 - Method: grounds the critique in Reformed confessional commitments, a covenantal reading of redemptive history, and Frame's tri-perspectival method (normative, situational, existential).
 - Practical implication: Christians are obliged to apply Scripture as authoritative in all spheres while recognizing proper role-distinctions and nonidentical applications.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit interlocutors include advocates of Two Kingdoms readings of Kuyper/Luther and modern interpreters who emphasize a sharp church/world divide.
 - Dialogue with Klinean covenant thinkers is evident in the treatment of covenant structure and ethical application (see "intrusion ethics" critique).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture's authority, covenant theology (distribution and continuity), Christology and the kingship of Christ, common grace vs. special grace, law and ethics, church-state relations.

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on a Reformed insistence that Christ's lordship is both universal and normatively binding: Scripture governs all life without collapsing distinct covenantal roles.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on a single, comprehensive kingship of Christ rather than parallel or insulated realms.
 - Use of tri-perspectivalism as a hermeneutical and ethical tool to explain how one Scripture can govern diverse human situations without flattening distinctions.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects the strict Two Kingdoms bifurcation that confines Scriptural authority to the church/sanctified sphere.
 - Modifies some Klinean emphases by arguing that "intrusion" models can unintentionally privatize theological normativity if they separate covenantal administrations too sharply.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts cultural engagement in covenantal terms: discipleship and common life are subject to Scripture's normativity, construed through covenant offices and human responsibilities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by many Reformed pastors and scholars as a compact, theologically grounded rebuttal to Two Kingdoms readings.
 - Functions as a go-to piece in curricular discussions on Christian social ethics and public theology within conservative Reformed circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to integrate confessional Reformed commitments with a robust cultural theology; valuable as both polemic and constructive alternative for teaching and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Two Kingdoms theology**
 - The view that God rules by different norms in a religious (spiritual) and a civil (temporal) kingdom; primary target of Frame's critique.
- **Lordship of Christ**
 - Central Reformed affirmation that Christ rules all creation and human institutions; Frame stresses universality and normative authority.
- **Covenant theology (Reformed)**
 - The framework used to locate continuity and distinctions in God's dealings; applied to rebut bifurcation of realms.
- **Klinean covenant theology**
 - Meredith G. Kline's covenantal structuring of redemptive history; Frame engages and corrects certain pragmatic ethical implications.
- **Intrusion ethics**
 - A phrase used in the debate to describe views that treat redemptive acts as occasional "intrusions" into otherwise autonomous spheres; critiqued for undercutting normative Scripture application.
- **Common grace vs. special grace**
 - Distinction concerns God's non-saving gifts to humanity vs. saving benefits in Christ; Frame emphasizes that common grace does not remove Scripture's normativity.
- **Tri-perspectivalism (normative, situational, existential)**
 - Frame's method for analyzing how Scripture speaks to rules (normative), facts/circumstances (situational), and personal response (existential).
- **Cultural mandate**
 - The creation-order responsibility to cultivate and steward creation; for Frame this mandate is under Christ's lordship and governed by Scripture.
- **Normative principle**
 - The claim that Scripture provides binding norms for life and society; used to counter the Two Kingdoms idea of separate normative orders.
- **Role distinction**
 - The notion that different social offices (church, family, state) have distinct duties without forfeiting common accountability to Scripture.
- **Public theology**
 - The field of applying theological convictions to social and political life; Frame's essay functions as a model for this integration.
- **Ethical application**
 - How Scripture's norms are concretely applied; Frame insists on principled yet contextualized application using tri-perspectival tools.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **polemic** against Two Kingdoms formulations in ecclesiology and public theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on Reformed ethics and covenant theology to demonstrate integrated lordship and normative application.
 - As a **definition source** for tri-perspectival application of Scripture to cultural issues and for clarifying the limits of "intrusion" language.
