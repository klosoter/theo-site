### TITLE
The Attributes of God - Peter A. Lillback (essay in Solid Ground: The Inerrant Word of God in an Errant World)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary conservative Reformed setting (early 21st century). Essay appears in a volume defending biblical inerrancy; Lillback writes as a confessional Reformed theologian and seminary president, addressing a readership concerned with orthodoxy, scriptural authority, and pastoral clarity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A robust doctrine of the divine attributes (properly framed as *absolute* and *relative*) is essential both to classical theism and to a principled defense of biblical inerrancy: misunderstanding God's attributes yields error in how Scripture, revelation, and truth are conceived.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define and distinguish **absolute** (attributes intrinsic to God's being) and **relative** (attributes as God relates to creation/creatures) properties.
 - Situate these categories within classical Reformed commitments: divine simplicity, immutability, aseity, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence as core absolutes.
 - Show how relative attributes (holiness, mercy, love, righteousness, faithfulness) express God's relational activity-especially covenantal and redemptive acts culminating in Christ and Scripture.
 - Argue that correct attribute theology guards against anthropomorphism, deism, process theology, and open theism, and undergirds confidence in Scripture's truthfulness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit appeal to classical sources (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed scholastics) and contemporary conservative critics of liberal and process theologies. Engages theological trends that relativize divine immutability or omniscience.
- **Doctrines treated:** Doctrine of God (central), Trinity (backgrounded but presupposed), revelation and inerrancy (applied locus), providence, and Christology (in relation to God's relational attributes).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** A coherent account of absolute and relative attributes secures both classical theism and confident trust in the Bible as the infallible self-revelation of the God whose being and acts are perfectly truthful.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Explicit linking of the absolute/relative attribute distinction to the doctrine of inerrancy-i.e., God's intrinsic truthfulness (an absolute) legitimates Scripture's inerrant character (a relational disclosure).
 - Pastoral-apologetic slant: attributes are treated to defend orthodoxy against contemporary theological deformities.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects modern tendencies to treat attributes as separable parts (avoids hypostatization) while also resisting reduction of relational attributes to mere metaphors.
 - Pushes back against theological movements (process/open theism) that compromise immutability or exhaustive foreknowledge.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tight pairing of traditional communicable/incommunicable language with the absolute/relative distinction to make application to revelation clearer.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and confessional evangelical circles as a clear, usable summary linking philosophical theism to pastoral concerns about Scripture.
 - Used in seminary classrooms and apologetics contexts where inerrancy and classical divine attributes are defended together.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between historical systematic theology and contemporary apologetic needs; valuable in teaching God's attributes while showing practical implications for doctrine of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes:** Perfections intrinsic to God's being (e.g., aseity, simplicity, immutability, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence). Ground the metaphysical basis of truthfulness.
- **Relative attributes:** Perfections as God stands in relation to creation (e.g., love, mercy, holiness, righteousness, faithfulness). Explain God's redemptive actions and covenantal disclosure.
- **Incommunicable attributes:** Traits not shared with creatures (closely overlaps with absolutes: aseity, immutability, simplicity).
- **Communicable attributes:** Traits creatures may reflect in finitude (linked to relative attributes: wisdom, holiness, love).
- **Divine simplicity:** The doctrine that God is not composite; attributes are identical with God's essence-used to avoid hypostatization.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence; grounds God's authority and the trustworthiness of revelation.
- **Immutability:** God's unchanging nature; used to rebut claims that God's knowledge, purposes, or moral character can change.
- **Omniscience / Omnipotence / Omnipresence:** Classical absolutes; serve as checks on proposals that limit God's knowledge, power, or presence.
- **Holiness / Righteousness / Mercy / Love:** Examples of relative attributes that explain how an immutable God acts graciously toward sinners without compromising justice.
- **Revelation / Inerrancy:** Scripture as the authoritative, truthful disclosure of God's being and acts; inerrancy is defended as the necessary epistemic correlate of divine truthfulness.
- **Covenant:** Framework under which relative attributes (faithfulness, mercy) are demonstrated historically and redemptively.
- **Trinitarian relations (implicit):** Grounds relationality within God without denying unity; preserves how relative attributes are truly divine.
- **Polemic targets:** Process theology, open theism, theological liberalism-positions that, according to Lillback, mis-handle attributes.
- **Pastoral-apologetic use:** Lillback's treatment is used to connect doctrine of God to congregational confidence in Scripture.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for pairing absolute/relative with communicable/incommunicable categories in dogmatics.
 - As a **polemic tool** against views that relativize immutability or exhaustive foreknowledge.
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot** linking attribute theology to the doctrine of revelation and inerrancy in classroom and apologetic contexts.
