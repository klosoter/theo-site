### TITLE
The New Perspective on Paul (selected essays and contributions)
Author: **Stephen Westerholm**
Scope: critical engagement with the New Perspective on Paul (Sanders, Dunn, Wright) across essays and edited-volume chapters; defense of a forensic reading of Pauline justification.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th - early 21st century debates sparked by E. P. Sanders' work on Second Temple Judaism; subsequent waves from James D. G. Dunn and N. T. Wright.
 - Westerholm writes as a historically attentive critic from within the evangelical/Reformed conversation, dialoguing with historians and interpreters of Paul.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The main contention: the New Perspective (NPP) often underplays or misunderstands the **forensic, declarative character of Paul's doctrine of justification**, replacing it with sociological/covenantal or eschatological models that weaken imputation and forensic forgiveness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close philological and contextual readings of Pauline vocabulary (dikaioo, dikaiosune, logizomai) to show dominant forensic usages.
 - Historical-theological corrective to readings that reduce justification to covenant membership or eschatological vindication.
 - Theological defense of **forensic imputation**: God's declarative acquittal of the ungodly on grounds of Christ's righteousness is central to Paul.
 - Critical engagement with key NPP moves:
 - Rejection of "works-righteousness" as Paul's target;
 - Emphasis on boundary-marking function of "works of the law";
 - Reinterpretation of "faith" as primarily **faithfulness** of Jesus or as corporate identity marker.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: **E. P. Sanders**, **James D. G. Dunn**, **N. T. Wright**.
 - Scriptural focus: Paul's letters (especially Romans and Galatians); Second Temple Jewish studies for context.
 - Reformation and patristic traditions mobilized to test theological continuity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Justification** (central), imputation/forensic declaration, soteriology, covenant (as background), Pauline Christology, sin and law.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Westerholm aims to preserve the classical Protestant insight that Paul proclaims a divine, forensic acquittal of sinners in Christ - a declarative imputation - while still taking seriously Jewish contexts and covenantal language.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Persistent insistence on the **forensic grammar** of Pauline justification; close lexical and rhetorical attention to courtroom metaphors.
 - Balances historical sensitivity to Judaism with theological commitments to the Reformation reading of Paul.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects NPP tendencies that minimize legal-forensic categories by showing where Paul uses verdict language to address guilt, penalty, and acquittal.
 - Challenges Wrightian eschatological and participatory readings that make justification primarily about covenant membership or future vindication.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and defends the modern usage of **"forensic imputation"** as a theologically necessary category to account for Pauline proclamation of righteousness.
 - Emphasizes the semantic field of Paul's vocabulary rather than reducing terms to single sociological functions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among conservative and confessional Protestant scholars as a primary NPP critique.
 - Influential in seminars on Romans/Galatians and in systematic theologies defending imputation and assurance.
 - Respected by many moderates for methodological rigor; contested by NPP proponents but essential to the debate.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to marry rigorous exegesis with doctrinal clarity; valuable as a corrective to readings that flatten Paul into merely socio-historical categories.
 - Serves as a sustained defense of the forensic dimension of justification for teaching and confessional work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - For Westerholm: primarily a **declarative, forensic verdict** by God acquitting sinners on the basis of Christ.
- **Forensic / Forensic Imputation**
 - Language of courtroom verdicts; **Christ's righteousness is imputed** and counted to believers in God's declaration.
- **Imputation**
 - Transfer language (crediting Christ's righteousness / charging sin to Christ) as central to Pauline soteriology.
- **Works of the law**
 - NPP reads as boundary markers; Westerholm insists Paul often opposes works that presume self-justification before God.
- **Works-righteousness**
 - The older Protestant category meaning human attempts to earn justification; Westerholm defends its continued theological relevance.
- **Covenantal nomism**
 - Sanders' description of Jewish piety; Westerholm accepts context but resists substituting covenantal language for forensic categories.
- **Participation / Participationist readings**
 - Wright and others emphasize union with Christ; Westerholm treats participation as complementary but not substitutive of forensic declaration.
- **Eschatological vindication**
 - NPP emphasis that justification is future vindication; Westerholm argues Paul's language also includes present declarative acquittal.
- **Faith / Faithfulness (pistis)**
 - Debate over whether pistis primarily denotes human trust or Christ's faithfulness; Westerholm argues for classical reading that centers faith as trust by which one receives the declarative verdict.
- **Dikaioo / Dikaiosune / Logizomai**
 - Close lexical analysis: these terms often function in verdict and accounting senses in Paul.
- **NPP (New Perspective on Paul)**
 - The conversational target; Westerholm engages its historiography and theology.
- **Sanders / Dunn / Wright**
 - Primary interlocutors whose work frames Westerholm's critique.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for forensic imputation in systematics.
 - As **polemic** against NPP readings in Pauline theology courses.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating lexical-contextual argumentation for justification language.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** when integrating historical Jewish context with Reformation doctrinal insights.
