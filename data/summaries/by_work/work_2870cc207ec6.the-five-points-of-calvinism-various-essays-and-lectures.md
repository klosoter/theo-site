### TITLE
The Five Points of Calvinism (various essays and lectures) - Robert L. Dabney

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-to-late 19th century American Presbyterianism; Dabney wrote as a Southern Presbyterian theologian and seminary professor (Union Theological Seminary, VA) within the conservative Princeton-Reformed milieu after the Second Great Awakening and during heated debates with American revivalists and Arminians.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** a robust defense and systematic exposition of the classical five points (TULIP) with special attention to **Regeneration and Effectual Calling**: that sinners are totally depraved, elect are unconditionally chosen, Christ's atonement is definite, grace is effectual (irresistible) and the elect persevere.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes human moral inability (total depravity) from Scripture and experience as the grounds for divine initiative.
 - Argues for **unconditional election**: God's choice is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
 - Treats **regeneration (new birth)** as an immediate, supernatural act of the Holy Spirit that precedes and enables faith and repentance.
 - Asserts **effectual calling/irresistible grace**: when God calls, He changes the heart so that the elect inevitably believe.
 - Uses exegesis (John 6:44, Romans 8-9, Ephesians 2), philosophical argument (will, moral inability, compatibilism), and pastoral examples to show coherence of the five points.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary sources: Scripture, John Calvin, Augustine, Jonathan Edwards.
 - Interlocutors: Jacobus Arminius and later Arminians/Wesleyan revivalists; contemporary American theologians (Princeton school: Hodge lines), opponents in revivalist camp.
 - Philosophical-theological engagement: debates over free will (compatibilist account favored) and the nature of causation in regeneration.
- **Doctrines treated:** soteriology (regeneration, calling, justification, sanctification, perseverance), anthropology (total depravity), pneumatology (Spirit's regenerating work), covenant theology implications, and pastoral theology (assurance).
- **Closing line:** Dabney's work locates the theological center of gravity in God's sovereign, efficacious initiative in salvation - particularly the Spirit's regenerating call that antecedently enables faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong, systematic insistence that **regeneration is prior to faith** and is a real ontological renovation, not merely a change of outward behavior or decision.
 - Emphatic restorations of philosophical **compatibilism**: moral responsibility and divine determinance are reconcilable.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back sharply against Arminian/prevenient-grace models that make divine election contingent on foreseen faith.
 - Critiques revivalist voluntarism that over-privileges human decision and experiential impulses apart from sovereign grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precise linking of "effectual calling" with a transcendent, causal regeneration so that the categories of calling, regeneration, and faith are tightly ordered.
 - Distinguishes carefully between external/general calling and internal/effectual calling (the latter being the regenerating act).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and Southern Presbyterian circles; used as a systematic and polemical resource for defending TULIP into the 20th century.
 - Reception complicated by Dabney's political and social stances (Confederate sympathies) which have affected modern appraisal; nevertheless, his theological arguments remain referenced for defense of classical Calvinism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, sermon-friendly exposition of regeneration and effectual calling; valuable for teaching order of salvation and for theological students learning to argue exegetically and philosophically for Reformed soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity:** human inability to seek God because of pervasive sin; the necessary premise for divine regeneration.
- **Unconditional Election:** God's choosing not based on foreseen merits or faith.
- **Limited (Definite) Atonement:** Christ's atonement is intentionally efficacious for the elect.
- **Irresistible (Effectual) Grace:** the Spirit's internal call effectively brings the elect to faith.
- **Perseverance of the Saints:** final perseverance grounded in divine preservation.
- **Regeneration (New Birth):** a supernatural, moral renovation wrought by the Spirit that precedes and enables faith.
 - Dabney stresses it as a real change of nature, not merely a change in legal standing.
- **Effectual Calling:** the inward, efficacious summons by the Spirit that results in regeneration and faith.
 - Distinguished from general external proclamation.
- **Prevenient Grace (rejected):** Dabney rejects Arminian notions that prevenient grace restores ability prior to election.
- **Compatibilism:** philosophical account reconciling divine sovereignty and human responsibility - central to Dabney's defense of predestination and effectual calling.
- **External vs Internal Calling:** external = gospel proclamation; internal = Spirit's regenerating work.
- **Order of Salvation (Ordo Salutis):** Dabney emphasizes calling -> regeneration -> faith -> repentance -> justification.
- **Assurance:** pastoral corollary; assurance flows from signs of regeneration and divine promises.
- **Covenant Theology:** background frame-Dabney reads election and calling within federal (covenantal) categories.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed formulations of regeneration and effectual calling (teaching and confessional catechesis).
- As a **polemic** and model argument against Arminian/prevenient-grace positions.
- As an **exegetical model** for marshaling biblical passages (John, Romans, Ephesians) to defend the order of salvation.
