### TITLE
Are We Living in the Last Days? (sermons and online resources) - Sam Storms

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/charismatic-Reformed milieu (late 20th-21st century). Materials are sermon series and online expositions rather than a formal monograph; aimed at parish teaching and lay/theological engagement via church website and podcasts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The present age is the eschatological "last days" in an inaugurated sense: Christ's first coming has initiated the end-times age; Revelation 20 and the millennium should be read non-literally (amillennial/inaugurated eschatology), denying a future earthly thousand-year political reign of Christ prior to final resurrection and judgment.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical reading of Revelation 20 within the context of apocalyptic symbolism.
 - Case that the "binding of Satan" describes Christ's decisive victory inaugurated at the cross and active through the church, restricting Satan's ability to prevent gospel advance.
 - Interpretation of the "thousand years" as symbolic, not a chronology leading to two resurrections separated by a literal millennium.
 - Corroboration from Pauline eschatology (e.g., 1 Corinthians 15; the order of resurrection and parousia), showing continuity with New Testament teaching about a single general resurrection at Christ's return.
 - Practical application: living faithfully now in the already/not-yet tension - expect final consummation but resist specious signs-based prognostication.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutors: dispensational premillennialists (especially literalist readings of Rev 20), historic premillennial advocates.
 - Scriptural loci: Revelation 20, correlated with Matthew, 1 Corinthians 15, Romans 5-8, and Johannine themes.
 - Secondary reference points: classical amillennial interpreters (e.g., Augustine historically), contemporary Reformed and evangelical eschatologists.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (millennium, resurrection, judgment, parousia), Christology (victory of Christ), Satanology (binding and influence), ecclesiology (role of the church in the end-times), hermeneutics of apocalyptic literature.
- **Closing line:** Theologically, the work centers on an **amillennial, inaugurated-eschatology** reading of Revelation 20 that stresses Christ's present reign and victory while calling the church to faithful expectation rather than speculative futurism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong pastoral emphasis marrying Reformed soteriology with charismatic pneumatology: the Spirit's present power is the empirical sign of Satan's restriction and the kingdom's advance.
 - Pastoral repudiation of sensational end-times timetables; prioritizes ethical perseverance over date-setting or political interpretations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to dispensational literalism: insists the text is symbolic and should not be pressed into a chronological scaffold that separates the resurrection into two widely separated events.
 - Contrasts with historic premillennial readings by retaining the symbolic hermeneutic for Revelation and a single consummatory parousia.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes "binding of Satan" less as total impotence and more as a functional limitation oriented toward gospel advance - a calibrated description of present spiritual reality.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in charismatic-Reformed circles and among pastors seeking a pastoral antidote to popular dispensational eschatology.
 - Less influential in strictly dispensational constituencies; valued as a clear, pastoral amillennial exposition rather than a novel academic treatise.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear model for preaching Revelation in non-futurist key; useful for pastors teaching congregations how to live in the "last days" without fascination with speculative timelines.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Last days:** The entire era inaugurated by Christ's first coming; not only a final few years but the period between first and second comings.
- **Millennium:** The "thousand years" in Revelation 20 read symbolically as a bounded but non-literal representation of Christ's present reign.
- **Binding of Satan:** Christ's victory at the cross that limits Satan's ability to thwart gospel spread; not absolute annihilation but functional restraint.
- **First Resurrection:** Interpreted spiritually or as a category that refers to believers' new life and ultimate vindication tied to Christ's resurrection; not necessarily a separate, prior bodily resurrection for a partial elect.
- **Second Death:** Final, irrevocable condemnation at final judgment; reserved for those outside Christ after the final resurrection.
- **Parousia:** The single, climactic second coming that coincides with the resurrection of the dead and final judgment.
- **Already/not yet:** Framework for understanding inaugurated eschatology - kingdom present in power, consummation future.
- **Amillennialism:** Eschatological position that denies a literal earthly millennium; sees Revelation 20 as symbolic and fulfilled in the church-age tension.
- **Apocalyptic symbolism:** Hermeneutical stance emphasizing symbolic and theological meaning over chronometric readings.
- **Resurrection of the dead:** Final general resurrection at Christ's return; opposed to two widely separated resurrections as in some premillennial schemes.
- **Final Judgment:** Single definitive judicial act after the parousia and resurrection which concludes history.
- **Satanology (eschatological):** Study of Satan's role in end-times; here emphasized as defeated but active until final overthrow.
- **Ecclesial mission in eschatology:** The church's mission as the present means by which Christ's reign is manifested and Satan's rule is restricted.
- **Hermeneutical polemic:** The work functions as a pastoral exegetical rebuttal to literalist/futurist readings of Revelation 20.
- **Practical application:** Used in preaching to foster sober endurance, anti-sensationalism, and theologically grounded hope.

How this work is used:
- As a concise amillennial definition-source and popular exposition of Revelation 20.
- As a polemic resource against dispensational/futurist millennial schemata.
- As an exegetical model for reading apocalyptic symbolically in pastoral preaching.
