### TITLE
B.B. Warfield, "The Lord of Glory: The Designations of Our Lord in the New Testament" 
Context: late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology; conservative Reformed scholarship addressing New Testament Christological titles.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written within the Princeton Seminary milieu that defended orthodox confessions against rising historical-critical and liberal-religious readings of the Gospels.
 - Warfield writes as both exegete and polemicist: careful philology and robust doctrinal commitment to Christ's divinity and messianic role.
- **Central thesis**
 - The various New Testament designations of Jesus (Kyrios/Lord, Christ/Messiah, Son of God, Son of Man, Logos, etc.) are historically grounded, theologically coherent identifiers that together disclose the New Testament's high Christology and the continuity of Jesus' messianic consciousness with Israel's hopes.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of principal New Testament titles and their usage in different authors (Paul, the Synoptics, John, early Church).
 - Historical-linguistic analysis demonstrating continuity with Old Testament and Jewish conceptions (Septuagint usage of Kyrios, messianic expectations).
 - Exegetical defense that early Christian confessions attributing divine honor to Jesus derive from authentic apostolic testimony rather than later doctrinal development.
 - Polemic against reductionist readings which separate the "historical Jesus" from the "Christ of faith" by denying early high Christological titles.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with higher criticism and liberal scholars of his day (those who minimized early high Christology); converses with Septuagintal, patristic, and Pauline scholarship.
 - Draws on internal New Testament comparison (Paul vs. Synoptics vs. Johannine terminology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): identity, titles, two natures implied in designation.
 - **Revelation**: confessional hearing and apostolic testimony as vehicles of divine self-disclosure.
 - **Kingdom / Messianic expectation**: how designations relate to Jesus' proclamation and self-understanding.
 - **Trinity** (implicitly): appropriation of divine titles to the Son affirms intra-divine identity.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Warfield insists that the New Testament's designations for Jesus are not accidental epithets but theologically decisive confessions: they locate Jesus as Israel's promised Messiah and as the divine Lord who fulfills and consummates the covenantal hopes of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Combines rigorous historical-linguistic exegesis with confessional theological commitments; refuses a sharp separation between historical-critical method and doctrinal conclusion.
 - Insists on the early and authentic origin of high Christological titles as integral to apostolic witness.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal and form-critical tendencies that reduce titles to later ecclesial invention or purely functional descriptors (e.g., "Jesus as just teacher").
 - Corrects any account that isolates Jesus' ethical teaching from his self-asserted messianic Lordship.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses "designations" as a methodological category to analyze title-function: not merely names but acts of confession that shape community identity and theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly regarded in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a robust defense of New Testament Christology.
 - Served as a resource for later orthodox theologians reacting to mid-20th-century theological liberalism and for those reconstructing historic high Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to marry careful exegesis with doctrinal clarity; remains a concise, instructive primer on how New Testament titles function theologically.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kyrios (Lord)** - Warfield treats this as the decisive New Testament confession; a Septuagintal transfer of Yahweh-language to Jesus, signaling divine status and eschatological authority.
- **Christ / Messiah** - Political and cultic connotations; Warfield emphasizes continuity with Jewish expectations and the kingdom-fulfillment aspect of Jesus' identity.
- **Son of God** - Affirms unique filial relationship to the Father; used both in Jewish royal-messianic sense and in explicit claims to divine sonship.
- **Son of Man** - Ambiguous title; Warfield reads it as rooted in Danielic eschatological imagery as well as in Jesus' self-descriptiveness, bearing both suffering and vindication themes.
- **Logos** - Johannine philosophical and revelatory term; Warfield shows how it personalizes divine revelation without dissolving historical specificity.
- **Lord of Glory** - Phrase capturing the union of messianic kingship and divine majesty (cf. 1 Cor 2:8), central to Warfield's thesis.
- **Messianic Consciousness** - The awareness and self-understanding of Jesus as Messiah; Warfield argues it is authentic and formative for New Testament confession.
- **Confession / kerygma** - Designations function as early confessional claims (what the church proclaimed about Jesus), not later speculative theology.
- **High Christology** - The early and intrinsic attribution of divine honors and titles to Jesus; Warfield defends its historicity.
- **Historical witness vs. theological confession** - Warfield argues these are inseparable in the New Testament: titles are witness-claims rooted in historical events.
- **Septuagintal background** - Key for understanding lexical transfer (Kyrios) and how OT Yahwistic language is applied to Jesus.
- **Apostolic testimony / tradition** - Carrier of designations; Warfield emphasizes its reliability for grounding Christological claims.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for understanding New Testament titles in confessional theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against reductionist historical-critical accounts that deny early high Christology.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how lexical, textual, and theological evidence combine to sustain orthodox Christology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching on the continuity of revelation, messianic fulfillment, and the divine identity of Christ.
