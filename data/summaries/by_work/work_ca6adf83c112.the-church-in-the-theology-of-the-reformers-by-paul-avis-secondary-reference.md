### TITLE
The Church in the Theology of the Reformers - Paul Avis (with attention to Reformed confessional loci exemplified by the Three Forms of Unity)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th/early-21st-century historical-theological study surveying 16th-century Reformation ecclesiology across Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, and Radical contexts. Engages primary reformers (Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Bucer, Knox) and confessional formulations (e.g., the Three Forms of Unity) within the post-Tridentine polemical and ecumenical milieu.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Reformers reshaped the doctrine of the church by returning to Scripture and reconfiguring ministry, sacraments, and authority; Avis argues that their ecclesiologies are plural yet coherent around common principles (Word, sacraments, Christ as head), and these deserve careful historical and theological retrieval for contemporary ecumenical conversation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnostic chapter(s): how medieval (Roman Catholic) sacramental-institutional ecclesiology became the object of reform.
 - Case studies: distinct treatments by Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Bucer, and others-emphasizing their convergences and divergences on ministry, sacraments, discipline, and visible/invisible church.
 - Confessional reception: tracing how Reformed confessions (including the Three Forms of Unity) systematized these insights into doctrinal standards.
 - Constructive reflection: implications for modern ecclesiology and ecumenical rapprochement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, Martin Bucer, John Knox; patristic sources and medieval scholastic texts; confessional documents (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort - the Three Forms of Unity); Roman Catholic critiques and Radical Reformation alternatives.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, marks of the church), sacramentology (baptism, Eucharist and varieties of presence), ministry and ordination (priesthood of all believers vs ministerial office), authority and Word (sola scriptura; the Word as instrument), discipline, unity and catholicity, covenant theology as an interpretive frame in Reformed reception.
- **Closing line:** The Reformers recast the church as a Word- and sacrament-centered, covenantal community under Christ the sole head; Avis insists this reforming center-nuanced across traditions-remains a critical resource for both confessional fidelity and ecumenical engagement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses plurality within a shared Reformation core rather than a monolithic "Reformed ecclesiology."
 - Highlights the primacy of the proclaimed Word as the formative instrument of the church, with sacraments serving as confirmatory and covenantal signs.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contrasts sharply with medieval institutional/sacramental ontology (church as mediator of grace) and with Radical Reformation voluntarism (purely voluntary societies).
 - Reads confessional codifications (Three Forms of Unity) as constructive consolidations rather than mere repetition of a single Reformer.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and reclaims the functional role of the "marks" of the church (preaching of the Word, right administration of sacraments, church discipline) as diagnostic rather than ontological predicates.
 - Reframes debates about presence in the Lord's Supper along pastoral and ecclesial axes rather than solely metaphysical ones.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Anglican and ecumenical studies for balanced historical retrieval; cited in Reformed teaching as a clear synthesis of divergent Reformation positions and in dialogues about confessional identity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise, comparative framework for courses on Reformation ecclesiology; aids pastors and theologians in translating historic principles into contemporary ecclesial practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible church:** The community marked by Word and sacrament, accountable to discipline and ministry.
- **Invisible church:** Christ's elect known fully only to God; used to protect the doctrine of election and critique purely institutional claims.
- **Marks of the church:** Preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, exercise of discipline - normative diagnostic criteria.
- **Word as instrument (verbum efficax):** The preached Word functions instrumentally to create and sustain the church.
- **Word and sacraments:** Dual loci of God's ordinary means of grace; sacraments are covenantal signs that confirm the Word.
- **Eucharistic presence:** Spectrum from Lutheran sacramental union, through Calvin's "spiritual real presence," to Zwingli's memorialism - treated as ecclesiological as well as metaphysical disputes.
- **Priesthood of all believers:** Undermines sacerdotal mediation, reorients ministry as service within a communal calling while preserving ordained ministry where Reformers judged necessary.
- **Covenant:** Used especially in Reformed reception (Three Forms of Unity) to bind sacraments, promise, and ecclesial life into a theological framework.
- **Authority and sola scriptura:** Scripture as normative rule for church order and doctrine; confessions interpretive aids.
- **Church discipline:** Ecclesial practice for maintaining holiness and purity; tied to visible marks.
- **Confessional reception (Three Forms of Unity):** Shows how Reformed ecclesiology was systematized into concise catechetical and confessional statements.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a definition source: standard historical-theological summary of Reformation ecclesiology for courses and lectures.
 - As a polemic/clarification: employed in debates contrasting Roman Catholic, Anglican, Reformed, and Radical positions.
 - As an exegetical and confessional model: used when aligning contemporary church practice with historic Word-and-sacrament principles.
