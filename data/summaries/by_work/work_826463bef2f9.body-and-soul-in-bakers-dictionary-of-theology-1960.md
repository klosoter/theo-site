### TITLE
Body and Soul - Anthony Hoekema (Baker's Dictionary of Theology, 1960)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; short reference entry in Baker's Dictionary intended to summarize the theological anthropology debate for pastors and students. Hoekema speaks from Dutch Reformed commitments later developed more fully in his systematic works.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To locate the biblical and Reformed position on the relation of body and soul: rejecting Greek/Cartesian bifurcation while maintaining the soul's immateriality and personal survival prior to resurrection. Emphasis on the unity of the person and the theological significance of death and resurrection.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnostic: surveys historic dualist (Platonic/Cartesian) and reductionist/materialist options and shows their limitations for biblical faith.
 - Constructive: advances a **psychosomatic or holistic anthropology** - the human is one psychosomatic unit; "soul" and "spirit" language are functional or referential aspects rather than separate ontological substances.
 - Eschatological correction: personal persistence after death is affirmed, but immortality is not natural to the human apart from God; resurrection is the decisive hope and terminus for bodily and personal continuity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Plato and classical Greek dualism; Augustine and medieval scholastics; Descartes and modern substance dualism; contemporary materialists; scriptural witnesses (Old and New Testament anthropology and eschatology); Reformed interpreters (implicit engagement with Calvinic perspectives).
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropological locus (nature of human person), death and intermediate state, resurrection and eschatology, soteriology implications (union with Christ and immortality as gift).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The Bible calls us to a holistic, psychosomatic understanding of persons that preserves both the reality of an immaterial, surviving aspect of the person and the centrality of bodily resurrection as the consummation of human destiny.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on **psychosomatic unity**: soul/ spirit are not independent subsystems but dimensions or ways of speaking about the one person.
 - Clarifies that immortality is a **gift** rather than an intrinsic property automatically possessed by every human soul.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against classical Platonic and Cartesian dualism that isolates the soul from bodily identity.
 - Counters materialist accounts that dissolve personal continuity at death without accounting for biblical testimony to conscious intermediate existence and final resurrection.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Functional reading of "soul" and "spirit" (psychic/relational categories) rather than simple two-part ontological schemata.
 - Emphasis on theological primacy of resurrection in assessing the status of body and soul.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Entry served as a concise, accessible Reformed corrective in mid-century dictionaries and pastoral resources.
 - Prefigures and harmonizes with Hoekema's later fuller treatments in his systematic and pastoral writings; used by subsequent Reformed teachers to nuance debates between dualism and materialism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful compact statement for seminarians: integrates biblical exegesis, historical theology, and systematic concerns.
 - Functions as a pedagogical pivot to reframe anthropological questions around resurrection and soteriological promises rather than metaphysical speculation alone.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity:** The human being as an integrated body-soul whole; primary anthropological model in Hoekema's entry.
- **Soul (psyche/psuche):** Language in Scripture used for life/personhood; treated functionally rather than strictly as a separable substance.
- **Spirit (pneuma):** Often overlapping with "soul"; refers to relational, religious, or orienting capacity within the one person.
- **Substance dualism:** Classical metaphysical thesis (Descartes/Platonism) critiqued for divorcing personhood from bodily identity.
- **Materialism / reductionism:** Modern rival view that reduces personhood to physical processes; rejected as inadequate doctrinally and biblically.
- **Natural immortality:** The notion that the soul is intrinsically immortal; Hoekema denies this as theologically unsustainable.
- **Conditional / God-given immortality:** Immortality understood as a gift of God realized in eschatological consummation (resurrection).
- **Intermediate state:** Conscious existence of the person between death and resurrection; affirmed, but subservient to resurrection hope.
- **Bodily resurrection:** The eschatological fulfillment and vindication of personal identity; the decisive doctrine for understanding body-soul relation.
- **Death:** Separation in experience but not final negation of personhood; theological and soteriological significance highlighted.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Framing category for human dignity and unity; used to resist reductionist or dualist diminutions.
- **Eschatology:** The hermeneutical key for correct anthropology according to Hoekema.
- **Personal persistence / identity:** Affirmed across death and resurrection, with continuity grounded in God's purposes rather than autonomous soul-substance.
- **Functional language:** Approach to biblical "soul" and "spirit" terms that prioritizes biblical usage over later metaphysical schemata.

- **How this entry is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for psychosomatic anthropology in Reformed curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against classical dualism and modern reductionism in pastoral and apologetic contexts.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** that reorients discussions of human nature around eschatology and the resurrection, rather than metaphysical speculation alone.
