### TITLE
"The Church" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in The New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; Westminster Seminary milieu; contribution to a broad, ecumenical reference work used by pastors and scholars.
 - Written against trends of ecclesial privatization, theological liberalism, and ecclesiological confusion in evangelicalism.

- **Central thesis**
 - The church is to be understood primarily as the covenantal, instituted, visible assembly of Christ's people, structured and governed according to biblical warrant and historic Reformed confession, with the Word, sacraments, and discipline as its constitutive marks and means of grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical-theological foundation: Christ as Head of the church; covenant continuity (OT to NT) grounds identity and practice.
 - Ecclesial marks and means: authoritative preaching (ministerial Word), baptism and the Lord's Supper as covenant signs/seals, and the exercise of discipline.
 - Ministry and offices: ordination and the eldership (pastoral/ruling elders) provide Christ-warranted leadership; plurality of elders and representative courts (session, presbytery, synod/general assembly) are defended.
 - Polity and discipline: Presbyterian polity is presented as the faithful biblical expression, with discipline as necessary to preserve purity and order.
 - Confessional and pastoral implications: link to Westminster and Reformed confessions; practical prescriptions for church government and pastoral oversight.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scriptural exegesis (New Testament ecclesiology); key Reformation and post-Reformation sources (Calvin, Westminster divines); engagement with Roman Catholic, Lutheran, congregationalist, and modern evangelical positions on church and ministry.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, Christology (Headship and union), ecclesiology (nature, marks, mission), sacraments, ministry and ordination, church government (Presbyterian polity), and discipline.

- **Closing line**
 - The church is the covenant community instituted and sustained by Christ through the ministerial Word, sacraments, and ordered eldership-distinctively Reformed in theology and Presbyterian in government, instituted to preserve covenantal fidelity and corporate holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong covenantal framing: continuity between Israel and the church undergirds ecclesial identity and sacramental practice.
 - Stress on the **ministerial Word** as servant-form of revelation: preaching is not merely exhortation but the authoritative means of grace.
 - Discipline given equal standing with preaching and sacraments as a mark of the true church.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against evangelical individualism and "consumer" models of the church.
 - Critique of Erastianism (state or secular control over church life) and of congregationalist reductions that downplay ordered eldership and broader accountability.
 - Balance between visible and invisible church: avoids a purely spiritualized "invisible only" conception but resists identification of the visible church simply with all who claim Christian identity.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Integration of covenant theology with concrete polity: uses covenant categories to justify polity (offices, courts, sacraments) rather than treating polity as merely pragmatic.
 - Emphasis on the functional reality of offices as means through which Christ exercises headship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used within conservative Reformed and Presbyterian teaching contexts; valued for clarity and confessional fidelity.
 - Cited in debates over ordination, discipline, and the public role of the church within Reformed denominations.

- **Enduring value**
 - A concise, theologically robust template connecting doctrine (Christ, covenant) to practice (preaching, sacraments, eldership, discipline) useful for pastors, seminarians, and ecclesial polity debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Church** - covenant community instituted by Christ; visible assembly ordered by means of Word and sacraments.
- **Visible / Invisible Church** - distinction affirmed: visible church is the concrete covenant community with marks; invisible church is the elect known only to God.

- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper)** - signs and seals of the covenant; means of grace tied to covenant membership and nourishment.
- **Eldership / Office** - plurality of elders (teaching and ruling); ordination as constitutive for lawful ministry.
 - Teaching elders (ministers) and ruling elders distinguished functionally but share in oversight.
- **Presbyterian polity** - session, presbytery, synod/general assembly; representative, ascending courts for oversight and discipline.
- **Discipline** - essential mark of the church; for purity, reconciliation, and correction; exercised by courts.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed ecclesiology in teaching and confessional contexts.
 - As a **polemic** against evangelical minimalism, congregationalist reductions, and Erastian arrangements.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for linking New Testament texts on church, ministry, and discipline to Presbyterian polity and confessional practice.
