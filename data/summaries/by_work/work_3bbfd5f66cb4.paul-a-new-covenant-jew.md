### TITLE
Paul, a New Covenant Jew - Brant Pitre (Baker Academic, 2016). 
Brief: a sustained argument that Paul must be read as a faithful, covenantal Jew whose theology is best explained by Second Temple Jewish categories - especially the inauguration of a **new covenant** in Christ.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2016 amid continued debates sparked by the New Perspective(s) on Paul (E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright).
 - Author: Brant Pitre, a Catholic New Testament scholar, writing for both academic and informed evangelical/Catholic audiences; draws widely on Second Temple literature, rabbinic texts, and Jewish interpretive habits.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul does not abandon Judaism; rather, he interprets Israel's covenantal institutions (Torah, circumcision, temple, priesthood, Passover) as fulfilled and transformed in Christ, inaugurating a **new covenant** that reconstitutes God's people.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Intro: critique of Hellenizing readings of Paul and defense of Jewish-context reading.
 - Exegetical core:
 - Re-reads key Pauline loci (Romans, Galatians, 1 Corinthians, Philippians) through covenantal and temple/ritual categories.
 - Argues for baptism as replacement for circumcision; Lord's Supper as new covenant Passover meal; Christ as high priest and true temple/altar.
 - Interprets justification and righteousness as covenantal status (membership) rather than merely forensic/legal declaration.
 - Comparative apparatus:
 - Uses Qumran, Philo, Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, rabbinic parallels to illumine Paul's idiom.
 - Synthesis: Paul's mission to Gentiles is not "anti-Jewish" but an expansion/reconstitution of covenant people centered on Jesus.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Contemporary scholars: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright (New Perspective interlocutors), plus critics from traditional Lutheran/forensic readings.
 - Ancient sources: Qumran sectarian texts, Second Temple literature, rabbinic traditions, Old Testament typology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (new covenant), Christology (high-priestly and sacrificial imagery), soteriology (justification, atonement), ecclesiology (people of God: Israel and Gentiles), sacramental signs (baptism, Eucharist), Torah and law.
- **Closing line**
 - Paul's theology is best understood as a faithful Jewish reinterpretation of Israel's covenantal story: in Christ God establishes a **new covenant** that fulfills and transforms Torah-bound Israel into a renewed people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Labels Paul explicitly a **"new covenant Jew"** - stressing continuity with Israel rather than rupture.
 - Strong recovery of temple/priests/sacrifice and Passover typology as central to Pauline thought.
 - Treats baptism and Eucharist as covenantal signs supplanting circumcision and Passover, respectively.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that portray Paul as abandoning Judaism or as primarily Hellenistic in theology.
 - Nuances but does not entirely adopt all formulations of the New Perspective; gives greater weight to sacramental and cultic language than some NP proponents.
 - Challenges strictly forensic accounts of justification by reinterpreting righteousness/justification as covenantal status (while not wholly denying forensic language).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-centers the phrase **"new covenant"** as the organizing hermeneutical key for Pauline theology.
 - Emphasizes "covenantal reconstitution" instead of merely "inclusion of Gentiles" or "law/works controversy."
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read across evangelical and Catholic circles for accessible synthesis of Jewish background and Pauline exegesis.
 - Influential in classrooms and preaching for rethinking sacramental and covenantal dimensions of Paul.
 - Critiques note potential overemphasis on continuity at expense of Paul's polemical anti-works rhetoric in some passages.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable corrective to anti-Jewish or overly Hellenizing readings of Paul; strong resource for courses on Paul, covenant theology, and Jewish-Christian relations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Covenant** - central interpretive key: Christ inaugurates the covenant promised in Jeremiah; Paul reads his entire theology through this lens.
- **Covenant membership / status** - justification and righteousness indicate belonging to God's covenant people.
- **Torah** - reinterpreted not abolished; functions transformed under the new covenant (identity marker vs. salvific instrument).
 - Contrast: Torah as corporate/national identity vs. Torah as universal path to salvation.
- **Circumcision / Baptism** - baptism replaces circumcision as the boundary sign of covenant membership in Christ.
- **Passover / Eucharist** - Last Supper is read as a new covenant Passover meal; sacrificial and memorial dimensions emphasized.
- **Temple / Priesthood / Sacrifice** - Christ as true temple and high priest; death as sacrificial act that fulfills cultic categories.
- **Justification / Righteousness (dikaiosyne)** - primarily covenantal standing; legal/forensic language is retained but reframed within membership.
- **Israel / Gentiles** - Paul's mission expands Israel's covenant to include nations; not erasure but reconstitution of peoplehood.
- **Typology (Moses/Christ, Adam/Christ)** - Paul's use of Israel's history as pattern fulfilled in Christ.
- **Second Temple Judaism** - the cultural matrix that explains Paul's vocabulary and concerns.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NP)** - interlocutor: Pitre aligns with many NP insights while insisting on sacramental/cultic emphases.
- **Atonement imagery** - sacrificial, temple, and covenantal motifs integrated into Paul's soteriology.
- **Covenantal nomism** - background category: Pitre shows Paul adopts and revises covenantal expectation rather than rejecting it.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for reading Paul through the new covenant paradigm in courses on Pauline theology and covenant theology.
- As a **polemic** against anti-Jewish or Hellenistic reconstructions of Paul and against narrowly forensic readings of justification.
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating Second Temple texts into Pauline exegesis (useful for biblical-theology seminars).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and teaching that seeks to recover sacramental, communal, and covenantal dimensions of Paul.
