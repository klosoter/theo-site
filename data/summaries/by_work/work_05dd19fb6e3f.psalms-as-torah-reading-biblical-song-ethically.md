### TITLE
Psalms as Torah: Reading Biblical Song Ethically - Gordon J. Wenham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Anglican Old Testament scholarship. Wenham writes from a conservative, historically informed background attentive to canonical and ethical readings of Scripture in response to purely form-critical or sociological models.
- **Central thesis:** The Psalter functions as a form of Torah - not legal code but formative instruction - so that reading the Psalms ethically reveals their role in shaping Israel's (and the church's) moral imagination and conduct toward the promised eschatological order (cf. New Heavens and New Earth).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes terminological claim: "Torah" as instructive orientation, not confined to Pentateuchal legislation.
 - Demonstrates through textual examples how psalms give moral teaching: patterns of trust, justice, mercy, covenant fidelity, and communal identity.
 - Argues for an integrated liturgy-ethic: psalmody forms dispositions that enable concrete ethical action.
 - Locates psalmic instruction within covenantal and eschatological horizons, connecting present obedience to the hope of renewal (New Heavens and New Earth).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Engages contemporary Psalms scholarship: contrasts with Walter Brueggemann's socio-rhetorical/protest focus and with form-critical accounts that isolate genres.
 - Dialogues with canonical critics (e.g., Brevard Childs) and with wisdom-stream interpreters (e.g., Gerstenberger, D. Kidner).
 - Draws on Hebrew text, canonical shape of Psalter, and ancient Near Eastern/background where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated:**
 - **Revelation:** Psalms as revelatory speech that instructs the people.
 - **Covenant:** Formation of communal identity and obligations through song.
 - **Ethics:** Moral instruction rooted in worship and theology (imitation of Yahweh, justice, mercy).
 - **Eschatology:** The Psalter points forward to renewed creation - optimism grounded in divine kingship (link to New Heavens and New Earth).
 - (Secondary: minimal explicit Christology; framework usable for Christotelic readings.)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The Psalter functions as formative Torah: liturgical song that discloses God, forms covenantal character, and orients communal ethics toward the divine promise of renewed creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Redefines "Torah" broadly to include normative, pedagogical literature beyond Pentateuchal law - emphasizing formative power rather than legal codification.
 - Stresses the **liturgical means** by which ethical dispositions are inculcated (singing, praying, lamenting as moral formation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Counters Brueggemannian readings that over-emphasize social protest by restoring a sustained ethical and covenantal coherence in the Psalter.
 - Challenges narrow form-critical separations that detach psalmic content from communal instruction and canonical function.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The phrase and methodological move "Psalms as Torah" - treating a poetic corpus as normative pedagogical instruction.
 - Emphasis on "psalm-formed character" as a theological category linking worship practice to moral behavior.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in conservative and pastoral circles for bridging worship and ethics; cited in biblical-theological treatments of the Psalms.
 - Provoked dialogue with critical scholars who caution against over-systematizing a heterogeneous collection.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise model for reading the Psalter as ethically instructive and canonically authoritative.
 - Useful for preaching, liturgical theology, and courses on biblical ethics and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Torah (redefined):** Instruction/pedagogy; not limited to Mosaic law but including formative texts like Psalms.
- **Formation / Moral formation:** Process by which liturgy and song shape dispositions and actions.
- **Liturgy-ethic link:** The claim that worship practices (singing/praying) are primary vehicles of ethics.
- **Covenant fidelity:** The Psalter's repeated call to loyalty to Yahweh as ethical imperative.
- **Imitatio Dei (imitation of God):** Psalms teach ethical behavior by modeling trust, justice, mercy of God.
- **Communal identity:** How psalmody constructs corporate memory and obligations.
- **Canonical reading:** Interpreting Psalms in the context of the whole Scripture and its theological aims.

- **Trust / Faith (emunah):** Central ethical disposition cultivated across genres (psalms of trust).
- **Lament and Praise as moral pedagogy:** Emotional genres that cultivate endurance, repentance, and gratitude.
- **Wisdom-psalm interplay:** Interaction between wisdom motifs and psalmic instruction for right living.
- **Divine kingship:** Theological motif linking ethical order and future restoration.
- **Canonical pastoral use:** Psalms used to teach congregations moral patterns fitting eschatological hope.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for broadening "Torah" to include formative non-legislative Scripture.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Psalms ethically and liturgically rather than solely sociologically.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in linking worship practices to covenantal ethics and eschatological hope (useful in homiletics, liturgics, and biblical theology).
