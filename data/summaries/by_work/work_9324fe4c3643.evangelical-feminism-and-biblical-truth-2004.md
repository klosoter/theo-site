### TITLE
**Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth (2004) - Wayne Grudem**

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / Publication Context**
 - Published 2004 in the milieu of late 20th-early 21st century evangelical debates over gender roles. Builds on and responds to the work of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW) and rising evangelical egalitarian scholarship.
 - Wayne Grudem: Reformed, conservative evangelical systematic theologian; defender of biblical inerrancy and complementarianism.

- **Central Thesis / Doctrinal Problem**
 - Evangelical feminism (egalitarianism) departs from biblical teaching; the Bible teaches **distinct but complementary roles** for men and women in marriage and church, grounded in creation order and the Trinity.
 - Part of the book advances the controversial thesis that the Son is eternally functionally subordinate to the Father (Eternal Functional Subordination, EFS) without compromising ontological equality.

- **Core Argument / Structure**
 - Survey of egalitarian claims and methods; critique of their exegetical and hermeneutical moves.
 - Exegetical defense of key texts: Genesis creation order, 1 Timothy 2, 1 Corinthians 11, Ephesians 5, pastoral qualifications for eldership.
 - Theological grounding: creedal affirmations, doctrine of creation, fall, redemption; argument that role differentiation is not a result of sin but rooted in created order.
 - Trinitarian argument: distinguishes **ontological equality** from **relational/functional ordering**; argues biblical data (e.g., Son sent by Father, Son submits) supports EFS as coherent and theologically orthodox.
 - Practical implications for marriage, church polity (male eldership), and ministry roles.

- **Figures, Sources, Interlocutors**
 - Targets contemporary egalitarian authors and proponents within evangelicalism (broadly defined).
 - Engages historical theologians and creedal texts to defend orthodoxy.
 - Direct dialogue with trinitarian critics of EFS (e.g., Kevin Giles) and conversation with those who have defended relational subordination (e.g., Bruce Ware has been an ally in this debate).

- **Doctrines Treated**
 - Scripture (inerrancy, hermeneutics), Creation, Fall, Redemption, Ecclesiology (leadership/eldership), Marriage, and Trinity (especially intra-Trinitarian relations).

- **Closing Line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Grudem's theological center: the Bible teaches **complementary role distinctions** between men and women grounded in creation and reflected in the Trinity (functional ordering), and these distinctions should govern marriage and church leadership.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic, multi-disciplinary defense combining philological exegesis, historical theology, and systematic argumentation.
 - Forthright defense of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** as both biblical and theologically coherent.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Rejects egalitarian hermeneutics that treat role distinctions as culturally contingent or solely post-Fall accommodations.
 - Argues against readings that equate submission only with the Fall or that collapse role distinctions into ontological inequality.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operational distinction drawn between **ontological equality** (essence, being) and **functional subordination** (role, authority), repeatedly applied to the Trinity and human relations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among conservative evangelicals and complementarian institutions (seminaries, denominations, CBMW).
 - Provoked significant controversy among theologians concerned about Trinitarian orthodoxy; intensified scholarly debates over EFS, spawning sustained responses and critiques.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a comprehensive, accessible compendium of the complementarian case; valuable as a primary articulator of modern complementarianism and as a stimulus for rigorous engagement with EFS and its implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Complementarianism** - doctrine that men and women are equal in worth but have distinct, complementary roles in church and home.
- **Evangelical Feminism / Egalitarianism** - the position Grudem critiques: role equality in leadership and marriage grounded in interpretive moves he deems unbiblical.
- **Headship (kephale)** - Grudem's interpretation: leadership/authority role of man in marriage and church; tied to creation order.
- **Submission (hypotasso)** - seen as role obedience within ordered relationships (marriage, and intra-Trinitarian relations when applied analogically).
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - claim that the Son is eternally submissive in role to the Father while ontologically equal; central and controversial move in the work.
 - Related: **Ontological equality** (essence/personhood parity) vs **relational/functional ordering** (authority/submission).
- **Inerrancy / Sufficiency of Scripture** - foundational hermeneutical commitments that justify grammatical-historical readings and reject cultural relativization.
- **Creation order** - appeal to Genesis 1-2 as normative ground for role distinctions.
- **Hermeneutic of role differentiation** - method for reading New Testament household and church instructions as prescriptive, not merely cultural.
- **Male eldership / pastoral qualifications** - practical outworking: pastors/elders to be male based on pastoral texts and Grudem's reading.
- **Trinitarian orthodoxy** - invoked to defend EFS as compatible with the doctrine of the Trinity; primary flashpoint for critics.
- **Functional subordination vs. ontological subordination** - technical distinction Grudem insists upon to avoid heresy charge.
- **Sent/mission language in the Trinity** - used to support role distinctions within eternal Trinitarian relations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** and systematic articulation of contemporary conservative complementarianism.
 - As a **polemic** against evangelical egalitarian arguments and as a model for conservative hermeneutics.
 - As an **exegetical model** for key passages (1 Tim 2; 1 Cor 11; Eph 5) and as a **conceptual pivot** in debates over EFS and intra‑Trinitarian relations.
