### TITLE
Friedrich Schleiermacher, The Christian Faith - background influence on Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestant theology (Romanticism and post-Enlightenment). Major works: Religionsphilosophische Schriften (1799) and Der christliche Glaube (The Christian Faith, 1821/22).
 - Intellectual interlocutors: Kantian epistemology, Fichtean subjectivity, Hegelian dialectic; response to Enlightenment critique of religion and to pietism/orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must ground doctrine in the empirical fact of religious life: the **"feeling of absolute dependence"** (Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit) is the immediate datum; doctrinal systems should be descriptions and articulations of this religious self-consciousness rather than metaphysical proofs.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Twofold method: an empirical (descriptive) theology of religion and an ontological/dogmatic articulation that expresses the structure of religious consciousness.
 - Major moves:
 - Define religion as a distinct mode of human awareness - immediate feeling rather than speculative cognition.
 - Show how Christian doctrine (God, Christ, Spirit, redemption, church, sacraments) can be reformulated as expressions of religious consciousness and its object (God).
 - Locate Christ as the paradigmatic instance of perfect religious consciousness - the divine-human unity realized in religious feeling.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Kant (limits of reason), Romantic thinkers (emphasis on feeling), contemporary critics of religious belief; later read and critiqued by Albrecht Ritschl, who reacted against Schleiermacher's subjectivism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as religious self-manifestation), God (as object of religious feeling), Christology (Christ as perfect religious consciousness), Holy Spirit, atonement (reinterpreted in experiential terms), ecclesiology and sacraments, ethics implicit in religious life.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher relocates the locus of theology from metaphysical speculation to the **inner, lived fact of religious feeling**, making doctrine an articulation of the believer's immediate relation to God - a move that provoked Ritschl to reassert objective, communal, ethical foundations for Christian faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The primacy of **religious feeling** (not propositional assent) as the ground of theology.
 - Theology as a descriptive-scientific enterprise about religious consciousness, avoiding metaphysical proofs.
 - Christology presented as the exemplar of perfected religious self-consciousness rather than primarily a metaphysical incarnation schema.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against Enlightenment rationalism: refuses purely evidential proofs for God, insisting on immediacy of religious experience.
 - Against orthodox metaphysical theology: strips speculative categories, recasting doctrines as expressions of inward experience.
 - Provoked Ritschlian reaction: Ritschl critiqued Schleiermacher's subjectivism and reasserted **historical, communal, and ethical** content as normative for doctrine.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **Gefühl** (feeling) and **religious self-consciousness** as theological primitives.
 - Methodological distinction between empirical description of religion and normative dogmatic articulation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central for 19th-century liberal theology and the study of religion; influenced Ritschl, Tillich, Bultmann, and later liberal/modernist trajectories.
 - Orthodox and confessional traditions often rejected Schleiermacher's subjectivism; Ritschl reworked some of his method into more objective ethical categories.
- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological template for grounding theology in human experience; useful corrective to abstract metaphysics.
 - Provokes sustained debate on grounding revelation, doctrine, and the relation between individual piety and communal vocation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence (Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit)** - immediate religious datum; center of Schleiermacher's epistemology.
- **Religious self-consciousness** - the reflective awareness that theology must describe and articulate.
- **Religion as immediate experience** - religion is not ideology or ethics first but a lived relation to the divine.
- **Theological method: empirical → dogmatic** - describe religious life, then systematize its content into doctrine.
- **Christ as perfect religious consciousness** - Christ's significance is exemplarily experiential; revelation is incarnate in human religious awareness.
- **Revelation as self-manifestation** - revelation is not propositional information from outside but God's self-expression apprehended in feeling.
- **Atonement reinterpreted** - emphasis on reconciliation as restoration of religious life rather than forensic substitution.
- **Church and sacraments** - institutional expressions that cultivate and articulate religious self-consciousness.
- **Subjectivism vs. objectivity** - Schleiermacher's emphasis on subjectivity prompted Ritschl's insistence on historical-objective revelation and the ethical kingdom.
- **Vocation / dominion / culture mandate (contextual use)** - Schleiermacher's inward focus tended to privatize vocation; Ritschl used Schleiermacher as a foil to recover vocation as **communal ethical service** and the church's public role in culture and dominion.
- **Use in loci**
 - Definition source: citation for **religion as experiential ground** of theology.
 - Polemic: target for Ritschlian and confessional critiques of theological subjectivism.
 - Exegetical model: template for re-reading Christology and ecclesiology in experiential terms.
 - Conceptual pivot: marks the fault-line between individualist pietistic inwardness and Ritschlian communal-ethical orientations for vocation, dominion, and cultural mandate.
