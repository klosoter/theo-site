### TITLE
Francis Turretin - The Doctrine of the Church (selection presented in John H. Leith, ed.), read as a representative statement of Reformed scholastic ecclesiology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th / early 18th century Reformed scholasticism; Protestant orthodoxy reacting to Roman Catholic claims, Arminianism, Amyraldian variants, and sectarian fragmentation.
 - The material appears in Leith's edited volume as a secondary source exposing classic Reformed formulations for modern readers and students.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church is Christ's instituted, holy society distinguished as both **visible** and **invisible**, preserved and recognized by objective marks (Word, sacraments, discipline), governed by divinely-appointed offices, and rightly opposed to Romanist sacramentalism and ecclesiastical absolutism.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural and confessional proofs for the church's nature and origin (Christ as alone Head, apostles as foundation).
 - Distinction and relation between the visible and invisible church; criteria for the true church situated in the *marks*.
 - Exposition of ministry: offices, vocation, and authority of preaching and keys.
 - Sacramental theology: sacraments as **signs and seals**, not ex opere operato; baptism (including infant baptism) and the Lord's Supper (real spiritual feeding).
 - Church discipline and excommunication as necessary for purity and the common good; relation to civil magistrate and the two-kingdom ordering.
 - Polemical refutation of Roman Catholic claims (papal supremacy, sacramental regeneration) and irregular sectarian positions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Roman Catholic theologians (e.g., Bellarmine-type positions), Arminians, Amyraldians, sectarians denying institutional marks.
 - Sources: Scripture, early church practice, Reformed confessions (implicit appeal to Geneva/Heidelberg/Westminster type formulations), Calvin and Reformed scholastic predecessors.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology, polity, ministry and ordination, sacraments, covenantal implications for church membership (incl. infant baptism), discipline, church-state relations, unity/catholicity.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin sets the Reformed center of gravity: the church is Christ's instituted visible assembly, defined by Word and sacrament under ordered ministry and discipline, safeguarded by confessional and scriptural marks against both Romanist excess and sectarian voluntarism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precision in the visible/invisible distinction coupled with objective, testable *marks* - avoids radical separation of the "true" church into purely subjective membership.
 - Careful scholastic method: syllogistic demonstration from Scripture and reason, with casuistic attention to pastoral applications (e.g., excommunication).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic sacramentalism and hierarchical absolutism by denying ex opere operato efficacy and papal infallibility.
 - Counters sectarian and pietistic tendencies that dissolve institutional structures by affirming office, discipline, and public sacraments.
 - Opposes Amyraldian or Arminian dilution where ecclesial theology intersects soteriology (i.e., maintains covenantal coherence).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces and refines the Reformed use of *marks* as ecclesiological criteria - developed with scholastic clarity that aided later confessional formulations.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely authoritative within Reformed scholastic and confessional circles (Swiss, Dutch, some English-speaking Reformed academies).
 - Used by Princeton and conservative Reformed traditions as a touchstone for classical orthodoxy; cited in modern recoveries of covenantal and confessional ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - A model of careful, confessional ecclesiology that links sacramental theology, ministry, and discipline; useful as corrective to both sacramental inflation and ecclesial minimalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible church** - the outward, organized assembly with ministry, sacraments, and discipline; the sphere of ecclesial administration and identification.
- **Invisible church** - the company of the elect known perfectly only to God; the ground of ultimate unity and salvation.
 - Relation: visible contains both true and false members; invisible guarantees spiritual reality.
- **Marks of the true church** - preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and exercise of church discipline; the criteria for recognizing a true church.
- **Keys** - the power to declare forgiveness and exclusion (binding/loosing) exercised in preaching and discipline.
- **Excommunication** - authoritative exclusion for the preservation of purity and the offender's repentance; remedial and disciplinary, not salvific in itself.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals** - outward signs that signify and seal covenant promises; efficacy tied to Christ and the Spirit, not to ritual alone.
- **Baptism (including infant baptism)** - covenant sign applied to children of believers; grounds in continuity of covenant promises and household inclusion.
- **Lord's Supper** - spiritual feeding on Christ by faith; rejects corporal presence yet affirms real spiritual communion with Christ.
- **Ministry / Offices** - divinely instituted roles (pastors/elders/deacons) for proclamation, pastoral oversight, and discipline; ordination confers public authority.
- **Covenant** - the theological matrix for church membership, sacraments, and generational faithfulness.
- **Church-state relations** - two realms: spiritual jurisdiction of the church and civil magistrate's role in external order and support, with limits to magistral interference in ecclesiastical doctrine.
- **Unity / Catholicity** - true catholicity defined by apostolic faith and marks rather than institutional universality or papal claim.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed positions on visible/invisible church, marks, and sacraments.
- As a **polemic resource** against Roman Catholic sacramentalism and sectarian ecclesial minimalism.
- As an **exegetical and confessional model** for reading texts bearing on ministry, baptism, and the Lord's Supper, and for teaching ordered church life.
