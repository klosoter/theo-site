### TITLE
"The Sacrifice of Christ and the Reprobation of God" (1892) - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th-century Dutch Reformed theological milieu; Bavinck writing as part of a revival and systematization of Reformed theology concurrent with (and sometimes contrasted to) Kuyperian Neo-Calvinism.
 - Reaction to contemporary controversies over atonement extent, the justice of God, and the coherence of election/reprobation with divine love.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Bavinck defends a covenantal, federal view in which **Christ's sacrifice is efficacious for the elect** as established in the eternal pactum salutis; **reprobation is derivative** and compatible with divine justice and love.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of the biblical data on sacrifice, atonement, and divine decree; insistence on Christ's representative, federal headship.
 - Presentation of the pactum salutis (covenant of redemption) as the theological locus tying election to Christ's work.
 - Analysis of reprobation: not an independent, arbitrary decree but a correlated ordering that manifests God's justice given his choice of election.
 - Polemic against formulations that either universalize the atonement apart from covenantal mediation or that make reprobation chargeable to arbitrary divine malice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis (e.g., Pauline and Johannine texts on atonement and election).
 - Engagement with Reformed tradition (Calvin, the Synodical scholastics) and contemporary opponents: Arminianism, Amyraldian/Hypothetical Universalism, and hyper-Calvinist caricatures.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (pactum salutis), Christology (federal headship; active/passive obedience), soteriology (penal substitution, limited atonement), divine decree (election/reprobation), divine attributes (justice, love).
- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers the atonement within the eternal covenant: Christ, as covenant head, secures the elect by a real, penal sacrifice; reprobation is a just, derivative ordering in the divine decree that does not diminish the moral goodness of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong integration of **pactum salutis** as the framework making sense of atonement and reprobation together - not treating atonement and predestination as separate doctrinal islands.
 - Balanced insistence on Christ's **representative/personally vicarious** role: his sacrifice is specifically efficacious because he acts as covenant head for the elect.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects **Amyraldian** and other universalizing tendencies by arguing the atonement's effectiveness is governed by the covenantal intention of God rather than a mere universal provision.
 - Counters **hyper-Calvinist** misreadings that make reprobation morally problematic by clarifying its derivative status and grounding in divine justice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic sharpening of the pactum salutis language in relation to penal substitution - treating the pact as the determinative context for the scope and intent of the sacrifice.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in late-19th/20th-century Reformed circles as a concise statement tying covenant theology to classical doctrines of atonement and predestination.
 - Frequently cited by later Reformed dogmaticians and confessionalists seeking a temperate, covenantally framed defense of particular redemption and divine justice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear, teachable model for relating Christology and soteriology via covenantal structure; valuable for pastors and scholars confronting modern critiques of predestination or atonement extent.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption)**
 - Eternal agreement within the Trinity whereby the Father appoints the Son to secure redemption and the Son undertakes representative obedience and sacrifice.
- **Christ as Covenant Head**
 - Christ acts as federal representative; his obedience (active) and suffering (passive) are imputed to the elect.
- **Sacrifice of Christ**
 - Penal, propitiatory, and effective - not merely exemplary or hypothetical; its efficacy is determined by the pactum salutis.
- **Reprobation**
 - A derivative, negative ordering in the divine decree: the just confirmation of non-election, consistent with God's holiness and righteousness.
- **Election**
 - Unilateral divine choice grounded in God's sovereign counsel; the positive correlate to Christ's salvific work in the pactum.
- **Penal Substitution**
 - Central model of atonement emphasized; Christ receives the curse and satisfies divine justice on behalf of the elect.
- **Particular Redemption / Limited Atonement**
 - The view that Christ's sacrifice secures the salvation of the elect specifically, articulated within covenantal commitments.
- **Active and Passive Obedience**
 - Active: Christ's life of perfect law-fulfillment; Passive: his suffering and death. Both are essential and covenantally appointed.
- **Divine Decree**
 - Single, coherent counsel of God that orders election and reprobation for his purposes of justice and mercy.
- **Imputation**
 - The forensic transfer of guilt to Christ and righteousness to believers by virtue of covenantal representation.
- **Justice and Love (Divine Attributes)**
 - Held in tension but harmonized in Bavinck: God's justice is satisfied in Christ; God's love is displayed in election.
- **Hypothetical Universalism (Amyraldianism)**
 - Rejected or corrected: Bavinck insists such models weaken the covenantal intentionality that secures efficacious redemption.
- **Representative Federalism**
 - The structure by which corporate headship explains substitution and final application of redemption.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for covenantal readings of the atonement and pactum salutis.
- As a **polemic** against universalist and hyper-Calvinist distortions of atonement and reprobation.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline and covenantal texts through federal representation and imputation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology and soteriology in Reformed systematic theology.
