### TITLE
Natural Theology (exchange with Emil Brunner) - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 1930s theological milieu: early Neo-orthodoxy and the crisis of liberal Protestantism in Europe. Brunner and Barth debated in 1934 after Brunner's essay on natural theology; Barth replied famously with a short rejoinder, usually rendered as "Nein!" Barth develops the critique further in later volumes of Church Dogmatics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Barth's central claim: **natural theology is untenable** as a theological method because God can be known only through God's self-revelation in Jesus Christ; any attempt to ground knowledge of God in nature or human reason presupposes and thus corrupts revelation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Denial of a reliable human "point of contact" (Anknüpfungspunkt) that would allow nature or reason to bridge to God.
 - Emphasis on the **sovereignty and initiative of divine revelation**: revelation is an event enacted by God, not a proposition inferred from created order.
 - Theological anthropology: human sin radically distorts natural capacities, so unaided human reason cannot yield true knowledge of God.
 - Christocentrism: Jesus Christ is the decisive and exclusive act of God's self-disclosure; theology must begin and end with Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Direct interlocutor: Emil Brunner (who argued for a qualified natural theology).
 - Background interlocutors and targets: classical Thomistic natural theology, Enlightenment and liberal Protestant apologetics (e.g., Schleiermacher-type accounts), Kantian critiques, and certain strains of Reformed scholasticism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), theological epistemology, anthropology (sin), Christology (revelation in Christ), grace and nature, and implicitly the doctrine of God (transcendence).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Revelation is a sovereign divine act centered in Christ; human nature and reason cannot furnish a neutral bridge to God, hence **no natural theology** as a valid source for true knowledge of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The bold, succinct rejection of natural theology encapsulated in Barth's famous one-word response, emphasizing discontinuity rather than continuity between God and creation.
 - Revelation as discrete event (kerygmatic and relational), not cumulative evidence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects liberal attempts to secure religion on human feeling or reason; opposes Thomistic analogia entis by denying that created being provides an epistemic analog for God.
 - Contrasts with Brunner's moderated natural theology, which allows a "point of contact" in nature or conscience.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Revitalizes insistence on the **priority of God's initiative**; popularizes the polemical framing of "natural theology? - Nein!" and sharper language about revelation as an unrepeatable divine act.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed a long-running debate in 20th-century theology; deeply influential in neo-orthodoxy and among theologians who stress revelation and Christocentrism.
 - Provoked defenses of limited natural theology from various Reformed and Catholic theologians; also influenced apologetic approaches that either reject or radically reformulate natural theology (e.g., presuppositionalism, some strands of evangelicalism).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Clarifies methodological boundaries between theology and philosophy; forces renewed attention to Christ as the locus of revelation and to the effects of sin upon human knowing.
 - Serves as a primary polemical and conceptual pivot for courses on revelation, apologetics, and 20th-century dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural theology**
 - Knowledge of God derived from creation, reason, or human experience; Barth rejects its epistemic sufficiency.
- **Special revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure in history and Scripture, supremely in Christ; for Barth, the only reliable source.
- **General revelation**
 - The disclosure of God in creation and conscience; Barth treats it as insufficient without God's self-revelation.
- **Anknüpfungspunkt (point of contact)**
 - Brunner's phrase for where nature meets grace; Barth denies any neutral, salvific point of contact.
- **Nein!**
 - Barth's concise repudiation of Brunner's natural theology; emblematic of his polemic style.
- **Revelation as event**
 - Revelation is an act performed by God rather than a set of propositions discoverable by human reason.
- **Radical sin / total inability**
 - Doctrine that human sinfulness vitiates the capacity to know God unaided.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)**
 - Classical Thomistic principle that Barth largely rejects as a ground for knowing God.
- **Christocentrism**
 - The claim that Christ is the definitive and exclusive revelation of God.
- **Kerygma**
 - Proclamation-centered theology; Barth privileges the proclamation of God over natural evidences.
- **Sovereignty of revelation**
 - Theological priority of God's initiative over human religious activity.
- **Theological epistemology**
 - Barth's insistence that theology must be formed by revelation, not by autonomous reason.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and boundary-marker in debates over apologology and natural theology.
- As a **definition source** for courses on revelation and methodology (clarifying distinctions between general and special revelation).
- As a **conceptual pivot** for Christ-centered dogmatics and for critiques of liberal theology.
