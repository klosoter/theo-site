### TITLE
The Law and Its Fulfillment: A Pauline Theology of Law (Thomas R. Schreiner, 1993)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1990s evangelical, Reformed milieu; written in the context of intense debate over the New Perspective on Paul (Sanders, Dunn, Wright). Schreiner writes as a conservative, exegetically driven New Testament theologian seeking to defend a traditional understanding of law and justification within Pauline theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul represents the Mosaic law as fulfilled in Christ; this fulfillment transforms the law's role without rendering it irrelevant. Schreiner aims to define what Paul means by "fulfillment" and to map the law's continuing functions for Jew and Gentile in redemption and eschatology.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical groundwork: close reading of key Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, 1-2 Corinthians, Philippians) to determine Paul's usage of nomos/torah and related vocabulary.
 - Functional analysis: identifies several functions of the law in Paul - revelation of sin, condemnation, tutor/pedagogue, and normative guide for the regenerate life - showing how these persist or are transformed in Christ.
 - Fulfillment thesis: argues Christ both fulfills the law's demands and accomplishes its typological purposes (ceremonial and civil foreshadowing); moral requirements retain normative force for believers insofar as they are fulfilled internally by the Spirit.
 - Eschatological and covenantal implications: addresses corporate identities (Israel and the church), perseverance of God's promises, and the future of Israel (interaction with Romans 11).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages the New Perspective proponents (E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright); dialogues with traditional Protestant interpreters (Luther, Calvin implicitly), and with contemporary evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** Law (torah), justification by faith, covenant and election, Christology (Christ as fulfiller), soteriology (role of Spirit), eschatology (fulfillment and Israel's future), hermeneutics.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Paul's law theology is Christocentric: the law finds its telos in Christ - fulfilled in him, serving now as a guide transformed by the Spirit, while God's covenantal commitments (including a future for Israel) remain authoritative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses a *nuanced continuity* between law and gospel: fulfilled, not abolished; moral law maintains normative force through internalization by the Spirit.
 - Presents a multi-functional account of the law rather than a single-use definition (e.g., not only condemning).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Explicit corrective to the New Perspective that minimizes the law's role in convicting sinners or that reads Paul as primarily about ethnic boundary markers. Schreiner insists Paul sees the law as exposing sin and demanding righteousness that only Christ provides.
 - Counters any pietistic reading that makes the law irrelevant for Christian ethics; argues for transformed continuity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tightens the use of "fulfillment" as a doctrinal category in Pauline studies: fulfillment incorporates typological, covenantal, and moral trajectories rather than mere abolition or replacement.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a balanced, textually careful refutation of some New Perspective claims.
 - Influential in seminary teaching on Pauline law theology and used as a standard conservative alternative to Sanders/Dunn approaches.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of integrating detailed exegesis with systematic theological concerns; valuable for teaching law/gospel relations and for defenses of covenantal continuity and Israel's future.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fulfillment (pleroma / telos):** Christ as the goal and completion of the law's demands and types; fulfillment entails transformation, not mere abolition.
- **Torah / nomos:** Multifaceted in Paul - revelation, guide, condemnation; Schreiner insists on reading contextually for each function.
- **Works of the law:** Interpreted against the New Perspective's ethnic-boundary reading; Schreiner emphasizes soteriological, not merely ethnic, dimensions.
- **Justification:** Declared righteousness by faith; law functions to show human inability and need for Christ's righteousness.
- **Tutor / pedagogue (paidagogos):** The law as temporary guardian pointing to Christ (Galatian framework) - fulfilled once Christ comes, now superseded in function but not negated morally.
- **Moral vs. ceremonial law:** Ceremonial foreshadowing is fulfilled in Christ; moral law retains ongoing normative relevance for believers through the Spirit.
- **Remnant / Israel's future (Romans 11):** Paul's hope for a future, corporate restoration of Israel; Schreiner reads Romans 11 as affirmation of God's irrevocable covenant promises and a future salvation for Israel that coheres with law-fulfillment.
- **Continuity / discontinuity:** A graded model - essential continuity in covenantal promises and moral order; discontinuity in typological institutions and soteriological means (Christ replaces sacrificial system).
- **Eschatological fulfillment:** Fulfillment is consummative - ultimate realization in eschaton when law's aims are finally secured in Christ.
- **Spirit-enabled obedience:** The moral demands of the law are met in believers' lives by Spirit-wrought righteousness, not by law-works.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul's varied uses of "law" in context.
- As a **polemic** and corrective against aspects of the New Perspective on Paul.
- As a **definition source** in systematic discussions of law, covenant, and fulfillment within Reformed theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses treating Romans 11 and the theological question of Israel's future vis-a-vis law and covenant fidelity.
