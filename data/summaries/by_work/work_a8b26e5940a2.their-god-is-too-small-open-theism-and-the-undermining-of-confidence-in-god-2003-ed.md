### TITLE
Their God Is Too Small: Open Theism and the Undermining of Confidence in God (2003, ed. Bruce Ware)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Early 2000s theological conflict within evangelicalism. Reactionary volume issued amid the rise of Open Theism (1990s onward) as a rival to classical Reformed/evangelical conceptions of divine knowledge and providence. Polemical and pastoral concerns shape its tone: defending classical attributes to secure trust in God.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Open Theism's revision of divine foreknowledge and providence reduces the trustworthiness and consolatory power of God's promises and thus "undermines confidence in God." The book argues that limiting God's exhaustive foreknowledge or altering divine immutability threatens assurance, prayer theology, and biblical interpretation.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnose Open Theism: its key claim is that God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free human choices; the future is partly open. 
 - Theological consequences: show how this view affects doctrines of omniscience, immutability, providence, and covenant faithfulness. 
 - Pastoral implications: argue that an open future yields a God who is less reliable as covenant Lord, weakening trust, prayer confidence, and hope in promises. 
 - Apologetic and exegetical responses: defend classical readings of Scripture that support divine foreknowledge, providence, and immutable counsels.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Primary interlocutors include prominent Open Theists (e.g., Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Greg Boyd, William Hasker). Classical and Reformed defenders of divine attributes inform the counterarguments (broadly drawing on historic confessions, classical theists, and conservative evangelical exegetes).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Divine omniscience and foreknowledge 
 - Divine immutability and aseity 
 - Providence and sovereignty over history 
 - Human freedom and responsibility (compatibilist critique of Open Theism's libertarianism) 
 - Prayer, covenant assurance, and pastoral confidence

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Upholding classical divine attributes (notably exhaustive foreknowledge and immutable sovereignty) is necessary to preserve a God in whom believers can have firm, biblical confidence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Places pastoral confidence and the existential trust of believers at the center of the critique rather than abstract metaphysical priority alone. 
 - Connects doctrinal minutiae (the grammar of foreknowledge) to congregational life and prayer practice.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on Open Theism's claim that limiting divine knowledge better honors human freedom and relational risk. 
 - Reasserts traditional correlativity: God's providential rule and exhaustive knowledge secure the reliability of promises, unlike the contingency emphasized by Open Theists.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes the debate in terms of "confidence in God" rather than only "divine attributes," shifting focus to pastoral repercussions. 
 - Uses the rhetoric of "too small" to diagnose a perceived truncation of divine greatness in Open Theism.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely cited in conservative evangelical and Reformed debates as a comprehensive polemic against Open Theism. 
 - Useful shorthand in denominational statements and pastoral training to justify adherence to classical theism. 
 - Less persuasive to sympathetic analytic philosophers and some evangelicals who remain open to libertarian freedom and revised divine temporality.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models how doctrinal reasoning links to pastoral concerns; good case study in doctrine-to-practice hermeneutics. 
 - Serves as a compact primary-source anthology representing conservative evangelical responses to Open Theism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism:** theological position claiming the future is partly open and God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of free human actions. Treated as the primary object of critique.
- **Classical Theism:** the traditional doctrine asserting God's immutable, timeless (or at least non-ephemeral) attributes, including exhaustive foreknowledge and universal sovereignty.
- **Exhaustive Foreknowledge:** the claim that God knows all future contingent events definitively; defended as essential for divine faithfulness.
- **Divine Immutability:** God does not change in his essential being or decrees; used to rebut Open Theist claims of a God who learns or is surprised.
- **Providence:** God's governance of creation; argued to be compromised if God lacks definite knowledge of future human choices.
- **Covenant Faithfulness:** the trustworthiness of God's promises; central pastoral criterion for rejecting views that, allegedly, render God less reliable.
- **Human Freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist):** debate over whether genuine freedom requires indeterminate future; book favors compatibilist/responsibilist accounts compatible with exhaustive divine knowledge.
- **Prayer and Petition:** theological loci where Open Theism claims pastoral advantage (God is relationally responsive); volume argues classicalism better secures confidence in prayer efficacy.
- **Relational Risk:** Open Theists posit risk as necessary for authentic relation; Ware et al. contest that such risk need not compromise divine immutability or reliability.
- **Temporal Ontology of God:** whether God is temporal, atemporal, or interacts dynamically with time; used to defend a doctrine of divine sovereignty that includes foreknowledge.
- **Assurance:** believers' certainty in salvation and promises; presented as threatened by doctrinal concessions that diminish God's knowledge or control.
- **Biblical Exegesis:** appeals to scriptural texts (e.g., prophetic certainties, divine promises) to argue for classical readings over Open Theist reinterpretations.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **polemic** and departmental standard against Open Theism in conservative evangelical institutions. 
 - As a **pastoral-theological resource** linking doctrine (omniscience, providence) to pastoral practices (prayer, assurance). 
 - As an **exegetical model** favoring readings that sustain divine immutability and exhaustive foreknowledge.
