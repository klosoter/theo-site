### TITLE
The Interpretation of Prophecy (1856) - Patrick Fairbairn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Scottish Presbyterian theology; situated in the Reformed evangelical milieu reacting against both rationalist skepticism and sensational popular futurism. Fairbairn writes as a systematic and pastoral theologian addressing method in biblical prophecy at a moment of rising critical and speculative interpretations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Prophecy must be interpreted by a disciplined hermeneutic that preserves its historical sense, typological function, and ultimate Christocentric fulfillment within the covenantal history of redemption.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Begin with principles: the nature of prophecy, its relation to revelation, and the categories of meaning (literal, typical, spiritual).
 - Lay out hermeneutical rules for reading predictive and typical passages (context, covenant-history, canonical finality).
 - Apply rules to representative prophetic texts to demonstrate Christ as the center and culmination of prophetic promise.
 - Address eschatological questions, distinguishing legitimate expectation from speculative chronology or sensationalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on Reformed confessional tradition and the Scottish divines; engages generically with continental rationalists, popular premillennial/futurist readings, and loose allegorizing interpreters rather than targeting a single modern critic by name.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, prophetic inspiration, typology, Christology (fulfillment), covenant theology (notably the **Covenant of Grace**), eschatology, hermeneutics.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Fairbairn argues that prophetic Scripture, rightly read in its covenantal and canonical context, is a unified sequence of promises and types that finds its concrete fulfillment in Christ and thus grounds preaching, assurance, and eschatological hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Christocentric hermeneutic as a hermeneutical axiom:** Prophecy is read first as promise pointing to Christ; typology is historic and objective, not merely moralizing or subjective.
- **Balanced literal-typological approach:** Insists on the historical-grammatical sense but allows legitimate typological interpretation where history and promise converge; resists both bare literalism that severs typology and fanciful allegory that abandons history.
- **Covenantal integration:** Interprets prophetic texts within the framework of the **Covenant of Grace**, emphasizing continuity in God's redemptive purpose across testaments.
- **Methodological rigor:** Provides practical rules for discriminating prediction from promise, typical correspondence from mere resemblance, and eschatological expectation from speculative chronology.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors and rivals:**
 - Corrects allegorizing trends by recovering the historical sense.
 - Counters sensational futurism by insisting on canonical coherence and covenantal fulfillment.
 - Avoids reductionist rationalism by affirming prophetic inspiration and predictive import.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely read in 19th-century Reformed and Presbyterian circles as a conservative guide to prophetic interpretation; used in seminary instruction for its clear methodological prescriptions. Later historicist and critical scholarship diminished its prominence, but it influenced subsequent conservative hermeneutical practice.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a compact model for training ministers and students in faithful, covenantal, and Christ-centered reading of prophetic portions of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prophecy:** Inspired disclosure often containing promise, type, and prediction; interpreted within history and covenant.
- **Typology / Type and Antitype:** Historical persons/events as divinely instituted shadows whose reality is realized in Christ (the antitype).
- **Fulfillment:** The concrete realization of prophetic promise in Christ and the redemptive acts of God.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The unifying framework for prophetic promise; prophecy interpreted as progressive revelation within this covenant.
- **Progressive Revelation:** The unfolding of God's redemptive plan across time culminating in Christ.
- **Historical-grammatical method:** Attention to original context, authorial intent, and historical setting as the baseline for meaning.
- **Literal vs. Spiritual sense:** Distinction preserved - the literal (historical) meaning undergirds legitimate spiritual/typological senses.
- **Prediction vs. Promise:** Fairbairn distinguishes forward-looking foretelling from covenantal assurances that may be typologically fulfilled.
- **Canonical context:** Prophecy to be read in light of the whole Scripture's testimony, not isolated proof-texting.
- **Christocentric interpretation:** The rule that Christ is the focal point for interpreting messianic and redemptive prophecy.
- **Eschatology:** Treated cautiously: expectation affirmed, speculative chronology rejected.
- **Hermeneutical rules:** Practical maxims offered for discriminating types, predictions, and fulfillments.
- **Promise-fulfillment nexus:** Emphasizes promise as the covenantal root of predictive passages.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional and exegetical resource in discussions of the **Covenant of Grace** - showing how prophecy fits the covenantal structure of promise and fulfillment.
 - As a representative conservative model in studies of **Covenant Theology in the Reformed Tradition** - used polemically against allegorizing and speculative futurism and as an exegetical model for typological, Christ-centered reading of prophetic texts.
