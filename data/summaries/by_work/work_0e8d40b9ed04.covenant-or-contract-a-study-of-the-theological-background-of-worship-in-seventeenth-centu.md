### TITLE
Covenant or Contract? A Study of the Theological Background of Worship in Seventeenth-Century Scotland - James B. Torrance (Scottish Journal of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Mid- to late-20th-century theological retrieval of Scottish Reformation and Puritan worship debates; published in Scottish Journal of Theology as part of Torrance's recovery of covenantal and sacramental emphases in Reformed worship. 
 - Engagement with seventeenth-century Scotland (Westminster, National Covenant era, Knoxian and Rutherfordian practice) and wider Reformed sources (Calvin, Bucer, Reformed scholastics).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Worship in seventeenth-century Scotland is best understood within a **covenantal** framework (relational, corporate, formative) rather than a **contractual** one (transactional, legalistic). This distinction crucially shapes how the church handles **guilt, pollution, and death**-not merely as juridical liabilities but as relational realities remedied by covenantal incorporation into Christ.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Historical-theological diagnosis: traces liturgical practices, catecheses, and confessional standards to show covenant thinking permeating worship. 
 - Theological analysis: contrasts covenant (participatory, sacramental, reconciliatory) with contract (stipulative, forensic, external). 
 - Practical consequences: sacramental rites (baptism, Lord's Supper), public confession, and pastoral discipline are interpreted as means of **restoration from guilt, cleansing from pollution, and victory over death** through union with Christ rather than mere legal pardon. 
 - Concludes by urging a corrective to modern worship theories that reduce rites to contractual sign-posts or moral aids.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Scottish divines and presbyterian liturgists (e.g., Rutherford, Baillie, Knox-derived practice), Westminster Assembly documents, Calvin, and key Reformed manuals; implicit critique of later legalistic or pietistic readings.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Covenant theology**, sacramentology, ecclesiology (corporate identity), atonement (participatory vs purely forensic emphases), sin (guilt, pollution), death, law/gospel distinction, liturgy and worship practice.

- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 - Worship functions as a covenantal encounter of the church with the living Christ - a corporate, sacramental remedy for guilt, pollution, and death - rather than a contractual exchange of promises and penalties.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Prioritizes **corporate, participatory union with Christ** in worship over forensic categories; reading sacraments as means of incorporation that address guilt, pollution and death existentially and communally. 
 - Reads seventeenth-century Scottish practice sympathetically as robustly covenantal rather than merely legalistic.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on historiographies that characterize Reformed worship as dominated by legal-contract metaphors or purely didactic/pietistic function. 
 - Challenges evangelical reductions of sacraments to symbolic memorials or mere seals.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Sharp, programmatic contrast: **Covenant vs Contract** as analytical category for liturgical theology. 
 - Reframes traditional forensic terms (guilt, pollution, death) within covenantal reparative language.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Influential among scholars retrieving Reformed sacramental and covenantal theology; used in debates over the theology of worship, communion practices, and pastoral liturgy. 
 - Respected for nuanced historical reading and theological synthesis; cited in subsequent work on covenantal identity and sacramental presence.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a compact model for reading liturgical texts and practices through covenantal lenses; valuable corrective to an overly juridical or privatized view of sin and sacrament.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - relational agreement rooted in God's initiative; frames worship as communion and incorporation. 
- **Contract** - stipulative transactional model; Torrance uses as foil to expose limitations for understanding worship. 
- **Worship (covenantal)** - corporate encounter, formative and reconciliatory; sacramental participation in Christ. 
- **Guilt** - forensic sense of culpability; in Torrance's reading it is addressed within covenantal reconciliation, not only declared forgiven. 
- **Pollution** - ceremonial/relational defilement affecting access to God's presence; cleansing is a covenantal restoration (ritual and sacramental). 
- **Death** - existential and communal consequence of sin remedied by union with Christ (resurrection life communicated in worship). 
- **Sacrament / Sacramental presence** - means of real participation in Christ; not mere signs or seals but conduits of covenantal grace. 
- **Federal headship / Incorporation** - theological mechanism by which guilt/pollution/death are remedied: Christ as head, believers as members. 
- **Forensic (juridical) language** - legal categories (pardoning, imputation) acknowledged but subordinated to participatory covenantal language. 
- **Discipline and public confession** - ecclesial practices that restore covenant status, address pollution, and reconcile members to communal life. 
- **Law/Gospel dialectic** - used pastorally: law exposes, gospel restores within the covenantal community. 
- **Liturgical form (Scottish)** - studied as shaped by covenant theology (public vows, sacraments, catechesis). 
- **Communion / Participation** - central motif: worship is entrance into covenantal life with Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing covenantal vs contractual models of worship and ecclesial identity. 
 - As a **polemic** against reductive forensic or symbolic sacramental theologies and against privatized pietism. 
 - As an **exegetical and historical model** for reading Reformed liturgies and pastoral practices through the categories of guilt, pollution, and death remedied in covenantal communion.
