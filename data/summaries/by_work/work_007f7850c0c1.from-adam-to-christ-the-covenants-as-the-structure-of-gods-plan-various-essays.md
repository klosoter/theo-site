### TITLE
From Adam to Christ: The Covenants as the Structure of God's Plan (essays ed. Stephen Wellum)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical scholarship (late 20th-21st century milieu). Situated in renewed interest in covenant theology as the canonical and redemptive-historical framework of Scripture; dialogue with dispensationalism, New Covenant Theology, and recent work in biblical theology (e.g., Vos, Kline, Gaffin, Murray).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture is best read and systematized through the covenants: God's dealings from Adam to Christ form a coherent covenantal structure in which the promise of redemption is progressively disclosed and finally realized in Christ. The covenants are the primary organizing principle for understanding revelation, Christology, soteriology, and the church.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: each major biblical epoch (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, New Covenant in Christ) is interpreted as a covenantal administration revealing the one covenantal purpose.
 - The covenant of works (Adam) and the covenant of grace (promised fulfillment) frame divine-human relations; Christ is the covenantal Mediator who fulfills the Adamic role as federal head (Second Adam).
 - Continuity and development: unity of the covenant of grace across administrations, with typology and promise-fulfillment as the hermeneutical engine; law, promise, and sacramental signs function within the covenantal economy.
 - Practical correlates: ecclesiology (people of God across redemptive history), sacramentology (signs/ seals as covenant markers), and pastoral-theological implications for preaching and catechesis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Geerhardus Vos (redemptive-historical method), John Murray (covenant theology), Meredith G. Kline (administrative approaches), O. Palmer Robertson, recent critics such as dispensationalists and New Covenant Theology proponents; also engagement with biblical exegesis across OT and NT texts (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Prophets, Pauline and Johannine corpus).
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant (works and grace), revelation, Christology (Second Adam, Mediator), atonement, federal headship, soteriology, ecclesiology, sacramental theology, typology, law and gospel.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The book argues that the covenants - especially the contrast and continuity between Adam and Christ - constitute the structural spine of redemptive history, making covenantal theology the hermeneutical key to Scripture's unified story of promise and fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the covenant of works as the necessary counterpart to the covenant of grace for making sense of sin, law, and the need for a covenantal Mediator.
 - Emphasis on Adam-Christ typology as structural rather than merely illustrative: Adam and Christ as federal heads who determine covenantal standing for their respective peoples.
 - Covenant unity: persistent claim that the covenant of grace is one covenant with diverse administrations rather than a series of unrelated covenants.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against dispensational bifurcation of Israel/Church; argues for organic continuity of God's people under one covenantal economy.
 - Critique of views that minimize the covenant of works or dissolve covenantal continuity (e.g., some New Covenant Theology positions).
 - Engages Meredith Kline's covenant-administration emphasis but stresses typological and promise-fulfillment continuity more than purely legal-administrative accounts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Framing the entire canonical drama as a single covenantal plan from Adam to Christ, articulated through promise/fulfillment patterns and covenantal mediatorship.
 - Use of "covenant administration" language alongside robust federal-headship categories to bridge exegetical detail and systematic doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a contemporary synthesis of classic federal theology and redemptive-historical exegesis.
 - Influential among pastors and teachers for sermon structure and catechetical frameworks; increasingly cited in academic treatments of covenant theology and Christology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers an integrated framework linking biblical theology and systematic doctrine.
 - Provides usable exegetical models for reading OT covenants in light of Christ and for defending covenant continuity against rival models.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** The pre-Fall arrangement with Adam as federal head, whose obedience was condition for life; accounts for law, original failure, and need for a Redeemer.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The single, unfolding covenant promising redemption through a Mediator; administered in multiple epochs (Adamic promise, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant).
- **Federal Headship:** The theological category whereby Adam and Christ represent and determine the standing of their respective peoples.
- **Adam-Christ Typology:** Structural reading that sees Adam as prototype and Christ as true, obedient representative (Second Adam) who fulfills covenantal obligations.
- **Redemptive-historical method:** Hermeneutic that reads biblical texts in their role within the unfolding covenantal story of promise and fulfillment.
- **Covenant administration/administration of the covenant:** The historical, mediatorial forms in which the one covenant of grace is expressed and applied (sacramental, legal, prophetic means).
- **Promise-fulfillment pattern:** The recurrent canonical rhythm that links OT promises to their consummation in Christ and the New Covenant.
- **Mediator (Christ as Mediator):** Christ's role as covenant-representative who establishes and secures the covenantal benefits for his people.
- **Continuity vs discontinuity:** The debate over how much of Israel's covenantal identity and promises carry over to the church; this work argues for significant continuity under one covenant.
- **Sacraments as covenant signs:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper function as covenant seals that mark belonging to the covenant people.
- **Law and Gospel within covenant:** Law functions as covenantal boundary and guide; gospel is fulfillment and restoration through Christ's faithfulness.
- **Typology vs allegory:** Prefers typological, promise-fulfillment interpretation grounded in canonical progression rather than loose allegory.
- **Canon as covenantal unity:** Scripture construed as a unified covenantal narrative rather than disconnected legal/ritual/legal texts.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for contemporary Reformed covenant theology and federal-headship expositions.
 - As a polemic and corrective against dispensationalism and certain forms of New Covenant Theology.
 - As an exegetical model for preaching and theological integration (OT-to-NT typology, Christocentric canonical reading).
