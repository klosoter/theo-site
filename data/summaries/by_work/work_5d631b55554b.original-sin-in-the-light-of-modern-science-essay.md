### TITLE
Original Sin in the Light of Modern Science (essay) - Karl Rahner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Mid-20th century Catholic theology (postwar ressourcement and pre-/post-Vatican II). Rahner writes at the intersection of classical Thomism, patristic-Augustinian heritage, and contemporary scientific developments (especially evolutionary biology). The essay aims to bring the doctrine of original sin into constructive dialogue with modern science.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Rahner argues that the Christian doctrine of original sin must be reformulated so that it remains theologically intact while intelligible in the light of evolutionary anthropology and modern genetics. He insists the problem is not scientific "how?" but theological "what?" and "why?" - i.e., the reality of human estrangement from God must be preserved, even if the mode of its historical occurrence is reinterpreted.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reappraisal of traditional formulations (Augustinian inherited guilt, Reformed federal-head models) in light of empirical science that rejects simple biological transmission of a single ancestral act.
 - Distinction between the theological fact of original sin (a universal existential condition and disorder) and its empirical description (mechanisms of biological descent).
 - Proposal: preserve the necessity and universality of a primordial rupture (a "primeval existential event" or structural corruption) while allowing non-literal, non-juridical accounts of transmission - emphasis on ontological/relational transmission (human solidarity), not merely genetic heredity.
 - Reaffirmation of Christology and grace: only Christ's redemptive act and grace can heal the structural disorder; original sin explains universal need for salvation.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and classical Western tradition; Thomas Aquinas (Thomistic categories retained but brought into transcendental method); Reformation confessions (federal headship as a major interlocutor); contemporary scientists and evolutionary thinkers (e.g., engagement with Teilhardian themes implicitly); modern theologians debating historicity of Adam.
- **Doctrines treated:** Original sin, human nature/anthropology, grace and justification, Christology (necessity of the Incarnation and redemption), revelation (authority and interpretation), and soteriology (universal need for grace).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Rahner holds that original sin must be rearticulated as a universal, structurally transmitted existential estrangement remedied only by Christ - theological truth preserved, empirical account revised to accommodate modern science. (Addresses both **Historicity And Federal Headship Of Adam** and **The Fall And Its Consequences**.)

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Moves from juridical/federal models to a **structural-ontological** understanding of original sin: sin as a deep disorder of human existence, not merely inherited guilt.
 - Uses Rahner's transcendental-anthropological method to argue the necessity of interpreting human experience (alienation, culpability) as theological datum.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Challenges a strictly Augustinian inherited guilt model and classical federal headship (Adam as legal representative) without denying the reality of sin's transmission or the historicity of a primordial turning away.
 - Contrasts with literalist historicism by allowing symbolically understood, yet theologically real, accounts of a "first turning."
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes **solidarity** and **existential transmission** over biological heredity; reframes "original guilt" as a function of communal ontological condition rather than simple forensic imputation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in Catholic theology for enabling dialogue with evolutionary science; welcomed by many for pastoral and apologetic clarity.
 - Criticized by some Reformed and conservative Roman Catholic voices for downplaying federal headship and juridical categories.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a methodological model for integrating scientific knowledge with dogmatic theology; valuable for ecumenical discussion on Adam, sin, and human origins.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin:** A universal structural disorder of human nature and relation to God; theological fact to be preserved.
- **Historicity of Adam:** Rahner allows non-literal historical interpretations; retains a primordial event's theological role without requiring a single biological pair.
- **Federal headship (Adam):** Critiqued in strict forensic terms; Rahner rejects simple representative-imputation while acknowledging solidarity that makes Adam paradigmatic.
- **The Fall:** Understood as a primordial existential rupture that explains human autonomy from God and need for redemption.
- **Original guilt:** Problematized as juridical imputation; reinterpreted via **ontological solidarity** rather than direct forensic inheritance.
- **Transmission of sin:** Emphasizes **existential/ontological** transmission (social, spiritual structure) over genetic mechanism.
- **Privation (privation boni):** Classical category preserved to explain the negative metaphysical aspect of sin.
- **Grace / Christological remedy:** Grace as superadded healing-order; Christological uniqueness remains necessary and universal.
- **Transcendental anthropology:** Rahner's method - starting from human experience and openness to the divine to reinterpret doctrine.
- **Solidarity of the human race:** Key sociological/theological premise for universality of original sin.
- **Evolutionary anthropology:** Scientific horizon Rahner engages; forces rethinking of single-pair literalism.
- **Existential event / primeval event:** Terminology Rahner uses to allow theological reality without positivist historicism.
- **Forensic vs. ontological models:** Central contrast Rahner draws to reframe debates.
- **Mythic-historical hermeneutic:** Rahner favors theological-historical meaning over literalist historicism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology to move from juridical to structural accounts of sin.
 - As an **exegetical and doctrinal model** for reconciling scriptural/creedal claims about Adam with modern evolutionary science.
