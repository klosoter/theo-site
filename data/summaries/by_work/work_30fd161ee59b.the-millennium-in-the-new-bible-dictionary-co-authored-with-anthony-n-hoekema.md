### TITLE
**"The Millennium" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (co-authored with Anthony N. Hoekema), entry in The New Bible Dictionary**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical context; response to widespread premillennial and dispensational readings. Located within covenant theology and the rise of inaugurated eschatology discussions.
 - Addresses pastoral and scholarly confusion about Revelation 20 and millennium expectations amidst popular eschatological speculation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The thousand-year "millennium" in Revelation 20 is best understood within an **amillennial/inaugurated eschatology**: it symbolizes the present, limited reign of Christ (with Satan restrained) from his ascension to his final return, rather than a literal future earthly thousand-year period.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical reading of Revelation 20:
 - Interprets the numeric "thousand" as symbolic, consistent with apocalyptic idiom.
 - Treats the binding of Satan as a present reality effected by Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, enabling gospel advance.
 - Distinguishes between Christ's heavenly reign and the final consummation (resurrection, judgment, new creation).
 - Theological integration:
 - Connects Revelation 20 to broader New Testament witnesses (e.g., Pauline and Johannine motifs of already/not-yet).
 - Emphasizes the resurrection as central pivot for eschatological fulfillment.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Critiques literalistic and futurist readings (classical and dispensational premillennialism) for isolating Revelation 20 from New Testament eschatological contours.
 - Corrects overly spiritualized readings that erase final physical resurrection and judgment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages New Testament texts (esp. Revelation, Pauline eschatology), Reformed theological tradition, and contemporary premillennial interpreters; implicitly dialogues with dispensationalists and postmillennial optimism skeptics.
 - Draws on covenantal exegesis and patristic/apocalyptic interpretive conventions insofar as they illuminate symbolic numbers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology** (millennium, parousia, final judgment)
 - **Christology** (exaltation, reigning Christ)
 - **Resurrection** (central to inaugurated eschatology)
 - **Satanology** (binding and activity)
 - **Covenant and kingdom** (already/not-yet fulfillment)
 - **Revelation** (hermeneutics of apocalyptic literature)

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin argues that Revelation 20 delineates Christ's present, heavenly reign-with Satan restrained-framed by resurrection-centered fulfillment, and that the millennium should not be pressed into a future literal chronological epoch.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places the **resurrection** at the heart of eschatological exposition: the millennium is intelligible only in light of Christ's victory and present reign.
 - Treats the millennium as an **exegetical-theological scheme** (symbolic temporal limitation) rather than a calendar to be harmonized with history.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects literalist/futurist tendencies (both dispensational and some forms of classical premillennialism) that treat Revelation 20 as a literal roadmap.
 - Pushes back on reductive spiritualizations that deny bodily resurrection and final judgment.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "binding of Satan" as an instrument of the church's mission (gospel expansion) within a limited present epoch, not as elimination of evil or evidence of an earthly monarchial reign by Christ.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed and evangelical scholarly circles as a concise, reliable amillennial summary; used in seminary courses and reference works.
 - Functions as a steady corrective in debates with dispensational premillennialism and popular millennial speculation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, biblically rooted framework for teaching Revelation 20 within covenantal/inaugurated eschatology.
 - Durable as a hermeneutical exemplar for reading apocalyptic symbolism responsibly while retaining doctrinal gravity (resurrection, judgment, Christ's present reign).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Millennium** - The thousand-year period in Revelation 20; read symbolically as the present restricted reign of Christ between ascension and parousia.
- **Amillennialism** - The view advocated: no future literal thousand-year earthly reign; millennium is realized/symbolic.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The already/not-yet framework: Christ's kingdom has begun (resurrection/ascension) but awaits consummation.
- **Binding of Satan** - A present restraining action effected by Christ enabling gospel advance; not an absolute cessation of demonic activity.
- **Thousand (numeric symbolism)** - Understood apocalyptically as symbol of fullness/limited epoch, not a strict chronological indicator.
- **Parousia** - Christ's future return which terminates the present epoch and inaugurates final judgment and new creation.
- **Resurrection-centered eschatology** - Emphasizes bodily resurrection as the decisive marker of inaugurated fulfillment.
- **Judgment / Second Resurrection** - Final vindication and condemnation follow the present reign; Revelation 20 distinguishes the present order from final assessment.
- **Kingdom of God** - Realized in Christ's reigning activity; not reducible to earthly political dominion prior to consummation.
- **Hermeneutics of apocalyptic literature** - Advocates symbolic, canonical, and New Testament-correlated reading rather than strict literal chronology.
- **Covenant continuity** - Reads the millennium within the continuity of God's covenantal promises fulfilled in Christ.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for amillennial and inaugurated eschatological positions in reference literature.
 - As a **polemic** against literalist and dispensational premillennial readings of Revelation 20.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating apocalyptic symbolism with Pauline and Johannine eschatology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching to re-center resurrection and covenant theology in eschatological instruction.
