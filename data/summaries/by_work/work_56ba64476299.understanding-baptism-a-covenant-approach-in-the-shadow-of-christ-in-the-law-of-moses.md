### TITLE
Understanding Baptism: A Covenant Approach (chapter) - Vern Poythress, in The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed theological milieu (late 20th / early 21st century). Part of a larger volume exploring how the Mosaic law shadows Christ; Poythress writes from a covenantal, confessional perspective engaging recent biblical scholarship and pastoral concerns.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Baptism must be read as the New Testament counterpart to Old Testament circumcision within covenant continuity. That identification shapes who is baptized (covenant children included), what baptism signifies (a covenantal sign and seal), and how its efficacy is rightly understood (real but not meritorious).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Maps typological relation: circumcision as a law-era sign that prefigures baptism as the new-covenant initiatory rite.
 - Shows covenantal continuity: household inclusion in Acts and the logic of covenant membership warrant paedobaptism.
 - Defines sacramental function: baptism is a **sign** (visible pointer to a spiritual reality) and a **seal** (divine attestation and application of covenant promises), not a mechanical instrument of regeneration.
 - Balances symbolism and efficacy: criticizes purely symbolic readings that reduce baptism to mere testimony and also rejects schemes that equate baptism with automatic justification.
 - Addresses mode and practice briefly: historical and philological data are surveyed to show multiple acceptable modes; theological priority is the sign-seal relation over uniform physical technique.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed confessional tradition (e.g., Westminster standards), New Testament exegesis on household baptisms (Acts), and critiques credobaptist arguments that sever baptism from covenantal continuity.
 - Dialogues implicitly with both historic paedobaptist theologians and modern credobaptist apologists; marshals biblical-theological and typological methods rather than purely systematic proofs.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, sacraments (signs and seals), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church; covenant children), soteriology (relation of external signs to internal grace), biblical typology and continuity/discontinuity.
- **Closing line**
 - Baptism is best understood theologically as the covenantal initiatory sign and seal that continues circumcision's function: inclusion of covenant households, a real (not automatic) application of promise, and a sacrament whose meaning outranks controversies over physical mode.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong typological hermeneutic: reads the Law of Moses as structurally "shadowing" Christ and his ordinances; baptism inherits and fulfills circumcision's covenantal logic.
 - Nuanced sacramental realism: affirms real spiritual consequence (seal of promise, means of covenant identification) without collapsing into sacramentalism that guarantees regeneration.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects credobaptist reductions that treat baptism purely as personal testimony or mere obedience.
 - Pushes back against extreme sacramentalizing tendencies by insisting on the primacy of internal faith and the Spirit's work apart from the external rite.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "sign-and-seal" vocabulary applied tightly to the circumcision-baptism relation; frames baptism as both covenantal initiation and public proclamation of already-given soteriological realities.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received within Reformed circles as a robust, biblically informed defense of paedobaptism that keeps close ties to confessional language; used in pastoral and academic discussions to rehabilitate typological arguments without antinomian continuity claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for exegetical linkage of OT and NT rites, for clarifying sacramental theology in pastoral practice, and for offering a balanced middle path between symbol-only and regeneration-by-rite extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant continuity**
 - The theological claim that essential covenant structure persists from OT to NT; grounds inclusion of infants in the covenant community.
- **Circumcision ↔ Baptism**
 - Circumcision as the Old Covenant sign; baptism as its New Covenant counterpart and fulfillment.
- **Sign and seal**
 - Baptism is a visible sign and divine seal-points to and attests the promised gracious reality.
- **Paedobaptism**
 - Baptizing covenant children based on household patterns and typological continuity; defended as faithful to the covenant logic.
- **Credobaptism**
 - Treated as a rival model that emphasizes individual profession and often severs baptism from corporate covenant identity.
- **Efficacy (baptismal)**
 - Real but non-meritorious: baptism communicates covenant standing and is accompanied by the promised Spirit in God's economy, yet does not automatically confer regeneration.
- **Baptismal regeneration (rejected-as-formula)**
 - The strict formulaic claim that the rite itself automatically effects regeneration is rejected; Poythress insists on the Spirit's sovereign application of covenant promises.
- **Mode (immersion / sprinkling / pouring)**
 - Historical/linguistic plurality acknowledged; theological emphasis placed on meaning rather than enforcing a single physical mode.
- **Household baptisms (Acts)**
 - Key exegetical loci used to demonstrate inclusion of children and corporate administration of the sacrament.
- **Visible vs invisible church**
 - Distinction used to explain why baptizing covenant children is appropriate even where individual faith is not yet evidentiary.
- **Typology**
 - Hermeneutical tool: OT institutions shadow NT realities; baptism is read typologically from circumcision.
- **Seal of promise**
 - Baptism functions as divine confirmation that the covenant promise applies (conditionally or sacramentally) to the baptized.
- **Sacramental realism**
 - Affirms sacrament's objective reference to grace without automaticizing its efficacy.
- **Covenant children**
 - The theological category that secures infant inclusion in baptismal practice.

- How this work is used:
 - As a definitional and exegetical resource for paedobaptist arguments linking circumcision and baptism.
 - As a balanced polemic against both over-symbolic credobaptism and formulaic baptismal-regeneration schemes.
 - As an exegetical model for integrating typology, covenant theology, and sacramental doctrine in pastoral application.
