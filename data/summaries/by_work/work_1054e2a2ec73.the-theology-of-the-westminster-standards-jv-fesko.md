### TITLE
**The Theology of the Westminster Standards** (J. V. Fesko - theological reading of the Westminster Standards; primary text: Westminster Confession of Faith, Larger and Shorter Catechisms)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-17th century English Reformation; produced by the Westminster Assembly (1643-1653) amid Covenant theology formation, parliamentary-puritan milieu, and conflicts with Roman Catholic, Arminian, and Laudian Anglican positions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Standards present a coherent, covenantal Reformed system in which **regeneration and the Spirit's indwelling** are sovereign acts of God rooted in union with Christ, effected monergistically by the Holy Spirit and mediated through the ordinary means of grace (Word and sacraments) for assurance and sanctification.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Systematic ordering from sin and God's decree to Christ, covenant of grace, salvation (calling, justification, adoption), and sanctification - locating regeneration and indwelling at the junction of effectual calling and progressive sanctification.
 - Distinct treatment of efficient vs. instrumental causes: Spirit is efficient; Word and sacramental signs are instruments/seals, not automatic causes of regeneration.
 - Assurance and experiential faith arise from the Spirit's internal testimony and the believer's persevering fruits (mortification and vivification).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Scripture as normative warrant; theological debt to Augustine, Calvin, English and Scottish Puritans, and Reformed scholastic formulations (e.g., Owen on the Spirit).
 - Polemical moves against Roman Catholic sacramentalism, Lutheran sacramentalism, and Arminian synergism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant of grace, election, effectual calling, regeneration, indwelling of the Spirit, justification (imputation), sanctification (progressive), sacraments (means and seals), assurance, perseverance, original sin.
- **Closing line:** The Westminster Standards anchor regeneration as the Spirit's sovereign, transforming act that establishes union with Christ and grounds progressive sanctification via the ordinary means of grace, providing both forensic certainty (justification) and experiential assurance (assurance and sanctification).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong covenantal grammar - regeneration is discussed within the covenant of grace and union with Christ rather than as an isolated mystical event.
 - Clear separation of the Spirit's efficient work from the instrumental efficacy of Word and sacraments (seals not causes).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Against Roman Catholicism: rejects ex opere operato sacramental regeneration; insists on Spirit's sovereign work.
 - Against Arminianism: affirms monergistic effectual calling and denies prevenient-free-will regeneration.
 - Against any reductionistic experientialism: insists assurance is grounded in objective covenant promises as testified by the Spirit, not merely subjective feeling.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integration of forensic (justification/imputation) and transformational (regeneration/indwelling) vocabularies within a single covenantal soteriology.
 - Precise use of "means" language - Word and sacraments as ordained instruments that the Spirit uses without being replaced by them.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for Presbyterian and many Reformed churches; central in seminary curricula and confessional subscription debates.
 - Modern interpreters (e.g., J. V. Fesko) recover its pastoral balance between doctrinal precision and applied piety.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to hold together sovereign grace, normative means, and pastoral assurance; serves as a catechetical and polemical resource for historic Reformed pneumatology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regeneration:** The Spirit's sovereign, instantaneous act of giving new spiritual life; produces faith and repentance.
- **Indwelling of the Spirit:** Ongoing habitation of the Spirit in believers that grounds sanctification, assurance, and communion with Christ.
- **Effectual calling:** The Spirit's efficacious summons that results in conversion (distinct from general calling).
- **Union with Christ:** Federal and mystical bond by which benefits (justification, sanctification, perseverance) are received; locus of regeneration.
- **Means of grace:** The Word and sacraments as ordained instruments the Spirit uses to apply Christ's benefits; seals, not automatic causes.
- **Sanctification (progressive):** The Spirit-enabled growth in holiness following regeneration; involves mortification (putting to death sin) and vivification (new life).
- **Assurance:** Spirit-wrought confidence grounded in covenant promises and observable fruit, not merely subjective sensation.
- **Imputation (forensic):** Christ's righteousness counted to believers; coordinated with regeneration but distinct in category.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration by God; simultaneous with union but distinct from regeneration (which changes the person).
- **Covenant of grace:** The theological frame locating promises, means, and the Spirit's work in salvation history.
- **Common vs. saving grace:** Distinguishes general benevolence from particular regenerative work of the Spirit.
- **Sacramental efficacy:** Clarified as dependent on the Spirit's work - sacraments are seals that confirm, not produce, regeneration.
- **Mortification & vivification:** Paired terms describing the Spirit's work in sanctification (putting sin to death / imparting new life).
- **Assurance test (fruit and promise):** Assurance roots in both external promise and internal fruit as witnessed by the Spirit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed doctrines of regeneration, indwelling, and means of grace.
 - As a **polemic** against Roman Catholic sacramentalism and Arminian synergism.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching and catechesis on conversion and assurance.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking forensic (justification/imputation) and transformational (regeneration/sanctification) loci in systematic theology.
