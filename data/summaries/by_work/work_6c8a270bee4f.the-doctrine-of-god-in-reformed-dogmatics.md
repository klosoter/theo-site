### TITLE
**Geerhardus Vos - The Doctrine of God (Reformed Dogmatics)**

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Reformed scholarship; Vos taught at Princeton Seminary and is a founding figure of evangelical redemptive-historical theology. The material appears in his Reformed Dogmatics (posthumous collection of lectures) and reflects the mature pastoral-scholarly milieu of classical Dutch Reformed orthodoxy modified by modern historical-critical pressures.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate the being and activity of God as the sovereign, covenantal Author of redemptive history: God's attributes, knowledge, will, and acts are to be understood primarily in relation to revelation and covenant rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Starts from Scripture and redemptive history (Biblical-theological method) rather than abstract speculation.
 - Systematically treats divine being and attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, omniscience) and then moves to divine acts: revelation, decree, election, providence, and covenant administration.
 - Emphasizes God's historical self-revelation in Christ as the center for understanding divine perfections.
 - Argues for the priority of divine decree and concurrence in explaining foreknowledge and contingent events (see below on Molinism).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed scholastic sources (Calvin, Turretin), modern theologians of his day, and biblical exegesis; interacts critically with contemporary philosophical accounts of knowledge and freedom (implicitly opposed to Molinist proposals).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Trinity, attributes of God (simplicity, aseity, immutability, omniscience), providence (concurrence and preservation), decree and predestination, covenant theology, and Christ as the decisive self-revelation of God.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - God is to be known and defined primarily as the covenantal, sovereign Actor in redemptive history: divine attributes and knowledge are intelligible only within God's electing, revelatory, and providential acts in history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Redemptive-historical priority:** Vos insists that doctrine of God must be grounded in the narrative of revelation and covenant, not in abstract attribute-lists.
 - **Theological epistemology:** Divine knowledge is explained inside God's eternal decree and providential governance rather than by appeal to speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against purely metaphysical treatments (speculative theism) that divorce God's being from His historical self-revelation.
 - Implicitly opposes Molinism: rejects the idea that God's knowledge of counterfactuals (middle knowledge) is the primary ground for providential action; instead grounds foreknowledge in divine decree and concurrence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys covenant and history as primary hermeneutical keys for classical terms (e.g., "foreknowledge" read covenantally and electively rather than merely cognitively).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and evangelical circles; foundational for later redemptive-historical and Biblical-theological approaches in systematic theology. Read as a corrective to both liberal historicism and dry scholasticism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models integration of biblical exegesis and dogmatic precision; offers a robust Reformed alternative to Molinist and open-theist accounts of foreknowledge and providence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; Vos stresses this but frames it in God's covenantal initiation.
- **Simplicity** - Divine unity; used to guard against dividing God's being from His acts.
- **Immutability** - Not mere static unchange, but fidelity to covenantal purposes.
- **Omniscience / Foreknowledge** - God's knowledge of future events is treated as comprehensive and grounded in divine decree and providential concurrence, not in an independent middle knowledge.
 - Relation to Molinism: Vos opposes the Molinist claim that God's knowledge of counterfactuals (middle knowledge) is the basis for election and providence.
- **Decree / Predestination** - Central explanatory category for how God ordains history and knows contingent events.
- **Providence (Concurrence)** - God actively concurs with secondary causes; contingency is real but always under divine governance.
- **Revelation (Special and Redemptive-Historical)** - Primary hermeneutical key: attributes and acts of God are known through Christ and covenant history.
- **Covenant** - The structural axis of divine action; election, promise, and administration are read covenantally.
- **Trinity** - Ground for relational language of God and the historical sending of the Son and Spirit.
- **Election** - Treated as both eternal decree and manifested covenantally in history.
- **Concursus** - The doctrine of divine cooperation with created causes; explains providence without denying creaturely agency.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism** - Cited as a rival account of divine foreknowledge; Vos uses his covenantal-decretal framework to critique it as undermining divine sovereignty and the priority of election.
- **Redemptive-Historical Method** - Vos's methodological hallmark: dogmatic categories are disciplined and informed by the unfolding canon.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed renderings of attributes, decree, and providence grounded in Scripture.
- As a **polemic** against Molinism and speculative schemes that separate divine knowledge from decree.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how biblical-theological reading shapes systematic categories and links doctrine of God to soteriology.
