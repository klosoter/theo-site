### TITLE
Holy Spirit Baptism (1972) - Anthony A. Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1972 amid the rapid spread of the charismatic renewal (1960s-70s) and intense Reformed evangelical engagement with Pentecostal claims. Hoekema writes from a Dutch Reformed / Christian Reformed perspective, aiming to pastorally and theologically correct popular charismatic excesses.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The principal claim is that **baptism with the Holy Spirit is not a distinct, post-conversion experience** producing miraculous signs as normative; rather it is the Spirit's act of incorporation (regeneration/union with Christ) given to believers at conversion. Charismatic claims to a second, sign-producing baptism are theologically unnecessary and exegetically weak.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of key texts (Acts 2, 8, 10, 19; 1 Corinthians 12-14; John 3; Romans 8; Galatians 3) showing the Spirit-baptism language ordinarily denotes entrance into the body of Christ and new-covenant regeneration.
 - Historical and confessional assessment showing Reformed tradition interprets Spirit-baptism as present at conversion and tied to sacraments/confessional language.
 - Critical appraisal of charismatic interpretations: distinguishes between genuine charismatic experiences and common psychological/spiritual phenomena; argues many charismatic claims rest on equivocal readings and poor theological categories.
 - Pastoral-theological implications: warns of ecclesial disorder when extraordinary claims are made normative and argues for sober, Scripture-grounded Christian life shaped by sanctification, not by pursuit of signs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages broadly with contemporary **Pentecostal/charismatic** proponents (the movement rather than single names), classical Reformed confessions and theologians, and biblical commentators; appeals to Scripture as final arbiter.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (central), soteriology (regeneration, justification), ecclesiology (unity/indwelling of the Spirit, body of Christ), sacramental theology (relation of Spirit to baptism), and aspects of revelation/authority for assessing claims.
- **Use of "Common Grace" and "Preparatory Grace":** Hoekema distinguishes the Spirit's non-saving restraining and enabling activity (common/preparatory grace) in the world from saving Spirit-baptism. He uses these categories to explain how God may work providentially toward conversion without endorsing charismatic paradigms of Spirit baptism.
- **Closing line:** Hoekema's theological center of gravity: **Spirit-baptism = the Spirit's sovereign work of incorporation and regeneration at conversion; charismatic second-baptism paradigms are biblically unsustained and ecclesiologically disruptive.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strongly ties Spirit-baptism to **union with Christ** and to the moment of true conversion rather than to later experiential markers.
 - Uses the pair **common/preparatory grace** to account for non-saving Spirit activity while guarding the uniqueness of saving Spirit baptism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Pentecostal/charismatic readings that posit a normative, subsequent "empowering" Spirit-baptism evidenced primarily by tongues and signs.
 - Contrasts with both an extreme cessationism that trivializes extraordinary gifts and with charismatic excess that elevates them to doctrinal norm.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies vocabulary by distinguishing **indwelling/regeneration** language from **empowerment/charismatic** language; insists on doctrinal precision when the same biblical terms are used in varying contexts.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical critiques of charismaticism; used in seminary classrooms as a compact, accessible Reformed pneumatology.
 - Less persuasive to charismatic theologians; continues to function as a standard conservative corrective rather than a dialogical bridge.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Crisp exegetical chapters on Acts and 1 Corinthians remain pedagogically useful.
 - Valuable for pastors and students requiring a theologically sober, confessional counterpoint to charismatic excess.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit baptism:** The Spirit's act of uniting believers to Christ, often contemporaneous with conversion/regeneration.
- **Regeneration:** Spiritual rebirth; Hoekema equates this closely with the normative effect of Spirit-baptism.
- **Union with Christ:** The theological locus of Spirit-baptism; entrance into the body of Christ.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive Spirit-work following regeneration, distinct from initial Spirit-baptism though inseparable in the believer's life.
- **Charismatic gifts / Sign gifts:** Miraculous manifestations (tongues, prophecy, healings); treated as historically conditioned and non-normative for establishing Spirit-baptism.
- **Cessationism (qualified):** Hoekema leans toward a restraining view of sign gifts' normative role, while carefully distinguishing doctrinal from pastoral claims.
- **Common grace:** God's general restraining and enabling activity toward creation and unbelievers; used to explain non-saving Spirit effects in history.
- **Preparatory grace:** Subset of common grace-God's providential work preparing hearts for the gospel without effecting saving conversion.
- **Sacramental relation:** How Spirit-baptism relates to water baptism and covenant signs in Reformed thought.
- **Ecclesial order:** Hoekema emphasizes sober worship and church discipline over experiential tests.
- **Biblical exegesis (model):** Close contextual reading of Acts and Pauline texts to determine the referent of Spirit-baptism in each passage.
- **Pastoral prudence:** A repeated practical criterion-guard against spiritual elitism and disorder caused by unchecked experiential claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the Reformed understanding that Spirit-baptism equals conversion/regeneration.
- As a **polemic** against charismatic readings that posit a separate second baptism evidenced by sign gifts.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading baptism-of-the-Spirit passages holistically (Acts + Paul) within covenantal theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking pneumatology with doctrines of common/preparatory grace to explain non-saving Spirit activity.
