### TITLE
Creation And The Sovereignty Of God - Hugh J. McCann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Placed in the modern/postwar Anglo‑American Reformed theological conversation addressing challenges from liberal theology, Barthian dialectical theology, and emerging process and open‑theist critiques of classical divine sovereignty.
 - Oriented toward systematic and apologetic concerns: reconstructing classical doctrines of creation and providence for contemporary philosophical and pastoral contexts.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - God's sovereignty and the created order are not opposed: true sovereignty is the gracious ordering and sustaining of contingent creatures rather than mechanistic determinism. The book aims to reconcile divine omnipotence with creaturely contingency, freedom, and moral responsibility.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful reading of Scripture on creation (Gen 1-2, Psalm 104, Colossians 1, John 1) to ground claims about divine agency and covenantal relation to creation.
 - Historical theology: survey of patristic, medieval, and Reformed accounts (Augustine, Calvin, Kuyper, Bavinck) to recover classical resources for a doctrine of creation that affirms both divine transcendence and immanence.
 - Philosophical clarification: analysis of key concepts (omnipotence, causation, contingency) and critique of alternatives (process theology, strong open theism, reductive naturalism).
 - Systematic synthesis: doctrine of sovereignty as providential ordering - distinctions among creation ex nihilo, preservation, concurrence, and governance; implications for theodicy, freedom, and eschatology.
 - Practical/pastoral implications: how a robust doctrine of creation and sovereignty shapes worship, ethics, stewardship, and hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed authorities: Calvin, Kuyper, Bavinck; moderns: Herman Bavinck, Cornelius Van Til (in theological family), possibly Barth (critique and engagement).
 - Contemporary critics: process theologians (Whiteheadian streams), open theists, analytic philosophers on free will and divine foreknowledge (Plantinga implicitly engaged).
 - Scripture as primary normative source throughout.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (creatio ex nihilo, creatio continua)
 - Divine sovereignty and providence (preservation, concurrence, governance)
 - Divine attributes (omnipotence, aseity, omniscience)
 - Anthropology (imago Dei, freedom/responsibility)
 - Theodicy and the problem of evil
 - Covenant theology and eschatological telos (relation of creation to redemption)

- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity**
 - God's sovereignty is best understood not as coercive determinism but as the divine, covenantal ordering and sustaining of a genuinely contingent creation toward its redeemed telos.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes **sovereignty as ordering and sustaining** rather than unilateral control; sovereignty is relational and purposive.
 - Strong insistence on **creatio ex nihilo** as metaphysical guarantee of creaturely contingency and divine dependence.
 - Reframes providence to highlight divine concurrence that preserves creaturely causal efficacy while securing providential aims.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on deterministic readings of classical theism (that collapse sovereignty into fatalism).
 - Critiques Barthian and radical dialectical accounts that risk minimizing creaturely reality by overemphasizing the Word at the expense of creation's ontological status.
 - Opposes process theology and open theism by defending classical omnipotence and foreknowledge while allowing genuine contingency.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The pragmatic use of the phrase **"sovereign ordering"** as a theological category to mediate between divine control and freedom (terminology aimed at pastoral clarity more than technical novelty).
 - Nuanced deployment of **concurrence** language to preserve both divine causality and secondary causation without reductionism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited selectively in Reformed academic circles as a clear statement reconciling classical sovereignty with modern concerns.
 - Used in curricula on doctrine of God and providence; influenced debates on providence vs. freedom in evangelical scholarship.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a compact, systematic defense of classical Reformed emphases on creation and God's lordship, useful for teaching providence, apologetics, and pastoral theology.
 - Models how historical theology and philosophical analysis can be brought to bear on contemporary theological problems.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation (creatio ex nihilo)** - God as origin of all being; basis for creaturely contingency and dependence.
- **Sovereignty** - Redefined as **ordering, sustaining, and governing**; not equivalent to determinism.
- **Providence** - Includes preservation, concurrence, and governance; the means by which sovereignty operates in history.
- **Concurrence** - Doctrine that divine causality cooperates with creaturely causation without obliterating it.
- **Primary/Secondary causality** - Distinction preserved to honor both divine agency and creaturely freedom.
- **Omnipotence** - Affirmed in classical sense but qualified by the claim that divine power is rightly exercised in covenantal ordering.
- **Contingency** - Creaturely contingency rooted in creatio ex nihilo; crucial to moral responsibility.
- **Theodicy** - Attempts to account for evil within a framework of sovereign ordering and redemptive telos.
- **Imago Dei** - Grounds human dignity and responsibility within the sovereignly ordered creation.
- **Covenantal creation** - Creation depicts relational, covenantal context rather than merely material substrate.
- **Divine concurrence** - Technical term used to navigate metaphysical cooperation between God and creatures.
- **Eschatological telos** - Creation is oriented toward redemption and consummation under God's sovereign rule.
- **Metaphysical dependence** - Emphasizes Creator/creature ontological asymmetry necessary for proper theism.
- **Providential governance** - Practical articulation of sovereignty in history, politics, and ethics.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for conservative/Reformed accounts of providence and creation.
 - As a **polemic** resource against process theology and forms of open theism that downplay divine control.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading biblical texts that link creation language to divine sovereignty and redemptive purpose.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of God, providence, and human responsibility in Reformed seminaries.
