### TITLE
Fencing the Table: Admission to the Lord's Supper in the Reformed Tradition (Ordained Servant, 2016) - James J. Cassidy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2016 in Ordained Servant (PCA-oriented ministerial journal). Engages contemporary pastoral controversies (open vs. closed communion, paedocommunion, guest communicants) within the broader Reformed and Presbyterian revival of confessional identity.
 - Situated in Reformed ecclesial practice, drawing on classical sources (Calvin, Westminster divines, Puritan catecheses) and recent pastoral dilemmas in denominational life.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Lord's Table should be "fenced" in a way faithful to Reformed covenant and sacramental theology: admission ought to protect the sacrament's integrity, the covenant community's boundaries, and pastoral care for souls, without collapsing into legalism or pietistic laxity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern practice has drifted toward overly permissive admission or confused application of paedocommunion; both undermine Reformed sacramental theology.
 - Theological foundation: sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant; worthy reception required by 1 Cor 11:27-29; the visible church and church discipline bear on admission.
 - Historical-theological survey: how Reformed norms have historically articulated fencing (examination, profession, elders' oversight).
 - Pastoral praxis: practical procedures for elders-public/private admonition, admission criteria, handling visitors and baptized children, pastoral teaching to prepare communicants.
 - Pastoral guardrails: balance between covenant inclusion (baptism's sign) and the necessity of personal faith/profession for partaking of the supper.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Classical Reformed authorities (implicit and explicit references to Calvin, Scottish practice, Westminster Standards, Puritan pastoral manuals).
 - Contemporary denominational practice and debates within Presbyterian circles; pastoral eldership literature.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology (Lord's Supper as sign/seal; efficacy and reception).
 - Covenant theology (covenant signs, household inclusion, children).
 - Ecclesiology (visible church, membership, eldership, discipline).
 - Pastoral theology and moral theology (examination, admonition, care of conscience).
 - Scripture engagement chiefly via 1 Corinthians 11 and covenantal texts.

- **Closing line**
 - Cassidy centers the work on a pastoral-confessional conviction: faithful fencing of the Table preserves sacramental integrity, honours covenant order, and safeguards souls.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral focus: fencing is primarily a shepherding exercise, not a mere juridical exclusion.
 - Balanced stress on both covenant inclusion (baptism) and personal faith/profession as conditions for partaking.
 - Practical attention to eldership procedures-how to implement fencing charitably and ecclesiologically.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both liberal "open communion" that ignores covenantal boundaries and rigid legalisms that convert inspection into a works-practice.
 - Opposes paedocommunion by insisting on the distinction between baptismal sign and worthy reception of the supper for covenant children who are not yet professing believers.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "fencing the table" explicitly as a pastoral-covenantal discipline rather than merely a disciplinary rule; emphasizes "fencing" as formative instruction as well as boundary-setting.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful within conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles as a concise pastoral-theological resource; cited by ministers and session-level materials debating communion practice.
 - Limited wider academic influence but practical traction in denominational polity discussions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, pastorally-oriented bridge between confessional theology and sessional practice; valuable for teaching elders, training pastors, and orienting congregational catechesis toward the Lord's Supper.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fencing the Table** - pastoral practice of setting conditions and preparatory instruction for admission to the Lord's Supper.
- **Closed communion** - restrictive admission based on visible membership/profession; Cassidy nuances rather than simply endorses.
- **Open communion** - unrestricted invitation to partake; treated as problematic when it negates covenantal and disciplinary norms.
- **Paedocommunion** - practice of admitting baptized children without personal profession; critiqued and generally rejected here.
- **Worthy reception** - biblical demand (1 Cor 11) requiring self-examination and repentance before partaking.
- **Sign and seal** - Reformed sacramental vocabulary: baptism and the supper as covenantal indicators; used to distinguish baptismal inclusion from supper participation.
- **Visible church / church membership** - ecclesiological categories determining corporate boundaries and eligibility for sacraments.
- **Examination** - pastoral practice (private and/or public) of assessing readiness for communion; recommended as a regular, compassionate duty of elders.
- **Elders' oversight** - governance function charged with both guarding the sacrament and pastoring communicants.
- **Covenant household** - framework for discussing children's place: baptism includes children in covenant promises but not automatically to the supper without profession.
- **Discipline / admonition** - corrective and formative measures associated with fencing; meant to restore, not merely punish.
- **Regulative Principle (implied use)** - governs worship and sacramental administration, informing the article's conservative liturgical ethos.
- **Sacramental integrity** - concern for preserving theological meaning and pastoral efficacy of the supper.

- How this work is used:
 - As a concise definition and pastoral guide within Reformed polity discussions about communion practice.
 - As a polemic resource against open communion and paedocommunion in denominational debates.
 - As a practical exegetical-pastoral model for sessions and ministerial training on implementing admission and examination.
