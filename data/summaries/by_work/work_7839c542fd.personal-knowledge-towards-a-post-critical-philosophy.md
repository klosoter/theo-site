### TITLE
Personal Knowledge: Towards A Post-Critical Philosophy (Michael Polanyi, 1958)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post‑World War II epistemological debate; reaction against logical positivism, strict empiricism, and reductive accounts of scientific method. Polanyi writes as a scientist/philosopher arguing for a revised epistemology that recognizes the personal dimension of knowing.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Knowledge is essentially personal and tacit; the ideal of detached, wholly objective knowing is a philosophical fiction. Epistemology must account for the non‑explicit, skillful, fiduciary components that make knowledge possible.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critique of the "objectivist" ideal: claims that detached verification and explicit rules cannot account for the actual practice of science and other knowing activities.
 - Positive account of personal knowledge: knowing involves a **personal commitment** and an active integration of subsidiary clues toward a focal awareness.
 - Explanation of tacit dimension: many components of knowing are inarticulate yet indispensable (e.g., skills, recognition, judgment).
 - Development of key concepts: **subsidiary vs focal awareness**, **indwelling**, **fiduciary frameworks**, **polycentricity** of standards.
 - Implications for objectivity: objectivity is reinterpreted as intersubjective reliability grounded in personal participation rather than impersonal detachment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicitly directed against logical positivists and verificationists (A. J. Ayer, Vienna Circle), Cartesian dualism, and naïve empiricism; anticipates and influences later thinkers in philosophy of science and epistemology (Kuhn, later commentators).
- **Doctrines treated or implicated:** Not a systematic theology, but strongly relevant to doctrines and loci including:
 - Revelation and the epistemology of faith (how one knows divine truth)
 - Authority and tradition (role of personal trust in transmitting knowledge)
 - Hermeneutics and sacramental practice (skillful indwelling; non‑propositional knowing)
 - Apologetics and the critique of scientism
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Knowledge is a personal, fiduciary act grounded in tacit, skillful integration; theological knowing must therefore be understood as committed, interpretive, and participatory rather than as the mere accumulation of detached propositions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Elevates **tacit knowledge** to the core of epistemology: what we know but cannot fully articulate supplies the basis for explicit claims.
 - Reframes objectivity as achieved through **personal, communal standards** (fiduciary commitments), not through impersonal rules.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects positivist insistence on explicit rules and verification as sufficient for knowledge.
 - Challenges Cartesian subject/object separation by showing knowing as an act of **indwelling** in the object of inquiry.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Subsidiary vs focal awareness** - knowledge depends on attending to subsidiary particulars while focusing on a tacitly held whole.
 - **Indwelling** - the knower internalizes aspects of the known; skillful incorporation of clues.
 - **Fiduciary framework** - the network of commitments and trust that undergirds inquiry.
 - **Polycentricity** - standards of judgment are multiple and coordinated rather than reducible to single procedures.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely appropriated across theological traditions as a corrective to scientism and to overly propositional models of faith.
 - Used in constructing an epistemology of revelation, authority, and tradition that honors non‑propositional dimensions of religious life.
 - Influential in interdisciplinary conversations (science‑religion, hermeneutics, pastoral theology).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a robust framework for integrating skill, tradition, and personal commitment into epistemology.
 - Serves as a pedagogical tool for teaching theological method, apologetics, and the limits of positivist criticism.
 - Encourages humility about the limits of explicit proof and invites attention to practice, formation, and community.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Personal knowledge:** Knowledge that involves the knower as an active, committed participant rather than as a detached observer.
- **Tacit knowledge:** Unarticulated, skill‑like components of knowing that are necessary for judgment and discovery.
- **Subsidiary awareness:** The background particulars or clues one attends to indirectly in order to focus on a whole.
- **Focal awareness:** The explicit object or aim of attention that is achieved by integrating subsidiary clues.
- **Indwelling:** The knower's assimilation or interiorization of elements of the known; a bodily/skillful appropriation.
- **Fiduciary framework:** The network of trust, commitments, and presuppositions that underlie and guide inquiry.
- **Post‑critical philosophy:** Polanyi's program to move beyond the "critical" (detached-skeptical) stance, recovering assent and commitment as epistemic virtues.
- **Polycentricity:** The idea that truth‑seeking is governed by multiple, coordinated centers of judgment rather than a single method.
- **Tacit integration:** The process by which subsidiary items cohere into a meaningful whole without full articulation.
- **Commitment / Passionate participation:** The affirmation that personal commitment is necessary for discovery and assessment.
- **Objectivity (reinterpreted):** Reliability grounded in communal practices and personal accountability rather than in impersonal neutrality.
- **Authority and tradition (as epistemic carriers):** Tradition and authoritative testimonies function via fiduciary trust and tacit knowing.
- **Heuristic imagination:** The creative, tacit faculty that guides hypothesis formation and discovery.
- **Skillful performance:** Knowing-as‑doing; exemplifies how competence embodies tacit knowledge.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for non‑propositional and tacit dimensions of knowledge in theological epistemology.
- As a **polemic** against scientism, positivism, and overly reductive models of revelation and authority.
- As an **exegetical and methodological model** for interpreting tradition, sacramental practice, and communal formation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting philosophy of science, hermeneutics, and theological method.
