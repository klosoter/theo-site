### TITLE
The Drama of Scripture: Finding Our Place in the Biblical Story - Craig G. Bartholomew (with Michael W. Goheen)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - First published 2004; arises within late-20th / early-21st century Reformed-evangelical, narrative-hermeneutical, and mission-focused movements.
 - Responds to fragmentation in theological education between biblical studies, systematic theology, and mission; conversant with redemptive-historical reading, canonical approaches, and missional ecclesiology.
 - Site usage: 1 reference here addresses **Vocation, Dominion, and the Cultural Mandate** as a key locus.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible is best read as one grand drama with Christ as its climax; Christians discover vocation by entering and advancing that drama in every sphere of life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents Scripture as a six-movement drama (schematic but pedagogically intentional):
 1. Creation - God establishes order, goodness, and human vocation.
 2. Fall - Disruption of creation and vocation by sin.
 3. Israel - Covenant-life and promise-shaping a people and place.
 4. Jesus - Climax: fulfillment, kingdom inauguration, and covenant fulfillment in Christ.
 5. Church - Missional people called to embody and extend Christ's reign.
 6. New Creation - Eschatological consummation and restored vocation.
 - Major moves:
 - Reconfigure hermeneutics from discrete proofs to a canonical, story-shaped reading.
 - Re-locate Christian life within the ongoing drama: vocation is participation in God's mission.
 - Re-assert the cultural/dominium mandate as part of redeemed vocation, not preeminently secular task.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages canonical critics and redemptive-historical proponents (e.g., Brevard Childs, N. T. Wright), evangelical mission theologians, and Reformed covenantal traditions.
 - Dialogues with pietistic privatization and secular/sacral dichotomies in modern theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (biblical unity and canon), covenant (promise/fulfillment framework), Christology (Jesus as drama's center), eschatology (new creation telos), creation and sin (origin and disruption of vocation), mission/ecclesiology (church as agent), image of God (human vocation and dominion).

- **Closing line**
 - Scripture is a single, Christ-centered drama that summons the church and Christian vocation to reclaim cultural stewardship and mission as integral episodes in God's restorative story.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Drama/theatre metaphor: Scripture as staged action into which readers are invited to act.
 - Holistic integration of mission, doctrine, and daily vocation - not merely piety or proclamation but cultural participation.
 - Strong canonical orientation: reading books in light of the whole narrative arc.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Pietistic inwardness that confines faith to private morality.
 - Secularized accounts that separate cultural work from Christian discipleship.
 - Systematic approaches that abstract doctrines from narrative context.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Six-movement schema as pedagogical tool.
 - "Entering the drama" language to describe vocation and mission.
 - Framing vocation as theatrical participation rather than mere duty or profession.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries, mission courses, and congregational teaching.
 - Influential in shaping missional ecclesiology and narrative preaching.
 - Critiques: sometimes viewed as schematic, under-specified on contested exegetical details, or insufficiently systematic on some doctrinal loci.

- **Enduring value**
 - Accessible, pedagogically powerful synthesis linking Bible, mission, and culture.
 - Durable resource for teaching biblical theology and reframing vocation as inherent to Christian identity.
