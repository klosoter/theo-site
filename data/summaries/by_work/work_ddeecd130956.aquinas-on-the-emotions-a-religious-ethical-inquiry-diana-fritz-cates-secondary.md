### TITLE
Aquinas on the Emotions: A Religious-Ethical Inquiry - Diana Fritz Cates (secondary study of **Thomas Aquinas**). 
Concise scholarly treatment linking Aquinas's moral psychology of the passions to theological themes of formation, grace, regeneration, and indwelling.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary secondary study situated within analytic and historical scholarship on medieval moral psychology; locates Aquinas in the Aristotelian-Augustinian scholastic tradition and in dialogue with modern ethical psychology.
 - Moves between close readings of Summa Theologiae and Scriptum super Sententiis and contemporary concerns about affective formation and spiritual regeneration.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Aquinas provides a coherent religious-ethical account of the emotions whereby passions are neither merely irrational impulses to be suppressed nor purely cognitive judgments, but integral components of moral agency transformed by habit, reason, and divine grace - especially via regeneration and the indwelling of the Spirit.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Description of Aquinas's taxonomy of appetites and passions (concupiscible/irascible; sensitive vs. rational appetites).
 - Analysis of how reason and will order passions through virtuous habituation (moral virtues) and through infused theological virtues (charity) effected by grace.
 - Examination of the spiritual-cum-psychological process: regeneration (interior renewal) enables indwelling (charity and the Spirit) which reorients affective structures (ordo amoris).
 - Normative implication: ethical formation must address affectivity, not only deliberation; pastoral practice must engage emotions as loci of sanctification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics), Augustine (affective theology), Thomas Aquinas (Summa, commentary traditions).
 - Secondary interlocutors: modern moral psychology, contemporary theologians on sanctification and spiritual formation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Moral psychology, virtue ethics, grace, charity, sanctification/regeneration, indwelling (presence of God/Spirit), will and intellect, habitus.

- **Closing line**
 - Cates reads Aquinas as offering an integrated model: affective life is morally and theologically formative - transformed, not eradicated, by regeneration and the indwelling life of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats passions as morally ambiguous powers: morally formative when rightly ordered, corrupted when disordered - emphasis on affective orientation (ordo amoris) as the decisive test of moral health.
 - Stresses the continuity between acquired virtues and infused virtues: human habituation prepares the affective ground that grace perfects.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters Stoic suppression and Cartesian affective/cognitive dichotomies by showing Aquinas's holistic integration of body, affect, intellect, and will.
 - Distinguishes Aquinas from purely Augustinian anti-psychologizing readings: Augustine supplies the theological center (sin, grace), but Aquinas supplies a systematic moral-psychological mechanism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Highlights practical deployment of medieval categories (concupiscible/irascible, habitus, infused charity) as analytic tools for modern affective ethics.
 - Frames regeneration and indwelling as dynamic reorientation of appetites rather than mere juridical status-change.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful corrective in contemporary theology and ethics that underestimates emotions; taken up in pastoral theology, virtue-ethics, and spiritual formation literature.
 - In Reformed contexts: valued as resource for thinking about sanctification and the Spirit's formative work, though some resist Aquinas's sacramental/infused-habit language.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a textured theological anthropology of emotion; durable for courses on virtue, moral psychology, and spiritual formation; a model for integrating classical virtue theory with Christian soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Passions (passiones)**: bodily movements or responses that incline the agent toward or away from perceived good or evil; morally ambivalent in Aquinas.
- **Concupiscible appetite**: desires for simple sensual goods (love, desire, pleasure, aversion).
- **Irascible appetite**: desires related to difficult goods and evils (hope, fear, daring, anger).
- **Appetitus (appetite)**: broader category including sensitive and rational appetites; bridge between body and will.
- **Habitus (habit)**: stable disposition that inclines toward action; subdivided into acquired (moral) and infused (theological) habits.
- **Infused virtues**: theological gifts (notably charity) given by grace that order the passions toward God.
- **Charity (caritas)**: the infused love that reorganizes affective priorities; central to indwelling and regeneration.
- **Ordo amoris (order of love)**: key evaluative concept - right ordering of loves underpins moral life.
- **Reason and will**: rational ordering faculties that govern passions; reason presents, will chooses and affirms.
- **Regeneration**: interior renewal by grace that transforms moral dispositions; not merely forensic but affective-psychological.
- **Indwelling**: presence of God/Spirit (and charity) in the soul that reconfigures appetites and virtues.
- **Moral formation/spiritual formation**: praxis of shaping passions via habit, sacrament, prayer, and community.
- **Disposition/operative grace**: grace that disposes and elevates natural capacities toward supernatural ends.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Thomistic accounts of passions and habitus in ethics and pastoral theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking virtue-ethics and soteriology: shows how regeneration/indwelling reshape affective structures.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Aquinas's texts on the emotions, useful for seminarians and scholars addressing sanctification and affective formation.
