### TITLE
Selected Sermons and Biblical Commentaries - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 13th-century scholasticism; Dominican preaching and university theology centered at Paris and Naples; synthesis of patristic exegesis, the Sentences commentary tradition, and Aristotelian philosophy filtered through Christian doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To interpret Scripture pastorally and doctrinally so that the faithful receive right belief and sanctifying grace; to show how Word, sacraments, and prayer operate within the ordered economy of salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:** sermons and commentaries typically proceed from:
 - literal exegesis of the text (sensus litteralis),
 - theological amplification (Trinity, Christology, grace),
 - moral application for Christian life (virtues, sacraments, prayer).
 - frequent use of scholastic distinctions (act/potency, cause types) to explain spiritual realities.
- **Major moves (typical):**
 - Establish the literal sense and authorial intent.
 - Bring in patristic testimonies and conciliar/Scriptural authority.
 - Apply metaphysical categories to theological questions (e.g., instrumentality of sacraments).
 - Prescribe pastoral remedies and moral exhortations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, Augustine (primary), Gregory, Ambrose, Peter Lombard, Aristotle (via translators/commentators), contemporary scholastics (implicit debate with Henry of Ghent and secular masters).
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, Trinity, Christology, Incarnation, Eucharist and other sacraments, grace (infused virtues, sanctifying grace), ecclesiology (ministerial priesthood), Holy Spirit (charisms), prayer, eschatology, moral theology.
- **Closing line:** Aquinas's sermons and commentaries construe Scripture as the normative basis for doctrinal teaching while embedding that teaching within a metaphysically ordered sacramental economy in which Word, sacrament, and prayer function as distinct but complementary means of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear articulation of **instrumental causality**: sacraments as real causes of grace (causa instrumentalis/causa principalis distinctions) and preaching/prayer as dispositional or instrumental causes rather than conferring sanctifying grace in themselves.
 - Balanced treatment of **charisms**: recognizes extraordinary gifts (miracles, prophecy) as real but not normative for established doctrine or ecclesial order.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves beyond purely allegorical readings of some patristic exegesis by insisting on the primacy of the literal sense for theological construction, then legitimately ascending to spiritual senses.
 - Contra later Protestant critiques, affirms sacramental efficacy tied to ordained ministry and objective signs (a corrective to purely subjective views of grace).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of Aristotelian causality to explain sacramental signs and effects (e.g., distinction between signum and res signata, efficacious sign).
 - Precise account of **ordinary** versus **extraordinary** operations of the Holy Spirit that anticipates later debates on continuationism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central for Roman Catholic sacramental theology and pastoral practice; served as a major point of reference and target for Reformation critique (esp. on Eucharistic presence and sacramental efficacy).
 - In modern debates, Aquinas is often appealed to by those arguing for a regulated place for charisms (allowing continuation but subordinating it to sacramental order).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of integrating exegesis, dogmatics, and pastoral application; durable resources for debates about **means of grace** (preaching, sacraments, prayer) and the proper ecclesial place of charismatic phenomena.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacramentum (sacrament):** visible sign instituted by Christ that confers grace; treated as efficacious sign.
- **Signum efficax (efficacious sign):** the sacrament as a sign that truly produces the reality it signifies (not mere symbol).
- **Ex opere operato:** classical scholastic formula for sacramental efficacy; Aquinas nuances it with the importance of proper disposition.
- **Causa instrumentalis / causa principalis:** distinction showing how ministers and rites serve as instruments of God's causality in distributing grace.
- **Infused virtues / sanctifying grace:** habitual gifts that make the soul pleasing to God; primary "ordinary" effects of sacraments.
- **Charismata (gifts of the Holy Spirit):**
 - **Ordinary gifts:** sanctifying grace, graces proper to sacraments and virtues.
 - **Extraordinary gifts:** prophecy, miracles - acknowledged but subordinated to ecclesial rule.
- **Preaching (verbum; sermo):** a ministerial instrument that instructs and disposes; moves hearts toward grace but is not itself a sacrament in the technical sense.
- **Prayer (oratio):** both communal and private prayer are instrumental in invoking and disposing to grace; linked to sacramental life.
- **Sensus litteralis / spiritualis:** methodological categories for reading Scripture (literal first, then allegorical/tropological/anagogical).
- **Magisterium & auctoritas:** appeal to Church authority and Fathers as hermeneutical guides.
- **Ministerial priesthood:** necessary for valid administration of sacraments and proper transmission of sacramental grace.
- **Ordinary vs extraordinary operations of the Holy Spirit:** framework applied to contemporary debates on continuationism vs cessationism.
- **Sacra doctrina:** theology as servant to pastoral preaching and doctrinal formation.
- **Signum / res signata:** distinction between the sacramental sign and the thing signified.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Thomistic sacramental theology (sacrament, instrumentality, efficacy).
- As a **polemic resource** in debates on Continuationism vs Cessationism: supports allowance for charisms while prioritizing sacramental order.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching and lectio: literal-to-spiritual method tied to pastoral ends.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking preaching, sacraments, and prayer as coordinated means of grace within ecclesial economy.
