### TITLE
Rethinking the Trinity and Religious Pluralism: An Augustinian Assessment (Keith E. Johnson, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2011 within contemporary debates in theology of religions; engages late 20th-early 21st century pluralist and inclusivist models (e.g., John Hick, Karl Rahner).
 - Situated in a broadly Augustinian and Reformed interpretive milieu with constructive retrieval of patristic resources to address modern pluralism.
- **Central thesis**
 - A classical Augustinian trinitarianism-understood as the God who is **intrinsically relational (Father, Son, Spirit)** and who discloses himself in the incarnate Word and Spirit-provides a stronger theological basis than pluralist or Rahnerian options for defending the uniqueness and particularity of Christian revelation and salvation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Maps contemporary positions in the theology of religions (exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism) and locates their primary theological defects.
 - Reconstructs an Augustinian doctrine of the Trinity emphasizing:
 - the ontological priority of relationality in God,
 - the inseparability of economic and immanent Trinity in the economy of revelation,
 - the primacy of incarnational disclosure (Christ) mediated by Spirit.
 - Shows how this trinitarian framework:
 - undermines the abstracted, anonymous-God models (e.g., Rahner) that allow easy pluralist equivalence;
 - secures particular Christian truth-claims without anti-religious triumphalism;
 - provides a coherent epistemology for how finite persons know God by participation in Word and Spirit.
 - Applies the framework to evaluate pluralist proposals and defends a qualified Christian particularity about salvation and revelation.
- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages John Hick, Karl Rahner, and broader pluralist/inclusivist literature; dialogues with Augustine (primary), classical patristic trinitarianism, and modern Reformed/evangelical responses (Barthian resonances are noted but Augustinian retrieval is primary).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent/economic relations, perichoresis), revelation (incarnation and mediating Word), Christology, Spirit and pneumatology, soteriology, epistemology of religious knowledge, ecclesiology (by implication).
- **Closing line**
 - Johnson's theological center: **true knowledge of God is grounded in the triune God's self-disclosure in Word and Spirit; once that trinitarian structure is recovered, religious pluralism's equalizing tendencies lose their theological footing.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers Augustine as corrective to modern pluralist theology rather than simply as historical exposition-uses Augustinian relational ontology as an epistemic criterion.
 - Treats the **ontological relationality of God** (persons-in-relation) as decisive for how revelation functions and how religious truth-claims are judged.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Opposes Rahner's "anonymous Christian" and Hick's pluralistic relativism by insisting that the Trinity's self-revelation in Christ cannot be abstracted into a neutral, universally accessible "ground of being."
 - Distinguishes his view from narrow exclusivism by stressing the Spirit's work in general revelation and prevenient grace-so the critique is theological, not merely polemical.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts the dialogue about religious pluralism into questions about **divine intra-relationality and disclosure** rather than merely comparative soteriology.
 - Emphasizes a hermeneutic of participation (knowing God by participation in Word/Spirit) that reframes religious encounter.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited within Reformed and evangelical circles as a scholarly, patristically informed alternative to pluralist models; discussed in systematic and historical-theological reviews of theology of religions.
 - Serves as a touchstone for subsequent work that seeks to bring classical trinitarianism to bear on pluralism debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for courses on trinitarian theology, theology of religions, and Augustine; it models how patristic retrieval can inform contemporary doctrinal controversies while keeping theological rigor and pastoral sensitivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (ontological relationality)** - God's being is constituted by persons-in-relation; this is epistemically decisive.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity** - stresses their continuity: God's self-disclosure (economic) cannot be severed from God's inner life (immanent) for soteriological claims.
- **Incarnation / Christocentrism** - the incarnate Word is the definitive locus of divine revelation and the measure for other religious claims.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit's mediating role)** - Spirit enables participation in the revealed Word; allows for genuine, though partial, knowledge of God outside explicit Christian confession.
- **Anonymous Christian (Rahner)** - critiqued as theologically insufficient because it abstracts Christ from the personhood of the triune God.
- **Religious pluralism (typology: exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism)** - Johnson maps and evaluates these categories against trinitarian criteria.
- **Participation / communion** - epistemic model: knowing God through participation in Word and Spirit rather than detached abstraction.
- **Perichoresis** - intra-trinitarian mutual indwelling used to explain relationality and revelation.
- **Augustinian retrieval** - method and resource; Augustine's theology is brought to bear as normative corrective.
- **Revelation as particular and universal** - revelation is uniquely Christ-centered yet the Spirit's work gives universal witness.
- **Epistemology of religious knowledge** - grounded in the triune God's self-giving, not in neutral metaphysics.
- **Divine missions (processions / missions)** - distinction used to explain how God's inner life is manifested in history.
- **Soteriological particularity** - defends particularity of salvation without doctrinal isolationism.
- **Doctrinal criterion** - the Trinity functions as the criterion for adjudicating religious truth-claims.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for trinitarian resources applied to theology of religions.
 - As a **polemic** against Rahnerian inclusivism and Hickian pluralism.
 - As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for courses on Augustine, trinitarianism, and systematic theology.
