### TITLE
Theological Dictionary - "Eschatology" (Karl Rahner)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Catholic theology; Rahner writes from a **transcendental-Thomist** perspective engaged with existential philosophy, patristic retrieval, and the theological ferment leading into and out of Vatican II.
 - Entry functions as a concise, systematic treatment within a theological reference work aimed at scholars and pastors.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Eschatology must be understood as the theological articulation of **the absolute future of God** breaking into human history: this future both judges and fulfills persons and the cosmos. It resolves tensions between individual immortality and cosmic consummation by reading them as two aspects of one eschatological horizon.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses two distorted emphases: an overly individualistic "personal immortality" and an overly cosmic, depersonalized "world-renewal" eschatology.
 - Argues for a unity of **individual and cosmic eschatology**:
 - Christ is the center: his death, resurrection, and parousia are the decisive interpretive key.
 - The future (consummation) is present in seeds: sacraments and grace are **anticipatory real presences** of the eschaton.
 - Judgment and mercy are not abstract metaphysics but divine self-determination addressing concrete persons and history.
 - Treats modalities: death, resurrection, general judgment, consummation of creation, and the intermediate state as interrelated moments of one drama.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Augustine and Aquinas (classical resources), engages modern critics: Bultmann (demythologizing), Barth (Christocentric corrective), and contemporary existential and phenomenological thought influencing method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Christology (eschatology founded in Christ)
 - Trinity (divine self-communication in time)
 - Anthropology and grace (human openness to the future)
 - Sacramentology (eschatological presence)
 - Resurrection, judgment, and cosmic renewal (creation)

- **Closing line**
 - Rahner's entry situates eschatology as the theological lens that makes sense of Christian existence: the future of God interprets present grace and history, binding individual destiny to cosmic consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Eschatology as intrinsically **transcendental**: the human subject's ultimate horizon is the divine future; eschatology is not merely doctrine about last events but the existential grammar of Christian faith.
 - Strong insistence on **sacramental anticipation**: liturgy and sacraments are real encounters with the future, not mere symbols pointing forward.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters a separated dualism that isolates personal immortality from the destiny of creation; opposes narrow demythologizing that strips eschatology of its future hope.
 - Modifies Barthian concentration on Christ by integrating a philosophical account of human openness and historical fulfillment.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of language such as **"eschatological presence"** and the future as an interpretive **horizon** that makes present realities intelligible.
 - Integration of existential categories with classical scholastic terms to reconceive "last things" for modern theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in post‑Conciliar Catholic theology, sacramental theology, and pastoral teaching; used as a model for integrating personal salvation and ecological/creation concerns.
 - Criticized by some conservatives for speculative inclusivism and by some Protestants for heavy metaphysical framing; nonetheless widely cited across confessional lines for its systematic clarity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable pedagogical and exegetical template for teaching eschatology that refuses compartmentalization and that links liturgy, Christology, anthropology, and cosmic hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatology**: theology of last things understood as the event of God's definitive future entering history.
- **Individual eschatology**: the destiny of the person (death, judgment, immortal life) interpreted within the wider eschatological horizon.
- **Cosmic eschatology**: the consummation and transfiguration of creation; not separable from personal destiny.
- **Already / Not-yet**: the tension between present sacramental possession of the eschaton and its future consummation.
- **Parousia**: Christ's definitive coming as the decisive eschatological event that binds individual and cosmic outcomes.
- **Resurrection**: bodily renewal as both personal vindication and sign of creation's transfiguration.
- **Judgment**: God's final act of self-determination toward persons and history, to be understood in relation to mercy and grace.
- **Eschatological presence**: the claim that sacraments and divine gifts are real anticipations of the final consummation.
- **Sacrament as anticipation**: liturgy mediates the future into present existence; a theological pivot between praxis and hope.
- **Transcendental openness / human horizon**: the philosophical-anthropological claim that humans are always oriented toward a future fulfillment in God.
- **Consummation (telos)**: the final ordering of things under Christ; the interpretive goal of revelation.
- **Apocalyptic vs. consummatory language**: Rahner balances apocalyptic imagery with metaphysical claims about fulfillment to avoid naive futurism.
- **Grace and freedom**: eschatology reads grace as the future act that actualizes human freedom toward God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for linking personal salvation and cosmic renewal in systematic theology courses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology and liturgical theology to argue that worship participates in the eschaton.
- As an **exegetical model** and polemic resource against both reductionist demythologizing and narrowly otherworldly piety.
