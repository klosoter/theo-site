### TITLE
The Advent of Jesus Christ: Sermons and Essays - John Murray 
20th-century Reformed sermons/essays collection; theological and homiletical treatment of Christ's coming and consummation. Emphases on biblical exegesis, covenantal framing, and the doctrine of the New Heavens and New Earth.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed milieu; Murray (1898-1975) writing as a conservative covenant theologian and seminary expositor.
 - Reaction against sensationalist, speculative eschatologies (especially dispensational premillennialism) and liberal minimizations of final hope.
 - Pastoral-sermonic shape: sermons intended for congregation formation as well as theological reflection for ministers and students.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The advent of Christ must be understood as the hinge of redemptive history: historically incarnate, presently operative in Spirit and Word, and finally consummatory at Parousia - which issues in resurrection, judgment, and the New Heavens and New Earth.
 - Theology must safeguard both the already (Christ's accomplished work) and the not-yet (final consummation).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical opening: careful treatment of key texts (Gospels, Pauline eschatology, Revelation, Isaiah) to define biblical categories of "coming" and "kingdom."
 - Theological synthesis: integrates Christology, covenant, and providence to account for present vocation and future hope.
 - Practical application: pastoral exhortation to holy living, patient endurance, and assured hope in final restoration.
 - Eschatological locus: argues for continuity of creation culminating in a renewed cosmos (New Heavens and New Earth) rather than destruction or mere spiritualized immortality.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Scripture and Reformed confessional tradition.
 - Secondary engagement: Calvinistic exegesis, earlier Reformed writers (e.g., Owen), and critique of contemporary dispensationalists and liberal theologians.
 - Use of pastoral homiletic resources to communicate doctrine to the church.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (two advents and their unity), Parousia, resurrection of the body, final judgment, New Heavens and New Earth, covenant fulfillment, sanctification, providence, hope.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - The advent of Christ orders Christian existence: truth grounded in history, hope oriented toward consummation, and life shaped by the promise of a renewed creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precision in distinguishing the multiple senses of "advent" (incarnation, present reign in Spirit/Word, final Parousia) while retaining their unity in Christ.
 - Strong covenantal hermeneutic linking promises to historical fulfillment and cosmic renewal.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Polemical corrective to dispensational literalism: rejects an isolated earthly millennium and a bifurcated people of God.
 - Corrects liberal or pietistic elisions that reduce eschatology to private immortality or moralism by reasserting corporate, cosmic consummation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "advent" as an ongoing redemptive axis rather than a one-off event; uses inaugurated-consummated language without novel neologisms, making the schema pastorally accessible.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries and pulpits for clear, sober eschatology; widely cited as a model of how to preach and teach eschatology without sensationalism.
 - Influenced subsequent conservative evangelical treatments of New Heavens and New Earth within covenant theology.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Model of exegetical restraint combined with doctrinal clarity and pastoral urgency; useful for courses in eschatology, homiletics, and systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Advent** - the coming(s) of Christ: incarnate, present (Spirit/Word), and final Parousia.
- **Parousia** - the final visible return of Christ that effects resurrection, judgment, and consummation.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - the interplay of "already" (Christ's work) and "not-yet" (final consummation).
- **New Heavens and New Earth** - Murray affirms covenantal continuity and qualitative renewal of creation (cf. Isaiah 65-66; Revelation 21), not annihilation or mere spiritualization.
 - Emphasis on moral and ontological transformation of creation into an ordered realm of righteousness and presence of God.
- **Resurrection of the body** - bodily continuity and transformation at Parousia; central to hope and ethics.
- **Final judgment** - corporate and individual reckoning that vindicates divine righteousness and culminates history.
- **Covenant fulfillment** - the advent as the consummation of covenant promises to elect people and creation.
- **Kingdom of God** - both present reality (reign of Christ) and future consummation; not reducible to social program or purely spiritual state.
- **Providence** - God's governance sustaining the "already" toward its consummation.
- **Hope** - eschatological assurance shaping holy living and endurance.
- **Sanctification** - ethical fruit of the advent and anticipation of consummation.
- **Typology** - use of Old Testament promises/events as foreshadowing the final renewal.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed eschatological categories (advent, inaugurated/consummated).
- As a **polemic** against dispensational literalism and speculative futurism.
- As an **exegetical-homiletic model** for preaching eschatology that integrates doctrine, pastoral care, and cosmic hope.
