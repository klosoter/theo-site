### TITLE
The Righteousness of God: A Lexical Examination of the Covenant-Faithfulness Interpretation - Lee Irons

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary contribution to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) debates; responds to lexical and exegetical claims advanced by Tom Wright, James D. G. Dunn, and related interpreters.
 - Methodologically oriented toward lexical semantics and LXX/Greek corpora studies rather than purely doctrinal polemic.
 - Situated within late 20th-early 21st century reappraisals of Pauline language about justification and covenant.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: many occurrences of the phrase **"the righteousness of God" (dikaiosyne theou)** in Pauline and intertestamental contexts are best understood as **God's covenantal faithfulness (fidelitas)**-a dynamic, covenantal action-rather than primarily a moral attribute or forensic status.
 - Problem addressed: lexical ambiguity has allowed divergent theological readings (forensic/ontological vs. covenantal/actional); Irons seeks lexical criteria to adjudicate meaning.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents a principled lexical-semantics method: establish semantic range via classical Greek, LXX, Hellenistic Jewish, and Pauline corpora; use syntagmatic and contextual cues to identify senses.
 - Tests the CFI (covenant-faithfulness interpretation) against empirical data:
 - Surveys occurrences of dikaiosyne and related forms in LXX and contemporaneous Greek authors.
 - Distinguishes uses that clearly denote relational/covenantal fidelity from uses denoting moral rectitude or judicial status.
 - Applies definitional and contextual criteria to Pauline passages (notably Romans 1-4, 3:21-26).
 - Evaluates rival readings (forensic/merit-based soteriology, moral attribute readings) and specifies where each remains plausible or inadequate.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages N. T. Wright and other advocates of CFI; dialogues with classical lexicography (BDAG), James Barr on semantics, and LXX studies.
 - Uses Septuagint examples, Philo, Josephus, and Greco-Roman authors for comparative semantic evidence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant faithfulness), justification, atonement, divine character (righteousness), Pauline soteriology, and ecclesial implications for justification discourse.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological center: **"Righteousness of God" is predominantly exegetically and theologically intelligible as God's covenantal faithfulness manifested in saving acts-yet careful lexical and contextual control tempers sweeping replacements of older forensic idioms.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous lexical methodology: combines corpus evidence, syntagmatic analysis, and discourse-pragmatic criteria rather than relying on theological presuppositions.
 - Prioritizes LXX and Jewish usage as mediating categories between classical Greek and Pauline koine.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects overly broad claims by some NPP proponents that dikaiosyne theou universally means "covenant faithfulness" in all contexts.
 - Challenges classical Reformation/Protestant readings that reduce the phrase to purely forensic justification without attention to covenantal action in the biblical idiom.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes criteria for identifying covenantal uses (lexical collocates, object/agent markers, ritual or covenant-language surroundings).
 - Distinguishes "righteousness-as-faithfulness" (actional, relational) from "righteousness-as-status" (forensic) and "righteousness-as-moral-attribute."

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited within exegetical and NPP discussions as a methodological corrective; used by scholars seeking a middle path between extremes.
 - Mixed uptake in confessional Reformed circles-valued for lexical rigor but sometimes viewed with suspicion for perceived doctrinal implications regarding forensic justification.

- **Enduring value**
 - A durable model for combining lexical semantics with theological exegesis; useful for teaching how word-study must interact with discourse and theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **dikaiosyne theou ("righteousness of God")**
 - Central phrase; Irons argues it often points to God's covenantal faithfulness rather than merely moral rectitude or juridical status.

- **Covenant-Faithfulness Interpretation (CFI)**
 - The proposal that dikaiosyne frequently denotes fidelitas Dei-God's faithfulness in covenantal saving acts.

- **Lexical semantics**
 - Methodological backbone: study of semantic range, collocation, and contextual meaning.

- **Septuagint (LXX) usage**
 - Crucial corpus for bridging Hebrew concepts and Greek terms; LXX examples frequently show relational/covenantal senses.

- **Syntagmatic criterion**
 - Method: meaning inferred from co-text and collocates (what words occur with dikaiosyne).

- **Forensic vs. actional senses**
 - Forensic/status: righteousness as declared status (legal justification).
 - Actional/faithfulness: righteousness as covenantal action or fidelity.

- **Pistis / faith/faithfulness**
 - Irons notes interplay between pistis (faith/faithfulness) and dikaiosyne in Pauline argumentation.

- **Fidelitas Dei**
 - Latin shorthand for covenant-faithfulness; used to connect Pauline theology to classical covenant language.

- **Semantic range**
 - The spectrum of meanings a lexical item can carry; central to Irons' analytic framework.

- **Discourse-pragmatic context**
 - Importance of larger rhetorical and covenantal contexts in fixing meaning.

- **Justification**
 - Treated as theological locus where lexical conclusions have major implications; Irons reframes justification language with covenantal parameters.

- **Exegetical calibration**
 - Practical technique: apply lexical criteria case-by-case rather than wholesale assumptions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for proponents of the CFI, supplying lexical justification.
- As a **polemic tool** against simplistic forensic or purely moral interpretations.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans and other Pauline texts with disciplined lexical-contextual methods.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in classroom debates-teaching methodologically cautious word-study that informs doctrinal conclusions.
