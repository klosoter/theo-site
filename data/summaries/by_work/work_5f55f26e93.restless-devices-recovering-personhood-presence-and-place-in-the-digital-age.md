### TITLE
Restless Devices: Recovering Personhood, Presence, and Place in the Digital Age - Felicia W. Song

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary digital-age theology addressing early 21st-century proliferation of smartphones, social media, ubiquitous computing, and algorithmic design.
 - Interdisciplinary conversation across theology, pastoral ministry, media studies, and ethics during the rise of concerns about attention, loneliness, and mediated sociality.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Digital technologies and design practices foster a diminished sense of embodied personhood, fractured presence, and dislocated sense of place; Christian theological resources (incarnation, Sabbath, sacraments, hospitality) are necessary to recover robust personhood, embodied presence, and situated place-making.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Maps how device design, attention economies, and platform architectures cultivate "restlessness"-an orientation away from sustained embodied relationships and places.
 - Theological retrieval: Recovers classical Christian doctrines (incarnation, creation, covenant, sacraments, Sabbath) as hermeneutical tools to critique and reorient digital life.
 - Practical formation: Proposes spiritual practices, liturgical reforms, and ecclesial habits (e.g., ritualized device use, embodied presence practices, place-anchored community patterns) to cultivate resistances to restless devices.
 - Design engagement: Argues for ethical and theological critique of device and platform design; invites Christian engagement with technology makers to shape humane defaults.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and medieval theologians (incarnational and sacramental tradition).
 - Contemporary critics of technology and attention (media theorists, social psychologists).
 - Pastoral and liturgical theologians concerned with embodiment and practice.
 - Likely engages broadly with philosophers of place and technology (e.g., phenomenology of presence).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology**: Personhood as embodied, relational, and vocational rather than disembodied informational self.
 - **Incarnation/Christology**: Central recourse to the Word made flesh as normative for presence and embodiment.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacramentality**: Church as a place-creating, embodied community that forms attention and practices.
 - **Sabbath and covenantal time**: Rhythms for resisting compulsive device-readiness.
 - **Ethics and creation**: Human flourishing within created places and material habits.

- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity**
 - Theologically coherent recovery of embodied personhood and situated presence-rooted in the incarnation and ecclesial practice-offers the primary resource for resisting the dispossession of self and place wrought by "restless devices."

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Frames devices as "restless" agents shaping attention, habit, and social ontology rather than neutral tools.
 - Centers "place" as theological category alongside personhood and presence, insisting on spatiality as formative for virtue and worship.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond binary techno-optimism/techno-pessimism by combining critique with constructive ecclesial practices.
 - Contrasts secular media critiques that emphasize policy or individual willpower by foregrounding sacramental and communal formation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Restless devices" as a coined diagnostic term linking design affordances to spiritual-pastoral outcomes.
 - "Presence practices" as a programmatic category for spiritual disciplines shaped specifically to counter mediated distraction.
 - Emphasis on "place-making" as a theological praxis connected to liturgy and neighborly hospitality.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in pastoral theology, congregational formation, and digital-ethics discussions.
 - Cited by theologians interested in embodiment, liturgy, and technology; influence growing where churches seek pastoral responses to digital culture.
 - Cross-disciplinary uptake in media ethics and design ethics conversations.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides an integrated model linking doctrine, critique, and practice-suitable for courses on theology and technology, pastoral care, and liturgical theology.
 - Provocative vocabulary and pastoral proposals make it a durable resource for curriculum and parish formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Restless devices**
 - Devices and platforms designed to perpetuate attention capture, interruptive notification, and constant connectivity; the primary diagnostic category.

- **Personhood (embodied)**
 - Human identity located in corporeal, relational existence; contrasted with informational/disembodied models of the self.

- **Presence (theological presence)**
 - Attentive, incarnational availability to God and neighbor; cultivated through liturgy, practices, and bodily habits.

- **Place (place-making)**
 - Material and social loci that shape moral and spiritual formation; church as formative place.

- **Incarnation as corrective**
 - Christology used to critique disembodied interaction; the Word becoming flesh as paradigm for presence and mediated engagement.

- **Sabbath rhythm**
 - Temporal practice resisting perpetual readiness and restoring attention to creation, neighbor, and God.

- **Sacramental practice**
 - Rituals and embodied rites that reorient the body and attention, countering the flattening effects of screens.

- **Attention economy**
 - The political-economic framework explaining why devices incentivize distraction and restlessness.

- **Hospitality**
 - Ecclesial ethic for place and person; counters transactional, performative online interactions.

- **Design ethics**
 - Normative critique and constructive engagement with how technologies are shaped and how Christians might influence design.

- **Presence practices**
 - Specific disciplines (device sabbaths, communal mealtimes, liturgical attention exercises) proposed to retrain attention.

- **Situated worship**
 - Theological insistence that worship is embodied, place-bound, and formative for social presence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "restless devices" and theological framing of attention-tech harms.
- As a **polemic** against unreflexive digital assimilation in pastoral and congregational life.
- As an **exegetical/practical model** for integrating liturgical and sacramental formation with digital-age practices.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and discussions linking Christian anthropology, ecclesiology, and technology ethics.
