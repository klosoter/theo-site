### TITLE
Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture (Graeme Goldsworthy, 2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published at the turn of the 21st century within the evangelical/biblical-theology renewal. Builds on post-war re-appraisals of biblical unity (mid-20th c. onward), the redemptive-historical movement in homiletics, and ongoing debates about the relation of Old and New Testaments in preaching.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The Bible must be preached as a single, Christ-centered revelation: the Old Testament is Christian Scripture when read and proclaimed in light of Christ and the gospel rather than as an independent moral or national manual.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Scripture is unified by God's one redemptive purpose; preaching should trace this unity rather than isolate texts. 
 - Christ (and the consummation of God's purposes in him) functions as the hermeneutical key for reading both Testaments. 
 - Preaching should be historically responsible yet typological and covenantal, showing promise-fulfillment patterns across the canon. 
 - Practical homiletical guidance for making OT texts speak to Christian congregations without collapsing historical distinctiveness or allegorizing.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Draws on the biblical-theology tradition (representative theological method rather than an engagement-heavy critical apparatus). 
 - Interacts implicitly with dispensational and moralistic or proof-text approaches to Scripture; dialogues with redemptive-historical homileticians and covenantal theologians more than with continental or critical theorists.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Christology:** central as interpretive key. 
 - **Covenant:** structure for reading promise and fulfillment. 
 - **Revelation/Scripture:** unity and authority of the canon. 
 - **Typology and promise-fulfillment:** hermeneutical tools. 
 - **Kingdom of God / redemptive history:** narrative frame for sermons.

- **Closing line:** 
 Goldsworthy's theological center of gravity: faithful preaching must treat the whole Bible as Christian Scripture by reading every text in the light of Christ and the one unfolding covenantal purpose of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence that the Old Testament is legitimately "Christian Scripture" when proclaimed Christocentrically, not as an optional or merely preparatory text. 
 - Bridges academic biblical theology with pastoral homiletics - a pragmatic handbook for pastors rooted in canonical theology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects moralistic/proof-text preaching that severs texts from the gospel. 
 - Opposes dispensational compartmentalization that treats OT and NT as disconnected economies. 
 - Distinct from purely historical-critical readings that stop at the original-world meaning and neglect Christological fulfillment.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Articulates a concise, pastorally usable formulation of "promise-fulfillment" as the preacher's organizing principle. 
 - Reframes typology as canonical, not merely rhetorical or allegorical.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely received in evangelical and Reformed homiletic circles as a key resource for redemptive-historical preaching. 
 - Influenced seminary curricula and preaching workshops; became a go-to for pastors seeking a Christ-centered hermeneutic. 
 - Prompted critique from those who press for stricter historical-critical restraint or who worry about over-Christologizing OT texts.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a clear, teachable method for preaching across the canon. 
 - Durable bridge between theology and homiletics: valuable for pastor-training, sermon preparation, and curriculum design.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christian Scripture:** the whole canon read and preached under the lordship of Christ. 
- **Christ-centered hermeneutic:** interpretive rule that locates Christ as the controlling meaning of Scripture. 
- **Promise-fulfillment pattern:** covenantal sequence where divine promises (esp. to Abraham, David) find fulfillment in Christ. 
- **Typology:** persons, institutions, events in the OT that are divinely intended foreshadows (types) fulfilled in Christ (antitype). 
 - Emphasized as canonical and covenantal rather than subjective allegory. 
- **Covenant theology:** structuring principle for biblical unity and God's single redemptive purpose. 
- **Redemptive-historical preaching:** sermons framed by God's historical acts culminating in Christ, not by abstract moralism. 
- **Kingdom of God:** the narrative horizon in which promise and fulfillment unfold; used as organizing theological motif. 
- **Canonical reading:** attention to the final form of Scripture and how canonical context shapes meaning. 
- **Continuity and fulfillment:** balances God's ongoing covenant purposes with their consummation in Christ. 
- **Hermeneutical grid:** the explicit set of theological commitments that guide reading and preaching (Christ, covenant, promise-fulfillment). 
- **Antitype/type language:** used to show how OT realities point to NT realities without erasing historical particularity. 
- **Preaching praxis:** practical steps and approaches for sermon construction that honor both historical meaning and Christological fulfillment. 
- **Authority of Scripture:** presupposed and reinforced as the foundation for preaching.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for Christ-centered, redemptive-historical preaching method. 
 - As an **exegetical model** in seminaries and sermon workshops for integrating OT texts into gospel proclamation. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over continuity/ discontinuity between Testaments and over typology in evangelical homiletics.
