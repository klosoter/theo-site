### TITLE
Contributions to Justified in Christ: God's Plan for Us in Justification (ed. K. Scott Oliphint) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (chapter on Adoption and Union with Christ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed evangelical theology. Published within a Festschrift/essay-collection engaging contemporary debates over justification (including responses to the New Perspective on Paul and intra-Reformed controversies). Gaffin writes from a conservative Reformed, Westminster-influenced milieu with strong emphasis on Pauline "union with Christ" themes.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Adoption is not a peripheral aftereffect of salvation but an essential, filial dimension rooted in believers' **union with Christ** and grounded in the objective, forensic work of Christ; justification and adoption are distinct but inseparable benefits of being "in Christ."
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scriptural exegesis of key Pauline texts (esp. Romans 8; Galatians 4; Ephesians 1) showing adoption language tied to union with Christ and the Spirit's witness.
 - Theological distinction: **justification** as declarative/legal status vs **adoption** as relational/filial status - both secured by Christ's person and work and applied by the Spirit.
 - Defense of the objective forensic character of justification while locating its relational consequences (adoption) in the communion-union with Christ.
 - Practical/eschatological point: adoption is present reality (positional) with consummation in final glorification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages Reformers (Calvin, Turretin), Princetonians (Warfield), contemporary Reformed authors; interacts implicitly/explicitly with proponents of the New Perspective and with views that subsume justification under covenant-membership or reduce adoption to moral change.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (forensic), Adoption (filial), Union with Christ (soteriology), Covenant of grace, Christology (person and work), Pneumatology (seal/agent of adoption), Sanctification (fruit/distinct but related), Eschatology (consummation of sonship).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Adoption for Gaffin is the filial fruit of union with Christ - a real present status and future consummation rooted in the objective, forensic accomplishment of Christ and applied by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **union with Christ** as the exegetical and theological key that unifies justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification.
 - Treats adoption as both legally grounded and existentially real - not merely a metaphorical consequence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects views that treat justification as purely forensic without adequate relational consequences.
 - Opposes reductions that make justification primarily a covenantal membership marker (e.g., certain readings associated with the New Perspective or with Federal Vision variants).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tight coupling of **forensic declaration + filial status** language: insists on a twofold grammar for salvation benefits - declarative/legal and relational/kinship - both anchored in "in Christ."
 - Emphasizes pneumatological mediation (Spirit as agent/seal of adoption) in continuity with objective justification.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Regarded in Reformed circles as a careful, theologically conservative integration of forensic justification with biblical union theology.
 - Influential as a corrective to accounts that either detach adoption from justification or that securitize adoption only as ethical transformation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to exegete Pauline texts responsibly while maintaining doctrinal distinctives.
 - Serves pastors and theologians wanting a coherent account that preserves both forensic and familial dimensions of salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ ("in Christ")** - the foundational reality through which all soteriological benefits (justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification) are given and understood.
- **Justification (forensic/objective)** - God's declarative acquittal of believers on the basis of Christ's righteousness; the legal ground for receiving adoption.
- **Adoption (filial/legal-relational)** - believers' reception into the family of God, a present status and future consummation, grounded in Christ and applied by the Spirit.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit as seal/agent)** - the Spirit who effects adoption, assures sonship, and testifies to believers' status.
- **Imputation (of Christ's righteousness)** - legal transfer constitutive for justification; distinguished from the relational bestowal of sonship.
- **Covenant of grace** - the covenantal framework that contextualizes union, justification, and adoption without collapsing forensic and relational categories.
- **Eschatological consummation** - adoption's final realization in glorification; adoption is both present-positional and future-complete.
- **Brotherhood / filial language** - emphasis on Christians as sons/daughters and brothers of Christ by virtue of union.
- **Objective vs subjective benefits** - Gaffin stresses objective accomplishment (Christ's work) and subjective appropriation (by union and Spirit), resisting reduction to merely subjective experience.
- **Forensic declaration vs relational status** - key analytic distinction to keep doctrinal categories distinct yet connected.
- **"In Christ" soteriology** - a hermeneutical principle for interpreting Pauline theology and adoption texts.
- **Sanctification (ethical fruit)** - distinct process and evidence of adoption but not identical to adoption's legal/relational status.
- **Seal/guarantee** - the Spirit as the present pledge of both justification's effect and adoption's assurance.
- **Legal standing vs familial standing** - helpful pair to summarize Gaffin's structural insistence.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for adoption that preserves both legal and familial categories.
 - As a **polemic resource** against accounts that dissociate justification from relational sonship (NPP/Federal Vision tendencies).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline "in Christ" and adoption passages that integrates Pneumatology and eschatology.
