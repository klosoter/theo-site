### TITLE
Should Christians Expect Miracles Today? - Wayne Grudem (journal essays/articles)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate amid the global charismatic renewal and its critics; Grudem writes from an evangelical/Reformed-heritage vantage seeking to engage both Pentecostal claims and Reformed objections.
 - Addressed to pastors, theologians, and lay leaders wrestling with pastoral practice, biblical interpretation, and ecclesial order.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - **Thesis:** Christians should expect God to work miraculously today; the New Testament presents miraculous (sign) gifts as continuing until Christ's return and as normative for the church, though subject to biblical testing and ecclesial order. 
 - **Problem:** Tension between charismatic claims (frequent, public gifts) and Reformed/cessationist insistence that sign gifts ceased with the apostolic era.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Exegetical case: careful reading of key NT texts (Acts, 1 Corinthians 12-14, Mark 16 traditions, John's and Paul's references to signs) arguing continuity of gifts rather than explicit cessation. 
 - Historical survey: evidence of miraculous activity beyond the apostolic era undermines an absolute cessationist claim. 
 - Theological rationale: gifts are given for proclamation, authentication, and edification of the church; nothing in the New Testament prescribes their termination prior to Christ's return. 
 - Pastoral theology: proposals for testing and regulating gifts in congregational life (Scriptural conformity, fruit, accountability, cessation of abuses).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Pentecostal and charismatic practitioners and testimonies as primary empirical interlocutors. 
 - Reformed/cessationist positions addressed broadly (historical cessationist arguments, common contemporary critics). 
 - Scriptural texts form primary sources; historical patristic and post-patristic examples cited.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Pneumatology** (gifts, operations of the Spirit) - central. 
 - **Revelation and authority** (relation of prophetic utterances/gifts to Scripture). 
 - **Ecclesiology** (role of gifts in worship and order). 
 - Secondary: soteriology (effects of testimony), Christology implicitly (authority of Christ in gifting).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - God continues to work miraculously for the church's building and witness; Christians may and should expect miracles, but always under the norm of Scripture and with tested, orderly pastoral practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Combines robust continuationist conviction with rigorous Reformed commitments to Scripture's primacy and pastoral safeguards. 
 - Frames continuation as a *normative expectation* (not mere possibility) while rejecting both fideistic excess and brittle skepticism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Challenges cessationist readings of texts like 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 and Hebrews' appeals; disputes historical claims that gifts universally ceased after the apostolic age. 
 - Distances itself from uncritical Pentecostalism by insisting on biblical tests and ecclesial oversight.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clear operational distinctions between *sign gifts* (miracles, healings, tongues), *edifying gifts* (prophecy for building up), and *ordinary means of grace* (Word and sacraments). 
 - Emphasizes *expectation language* as theological posture (we "should expect" rather than merely "may hope for").

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited among conservative evangelicals who are open to charismatic phenomena; provided a major reference-point for Reformed charismatics seeking theological integrity. 
 - Criticized by strict cessationists for perceived over-reading of the NT; praised by charismatics for careful scholarship and pastoral application.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a compact, exegetically informed, pastorally sensitive model for engaging charismatic-cessationist debates within Reformed and broader evangelical contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism:** Affirmation that Spirit-given miraculous gifts continue until Christ's return; Grudem's primary position. 
- **Cessationism:** Opposing view that sign gifts ceased with the apostolic age; Grudem critiques common cessationist arguments. 
- **Sign gifts:** Miracles, healings, tongues, and other extraordinary acts meant to authenticate the gospel. 
- **Edifying gifts:** Prophecy and similar gifts intended primarily to build up the church's faith and order. 
- **Ordinary means of grace:** Preaching, sacraments, and Scripture - distinct but not exclusive channels of God's activity. 
- **Testing the spirits:** Criteria (Scriptural conformity, Christ-centered content, moral fruit, accountability) for distinguishing genuine gifts from error or deception. 
- **Normative expectation:** Grudem's phraseology to indicate gifts are to be anticipated as part of New Testament church life. 
- **1 Corinthians 12-14 hermeneutic:** Central exegetical framework - emphasis on order, function, and continuity of gifts. 
- **Signs and wonders:** Language used to describe public miraculous confirmation of God's redemptive work. 
- **Experiential verification vs. scriptural norm:** Tension resolved by subordinating experience to Scripture while recognizing legitimate testimonial evidence. 
- **Pneumatological continuity:** Theological claim that the Spirit's gifting activity is continuous, not epochal. 
- **Pastoral safeguards:** Practical rules for congregational governance of gifts (evaluation, restraint, teaching). 
- **Authenticity markers:** Scriptural alignment, prophetic accuracy, ethical fruit, community discernment.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for conservative continuationist positions in systematic theology and pneumatology. 
 - As a **polemic** against Reformed cessationism in ecclesial debates. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians and Acts in gift-theology discussions. 
 - As a **pastoral resource** offering guardrails for churches encountering charismatic practice.
