### TITLE
**Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance** - Bruce A. Ware (2005)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 2005 amid intensified evangelical debates over **gender, church leadership, and the doctrine of the Trinity**. Tied to the broader complementarian movement and the emergent **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** controversy documented in the "Eternal Functional Subordination Debates."
 - Aimed at conservative evangelical and Reformed audiences seeking a Trinitarian warrant for male headship and church/family role distinctions.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Son is **ontologically equal** with the Father but eternally ordered in **functional authority and submission**; this intratrinitarian ordering is a legitimate and necessary theological foundation for complementarian gender roles.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Part I: Biblical exegesis - surveys NT language (Father-Son authority language, Pauline and Johannine texts) to show relational authority distinctions are grounded in Scripture.
 - Part II: Theological formulation - distinguishes **ontological equality** (essence) from **relational/functional order**, arguing that eternal relations of authority are compatible with Nicene-Trinitarian orthodoxy.
 - Part III: Historical and pastoral application - argues continuity with historic orthodox tradition and draws implications for ecclesial and familial roles.
 - Major moves:
 - Define and defend the conceptual distinction between nature (what the persons are) and role/authority (what the persons do).
 - Argue for the eternal character of relational ordering (not merely economic or incarnational).
 - Apply intratrinitarian ordering as a paradigm for male-female roles without implying ontological inferiority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary egalitarian critics (e.g., Kevin Giles and others who warn of subordinationism) and interlocutes with patristic and scholastic texts to claim theological continuity.
 - Uses NT exegesis, classical doctrinal statements (Nicene-Constantinopolitan formulae), and contemporary systematic categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (central), Christology (in relation to Son's role), revelation and Scripture (authority of texts used), and ecclesiology/ethics (gender roles as application).

- **Closing line**
 - Ware locates the work at the intersection of orthodoxy and practice: **eternal relational ordering within the Trinity is both theologically coherent and normatively relevant for complementarian teaching.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Forceful advocacy of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**: the Son eternally submits to the Father in **role** while remaining equal in **being** and **deity**.
 - Sharp analytic delimitation of **ontological equality vs. relational authority** as theological categories.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects views that limit Father-Son authority language to the economic Trinity (i.e., mere incarnation-related submission).
 - Contrasts with egalitarian critiques that allege any eternal subordination implies ontological inferiority or classical subordinationism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized contemporary evangelical use of "eternal functional subordination" as a hermeneutical and doctrinal pivot linking intratrinitarian relations to human social orders.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative evangelical and complementarian circles; widely cited in seminary teaching and policy statements supporting male headship.
 - Provoked sustained critique from egalitarian scholars and some historical-theological critics who argue EFS risks revisionist readings of patristic theology and Nicene commitments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, systematic exemplar of how confessional Trinitarian theology is mobilized for contemporary ethical and ecclesial debates.
 - Remains a primary source for understanding the theological case for EFS and its practical ramifications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - The claim that the Son eternally submits to the Father in role/authority while sharing equal divine essence.
- **Ontological equality** - Equality of being or essence among the three persons; Ware insists this remains intact.
- **Functional/relational order** - The ordering of roles/authority distinct from substance; central to Ware's argument.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history; Ware argues the relational order is not limited to this economic sphere.
- **Immanent Trinity** - The internal life of God; Ware affirms ordered relations here (eternal).
- **Subordinationism** - Historical charge/warning (ontological inferiority); Ware denies ontological subordination while endorsing functional ordering.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling; Ware treats it compatibly with ordered relations, not as antithetical.
- **Headship (kephale)** - Pauline term used by Ware to support relational authority paradigms applied to the family and church.
- **Nicene orthodoxy** - Standard against which Ware measures his proposals; he argues his account remains within its bounds.
- **Patristic witness** - Ware reads selected patristic texts as compatible with relational ordering; contested by critics.
- **Complementarianism** - The social/ethical program that Ware's Trinitarian thesis supports and helps justify.
- **Egalitarian critique** - Opposing body of interpretation emphasizing dangers of EFS; Ware engages these directly.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for EFS and the distinction between ontological equality and functional order.
 - As a **polemic** in ecclesial debates to defend complementarian policies.
 - As an **exegetical-model exemplar** for reading Father-Son language as indicative of eternal relational ordering.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology classes linking Trinitarian doctrine to ethical practice.
