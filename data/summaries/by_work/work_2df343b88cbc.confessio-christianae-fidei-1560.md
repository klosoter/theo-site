### TITLE
Confessio Christianae Fidei (1560) - Theodore Beza 
A concise Reformed confession by Theodore Beza articulating mid-16th-century Calvinist distinctives, intended for use in Geneva and among Reformed communities.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1560 in the wake of Calvinian reform in Geneva. Beza (Calvin's successor) writes within the mid-Reformation controversies: Catholic Counter-Reformation (Council of Trent), Lutheran/Reformed debates, and internal Protestant tensions (Antinomianism, adiaphora). The document functions as a clear statement of Reformed orthodoxy for churches and magistrates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To set forth a coherent Reformed Christian creed that defends sola scriptura, justification by faith, and God's sovereign decree while distinguishing true evangelical preaching from Roman and radical Protestant errors.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Affirmation of Scripture as sole rule of faith and practice. 
 - Trinitarian statement and classical Christology (two natures, one person) as basis for redemption. 
 - Soteriology: justification by faith alone, Christ's satisfaction and the imputation of righteousness, election and reprobation as divine decrees securing salvation and divine justice. 
 - Role of the law: conviction of sin, rule of life for the regenerate, and distinction between law and gospel (law prepares and condemns; gospel reveals Christ and grace). 
 - Sacraments and church order: two sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper) as means of grace; ecclesiastical discipline and proper relationship with civil magistrate. 
 - Pastoral and polemical moves to repel Roman sacramentalism, works-righteousness, and sectarian excesses.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (primary), John Calvin (immediate theological influence), polemical engagement with Trent/Catholic theology, comparison and contrast with Lutheran positions (notably on justification and sacraments), and responses to radical reform movements.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, Trinity, Christology, atonement (penal/judicial motifs emphasized), justification by faith, election and predestination, law vs. gospel, covenantal elements, sacraments, ecclesiology, magistrate-church relations.
- **Closing line:** A compact articulation of Reformed doctrinal center: Scripture-governed faith centered on Christ's imputed righteousness and God's sovereign decree, with the law properly subordinated to the gospel.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on divine sovereignty and predestination as explanatory keys to salvation history. 
 - Careful juridical language: emphasis on Christ's satisfaction, imputation, and forensic justification. 
 - Practical connection of doctrine to church discipline and civic order-the confession is both doctrinal and pragmatic.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Moves decisively beyond medieval sacramentalism of Trent, denying inherent salvific power apart from faith. 
 - Sharp contrast with Lutheran emphases where Reformed views claim clearer gulf between law and gospel and different sacramental theology. 
 - Pushback against antinomian tendencies by affirming ongoing moral use of the law for the regenerate.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Consolidates post-Calvin terminology on imputation, active/passive obedience of Christ, and covenantal framing that prefigures later Reformed systematic elaborations. 
 - Clarifies the law-gospel distinction as central to preaching and pastoral care.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used among Genevan and French Reformed churches; influential in Huguenot circles and in shaping later confessional Reformed statements. 
 - Contributed to disputes over predestination and polemics with both Catholic and Lutheran opponents; served as a touchstone for Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - A concise primary source for tracing post-Calvin Reformed emphases (election, imputation, law/gospel). 
 - Useful for teaching how theology shapes church order and pastoral practice in Reformation contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura:** Scripture as the sole infallible rule for faith and life; basis for all doctrinal claims. 
- **Justification by faith:** Forensic declaration of righteousness through faith alone in Christ's work. 
- **Imputation:** Christ's righteousness reckoned to believers; central to forensic soteriology. 
- **Predestination / Election:** God's eternal decree to save some (and pass over others), presented as sovereign and inscrutable. 
 - Often read as emphatically articulated in Beza's language. 
- **Reprobation:** The counterpart to election; a divine passing-over in justice. 
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** Christ's obedience in life (active) and suffering/death (passive) both necessary for atonement and imputation. 
- **Law and Gospel distinction:** 
 - **Law:** Reveals sin, convicts, and guides the regenerate. 
 - **Gospel:** Proclaims Christ's fulfillment and gives grace; the priority that saves. 
- **Covenant of Grace:** Framework (incipient here) for understanding Christ's mediatorial work and the church's vocation. 
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** Means of grace, signs and seals instituted by Christ; efficacy tied to faith, not ex opere operato. 
- **Perseverance of the Saints:** Assurance that true believers are kept by God to the end (implied within election and covenant schema). 
- **Ecclesiastical discipline:** Church governance and moral order as necessary corollaries of doctrinal fidelity. 
- **Magistrate-Church relation:** Cooperation with civil authorities for public religion and order; rejection of radical separation.
- **Atonement (penal-judicial motifs):** Emphasis on satisfaction and substitution as the ground of justification.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **confessional definition source** for Reformed doctrine in Geneva and Huguenot communities. 
- As a **polemic instrument** against Roman Catholic sacramentalism and Lutheran divergences. 
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for applying the law-gospel distinction in preaching and discipline.
