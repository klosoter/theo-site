### TITLE
Continuity and Discontinuity: Perspectives on the Relationship Between the Old and New Testaments (ed. John S. Feinberg, 1988)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th-century evangelical scholarship confronting polarized readings of the OT/NT relationship. Published amid renewed interest in covenant theology, rising critiques from dispensational scholarship, and the growth of redemptive-historical hermeneutics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The volume addresses whether and how the Old and New Testaments form a single theological-historical unity. It asks which elements of the OT remain normative for the church and which are fulfilled, transformed, or abrogated in Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:** A multi-author anthology that:
 - surveys hermeneutical principles for reading the OT in light of the NT;
 - examines covenantal structures (promise, law, oath) and their continuities/discontinuities;
 - treats specific loci such as law, worship/sacraments, kingdom, and ethics to show patterns of fulfillment and change;
 - draws Christological and canonical conclusions that make Christ the decisive interpretive key.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Dialogue with classic streams rather than single authors: covenant theology and its variants, dispensationalism, redemptive-historical approaches, and historic Protestant exegesis. Uses Scripture as primary source and engages patristic and Reformation typologies implicitly through exegetical work.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and canon, covenant (works/Grace), law (moral/ceremonial/civil distinctions), Christology (fulfillment and typology), soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments/ritual, eschatology, and anthropology (implications for sin and responsibility).
- **Closing line:** The contributors converge on a calibrated position: the OT and NT are one redemptive-historical continuum whose unity is centered on Christ, producing both substantive continuity in divine purpose and decisive discontinuity in covenantal administration and fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong use of Christ as the hermeneutical key: continuity is measured by Christ-centered promise; discontinuity follows from Christ's fulfillment and inaugurated eschatology.
 - Careful distinction between levels of continuity (theological purpose, moral ethic) and administrative discontinuity (ceremonial practice, covenantal form).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against wholesale dispensational severance of Testaments while also critiquing any simplistic "continuity-only" collapse that erases typological/eschatological transformation.
 - Corrects extremes that read the OT merely as an appendix or as identical law for the church without Christological re-interpretation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced deployment of typology and fulfillment language to categorize elements that are retained, transformed, or abrogated.
 - Emphasis on covenantal administration as a helpful analytic bracket distinguishing substance from form.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in evangelical and Reformed circles as a balanced resource; frequently cited in seminary courses on hermeneutics and biblical theology.
 - Served as a reference point for later work in redemptive-historical preaching and for constructive engagements between covenantal and dispensational camps.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a disciplined taxonomy for students wrestling with how law, promise, and practice relate across Testaments.
 - Useful as a corrective to both proof-texting and ahistorical readings of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuity:** Theological unity across covenants centered on God's single redemptive purpose; continuity of promise and ultimate ethical ends.
- **Discontinuity:** Administrative or covenantal change resulting from Christ's fulfillment; not mere rupture but transformative fulfillment.
- **Fulfillment:** NT realization and reinterpretation of OT promises, types, and institutions in Christ.
- **Typology:** OT persons/events/institutions as divinely ordained patterns that find their eschatological meaning in Christ.
- **Covenant (administration vs. substance):**
 - Administration: differing forms and rites (e.g., sacrificial system) that can change.
 - Substance: enduring promises and objectives of God's covenantal will.
- **Law (moral/ceremonial/civil):** Analytical distinctions to determine what remains normative (moral) and what is fulfilled or modified (ceremonial/civil).
- **Hermeneutical key (Christ-centered reading):** Principle that Christ and the NT interpret the meaning and application of OT texts.
- **Redemptive-historical reading:** Reading the Bible as a single unfolding story of redemption with developmental stages.
- **Eschatological inauguration:** The idea that Christ inaugurates the kingdom, causing both present continuity and future consummation.
- **Typological ethics:** How OT ethical patterns are re-applied or transformed in the NT community.
- **Canon as interpretive frame:** Use of the completed canon to read OT prophecy and law in light of Christ.
- **Dispensationalism (contrast):** A rival framework that largely emphasizes discontinuity between covenants and distinct economies.
- **Covenant theology (contrast):** A rival/overlapping framework emphasizing unity and continuity of covenant structures.
- **Anthropology: sin and free will:** The volume explores implications of covenantal shifts for responsibility and moral obligation - continuity of human culpability and need for grace persists despite covenantal form changes.
- **Soteriological continuity:** Salvation is one historical work of God; modalities and signs change.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Definition source and taxonomy for the continuity/discontinuity debate.
 - Exegetical model and teaching aid for Christ-centered OT interpretation and for discussions of sin, responsibility, and the moral law across covenants.
