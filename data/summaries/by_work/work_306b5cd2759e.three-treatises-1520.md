### TITLE
**Three Treatises (1520)** - Martin Luther 
Contains: *To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation*, *The Babylonian Captivity of the Church*, *The Freedom of a Christian*.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 1520 during the early Reformation; situated amid growing critique of papal abuses, scholastic theology, and late medieval sacramental practice. Aimed to press reform both ecclesiastically and politically.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A comprehensive call to reform: dismantle papal claims and clerical monopolies, reconfigure the sacraments around Gospel faith, and articulate Christian liberty rooted in justification by faith.
 - Epistemologically, insists that faith (analogia fidei) governs knowledge of God; rejects speculative natural analogies (analogia entis) that elevate human reason or nature to determine God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - *To the Christian Nobility*: Political-theological critique of papal privileges; exposes the "three walls" protecting the papacy and urges secular authorities and laity to act for reform.
 - *Babylonian Captivity*: Polemic against sacramental theology as practiced - reduces valid sacraments, rejects transubstantiation, condemns private mass and sacerdotal manipulation of sacraments.
 - *The Freedom of a Christian*: Theological and pastoral synthesis - paradox of Christian existence: a Christian is simultaneously *servus peccati* and *dominus iustitiae*; freedom of conscience and service in love through faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages papal curia, canon law, scholastic theologians (implicit critique of Thomistic and later scholastic methods), and uses Augustinian themes of grace and bondage. Indirectly contests Romanist reliance on natural theology (analogiai entis).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification by faith (soteriology), sacraments (baptism, Eucharist, penance), ecclesiology (papal authority, priesthood of all believers), Christian liberty and conscience, authority of Scripture vs. tradition.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Reform of church order and sacramental life grounded in the primacy of faith and the Gospel; ecclesial and political reform are consequent to the truth that Christians are justified and free by faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Priesthood of all believers** as practical and theological corrective to clericalism.
 - **Faith as the ruling hermeneutic** (analogia fidei) and criterion for doctrinal and sacramental validity.
 - **Paradoxical anthropology**: believer simultaneously justified/free and yet sinful/servile - freedom leads to loving service, not antinomianism.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to papal juridical claims (the "three walls") and to late medieval sacramental inflation; contrasts with scholastic reliance on natural reason to argue for God (analogia entis).
 - Challenges medieval notion that the Mass and sacramental rites are the engines of salvation independent of faith.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Sharp rhetorical framing (three treatises as a triptych: politics, sacraments, piety).
 - Re-framing of "freedom" as gospel-driven paradox rather than purely civic liberty.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate catalytic effect on German and broader Protestant reform movements; provided theological ammunition for ecclesial restructuring and sacramental debates.
 - Influenced later Protestant confessions' treatment of sacraments, justification, and ecclesiology; provoked sustained Catholic responses culminating in Counter-Reformation sacramental theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating doctrinal correction, ecclesial reform, and pastoral theology; remains a concise programmatic statement of core Lutheran commitments and a pivotal text in discussions of faith vs. reason.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola fide (justification by faith alone)** - central soteriological claim; faith unites sinner to Christ apart from works.
- **Priesthood of all believers** - denies sacerdotal monopoly; implies lay access to Word and sacraments.
- **Three walls** - rhetorical critique of papal legalism: (1) clergy above temporal authorities, (2) only pope interprets Scripture, (3) only pope convenes councils.
- **Sacraments (reduction and critique)** - argues for fewer valid sacraments and insists on faith as condition; attacks transubstantiation and private mass abuses.
- **Eucharist: sacramental union (consubstantiation language)** - rejects transubstantiation; insists on real presence in a manner tied to Christ's promise and faith.
- **Freedom of the Christian** - paradoxical formulation: "A Christian is the most free lord of all, and subject to none; a Christian is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to everyone."
- **Law and Gospel distinction** - practical hermeneutic: law condemns and drives to Gospel; Gospel alone reveals justification by faith.
- **Analogia fidei** - interpretive principle: Scripture and faith conform to themselves; theological claims must be subordinated to revealed Gospel.
 - Contrast: **Analogia entis** (rejected) - the idea that created being provides a reliable analogical knowledge of God; Luther resists speculative natural theology that claims knowledge of God independent of revelation.
- **Bondage of the will (anticipatory motif)** - not the later book of 1525, but present in rhetoric: human will bound without grace; reason cannot achieve salvation.
- **Ecclesial authority / conciliarity** - advocacy for councils and secular cooperation against papal absolutism.
- **Papalism / Roman Curia** - targeted institutional structures sustaining clericalism and sacramental abuses.
- **Pastoral pedagogy** - emphasis on preaching and catechesis as means of grace in the life of the believer.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for early Lutheran positions on sacraments, liberty, and priesthood of believers.
- As a **polemic model** for Protestant critique of papal authority and sacramental theology.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for integrating doctrine with parish practice (preaching, baptism, Eucharist).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over analogia entis vs. analogia fidei and the role of reason in theology.
