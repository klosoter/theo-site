### TITLE
Liturgical Theology: The Church as Worshiping Community - Simon Chan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century conversation (published 1998) amid liturgical renewal, sacramental recovery in evangelicalism, and ecumenical interest in worship as formative for doctrine.
 - Chan writes from an Anglican-evangelical perspective shaped by Asian church contexts and global ecumenical resources.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Worship is not merely an expression of prior doctrine or private piety; it is the primary locus where the church exists, knows God, and is formed into Christian identity. The task of "liturgical theology" is to read doctrine through the convivial, performative grammar of worship.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies what liturgical theology is and distinguishes it from a "theology of worship" and from purely historical or practical studies.
 - Argues for an integrated theology: worship informs doctrine (lex orandi -> lex credendi) and doctrine likewise shapes worship, but priority is given to the formative power of liturgical practice.
 - Develops theological categories via liturgical motifs: Trinity, Word and sacrament, sacral time/space, ecclesial formation, and mission.
 - Presents normative criteria for evaluating liturgical practices (biblical, historical, ecclesial, and pastoral).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws ecumenically on patristic and medieval sources, Reformation insights, Anglican liturgical tradition, and modern liturgical theologians (e.g., Schmemann, Rahner implicitly in sacramental themes).
 - Dialogues with contemporary evangelical skepticism toward ritual and sacramentality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology** (primary): the church as worshiping community.
 - **Sacramental theology**: Word and sacrament interplay, Eucharistic presence and formation.
 - **Trinity**: liturgy as Trinitarian encounter and doxological response.
 - **Revelation and Scripture**: the role of the Word in public worship.
 - **Sanctification/formation**: liturgy as means of grace shaping Christian dispositions.
 - **Authority and tradition**: liturgy as locus of ecclesial memory and teaching.

- **Closing line**
 - Liturgical theology reframes Christian identity: the church is shaped, authorized, and known primarily where it prays and celebrates, so theology must be done at the altar as well as the study.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that worship is formative rather than merely expressive; liturgy supplies theological categories by doing theology sacramentally and narratively.
 - Treats liturgy as communal, ecclesial memory that grounds mission and ethics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects an overly propositional or cognitive model of theology dominant in much evangelicalism by stressing embodied, ritual, and communal knowledge of God.
 - Counters ritualism or dry traditionalism by insisting liturgy must be theologically intelligible and pastorally formative.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies "liturgical theology" as a distinct discipline: systematic reflection undertaken from within and about liturgical practice.
 - Uses the phrase "church as worshiping community" to reorder loci of theology (worship first, then doctrine and mission).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Anglican seminaries as an accessible introduction to liturgical theology.
 - Served as a bridge for pastors and theologians uneasy with high-church language to take worship seriously as theological method.
 - Influential in ecumenical discussions about worship and formation, though not a programmatic scholarly watershed like Schmemann or Pannenburg.

- **Enduring value**
 - Practical and pedagogical clarity: useful for pastors, liturgists, and students for integrating worship and doctrine.
 - Provides a durable corrective to privatized, doctrinal-only theologies and resources for liturgical renewal that respect both tradition and pastoral context.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liturgical theology**
 - Theology that emerges from and interprets worship; reflective practice about liturgy as theological source.

- **Church as worshiping community**
 - Ecclesial identity centered in public prayer, sacraments, and corporate praise rather than private belief alone.

- **Lex orandi / lex credendi**
 - The dynamic relation: how we pray shapes what we believe; Chan emphasizes the formative direction.

- **Word and sacrament**
 - Interplay of proclaimed Word and enacted sacrament; both are central and mutually illuminating.

- **Sacramental imagination**
 - Habit of seeing material means and signs as vehicles of divine presence and formation.

- **Doxology**
 - Worship as primary response and orientation to God; theology framed as doxological knowledge.

- **Liturgical space/time**
 - Sacred architecture and calendar as carriers of memory and formation (sacramental time, sanctified space).

- **Ritual and formation**
 - Rituals as repeated practices that shape affections, habits, and communal identity.

- **Ecclesial memory**
 - Tradition preserved and re-presented in liturgy; liturgy as locus of doctrinal transmission.

- **Pastoral criteria for liturgy**
 - Chan's practical yardsticks: intelligibility, faithfulness, formative power, and pastoral suitability.

- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: supplies a working definition of liturgical theology for courses and syllabi.
 - As a **polemic**: used to challenge evangelical reductionism that sidelines sacraments and corporate worship.
 - As a **practical-ecclesial model**: adopted by pastors and liturgists for worship renewal and shaping congregational formation.
