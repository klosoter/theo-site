### TITLE
Last Things First: Unlocking Genesis 1-3 with the Christ of Eschatology - J. V. Fesko

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed biblical-theological work situated in 21st-century evangelical and confessional Reformed scholarship.
 - Responds to both liberal historical-critical readings of Genesis and non-federal or non-Christocentric treatments in some conservative circles.
- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1-3 is best read Christologically and eschatologically: the beginning is intelligible only when read toward its consummation in Christ (the "last things"), and Christ functions as the telos that unlocks the meaning of creation, covenant, fall, and promise.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Proposes a canonical-typological hermeneutic: Genesis is the seedbed for New Testament fulfillment, not an isolated ancient Near Eastern cosmogony.
 - Major moves:
 - Reconstructs Genesis 1-3 as covenantal and teleological, oriented toward Sabbath/temple and covenantal rule.
 - Treats Adam as federal head (covenant of works) whose failure is reversed in Christ (second/final Adam).
 - Shows New Testament texts (Paul, Hebrews, Revelation) read Genesis eschatologically and Christologically; argues we should follow that canonical reading.
 - Applies the eschatological telos to doctrines of imago Dei, original righteousness, and human vocation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with the Reformed tradition (Calvin, Murray, later covenant theologians) and contemporary biblical-theological interpreters.
 - Engages biblical witnesses (esp. Pauline and Johannine texts) and recent canonical/typological exegetes.
 - Offers corrections to popular secular ANE parallels, literary reductionisms, and anti-typological skepticism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, providence, imago Dei, covenant theology (covenant of works/inauguration), anthropology, sin/fall, Christology (Adam/Christ typology), eschatology (inaugurated and consummated), Sabbath/temple motif, soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - Reading Genesis 1-3 "from the end" - with Christ as the eschatological telos - reorients doctrine and preaching: creation, covenant, and fall are intelligible only in the light of Christ's consummating work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Pivots hermeneutics decisively toward the eschatological telos: Christ as interpretive key rather than merely the goal of later redemptive history.
 - Treats Genesis 1-3 not primarily as cosmology but as covenantal, sacerdotal, and messianic prologue to God's kingdom-work.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that separate Genesis from New Testament fulfillment or read Adam/Christ typology as optional metaphor.
 - Pushes back against readings that reduce Genesis to ANE myth parallels, asserting canonical distinctiveness and theological function.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The phrase and posture "Last Things First" as a hermeneutical principle: start interpretation with consummation.
 - Reinforces a "Christ of eschatology" concept - Christ not merely as redeemer but as the hermeneutical center for the beginning.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in confessional Reformed and conservative evangelical contexts for homiletical and seminary use.
 - Provokes critique from scholars who favor historical-critical emphasis or non-federal views of Adam; used as a foil in contemporary debates about Adam, covenant, and typology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Strong model for Christ-centered canonical exegesis of early Genesis.
 - Useful for pastors and teachers seeking to connect creation doctrine to Christology, covenant, and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological telos** - reading texts with the consummation (Christ and the new creation) as interpretive horizon.
- **Christotelic / Christ of eschatology** - the claim that Christ is the central end which gives meaning to the beginning.
- **Canonical-typological hermeneutic** - interpreting Old Testament texts as intentionally oriented to and fulfilled in Christ.
- **Covenant of works** - Adam as federal head under a covenantal command; failure and its theological consequences.
- **Federal headship / Adam-Christ typology** - Adam's representative failure contrasted with Christ's representative obedience and consummation.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - functional/relational and vocational account read in light of Christ's messianic rule.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - present-reality of Christ's kingdom with future consummation; Genesis is read with both aspects in view.
- **Original righteousness / paradisal order** - understood as covenantal blessing and priestly-kingly vocation.
- **Sabbath/temple motif** - Genesis framed by themes of divine rest and cosmic sanctuary anticipating Messianic rule.
- **Recapitulation** - theological motif: Christ as the one who sums up and reverses Adam's failure.
- **Canonical witness (NT reading of OT)** - method emphasizing how apostles and New Testament writers interpret Genesis.
- **Typology vs. allegory** - defends robust typology grounded in historical events and divine covenantal intention.
- **Use across loci**
 - Exegetical model: used as a template for Christ-centered readings of early Genesis in preaching and classroom exegesis.
 - Theological pivot: supplies a compact, canonical rationale for the covenant of works, imago Dei, and Adam-Christ typology in systematic theology.
 - Polemical tool: mobilized against non-federal Adam positions, certain evolutionary theologies, and purely critical-historical reconstructions.
