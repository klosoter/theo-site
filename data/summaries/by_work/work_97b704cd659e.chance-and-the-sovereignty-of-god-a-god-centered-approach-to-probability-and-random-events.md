### TITLE
Chance and the Sovereignty of God: A God-Centered Approach to Probability and Random Events - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed-analytic milieu. Intersects systematic theology, philosophy of religion, and foundations of probability theory; aimed at theologians and philosophically trained pastors concerned to reconcile biblical divine sovereignty with the language and practice of probability.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** **Probability and talk of "chance" are compatible with, and can be fruitfully subsumed under, divine sovereignty.** Apparent randomness does not imply a rival causal power; probabilistic descriptions reflect creaturely epistemic limitations and God-ordained distributions, not limits on God's control.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarifies technical distinctions in probability theory (frequentist, propensity, epistemic probability) and applies them to theological categories.
 - Argues that many uses of "chance" are **epistemic** (a marker of our ignorance or descriptive convenience) rather than metaphysical endorsement of indeterministic causation.
 - Shows how God can decree outcomes while allowing creaturely contingency and stochastic processes; probability statements are therefore often **God-centered descriptions** of lawful regularities he upholds.
 - Applies the framework to classical problems: divine foreknowledge, providence, theodicy, and doctrines of decree/election - reinterpreting them in probabilistic language without surrendering sovereignty.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** dialogues with contemporary philosophers of religion and philosophers of probability; engages Reformed theological tradition (sovereignty/providence), and interacts critically with positions that read chance as metaphysical indeterminism (including certain compatibilist/indeterminist treatments and some Molinist accounts).
- **Doctrines treated:** divine sovereignty and decree, providence, foreknowledge, election and reprobation, human freedom and contingency, theodicy (divine justice and the problem of evil), and the theological use of scientific/mathematical categories.
- **Closing line:** Poythress offers a **God-centered probabilistic hermeneutic**: probability and randomness are intelligible and usable within a robust doctrine of providence that preserves both divine control and genuine creaturely contingency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats probability primarily as a **theological-epistemic category** rather than a metaphysical rival to divine causality.
 - Stresses that God can ordain lawful stochastic systems - a middle path between hard determinism and metaphysical indeterminism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on readings that make "chance" an autonomous ontological power; corrects some popular uses of probability to avoid covert deism or a weakened providence.
 - Offers an alternative to Molinist reliance on counterfactuals of creaturely freedom by showing how probabilistic models can preserve divine sovereignty without committing to middle knowledge as ordinarily construed.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes common technical categories (epistemic vs ontic probability; stochastic laws as divinely sustained) into theological vocabulary, coining a practicable "God-centered approach" to probability.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed circles and by theologians working at the science-theology nexus; used in courses on providence, philosophy of religion, and theological method.
 - Draws interest from those seeking to integrate analytic philosophy of probability with historic doctrines of decree and providence.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A compact model for teaching how scientific categories (probability, randomness) may be reinterpreted theologically.
 - Useful corrective to both naive determinists and admirers of ontic chance; serves as a bridge between rigorous probability theory and confessional theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Probability (epistemic):** degree of belief or rational credence; often reflects human ignorance rather than metaphysical indeterminacy.
- **Probability (ontic/propensity):** tendency of a system to produce certain outcomes; Poythress allows propensities as lawful, God-ordained features.
- **Chance / randomness:** descriptive term for unpredictable events; primarily treated as a creaturely description within God's providential ordering.
- **Providence:** God's continuous governance; encompasses both deterministic regularities and lawful stochastic systems sustained by God.
- **Divine decree / sovereignty:** God's eternal ordination of all that comes to pass; construes decrees as consistent with probabilistic processes he authorizes.
- **Foreknowledge:** God's exhaustive knowledge of future outcomes; probabilistic descriptions do not limit divine foreknowledge.
- **Middle knowledge / Molinism:** the doctrine that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; Poythress is critical of making middle knowledge the primary solution, preferring a sovereignty-grounded account that uses probability as an interpretive tool.
 - Contrast: Molinism locates contingency in counterfactual certainties known by God; Poythress reframes contingency within divinely sustained chance.
- **Theodicy / divine justice:** addresses how probabilistic evil and suffering can be understood under a just, sovereign God without minimizing responsibility or the reality of evil.
- **Election and reprobation:** discussed under how decrees can entail statistical or probabilistic distributions of outcomes while preserving divine justice and purpose.
- **Freedom / contingency:** supports a compatibilist model where creaturely freedom and probabilistic events operate under divine governance.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: clarifying theological uses of technical probability terms for systematic treatment of providence.
- As a **polemic**: rebutting views that treat chance as a metaphysical rival to God (strong indeterminism, naive appeals to randomness).
- As an **exegetical model**: offering readings of biblical providence texts that accommodate apparent chance events.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching theodicy and foreknowledge: showing how probabilistic thinking can illuminate, not undermine, doctrines of decree and divine justice.
