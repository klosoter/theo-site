### TITLE
Covenant Theology - Sinclair B. Ferguson (New Dictionary of Theology, ed. Sinclair B. Ferguson & David F. Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical context; contribution to a confessional, interdisciplinary reference work intended for pastors, students, and theologians. Written amid renewed interest in classic Reformed covenant frameworks and ongoing debates with dispensationalism and various revisionist readings.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Covenant theology is the central structural principle for understanding Scripture and salvation history; it explicates how God orders creation, law, promise, and redemption through covenantal relations culminating in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Defines covenant as the primary biblical category by which God establishes relations with creatures (legal-relational, promissory, and redemptive dimensions).
 - Distinguishes major covenantal forms: *covenant of works* (pre-Fall, law-bound relationship with Adam), *covenant of grace* (post-Fall promise of salvation), with the intra-Trinitarian *covenant of redemption* often presupposed as the divine plan for Christ's obedience and atonement.
 - Argues for unity and continuity of the covenant of grace across redemptive history while allowing for typological and administrative changes (promise fulfilled in Christ; sacraments as signs/seals).
 - Applies covenantal categories to ecclesiology and sacramentology (covenant membership, infant baptism as sign of inclusion, sacraments as covenant seals).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Rooted in the Reformed confessional tradition - Calvin and the Westminster divines - with interaction (implicitly or explicitly) with Geerhardus Vos, B. B. Warfield, John Murray, and critics such as dispensationalists and some neo-orthodox reinterpretations of covenantal language.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (central), Christology (mediatorial work as covenant fulfillment), soteriology (imputation, promise-fulfillment), ecclesiology (covenant community), sacramentology (baptism, Lord's Supper), typology and hermeneutics (continuity/discontinuity).
- **Closing line:** Covenant theology, properly constrained by Scripture and confessional insight, provides the generative grammar for Reformed exposition: a unified, christocentric reading of redemptive history that anchors doctrine, worship, and pastoral practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses *unity* of the covenant of grace rather than a mere sequence of unrelated covenants; treats typological diversity as subordinate to one saving promise in Christ.
 - Highlights the pastoral and ecclesial implications - covenant language structures church life, discipline, and sacramental administration.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters dispensational fragmentation of redemptive history by insisting on a single covenantal strategy of redemption.
 - Corrects overly schematic or legalistic renditions of covenants that detach them from Christocentric promise and typology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not so much innovation as synthesis: Fergusonesque clarity in restating traditional Reformed covenant categories for a contemporary audience, emphasizing confessional coherence.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and preaching circles as a clear, compact account of covenant theology; influential in confessional renewal movements and in debates about baptism and covenant children.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a reliable, concise orientation to covenantal thinking - pedagogically strong for training pastors and students in the grammar of Reformed theology and the unity of Scripture around Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** The basic biblical category for God's binding relationships with creatures - legal, promissory, and relational dimensions emphasized.
- **Covenant of Works:** The pre-Fall arrangement with Adam characterized by law and life contingent on perfect obedience.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The post-Fall covenant promising salvation; single, overarching promise worked out in successive administrations and fulfilled in Christ.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Intra-Trinitarian pact or plan in which the Father, Son, and Spirit agree on the means of redemption (often presupposed as theological ground of the covenant of grace).
- **Federal Headship (Federalism):** The representative/typal principle (Adam and Christ as covenant heads) explaining imputation and corporate solidarity.
- **Typology / Promise-Fulfillment:** The hermeneutical method linking old covenant types and promises to their fulfillment in Christ.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity:** The balanced claim that the covenant of grace is continuous in substance but diverse in administration and sign.
- **Sign and Seal (Sacraments):** Baptism and the Lord's Supper function as visible signs and seals of covenant promises; baptism often argued as covenantal sign for infants in paedobaptist reading.
- **Ecclesial Covenant Membership:** The doctrine that covenant status structures church membership and pastoral practice (discipline, nurture of covenant children).
- **Christocentric Hermeneutic:** Reading all covenant forms and redemptive events in light of Christ's person and work.
- **Promise / Fulfillment:** The redemptive-historical axis: promises in earlier covenants find their telos in Christ.
- **Legal-Relational Structure:** Covenants are at once juridical (law, obligation) and relational (promise, fidelity).
- **Imputation:** Grounded in federal headship - Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness accounted to covenant parties.
- **Administration/Dispensation (intra-covenantal):** Varied external forms and rites that manifest the one covenant.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** of classic Reformed covenant categories for systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** tool against dispensational bifurcation and anti-confessional revisionism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for sacramentology and ecclesiology (useful in debates over infant baptism and covenant community).
