### TITLE
Canon and Covenant (Westminster Theological Journal, 1960) - Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1960 in WTJ amid mid-20th-century debates over biblical authority, canonical criticism, and covenant theology. Kline writes from conservative Reformed commitments while interacting with emerging canonical and form-critical scholarship (e.g., Gerhard von Rad, Brevard Childs) and longstanding Reformation concerns about Scripture vs. tradition.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The normative authority of the biblical canon must be grounded in the covenantal shape and purpose of God's self‑revelation; the canon is not merely a collection of texts but the authoritative record of covenant acts that define the corporate, covenantal identity and duty of God's people.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - The canon gains its normativity because it embodies and records covenant disclosure - God's historical acts and obligations - rather than by appeal to an external tradition as co‑equal source of authority.
 - Canonical form (arrangement, emphasis, boundaries) reflects covenantal categories and thus functions as the community's definitive guide to covenant faithfulness.
 - The community receives the canon as covenantal testament: texts bind corporate obedience by mediating stipulations, sanctions, and promises characteristic of covenant structure.
 - Consequently, interpretation and tradition must be accountable to the canonical witness shaped by covenant theology; extra‑canonical tradition may inform but not supplant canonical covenant norms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages broadly with debates between Protestant sola scriptura and Roman Catholic tradition; interacts implicitly with canonical critics (Childs, von Rad), and converses with Reformed covenantal heritage (Calvin, Westminster standards) while arguing against modes of interpretation that detach text from covenantal context.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture and revelation, covenant theology (structure and content), ecclesiology (community reception of canon), hermeneutics (normativity of canonical form), law and promise (as covenant elements).
- **Closing line:** The canon functions as the covenantal covenant-document of Israel and the church; its authority is intrinsic to its role as the divinely constituted record of covenantal obligation, promise, and identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats the canon primarily as a covenantal instrument - a legal-historical record that binds the community - rather than merely a literary corpus or theological anthology.
 - Stresses corporate, covenantal normativity: authority is communal and act-centered, not private or purely propositional.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against views that elevate ecclesiastical tradition to parity with Scripture, Kline insists tradition must be subordinate to the covenantal canon.
 - Differs from purely diachronic/form-critical approaches that abstract texts from covenantal function; he favors a synchronic, canonical reading that preserves covenant structure.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts "canon" in juridical-covenantal language (treaty/testament imagery) to show how canonical shape binds obligation.
 - Sharpens the link between canonical arrangement and covenantal categories (promise, stipulation, sanction).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among Reformed covenant theologians and conservative biblical theologians who sought a robust doctrine of Scripture tied to covenant history.
 - Contributed to subsequent discussions on canonical interpretation and to Kline's later, broader covenantal corpus (suzerainty-treaty emphases).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise polemical and constructive case for seeing canon as normative in covenantal terms - useful in courses on hermeneutics, covenant theology, and biblical theology.
 - Serves as a corrective to approaches that separate canonical form from covenantal content.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon:** The authoritative corpus of Scripture; here defined by its role as the covenantal record that binds the community.
- **Covenant:** Legal-historical relationship between God and people encompassing stipulation, promise, and sanction; the theological key to canonical normativity.
- **Normativity:** The source and grounding of binding authority; for Kline, rooted in covenantal self-disclosure in the canon.
- **Tradition:** Ecclesial transmission and interpretation; useful but subordinate to the covenant-shaped canon.
- **Canonical form:** The arrangement and final shaping of Scripture that reflects and enacts covenant categories and obligations.
- **Revelation:** God's self-disclosure in covenantal acts; not abstract propositions detached from covenant context.
- **Suzerainty-treaty imagery:** Legal model used to describe divine covenant obligations and canonical testament - stresses formal obligations and historical acts.
- **Communal reception:** The corporate appropriation of the canon as the covenant community's norma legis (norm of law).
- **Synchronic vs. diachronic reading:** Preference for reading the canon as a unified covenantal witness (synchronic) against fragmenting historical-critical tendencies (diachronic).
- **Binding testimony:** The idea that Scripture binds by reporting covenant obligations, not merely by asserting theological truths.
- **Stipulation/Promise/Sanction:** Covenant elements that the canon communicates and by which it exerts authority.
- **Interpretive accountability:** Tradition and private exegesis must be accountable to the covenantal meaning preserved in the canon.
- **Ecclesial identity:** The canon as formative of the people's corporate covenant identity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definition-source for grounding the authority of Scripture in covenantal history (doctrine of Scripture).
- As a polemical resource against ecclesial systems that relativize the canon to tradition (ecclesiology/authority debates).
- As an exegetical/conceptual pivot for canonical, covenantal biblical theology - shaping readings that preserve corporate covenantal categories.
