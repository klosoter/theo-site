### TITLE
Schleiermacher, Friedrich. The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube). Edited and translated H.R. Mackintosh & J.S. Stewart. Systematic theology reoriented around religious consciousness (1821-22; Eng. ed. Mackintosh & Stewart).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German theology: post-Kantian critical philosophy, Romanticism, reaction to Enlightenment rationalism, Lutheran Pietism and emerging modern biblical criticism.
 - Schleiermacher writes to reconstruct dogmatics after Kantian critiques of metaphysics, aiming to secure theology on experiential foundations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must begin with the descriptive analysis of **religious self-consciousness**, specifically the feeling of absolute dependence, rather than metaphysical proofs or external propositions.
 - Doctrinal formulations (God, Christ, Spirit, revelation, Scripture) are systematic articulations of gradients within that original religious consciousness and its historical manifestation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Begins with the nature and capacity of religious feeling (faculty and moments).
 - Develops doctrine of God as the object of the feeling; then the doctrine of redemption centered on Christ and the Spirit.
 - Treats revelation as God's self-manifestation in historical consciousness, culminating in Jesus and embodied in the church and its sacraments.
 - Moves from subjective grounding to objective ecclesial expressions (Scripture, sacraments, ministry).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with Kant (critique of metaphysics), Hegel (historicism and dialectic), Lutheran orthodoxy and Pietism, Enlightenment deists, and emerging critical biblical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, God, Christology, Spirit, redemption/atonement, ecclesiology, sacraments, Scripture, and implicitly the biblical covenants as historical stages of revelation.
 - Covenant material is assimilated to stages in the unfolding of divine-human religious consciousness (e.g., promise, law, kingdom, new covenant realized in Christ and church).
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher relocates Christian doctrine as systematic reflection on the life of religious feeling and its historical manifestations, making theology empirically anchored in consciousness and ecclesial existence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology grounded in immediate **religious feeling** (Gefuhl), especially the feeling of absolute dependence, rather than metaphysical speculation or purely ethical categories.
 - Priority given to experience and community over propositional certainties.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rejects classical metaphysical proofs for God and the juridical models of atonement dominant in Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Contrasts with covenantal/legal emphases by reading covenants as stages in relational consciousness rather than primarily juridical commitments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts revelation as **God manifesting in the consciousness** of humans historically, and dogma as the science of that faith rather than static metaphysics.
 - Trinitarian language reframed to express threefold modes of God's revelation: immediate consciousness, incarnate life (Christ), and communal spiritual life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for liberal Protestant theology, modern biblical theology, and pastoral theology; widely influential in 19th-century curricula.
 - Strongly critiqued by later neo-orthodox figures (e.g., Barth) for subjectivism and undermining objective revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model for theological method that integrates experience, history, and community.
 - Useful corrective to purely propositional or purely confessional readings of covenant theology by emphasizing lived relationality.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religious feeling (Gefuhl)**: the fundamental faculty; primarily the feeling of absolute dependence as the root datum for theology.
- **Self-consciousness of dependence**: the concrete human awareness that grounds knowledge of God.
- **Revelation (Offenbarung)**: God's self-manifestation in human religious consciousness and history; not merely propositional transmission.
- **Christ as paradigmatic revelation**: Jesus as the highest realization of God-human consciousness; center of redemption history.
- **Holy Spirit**: the communal, continuative presence that forms the church and sustains new religious life.
- **Scripture**: witness and record of revelation; authoritative as the church's testimonial embodiment, not as metaphysical proof-text.
- **Dogma as science of faith**: systematic description of the living content of faith grounded in experience.
- **Atonement/redemption**: described psychically/relationally as restoration of religious capacities and reconciliation with God, rather than primarily juridical substitution.
- **Church and sacraments**: the social and ritual embodiment of the revelation; means by which communal religious life is enacted.
- **Covenant(s)**: treated as biblical articulations of stages in the divine-human relation - promise, law, kingship, fulfillment/new covenant in Christ - interpreted through the lens of religious consciousness.
 - Covenant language is descriptive of relational modes rather than primarily legal-contractual formulations.
- **Immediate vs. mediated revelation**: distinction between direct God-consciousness and its historical/mediated forms (Jesus, Scripture, church).

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: as a methodological exemplar for theology grounded in religious experience and consciousness.
 - Polemic: to critique metaphysical or juridical accounts of doctrine (Trinity, atonement, covenant).
 - Exegetical/modeling role: informs readings of biblical covenants as stages in the history of revelation rather than static legal arrangements.
