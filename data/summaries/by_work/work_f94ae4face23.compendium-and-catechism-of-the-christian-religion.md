### TITLE
**Compendium and Catechism of the Christian Religion - Francis Turretin**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism centered in Geneva; Turretin (1623-1687) wrote amid post-Reform controversies (Amyraldian hypothetical universalism, Socinianism, Arminianism) and the consolidation of confessional orthodoxy. The Compendium functions as a concise catechetical distillation of his larger Institutio theologiae elencticae for classroom and parish instruction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to present a compact, disputationally sharpened statement of classical Reformed doctrine that is both pedagogical and polemical - defending particular redemption, divine sovereignty, and covenant order against contemporary errors while grounding pastoral catechesis in rigorous theological categories.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Systematic loci arranged for instruction: Scripture and revelation; God and the Trinity; creation, providence, and angels; sin and fall; Christology (person and work); covenant and law; justification and sanctification; sacraments; church and ministry; eschatology.
 - Q&A and aphoristic definitions followed by brief proofs and antitheses (common scholastic method): thesis, scriptural proof, objections answered.
 - Emphasis on the order of redemption (ordo salutis) and the application of redemption by the Spirit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Reformed authorities: Calvin, Beza, the Genevan tradition.
 - Contemporary opponents: Moses Amyraut (Amyraldianism), Socinians, Arminians; Roman Catholic and Lutheran positions are addressed in polemical sketches.
 - Scholastic tools and logico-exegetical method drawn from late medieval and Protestant scholasticism.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and Scripture authority; covenant theology (federalism); Trinity and persons; classical Chalcedonian Christology (two natures, one person); original sin and total depravity; particular election and limited atonement; penal substitutionary atonement; justification by imputed righteousness; sanctification and the Spirit's internal work; sacraments as signs and seals; church offices and discipline; particular eschatology (resurrection, judgment, consummation).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** a compact, forensic, and covenantal Reformed synthesis that defends divine sovereignty and the particularity of redemption while training pastors and laity in precise doctrinal distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous distinction between covenant of redemption (eternal pact in God) and covenant of works/ grace - used to structure soteriology and covenantal continuity/discontinuity.
 - Sharp insistence on penal substitution and particular atonement as normative Reformed formulations.
 - Methodical use of scholastic distinctions (actus/essentia, decretive will vs. preceptive will) to secure doctrinal clarity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Polemically corrects Amyraldian tendency toward hypothetical universalism by re-asserting particular election and definite atonement.
 - Opposes Socinian denials of original sin, satisfaction, and orthodox Christology with concise exegetical proofs.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precision in defining "imputation" and "federal headship" within catechetical form, making technical scholastic terms accessible for instruction.
 - Clear delineation of the Spirit's internal application of redemption (regeneration, sanctification, assurance) while retaining classical pneumatology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in orthodox Reformed academies and Presbyterian training (18th-19th centuries); used as a reliable manual of confessional orthodoxy.
 - Regained attention in modern Reformed retrievals for its clarity on covenant and atonement debates.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact doctrinal handbook: reliable for defining loci, teaching catechesis, and adjudicating confessional controversies. Useful as a bridge between scholastic method and confessional pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Redemption:** eternal pact within the Trinity ordering Christ's mediatorial work; grounds federal theology.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** distinction used to explain law, promise, and the role of Christ as federal head.
- **Particular Election / Limited Atonement:** Reformed claim that Christ's satisfaction secures the elect effectively; central to Turretin's soteriology.
- **Penal Substitution:** Christ's obedience and suffering as legal satisfaction for sin; forensic emphasis in justification.
- **Imputation:** forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers and Adam's guilt to humanity; precisely defined for catechesis.
- **Ordo Salutis:** ordered application of redemption by the Spirit - calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification.
 - Related: the Spirit's role in illumination and assurance - connects to pneumatological studies such as The Spirit In Redemptive History.
- **Accommodation:** doctrine that God condescends in revelation to human capacities; Turretin applies this to Scripture and incarnational language (see Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy).
- **Two Natures / One Person (Christology):** Chalcedonian formula as exegetical and polemical anchor against Nestorianism and Socinianism.
- **Sacraments as Signs and Seals:** covenantal tokens that confirm promise and effective use by the Spirit.
- **Authority of Scripture:** sola Scriptura as criterion against Roman and rationalist claims.
- **Divine Decree (eternal election):** absolute and efficacious will of God in salvation.
- **Eschatological consummation:** bodily resurrection, final judgment, and new creation - shapes pastoral views on culture and the world (relates to Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective).
- **Regeneration / Effectual Calling:** operation of the Spirit applied to the elect, distinguishing external call and internal work.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise definitional source for Reformed confessional loci (systematic theology classrooms).
 - As a polemic model and apologetic resource against Amyraldian, Socinian, and Arminian positions.
 - As an exegetical-pedagogical model for catechesis that links scholastic precision to pastoral formation, including applications in pneumatology and doctrines of revelation (see the three cited topical studies).
