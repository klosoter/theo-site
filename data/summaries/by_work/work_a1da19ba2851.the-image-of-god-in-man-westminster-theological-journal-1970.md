### TITLE
The Image of God in Man - Anthony A. Hoekema (Westminster Theological Journal, 1970)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 1970 amid renewed evangelical interest in biblical anthropology and the imago Dei.
 - Situated in a Reformed theological milieu attentive to Scripture, historical theology, and pastoral concerns about human nature.
 - Engages a contemporary debate within evangelical scholarship over **trichotomy vs dichotomy** of human composition.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Hoekema defends a **dichotomous** account of human composition (body + immaterial aspect) and a relational/functional understanding of the imago Dei, rejecting trichotomy as biblically and theologically unnecessary and harmful to a coherent doctrine of the person.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of key biblical texts appealed to by trichotomy proponents (notably 1 Thess 5:23; Hebrews and Pauline usage of "soul" and "spirit") and demonstration that these do not compel a three-part anthropology.
 - Exegetical case for the **unity of the person**: Scripture treats human beings as single persons whose life and identity overlap bodily and immaterial dimensions.
 - Positive proposal about the imago Dei: it is primarily **functional/relational** (rationality, volition, moral capacity, dominion, relationality to God), not a separable substantial thing residing in a "spirit" distinct from soul.
 - Theological implications: preserves Christian convictions about incarnation, resurrection, sanctification, and the communion of persons with God - all better accounted for by dichotomy and a non‑substantialist image.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interaction with historical voices (church fathers and Reformers) and modern proponents of trichotomy; close attention to biblical language (Hebrew/Greek terms psyche, pneuma, sarx) and canonical witness.
 - Draws on systematic theological resources in anthropology, Christology (Christ as true image), pneumatology, and eschatology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (central), with implications for **Christology** (Christ as perfect image), **pneumatology** (role of Spirit in sanctification and relation to "spirit" language), **soteriology** (regeneration of the whole person), and **eschatology** (bodily resurrection and continuity).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The imago Dei is best understood as the whole human person's God‑ordained relational and functional likeness to God; biblical and theological coherence favors dichotomy and a holistic anthropology over trichotomy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong insistence that the "image" language functions in relational and vocational registers (responsible dominion, moral and rational capacities) rather than as a metaphysical substratum.
 - Emphasizes pastoral and ecclesial stakes: how anthropology affects views of salvation, sanctification, death, and resurrection.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects trichotomists by showing that isolated proofs (e.g., 1 Thess 5:23) are exegetically overstated; contrasts with substantive or Platonic residuum readings of the soul/spirit.
 - Pushes back on reductionistic monistic or purely materialist accounts by upholding an immaterial but not tripartite locus of personal identity.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies the distinction between **substantive** and **functional** accounts of the imago and adopts a nuanced functional-relational thesis while retaining a realist sense of human immateriality.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a concise, rigorous Reformed contribution to mid‑20th century discussions; used by seminary teachers and scholars arguing against trichotomy.
 - Helped set the stage for Hoekema's later fuller treatment in his book "Created in God's Image" and influenced evangelical anthropological consensus toward dichotomy and relational readings of the imago.

- **Enduring value**
 - A compact, exegetically-minded corrective: useful as a model for combining biblical exegesis with systematic and pastoral concerns; remains a go-to brief defense against trichotomist readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - portrayed as relational/functional capacities (rationality, morality, dominion, relationality to God) rather than a separable substance.
- **Dichotomy** - human constitution as **body + immaterial aspect** (soul/spirit understood in overlapping ways); Hoekema defends this as the best biblical fit.
- **Trichotomy** - the contested view (body + soul + spirit); critiqued for exegetical weakness and theological problems.
- **Psyche (soul)** - used in Scripture for life/personality; Hoekema treats it as integral to personal unity, not an autonomous ontological "part."
- **Pneuma (spirit)** - biblical usage tied to relational capacity with God and to life-principle; not proof of a third ontological component.
- **Substantive view** - the idea that the imago is an ontological property (rejected here in favor of functional-relational emphasis).
- **Functional/Relational view** - the imago as vocation and relational likeness to God; central thesis of the work.
- **Personal unity** - the claim that Scripture portrays human beings as unified persons, relevant to resurrection and incarnation doctrine.
- **Christ as Image** - Christ is the perfect fulfillment and restoration of the imago; used to ground soteriological and christological claims.
- **Resurrection** - used to argue against separating personhood into detachable parts; supports holistic anthropology.
- **Sanctification / Pneumatology** - spirit-language in sanctification does not require tripartite anthropology.
- **Exegetical model** - careful lexical and contextual reading of key texts (Gen 1-2, 1 Thess 5:23) to determine anthropology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the imago Dei in systematic theology courses (functional/relational model).
- As a **polemic** and concise rebuttal against trichotomist readings in biblical and pastoral contexts.
- As an **exegetical model** for handling contested anthropological passages without importing philosophical dualisms.
