### TITLE
**Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion** (1559 final Latin; McNeill ed., Battles trans., 1960)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - 16th-c. Reformation; Geneva pastorate; humanist ad fontes method.
 - First ed. 1536 (catechetical, apologetic), expanded repeatedly to 1559 (four-book summa).
 - Addresses late-medieval scholasticism, Roman magisterium, emerging Protestant debates.
- **Central thesis / problem**
 - The **knowledge of God and of ourselves** is given and ordered by **Scripture** and the **Spirit**, centered in **Christ**, for the **salvation** of believers and the **ordering** of church and commonwealth.
- **Core structure (four books)**
 - I. **Knowledge of God the Creator**: natural awareness (sensus divinitatis), necessity and sufficiency of Scripture, Trinity, creation, providence, idolatry, law.
 - II. **Knowledge of God the Redeemer in Christ**: fall and sin, covenantal unity of Testaments, Mediator, Christology, atonement, law-gospel relation.
 - III. **The way we receive the grace of Christ**: Spirit and faith, repentance (mortification/vivification), justification by faith alone, adoption, sanctification, Christian liberty, prayer, election and assurance, perseverance.
 - IV. **External means**: church as mother, marks, ministry and discipline; sacraments (baptism, Supper) with spiritual presence; critique of papacy and Mass; civil government.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Scripture as normative; **Augustine** preeminent; Chrysostom, Bernard.
 - Medievals: Lombard, Aquinas (often critical).
 - Reformers: Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Bucer; debates with Osiander, Servetus, Anabaptists; Roman apologists (e.g., Sadoleto; Council of Trent era).
- **Doctrines treated broadly**
 - Revelation and canon; **Trinity**; creation/providence; anthropology and original sin; **Christology** (person/work); **Soteriology** (union with Christ, justification, sanctification, election); **Pneumatology**; **Covenant** unity; **Church and sacraments**; **Eschatology** (resurrection, judgment, hope); **Twofold kingdom** and civil polity.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Union with Christ by the Spirit through the Word**, yielding the double grace of justification and sanctification within the covenant community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Duplex cognitio Dei**: Creator and Redeemer frames the whole.
 - **Scripture under the Spirit's internal witness** as self-authenticating; patristic retrieval subordinate to Scripture.
 - **Union with Christ** as soteriological engine; **duplex gratia** (forensic justification and transformative sanctification).
 - **Providence** meticulous yet pastoral; **prayer** as chief exercise of faith.
 - **Covenant continuity** of one grace under diverse administrations.
 - **Sacramental realism**: spiritual, not local, presence in the Supper; ascent by the Spirit.
 - **Three uses of the law**; **church discipline** integral to health.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Roman claims: church does not authorize Scripture; rejects transubstantiation, sacrificial Mass, papal monarchy.
 - Against **Lutheran ubiquity** in the Supper; against **Anabaptist** ecclesiology and political separatism; against **Osiander** on essential righteousness; refutes **Servetus** on Trinity.
 - Moderates scholastic speculation with exegetical sobriety and pastoral aim.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Sharpened articulation of **sensus divinitatis**, **testimonium Spiritus**; **accommodation** in revelation; systematic integration of union and double grace.
 - Genre: a pedagogical summa coordinating exegesis, catechesis, and polemic.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Normative for **Reformed orthodoxy**; formative for Belgic, Heidelberg, Westminster.
 - Continues to shape Protestant **bibliology**, **soteriology**, **sacramentology**, and **political theology**; widely used ecumenically and academically.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of doctrinal clarity joined to piety; Scripture-saturated method; balanced ecclesial and civil ethic; durable framework for teaching.
