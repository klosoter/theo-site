### TITLE
**Oscar Cullmann, The Christology of the New Testament** (orig. German 1957; Eng. trans. 1959)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century, post-war biblical theology revival; response to form criticism and existentialist demythologizing (Bultmann) and to C. H. Dodd's realized eschatology. Part of Cullmann's broader Heilsgeschichte (salvation-history) project.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The NT presents a fundamentally unified Christology grounded in salvation history and structured by eschatological time. Christ's person is known through his saving functions and titles, culminating in the cross-resurrection-exaltation and oriented to the Parousia.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Method:** Start from NT sources and titles as confessional and liturgical strata; read them in Jewish-apocalyptic horizon, not primarily Hellenistic myth.
 - **Jesus' self-understanding:** Priority of the **Son of Man** sayings for messianic consciousness and kingdom proclamation; redefinition of messiahship through suffering.
 - **Post-Easter confession:** **Kyrios** as central title of the exalted Jesus, deriving from OT usage for YHWH in the LXX; early hymns (e.g., Phil 2; Col 1) attest high Christology.
 - **Unity of titles:** Messiah, Son of Man, Son of God, Servant, Lord coinhere when plotted along the axis of salvation history.
 - **Soteriological center:** Cross and resurrection as one saving event inaugurating the last days; forgiveness and Spirit-gift as firstfruits.
 - **Eschatological structure:** Already-and-not-yet orientation; addresses the **delay of the Parousia** by distinguishing decisive inauguration from final consummation.
 - **Scope of salvation:** Individual and cosmic dimensions converge; resurrection hope, not Greek immortality; creation awaits renewal (new heavens and new earth).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Bultmann, Dodd, Wrede, Weiss; uses OT (Daniel 7; Isaiah), Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic, LXX, and pre-Pauline confessions/hymns.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation in history, Christology (titles, pre-existence, incarnation), soteriology (cross-resurrection), eschatology (kingdom, Parousia), anthropology (resurrection of the dead), creation (cosmic renewal), ecclesiology (confession, worship).
- **Closing line:** Christology is the eschatological interpretation of history: the crucified-and-exalted Jesus as Lord anchors the present age and points to the consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Heilsgeschichte:** Salvation unfolds in concrete historical acts culminating in Christ; history, not timeless myth, carries revelation.
 - **Inaugurated eschatology:** The last days have begun in Christ; the church lives between inauguration and consummation.
 - **Title-synthesis:** Diverse NT titles form a coherent witness when read along the history-of-salvation line.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **realized eschatology** (Dodd): preserves robust futurity of Parousia and resurrection.
 - Against **demythologizing** (Bultmann): retains apocalyptic framework and historical claims of the NT.
 - Against Hellenization theses: roots high Christology in Jewish Scripture and early worship rather than late metaphysics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Functional-to-ontological movement: ontological claims arise from the functions Jesus performs in salvation history.
 - Cross-resurrection-exaltation as a single saving complex orienting all titles.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Shaped the language of **already/not yet** in evangelical-Reformed (e.g., Ladd, and via biblical-theological streams congenial to Vos/Gaffin) and ecumenical theology; conversed with Pannenberg's history-centered approach.
 - Critiqued for underdeveloped metaphysics and for prioritizing Son of Man; appreciated for exegetical integration and historical rootedness.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model for reading NT titles together; clarifies delay-of-Parousia and kingdom themes.
 - Pedagogically useful in connecting Christology with eschatology, soteriology, and anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heilsgeschichte (salvation history):** The ordered sequence of divine acts culminating in Christ; frames all NT titles.
- **Inaugurated eschatology (already/not yet):** Present realization of salvation with future consummation; explains both assurance and hope.
- **Parousia (delay of the Parousia):** Future appearing of Christ; delay interpreted as the designed interval of mission and sanctification, not a failed expectation.
- **Kingdom of God:** Present in Jesus' ministry and the church's life by the Spirit; future in final judgment and renewal.
- **Messiah/Christ:** Jesus as anointed king redefined through suffering and exaltation; messianic consciousness expressed especially via Son of Man.
- **Son of Man:** Jesus' preferred self-designation tied to Daniel 7; unites suffering, authority, and eschatological judgment.
- **Kyrios (Lord):** Post-Easter confession equating Jesus with the divine Lord of the LXX; centers worship and ethics.
- **Son of God:** Royal and relational title; moves from functional to ontological depth in early confessions.
- **Suffering Servant:** Isaiahic motif informing passion and atonement; integrates messiahship and vicarious suffering.
- **Pre-existence and incarnation:** Articulated in hymnic materials (Phil 2; Col 1; John 1) within salvation-history logic.
- **Early Christian hymns/confessions:** Liturgical strata evidencing early high Christology and shaping church proclamation.
- **Individual and cosmic eschatology:** Believers' resurrection hope bound to creation's renewal; opposes Greek immortality of the soul.
- **New heavens and new earth:** Eschatological goal of history under Christ's lordship; cosmic scope of redemption.
- **Historia salutis vs ordo salutis:** Priority of redemptive history over individual application, without separating them.
- **Eschatological anthropology:** Human identity as new creation in Christ, living between times, oriented to bodily resurrection.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As an exegetical model for integrating NT titles and apocalyptic horizons.
 - As a conceptual pivot for inaugurated eschatology across eschatology, Christology, and soteriology.
 - As a polemical resource against realized-only eschatology and anti-historical demythologizing.
 - As a definitional source for salvation-history method in biblical and systematic theology.
