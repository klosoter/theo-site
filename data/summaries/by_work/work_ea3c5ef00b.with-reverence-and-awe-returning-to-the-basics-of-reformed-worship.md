### TITLE
**With Reverence and Awe: Returning to the Basics of Reformed Worship** - D. G. Hart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed liturgical critique amid widespread evangelical worship renewal and contemporary worship models.
 - Reaction to charismatic, seeker-sensitive, and entertainment-shaped services; an appeal to historic confessional and Reformed practice.
- **Central thesis**
 - Reformed worship must recover **reverence and awe** shaped by the regulative principle, Word and sacrament centrality, and the liturgical habits of the Reformed tradition; novelty and consumer-driven models distort biblical and covenantal worship.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary worship often reflects consumer culture, emotive individualism, and pragmatic goals (growth/attraction) rather than covenantal obedience to Scripture.
 - Retrieval: survey of classical Reformed principles-Calvin, the Second Helvetic and Westminster traditions, and historic liturgical practices-as corrective resources.
 - Prescription: practical guidance for returning to:
 - Word-centered services (scripture reading, sermon prominence).
 - Proper administration of sacraments as means of grace.
 - Corporate liturgy: psalmody, set prayers, creeds/confessions, orderly rites.
 - An attitude of holy awe and restraint that fosters corporate formation.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engagement with Reformers (Calvin, Knox) and confessional standards (Westminster, Second Helvetic Confession).
 - Implicit/explicit critique of late-20th-century worship innovators (seeker movement leaders, some charismatic proponents) and pragmatic evangelical pastors.
 - Dialogue with contemporary liturgical renewal voices insofar as they touch Reformed commitments.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Worship theology** (regulative principle vs. normative/practical adaptation).
 - **Ecclesiology** (corporate identity and covenant life).
 - **Sacramentology** (Lord's Supper and Baptism as means of grace, covenant signs).
 - **Revelation and the Word** (preaching and Scripture as central).
 - Implicitly touches on Trinitarian praise (order and adoration), formation and sanctification.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Worship is theology enacted: to worship rightly is to confess a covenantal God by Word and sacrament in a posture of reverent awe shaped by Scripture and the Reformed confessions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats *reverence and awe* not as mere aesthetics but as theological categories that guard doctrine and shape spiritual formation.
 - Stresses *historical continuity*-use of confessions, psalmody, and liturgical discipline-as necessary for doctrinal fidelity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both liberal accommodation (watering down doctrine to appeal) and pietistic individualism (privileging private experience over corporate covenant signs).
 - Contrasts emotive/entertainment models with a sober, covenantal liturgy that forms communal identity.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Reframes the regulative principle as formative rather than merely prohibitive: it prescribes patterns that form reverence, not simply forbids innovation.
 - Emphasizes "worship as covenantal speech and deed" - words and rites participate in covenant life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed discussions on worship; used by pastors and session-level leaders advocating liturgical recovery.
 - Mobilized in debates within PCA/OPC and similar denominations over music, liturgy, and the role of innovation.
 - Critiqued by some as nostalgic, insufficiently adaptive to cultural communication, or overly prescriptive about aesthetics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically cohesive defense of classical Reformed worship that is useful for pastors, students, and committees deciding worship policy.
 - Serves as a clear reminder that worship practice is doctrinally consequential and ecclesially formative.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reverence** - corporate posture of solemn respect for God; grounded in doctrine (holiness, transcendence).
- **Awe** - theological apprehension of God's majesty that resists domestication of worship into entertainment.
- **Regulative Principle of Worship** - worship allowed only by express warrant of Scripture; presented as formative guidance for liturgical shape.
 - Emphasizes both prohibition of unscriptural rites and positive prescription for biblical practices.
- **Word-centered worship** - primacy of Scripture reading and preaching as the ordained means by which God addresses the congregation.
- **Sacraments as means of grace** - Baptism and the Lord's Supper convey covenant realities and are more than symbolic memorials.
- **Covenantal worship** - worship as a communal enactment of the covenant; rites function to bind congregation into covenant identity.
- **Psalmody** - use of the Psalms in corporate singing as historically normative in Reformed contexts.
- **Liturgy / liturgical order** - fixed or semiformed patterns (calls to worship, confession, readings, sermon, sacraments) that shape corporate formation.
- **Corporate formation** - the idea that worship shapes theology, piety, and congregational life over time.
- **Consumerism / entertainment model** - critique term for market-driven worship strategies that prioritize attraction and individual preference.
- **Confessionalism** - adherence to historic statements (Westminster, Second Helvetic) as liturgical and doctrinal anchors.
- **Order / decorum** - emphasis on measured practice (not emotional excess) as faithful to Scripture and tradition.
- **Worship wars** - the denominational and intrachurch debates over styles, music, and worship theology that Hart addresses.
- **Historical retrieval** - method of recovering past practices for present reform.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed worship theology and the theological import of liturgical practices.
- As a **polemic** against contemporary evangelical/seeker-sensitive worship trends; cited in debates over music and liturgy.
- As a **practical model** for pastors/sessions seeking to reform services toward historic Reformed patterns and sacramental fidelity.
