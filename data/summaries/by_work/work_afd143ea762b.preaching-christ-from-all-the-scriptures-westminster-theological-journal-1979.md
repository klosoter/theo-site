### TITLE
Preaching Christ from All the Scriptures - Edmund P. Clowney, Westminster Theological Journal (1979) 
Tradition: Reformed / redemptive-historical homiletics

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 1970s Reformed evangelical milieu; growing recovery of biblical-theological, redemptive-historical approaches to preaching against pietistic moralizing and flattened proof-texting.
 - Published in Westminster Theological Journal, addressing pastors and homileticians within the Reformed academy and church.

- **Central thesis**
 - All of Scripture - Old and New - must be preached as bearing witness to Christ; legitimate preaching finds and proclaims the Christological center of each text without distorting its historical and canonical context.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: many sermons either reduce the Old Testament to moral lessons or segregate Christ to the New Testament; other approaches allegorize or ignore redemptive-historical connections.
 - Hermeneutical principle: Scripture is unified by covenant promise and fulfillment; the Bible's progressive revelation is a single story whose goal is Christ.
 - Method for preaching:
 - Read the text in its historical context (authorial intent, covenant situation).
 - Identify the promise, typology, prophecy, or pattern that points forward to Christ.
 - Show promise-fulfillment relations in canonical perspective (how the NT interprets the OT).
 - Apply Christ's saving work concretely to contemporary hearers (law-gospel balance).
 - Practical instruction: sermon structure should lead hearers from text to Christ to life, using both exegesis and redemptive-historical connections.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws implicitly on Geerhardus Vos-style biblical theology and on Reformed covenant theology; converses with exegetical practice in Westminster circles.
 - Engages (by contrast) moralistic, proof-text, allegorical, and dispensational tendencies in homiletics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (unity of Scripture); covenant theology (promise-fulfillment pattern); typology; Christology (mediatorial and fulfillment aspects); soteriology (law-gospel application); hermeneutics/canonical theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: Scripture is one unfolding witness whose telos is Christ; faithful expository preaching must make Christ visible in every text by tracing promise, typology, and fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a disciplined redemptive-historical hermeneutic that preserves historical particularity and canonical fulfillment rather than resorting to loose allegory or detached moralizing.
 - Prioritizes the promise-fulfillment axis (covenant progression) as the main route to Christ in the text.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic moralizing that extracts ethical maxims apart from redemptive context.
 - Opposes dispensational separations that treat OT and NT as disconnected planes; also resists purely Christocentric readings that ignore the original Sitz im Leben of the text.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Articulates a practical bridge between scholarly redemptive-historical theology and pulpit practice - moving from descriptive canon theology to prescriptive homiletics.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed homiletic circles and seminary training as a concise defense of redemptive-historical preaching.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments of typology, covenantal preaching curricula, and pastors seeking a Christ-centered exegesis without eisegesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating exegesis, biblical theology, and pastoral application; durable for training preachers who must do both careful historical work and Christ-centered proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christocentric preaching** - the aim to make Christ central in exposition of any biblical text.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - reading Scripture as a single unfolding redemptive story culminating in Christ.
- **Promise-fulfillment** - covenantal pattern where divine promises in earlier revelation find fulfillment in Christ.
- **Typology** - persons, institutions, or events in the OT that prefigure and are clarified by Christ.
 - Distinguish: typology here is canonical and covenantal, not arbitrary allegory.
- **Canonical reading** - interpreting individual texts in light of the Bible's final form and NT interpretation.
- **Sitz im Leben / historical context** - respect for the original communicative situation as a guard against eisegesis.
- **Law and Gospel balance** - the preacher's task to show both demand and saving provision in Christ.
- **Expository sermon** - Clowney promotes sermons grounded in careful exegetical attention that culminate in Christological proclamation.
- **Fulfillment motif** - explicit OT promises and prophecies interpreted as realized in Jesus.
- **Mediatorial Christ** - Christ as fulfillment of mediatorial offices promised in the Old Covenant.
- **Typological ethics** - application that flows from Christ's fulfillment of antecedent patterns to present Christian life.
- **Redemptive continuity** - continuity of God's purpose across covenants, enabling coherent preaching across Testaments.

- How this work is used:
 - As a definitional source for redemptive-historical homiletics in Reformed seminaries and pulpits.
 - As a polemic against moralistic, allegorical, or dispensational homiletic tendencies.
 - As an exegetical-homiletical model for integrating historical exegesis, typology, and Christ-centered application.
