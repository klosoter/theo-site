### TITLE
The Plan of Salvation (1915) - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton theology; post‑Reformation Reformed confessional milieu reacting to modernism, liberalism, Arminian revisions, and rising dispensational schemes.
 - Warfield writes as a systematic exegete and apologist for classical Reformed orthodoxy; addresses both historical theology and contemporary doctrinal controversy.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel must be understood as a divinely decreed, covenantal plan effected in Christ - anchored in the intra‑Trinitarian decree (covenant of redemption) and realized in the covenant of grace - such that justification is by imputed righteousness through Christ alone, and sanctification is its consequent fruit, not a meritorious ground.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Sketches the divine "plan" as a single purposive economy: decree → covenantal engagement → Christ's obedience/sufferings → application by Spirit.
 - Emphasizes federal (representative) structures: Adam/Christ as federal heads; imputation of sin and righteousness.
 - Distinguishes justification (forensic imputation) from sanctification (ethical renewal), preserving sola fide and sola gratia.
 - Argues for effectual calling and monergistic regeneration against synergistic and semi‑Pelagian tendencies.
 - Counters errors: legalism (confounding law and gospel), Roman Catholic merit theology (conferring intrinsic merit to works), and speculative alternatives (e.g., Molinist middle knowledge as undermining divine sovereignty).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Scripture, Calvin, the Westminster Standards, and Princeton predecessors (Hodge, Shedd); engages contemporary opponents: Arminians, Roman Catholics, some dispensationalists, and modern theologians advancing new covenant schemes.
 - Indirectly implicated in later debates (e.g., Federal Vision; covenant‑nomist controversies) because of its emphases on covenant structure and imputation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as authoritative for plan), Covenant (of redemption; of grace), Trinity (intra‑Trinitarian decree), Christology (active/passive obedience, substitution), Soteriology (justification, sanctification, election), Anthropology (federal headship), and aspects of ecclesiology and sacraments as means in covenantal economy.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the theological center of gravity in a sovereign, covenantal, and forensic gospel: God's eternal plan accomplishes salvation in Christ, imputed to believers by grace alone and worked out in sanctification without making works meritorious.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Firm recovery of the *covenantal* and *federal* logic as the primary interpretive key to Pauline and covenantal soteriology.
 - Strong forensic vocabulary: emphasis on imputation (sin to Christ, righteousness to believer) and penal substitution as normative.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against any tendency to spiritualize or diffuse the forensic nature of justification (e.g., neo‑orthodox or sacramental reconfigurations).
 - Rejects both Roman Catholic notions of merit and Arminian synergism; critiques dispensational fragmentation of redemptive history.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not so much neologisms as a disciplined synthesis: integrates covenant of redemption language into popular exposition of soteriology for a modern audience.
 - Clarifies relation of imputation to sanctification (fruit vs. ground).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Longstanding influence in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, academically respectable defense of classical Protestant soteriology.
 - Later invoked in debates over covenant theology boundaries (e.g., Federal Vision and monocovenantalism debates) - often as a representative of traditional federal ideas and as a corrective to covenantal innovations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of rigorous, textually minded Reformed soteriology; valuable for teaching the logic of covenantal salvation, defending sola fide, and clarifying distinctions between justification and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plan of salvation**
 - The ordered, decretive framework by which God accomplishes redemption through Christ; theological synopsis of decree, covenant, atonement, and application.

- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Intra‑Trinitarian agreement: Father's appointment, Son's undertaking to redeem; Warfield uses this to ground the unity and voluntariness of the redemptive work.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The historical administration of salvation across redemptive history; a central hermeneutical key for Scripture and sacraments.

- **Federal (representative) headship**
 - Adam/Christ as covenant heads; explains imputation of guilt and righteousness.

- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer: sin to Christ (on the cross) and Christ's righteousness to the believer (justification).

- **Penal substitution**
 - Christ's bearing of penal wrath in the believer's stead; core of Warfield's atonement theology.

- **Justification vs. Sanctification**
 - Justification: instantaneous, forensic, by faith alone (imputed righteousness).
 - Sanctification: progressive, transformative, fruit of justification, not its ground or meritorious.

- **Monergism / Effectual calling**
 - Regeneration as God's sovereign work preceding/producing faith; rejection of synergistic models (including semi‑Pelagian compromises).

- **Law‑Gospel distinction**
 - Sharp antithesis: law accusatory and condemning; gospel declaratory and restorative; necessary to defend sola fide.

- **Merit (good works)**
 - Denied as grounds for salvation; works are evidences and fruits, not currency for justification.

- **Predestination / Election**
 - Particular and efficacious; portrayed as consistent with God's righteous character and the covenantal plan.

- **Molinism / Middle Knowledge**
 - Treated critically insofar as it undermines divine decretive sovereignty by prioritizing creaturely counterfactuals.

- **Analogia Fidei vs Analogia Entis**
 - Warfield's method favors analogy grounded in revelation (analogia fidei) over natural theology (analogia entis) when construing the plan.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed soteriology (justification, imputation, covenantal logic).
- As **polemic** against Arminianism, Roman Catholic merit theology, and reductive dispensational schemas.
- As an **exegetical-model** for interpreting Pauline doctrines of justification and federal headship.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in covenant theology teaching - consolidating covenant of redemption + covenant of grace schema.
