### TITLE
Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew (Author unknown)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Author unknown; manuscript evidence and internal style place it in the patristic-to-medieval transmission stream (commonly dated late antiquity to early medieval). Reflects synagogue-to-church milieu where Matthew functioned as a bridge text between Torah-centered Judaism and emergent Christian teaching.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Matthew presents Jesus as Israel's promised covenant mediator: the *fulfillment* of Torah, prophecy, and kingship. The commentary argues that Matthew intentionally recasts Israelite law, prophetic expectation, and cultural institutions under an inaugurated eschatological kingdom.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close exegesis of Matthean structure and wording to show a unified theological program:
 - Identification of five major discourses (Sermon on the Mount, Mission Discourse, Parables, Church Order, Eschatological Discourse) as a fivefold pedagogy paralleling the Pentateuch.
 - Persistent use of the fulfillment formula to read Old Testament covenants and typology into Christological identity.
 - Reinterpretation of law: continuity with Torah's moral core, discontinuity in application and covenantal status after Christ's inaugurating work.
 - Eschatological reading that places social and cultural norms under the imminent rule of the kingdom (Christ and culture framed eschatologically).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Old Testament books (Torah, Prophets, Psalms) as primary interlocutors; Jewish interpreters (Pharisees) and early church practices appear as foil texts; echoes of Moses-as-type and Davidic promises are frequent.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scriptural fulfillment), Covenant (continuity and transformation of God's promises), Christology (Messiah as teacher/king/new Moses), Eschatology (inaugurated/now-not-yet), Law/Gospel relation (reformulated authority of Torah in Christ).
- **Closing line**
 - The commentary reads Matthew as a theological program: Jesus is the covenantal and typological climax of Israel, whose teaching reorders law, culture, and eschatological hope around the kingdom inaugurated in him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on Matthew as canonical reinterpretation of the Pentateuch: the five discourses function as a new Torah for the church.
 - Persistent typological pairing: Moses -> Jesus; Exodus motifs recast as redemption motif in Christ.
 - Eschatological cultural analysis: Matthew reframes social order and moral norms as provisional under the kingdom's imminent realization (connects to modern Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against purely allegorical readings by grounding allegory in covenantal-typological fulfilment; rejects readings that sever Jesus from Israel's promises.
 - Counters readings that either abolish the law entirely or that bind Christian practice to the letter of Mosaic ritual without typological mediation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reading the "fulfillment formula" as a hermeneutical principle that redefines biblical covenant relations rather than a mere fulfillment note.
 - Re-articulation of law/gospel boundary: law retains moral-covenantal authority, but its covenantal locus shifts from Sinai-in-anticipation to Christ-mediated community (addresses Law Gospel Distinction).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in medieval homiletic practice and later Reformation-era debates about covenant continuity; used by covenant theologians as an exegetical anchor for continuity between covenants (Biblical Covenants).
 - Employed in typology and fulfillment studies as a primary model for how New Testament authors deploy Old Testament scripture (Typology And Fulfillment).
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for sermon formation, covenant theology, and courses on Matthew as it tightly integrates grammar, structure, and theology into a unified christocentric reading.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fulfillment formula** - "that it might be fulfilled": hermeneutic key for reading OT texts as covenantal pointers to Christ.
- **New Moses** - Matthew's portrait of Jesus as the greater lawgiver and covenant mediator replacing/fulfilling Mosaic pedagogy.
- **Five discourses** - Structural device paralleling Pentateuch, used to argue canonical pedagogical intent.
- **Typology** - Method of reading persons/events in Israel as prefigurations; central to the commentary's theology (see Typology And Fulfillment).
- **Covenant continuity** - Claim that promises to Israel persist but find their locus in Christ and his community (connects to Biblical Covenants).
- **Law-Gospel relation** - Distinction that maintains moral continuity of the law while relocating its covenantal authority to Christ (addresses Law Gospel Distinction).
- **Kingdom of Heaven** - Eschatological category that governs Matthew's cultural prescriptions; kingdom as both present inauguration and future consummation (links to Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective).
- **Prophetic hermeneutic** - Use of prophetic texts as fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus, not merely predictive statements.
- **Eschatological inauguration** - Theological frame that explains cultural and ethical transformations as consequences of the kingdom's arrival.
- **Kingdom ethic** - Ethical thrust of Matthew that reinterprets Torah injunctions in kingdom terms.
- **Typological fulfillment of Davidic promises** - Reading Jesus as Davidic-covenant culmination.
- **Sermon-as-Torah** - Functional phrase for the five discourses serving as church instruction.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a definitional source for Matthew's covenantal Christology in Biblical Covenants discussions.
 - As polemical resource against both antinomian and legalistic readings (Law Gospel Distinction).
 - As an exegetical model for typology and fulfillment studies (Typology And Fulfillment).
 - As a theological resource for integrating Christ-and-culture issues within an inaugurated eschatology (Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective).
