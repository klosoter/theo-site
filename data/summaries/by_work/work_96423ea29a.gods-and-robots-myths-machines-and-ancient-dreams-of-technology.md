### TITLE
Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology - Adrienne Mayor (Princeton University Press, 2018). 
Interdisciplinary classical scholarship linking ancient literature, material culture, and history of technology; not written as theology but highly relevant to theology of creation, agency, and artifact.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-2010s scholarly conversation: resurgence of interest in long-duration histories of technology and premodern imaginaries in the face of AI and robotics.
 - Method: classical philology + history of science + archaeology; cross-cultural sweep (Greek/Roman, Near Eastern, Indian, Chinese, Jewish).
 - Theological milieu: indirect - engages ancient religious narratives and metaphors about makers, makers-of-makers, and animated matter.
- **Central thesis**
 - Ancient cultures repeatedly imagined, described, and sometimes built mechanical or quasi-animate artifacts; these myths and devices reveal persistent questions about creation, agency, ensoulment, and the boundary between gods, humans, and machines.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of mythic automata and divine artificers (Talos, Hephaestus, Pygmalion, Pandora) in Greco-Roman sources.
 - Examination of Hellenistic and Roman mechanical inventions (Hero, Philo of Byzantium, Vitruvius) and possible prototypes.
 - Comparative chapters on Indian, Chinese, and Jewish traditions (automata, mechanical birds, golems) showing cross-cultural motifs of artificial life.
 - Reading myths and artifacts as thought-experiments that probe theological-political issues: who may create life; how are souls distinguished from mechanism; what counts as miracle vs craft.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Mythic: Hephaestus, Talos, Pygmalion, Pandora, Galatea.
 - Authors/engineers: Homeric corpus, Hesiod, Herodotus, Pliny, Pausanias, Ovid, Hero of Alexandria, Vitruvius, Philo of Byzantium.
 - Cross-cultural texts: Jewish golem literature, Indian epic/technical descriptions, Chinese mechanical wonders and automata reports.
- **Doctrines treated (implicitly, by implication)**
 - **Creation** (divine vs human making; imitatio Dei)
 - **Agency and personhood** (what constitutes life/soul vs programmed motion)
 - **Providence vs craft** (miracle, thaumaturgy, technology)
 - **Iconography and worship** (animated cult statues; boundaries of religious veneration)
 - **Anthropology** (what it means to be human when machines mimic life)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Mayor's study reframes ancient myths and mechanisms as sustained theological probes into creators and created, showing that the problem of making life - and its moral and ontological consequences - predates modern robotics and remains central to theology of creation and agency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Cross-cultural, material-culture focus: marries literary myth with archaeological and mechanical evidence.
 - Treats mythic automatons as intellectual experiments rather than merely fanciful tales.
 - Shows continuity between imagined automata and real Hellenistic engineering.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters modern historiographies that cast robots as purely modern phenomena; demonstrates deep premodern engagement with artificial life.
 - Challenges readings that separate religion and technology by showing their frequent entanglement in ancient thought.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Rehabilitates the category of "automaton" as a lens for theological and philosophical questions (vs. treating it as anachronistic novelty).
 - Emphasizes "technopoiesis" (humanmaking of life-like artifacts) as a recurring ancient concern (implicit term).
- **Reception & influence in theology**
 - Not a theological text, but widely used in theology of technology, ethics of AI, and religion-and-science studies as historical grounding.
 - Cited in discussions on imitatio Dei, sacramental/animistic views of artifacts, and moral status of artificial agents.
- **Enduring value**
 - Rich, evidence-based resource for courses on religion and technology, doctrine of creation, and history of religious imagination.
 - Provocative prompt for contemporary ethical-theological reflection on AI, prosthetics, and the maker role.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Automaton / Automata** - ancient mechanical devices or mythic animated statues; Mayor treats them as conceptual probes about life and agency.
- **Talos** - Cretan bronze guardian; paradigmatic mythic automaton interrogating metal-bodied agency and defensive violence.
- **Hephaestus / Divine Artisan** - god-craftsman archetype; model for divine vs human making and the sacred status of crafted life.
- **Pygmalion / Galatea** - love, art, and ensoulment motif: artistic creation turned living, raising issues of consent and divine intervention.
- **Golem** - Jewish tradition of an artificially made being; used to compare Jewish and Greco-Roman reflections on animated clay.
- **Thaumaturgy vs Technology** - distinction between miracle/wonder and engineered mechanism; Mayor shows overlap in ancient categories.
- **Imitatio Dei (implicit)** - humanmaking as imitation of divine creativity; a recurring ethical-theological problem.
- **Animism / Enlivening** - beliefs that objects may be inhabited or animated; explains cult statues and ritual agency.
- **Technopoiesis** - formation of life by technological means (implicit analytic term for the book's motif).
- **Mechanical personhood** - ancient speculation about moral/ontological status of animated artifacts.
- **Material culture evidence** - Mayor's methodological insistence on integrating artifacts, not only texts.
- **Cross-cultural motif** - similarity of artificial-life narratives across Greek, Roman, Jewish, Indian, Chinese sources.
- **Boundary-work** - how ancient societies demarcate living/dead, divine/human, animate/inanimate.
- **Modern anachronism caution** - warns against projecting modern "robot" sense onto ancient texts.
- **Myth-as-thought-experiment** - treating mythic narratives as systematic reflections on technology and theology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **historical-definition source** for premodern notions of artificial life in theology of creation and imitatio Dei.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics of AI and theological anthropology, providing longue duree background for debates about maker/creature relations.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading myth and material culture together when exploring religious attitudes to artifacts and agency.
