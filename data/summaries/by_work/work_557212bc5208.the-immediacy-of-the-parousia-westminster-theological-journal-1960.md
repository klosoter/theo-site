### TITLE
"The Immediacy of the Parousia," John Murray, Westminster Theological Journal (1960).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Reformed scholarship; WTJ venue addressing urgent debates in New Testament eschatology.
 - Reaction against currents that relativized or spiritualized the New Testament expectation of Christ's coming (e.g., some readings of C. H. Dodd, liberal-critical treatments, and developmental readings that downplay the future parousia).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents the Parousia as an **immediate, objectively future, and ethically decisive** event; the so-called "delay" is not a refutation of apostolic expectation but must be accounted for theologically without denying imminence.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical demonstration: close readings of key Pauline and synoptic texts (notably 1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, and the Olivet discourse) showing language of nearness/immediacy and imperative consequences for Christian conduct.
 - Theological interpretation: the interval between first and second coming is providentially willed and accounted for within redemptive-historical and covenantal categories; imminence is retained as a normative eschatological stance for believers.
 - Pastoral consequence: apostolic exhortations to watchfulness, sobriety, and holy living presuppose an imminent Parousia that continues to govern Christian hope and practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit interlocution with modern exegetical trends that emphasize "delay" or "realized" elements (e.g., Doddian tendencies), plus engagement with contemporary evangelical and Reformed interpreters.
 - Use of patristic and canonical witness where helpful to show continuity of imminent expectation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (Parousia, consummation, imminence)
 - Christology (future return of the risen Lord)
 - Providence and divine decree (explanation of interval)
 - Soteriology / sanctification (ethical urgency arising from imminent expectation)
 - Revelation and prophetic fulfillment (future verification of prophetic promise)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Parousia remains the immediate, future cornerstone of apostolic faith and praxis; any theological account must preserve its objective futurity and ethical exigency while explaining the providential interval without dissolving expectation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses **immediacy as a normative stance** rather than merely a chronological claim; imminence regulates moral and ecclesial life.
 - Balances objective futurity with theological explanation for temporal delay-avoids both naive chronologism and total spiritualization.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that either (a) deny a future, visible Parousia or (b) explain away apostolic imminence as mere rhetorical hyperbole.
 - Contrasts with both liberal-critical "delay" problem framings and with readings that domesticize the Parousia into only realized or purely spiritual categories.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Refines use of "immediacy" to include ethical immediacy (practical exhortation) and eschatological immediacy (expected future event), insisting they are inseparable in NT usage.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a careful corrective to revisionist eschatologies; often cited in discussions defending the future, visible return of Christ.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments that sought to harmonize inaugurated eschatology with continued expectation without capitulating to either extreme.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of integrating NT exegesis with dogmatic concerns; valuable for pastors and teachers wanting to recover the apostolic sense of watchfulness and hope.
 - Serves as a measured response to both over-literal and over-spiritualized readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia** - the coming or presence of Christ; Murray insists on its objective, future, visible character.
- **Immediacy (of the Parousia)** - insists on both temporal nearness (apostolic expectation) and ethical urgency deriving from that expectation.
- **Delay (of the Parousia)** - treated not as falsification but as a providential interval that must be theologically accounted for.
- **Imminence** - closely related to immediacy; used to describe the apostolic posture of ready anticipation and watchfulness.
- **Consummation** - the eschatological completion of redemptive history connected to the Parousia.
- **Realized/inaugurated eschatology** - Murray critiques readings that overemphasize present realization at the expense of the future coming.
- **Signs and the Olivet Discourse** - readings defended that distinguish between local/partial signs and the ultimate, decisive coming.
- **Ethical exigency** - the moral imperatives (watch, be sober, ready) founded upon imminent expectation.
- **Providential interval** - theological category explaining the time between first and second coming without negating expectation.
- **Prophetic verification** - contention that future Parousia will vindicate prophetic promises; delay does not annul prophetic truth.
- **Presence vs. Coming** - distinguishes Christ's present redemptive activity from the future, manifest Parousia.
- **Apocalyptic language** - Murray reads apocalyptic NT language as future-oriented and directive for conduct.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for clarifying "immediacy/imminence" in Reformed eschatology.
- As a **polemic** against both realized-eschatology excesses and skepticism that weaponizes the "delay" problem.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Thessalonians, Paul and synoptic eschatological texts with theological sensitivity to pastoral imperatives.
