### TITLE
God in the World? The Trinity Reconsidered (Dialog, 1981) - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1980s; follows Moltmann's major 1970s works (notably The Crucified God) and precedes/overlaps his sustained Trinity work (The Trinity and the Kingdom).
 - Located within post‑war German theological renewal, political/eschatological theology, and renewed interest in social Trinitarianism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Traditional static, aseitic accounts of God detach the divine personhood from history and suffering; the Trinity must be rethought so that God is truly "in the world" - crucified, risen and active in history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses a problem: one‑person or impersonal language about God (e.g., Van Til's "one‑person" emphasis) tends to abstract God away from relation and temporal involvement.
 - Reorients the doctrine by prioritizing the **economic Trinity** (God's self‑revelation in Christ and Spirit) as constitutive of the **immanent Trinity** - i.e., God's inner life is historically engaged and relational.
 - Develops a **kenotic, social** model: divine personhood is constituted by mutual indwelling, self‑giving and historical mission rather than isolated metaphysical aseity.
 - Ends by drawing theological and pastoral consequences: ethics, ecclesial mission, and hope grounded in a God who suffers and acts within history.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Cappadocians and social Trinitarian precedents, Augustine and Reformational emphases, Karl Barth (affirming revelation while pushing toward greater immanence), and contemporary interlocutors including Van Til (on one‑person language).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (crucifixion and resurrection as Trinitarian acts), Pneumatology (Spirit as presence and relation), revelation, creation, eschatology, and soteriology in their communal/social dimensions.
- **Closing line**
 - Moltmann reframes the Trinity as a kenotic, relational reality - God‑in‑history - making divine sociality the theological ground for hope, ethics and ecclesial mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places suffering and historical vulnerability of God (the crucified God) at the heart of Trinitarian reflection.
 - Strongly privileges the **economic** over abstract metaphysical accounts of the immanent Trinity: God's being is revealed in and through action in history.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters classical emphasis on divine aseity and impassibility; argues against theological moves that reduce God to a solitary, unrelational "one‑person" (a critique aimed in part at opponents like Van Til's linguistic/formal tendencies).
 - Modifies Barthian priorities by insisting that revelation cannot be read as a closed spectacle of transcendence detached from ongoing divine suffering and presence.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts Trinitarian language in terms of *kenosis*, *relation*, *mutual indwelling* and *mission*, pushing social ontology as doctrinal method.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant influence on liberation, feminist, ecological and political theologies that require a God who participates in suffering and history.
 - Sparked enduring debates with analytic and classical theologians over social Trinity claims and the risk of tritheism vs. relationality.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined, ethically charged model for teaching the Trinity that links doctrine to praxis and history; indispensable for studies that connect Christology and Pneumatology with mission and hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God's actions in history (Father sending Son; Spirit as presence); for Moltmann the primary key to understanding God's being.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God's inner life; Moltmann insists it must be read through the economic, not isolated from it.
- **Kenosis**
 - Divine self‑emptying; theological hinge for understanding God's vulnerability and presence in the world.
- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling of the three persons; recast as relational, dynamic, and missionally oriented.
- **Social (Relational) Ontology**
 - The doctrine that personhood and being are constituted by relations - used to argue against solitary "one‑person" conceptions.
- **God‑in‑the‑world**
 - Phrase summarizing Moltmann's aim: God participates in history, suffering and hope rather than remaining detached.
- **Crucified God**
 - Christological center: divine self‑giving and suffering as constitutive of Trinitarian identity.
- **Spirit as presence**
 - Pneumatology that grounds ongoing divine action, consolation, and community formation.
- **One‑person language**
 - Language criticized for abstracting God from relationality and historical involvement (explicit interlocutor: Van Til).
- **Aseity vs. Immanence**
 - Tension between divine self‑sufficiency and God's self‑giving presence; Moltmann privileges immanence without collapsing transcendence.
- **Eschatological orientation**
 - Future‑directed hope structures Trinitarian life and Christian ethics.
- **Mutual Indwelling (perichoretic mission)**
 - Theological reframing that grounds ecclesial mission and social ethics in Trinitarian communion.
- **Suffering God**
 - Theodicy move: God suffers with creation and is thereby redemptively present.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for social/relational Trinitarian language in systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against impassibility, one‑person abstractions and dehistoricized metaphysics.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** linking the cross, resurrection and Spirit to doctrinal, ethical and political theology.
