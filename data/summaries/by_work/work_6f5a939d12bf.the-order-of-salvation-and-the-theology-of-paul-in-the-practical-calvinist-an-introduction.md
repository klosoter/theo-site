### TITLE
**The Order of Salvation and the Theology of Paul** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (essay in The Practical Calvinist: An Introduction to the Presbyterian & Reformed Heritage)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed theological renewal; written by a conservative Presbyterian New Testament theologian engaged with classical Reformed dogmatics and Pauline exegesis.
 - Responds to systematic theology's habit of imposing a schematic ordo salutis on the biblical text; aims to recover a Pauline, covenantal, and Christ-centered soteriology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin argues that Paul's presentation of salvation is anchored in the *historia salutis* (the historical acts of Christ) rather than in an abstract, schematic *ordo salutis* (logical sequence of subjective experiences). The biblical ordering gives priority to Christ's objective accomplishment and believers' union with him.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchor: close reading of Pauline texts that locate redemption in Christ's past acts (death, resurrection) and appropriation in participation/union with Christ.
 - Methodological claim: theological loci (justification, sanctification, regeneration) should be explicated from the narrative of redemption rather than imposed lists.
 - Practical corollary: the Spirit's work in calling and conversion must be understood within the matrix of God's decrees and Christ's objective work - not isolated as autonomous psychological events.
 - Soteriological synthesis: objective redemption (accomplished in history) precedes and grounds subjective appropriation (faith, repentance, sanctification) without collapsing divine sovereignty into determinism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Pauline exegesis and Reformed dogmatic tradition (Vos, Warfield, Calvinist covenant theologians).
 - Counters tendencies in both liberal biblical criticism that fragments Paul's soteriology and pietistic or clinical systematicians who prefer neat ordo sequences.
 - Engages contemporary debates over the relation of Christ's work to the Spirit's application (Regeneration vs. Effectual Calling).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as narrative), Covenant theology, Trinity (especially Spirit's applying work), Christology (objective work of Christ), Soteriology (justification, sanctification, regeneration), Divine decree (election and reprobation).

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's theological center of gravity: **Pauline soteriology is fundamentally Christocentric and historical - the objective accomplishments of Christ (and our union with him) must govern how we order and understand salvation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that *historia salutis* governs theological ordering; this restores priority to Christ's historical acts and union with Christ as the key concept linking objective redemption and subjective appropriation.
 - Integrative use of Pauline exegesis to correct abstract, purely logical orders of salvation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects systematic ordo-centric models that risk making salvation a sequence of isolated psycho-spiritual events.
 - Contrasts with pietistic or existential readings that over-emphasize subjective appropriation at the expense of objective accomplishment.
 - Pushes back against readings that separate regeneration and effectual calling as strictly sequential in time apart from Pauline covenantal categories.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts ordo salutis as derivative and subordinate to historia salutis; reframes "order" as narrative-centered rather than merely logical.
 - Emphasizes *union with Christ* as the conceptual pivot between divine decrees and experiential appropriation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed exegetes and systematicians seeking to recover biblical ordering of soteriology.
 - Used in seminary instruction to bridge New Testament exegesis and Reformed dogmatics; often cited in debates over the priority of regeneration and the Spirit's role.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies method: how to do theology from Paul rather than impose categories onto Paul.
 - Offers a robust framework for teaching the coherence of objective redemption and subjective application in pastoral and polemical contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historia salutis**
 - The historical acts of God in Christ (incarnation, atonement, resurrection) that ground salvation; for Gaffin this is primary.

- **Ordo salutis**
 - Theorized logical sequence of salvific experiences (calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification); Gaffin treats it as secondary and derivative from historia.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The central Pauline category that unites objective accomplishment and subjective appropriation; the pivot of Gaffin's account.

- **Objective redemption**
 - Christ's accomplished work in history (death, resurrection, exaltation) that secures salvation for the elect.

- **Subjective appropriation**
 - The Spirit-mediated application of redemption to believers (faith, repentance, sanctification), to be understood within the narrative of Christ's work.

- **Effectual calling**
 - God's sovereign, efficacious summons that results in conversion; for Gaffin it is an act of the Spirit grounded in God's decree and Christ's work.

- **Regeneration**
 - The Spirit's life-giving work that makes sinners spiritually alive; discussed in relation to effectual calling (not merely simultaneous checklist items but functionally tied to calling and union).

- **Election**
 - Unconditional divine choosing of persons in Christ; Gaffin locates election within the covenantal-historical economy rather than abstract predestinarian schemata.

- **Reprobation**
 - The negative counterpart in divine decree; treated cautiously and subordinated to the central positive focus on Christ's accomplished work and the promise to the elect.

- **Resurrection (Pauline emphasis)**
 - Central to Paul's soteriology and the guarantee of believers' future glorification; a keystone of objective redemption.

- **Justification / Sanctification**
 - Treated as aspects of appropriation within union: justification as forensic declaration grounded in Christ, sanctification as Spirit-wrought participation in Christ's life.

- **Covenantal framing**
 - The narrative-covenantal context that shapes Gaffin's reading of Paul's soteriology.

Uses across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for recovering the priority of historia salutis over schematic ordo salutis in teaching soteriology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul: prioritize union with Christ and Christ's historical acts when explicating justification, regeneration, and sanctification.
- As a **polemic tool** against privatized, sequential lists of salvific events and against readings that divorce divine decrees from covenantal-historical context.
