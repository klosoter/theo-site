### TITLE
The Nature of the Atonement: Four Views - Thomas R. Schreiner (contribution presenting the Reformed/penal‑substitution view; volume juxtaposes four historic models)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical debate over atonement models; part of the "Four Views" series that stages direct comparison and critique among major proposals (penal substitution, governmental, Christus Victor, moral‑influence).
 - Schreiner writes from a conservative Reformed evangelical milieu, engaging both exegetical and pastoral objections to penal substitution.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The atonement must be understood primarily as **penal, vicarious, and forensic**: Christ bore the penalty due sinners and so satisfied divine justice, enabling God to justify the ungodly without compromising holiness.
 - Problem addressed: how to reconcile God's justice and wrath with God's love and mercy in the work of Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis: sustained appeal to key texts (Isaiah 53; Psalm 22; Levitical sacrificial language; Romans 3-5; 2 Cor 5:21; Gal 3) to show penal, substitutionary motifs dominate biblical witness.
 - Theological synthesis: ties penal substitution to **imputation** (sin to Christ; righteousness to believers), **satisfaction** (soteriological and covenantal), and **propitiation** (appeasement of divine wrath).
 - Polemic moves:
 - Against governmental theory: argues it weakens literal penal bearing and undermines substitution.
 - Against moral‑influence views: calls them insufficient for sin's objective removal and neglectful of judicial language.
 - Against minimalist Christus Victor readings: affirms Christus Victor motifs but insists they must be integrated into a penal‑forensic framework rather than replace it.
 - Pastoral and doxological implications: emphasizes assurance, evangelistic clarity, and worship shaped by reconciliation and propitiation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural witnesses (OT sacrificial texts, Psalms, Isaiah; Pauline epistles).
 - Contemporary theologians defending alternative models; classic witnesses (Anselm for satisfaction language; Reformers for imputation and penal focus).
 - Appeals to systematic dogmatics (soteriology, justification, Trinity in atonement).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (atonement, justification, imputation, redemption)
 - Christology (incarnation, substitutionary suffering, obedience)
 - Trinity (economic roles in atonement)
 - Divine attributes (justice, wrath, love)
 - Covenant theology (satisfaction within covenantal framework)

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner's view: **the Bible most coherently presents the atonement as a penal, vicarious satisfaction that secures forensic justification while encompassing victory over evil and moral renewal.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Heavy exegetical priority: reads atonement through the legal and sacrificial vocabulary of Scripture rather than primarily metaphoric or pastoral categories.
 - Integrative posture: affirms Christus Victor and pastoral benefits but insists they are subordinate to the penal‑forensic center.

- **Corrections / contrasts to rivals**
 - Clarifies that rejecting penal substitution often stems from philosophical horror rather than exegetical warrant; rebuts claims that penal substitution depicts God as gratuitously violent.
 - Argues governmental theory preserves divine justice only at cost of denying genuine substitution; moral‑influence models fail to explain objective reconciliation.

- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications**
 - Distinguishes **propitiation** (turning away God's wrath) from mere moral influence and from purely exemplary notions.
 - Reasserts **imputation** as not merely forensic fiction but covenantal transaction rooted in Christ's substitutionary person.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a robust defense of classical penal substitution.
 - Used in seminary courses and in polemical debates with proponents of Christus Victor emphasis and newer atonement approaches.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary of careful biblical‑theological argumentation for penal substitution; useful for students needing exegetical and systematic resources that connect atonement to justification and covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Penal substitution** - Christ bears the penalty due sinners; central claim defended.
- **Substitutionary atonement / vicarious suffering** - Christ suffers **in the place of** sinners.
- **Imputation** - Transferal of guilt to Christ and of Christ's righteousness to believers.
- **Satisfaction** - Christ satisfies divine justice; language tied to covenantal obligations.
- **Propitiation** - Christ turns away divine wrath; an atonement function affirmed against modern reticence.
- **Expiation** - Removal of sin; closely tied to propitiation in Schreiner's account.
- **Forensic justification** - God declares the sinner righteous on grounds of Christ's penal work and imputed righteousness.
- **Christus Victor** - Recognized as legitimate biblical motif (victory over powers) but argued as incomplete if detached from penal reality.
- **Governmental theory** - Critiqued as undermining real substitution by converting punishment to a public demonstration.
- **Moral‑influence theory** - Rejected as insufficient for objective reconciliation and inability to address divine wrath.
- **Covenantal framework** - Atonement located within covenantal law, obligation, and satisfaction rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Propitiatory sacrifice / sacrificial typology** - OT sacrificial system read as pointing to penal and propitiatory dimensions.
- **Reconciliation / redemption** - Outcomes of penal work: relational restoration and liberation from bondage.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for the penal‑substitution paradigm in soteriology and preaching.
 - As a **polemic** against governmental and moral‑influence alternatives; a go‑to resource in debates over atonement models.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Isaiah 53, Romans, and sacrificial texts with pastoral and doctrinal implications.
