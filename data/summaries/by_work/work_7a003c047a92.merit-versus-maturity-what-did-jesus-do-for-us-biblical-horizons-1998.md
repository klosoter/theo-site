### TITLE
**Merit Versus Maturity: What Did Jesus Do for Us?** (Biblical Horizons, 1998) 
Author: **James B. Jordan**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1998 within the Biblical Horizons imprint; emerges from late-20th-century Reformed/federal theological circles that were reengaging covenant theology, sacramental practice, and debates over how justification relates to covenantal life. Intersects postmillennial and Federal Vision conversations that reexamine union with Christ and covenantal righteousness.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jordan aims to distinguish two senses in which Christ's work is described - *merit* (what Christ legally and covenantally accomplished on our behalf) and *maturity* (what Christ produces in believers' growth and sanctification) - and to insist that proper Christian doctrine must account for both without collapsing merit into moral influence or reducing maturity to the ground of justification.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Defines the terms: *merit* as covenantal/forensic accomplishment (active and passive obedience, satisfaction/substitution); *maturity* as sanctifying effect, moral transformation, and covenantal life.
 - Surveys historical sources (patristic, medieval, Reformation) to show how the church has handled merit and growth, arguing that Protestantism recovered the forensic reality but sometimes neglected covenantal/sacramental means.
 - Reframes justification in covenantal language: Christ as federal head merits covenant blessings; those blessings are applied in union with Christ and mediated by covenant signs (sacraments).
 - Argues against reductionist positions:
 - Moral-influence readings that make Christ's work primarily exemplary or formative.
 - Antinomian readings that separate forensic justification so absolutely that the covenantal life is rendered optional or irrelevant.
 - Proposes a relational/covenantal model that preserves objective merit while insisting on real, covenantal effects (maturity) in the life of the believer.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformers (esp. Calvinic doctrine of active/passive obedience), medieval scholastic categories of merit and satisfaction, contemporary Federal Vision proponents and critics, biblical exegesis of Pauline and covenant texts.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification, sanctification, covenant, Christology (federal headship; active/passive obedience), atonement, imputation vs impartation, sacramentology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Christ both *merited* our covenant standing by his obedient life and atoning death and *matures* his people through union, means, and sanctifying presence - theological fidelity requires holding both dimensions together within a covenantal framework.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insistence on a *covenantal* framing of merit: merit is not merely metaphysical debt-payment nor merely legal fiction but the earning of covenant blessings by the federal head.
 - Reconciles forensic categories with sacramental and ecclesial realities (signs, union with Christ) as the ordinary means of applying merit.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on purely forensic or forensic-only accounts that neglect covenantal life and means.
 - Opposes moral-influence models that deny objective merit; opposes libertine readings that divorce justification from growth.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Prioritizes the dichotomy *merit vs maturity* as an organizing theological lens; treats *maturity* as a technical term for covenantal sanctification produced by Christ's applied work.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Found receptive audiences among postmillennial and covenantal theologians seeking synthesis of forensic and communitarian categories.
 - Provoked pushback from scholars who defend classical imputation language and from critics wary of Federal Vision proximities.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies confessional vocabulary for teaching justification in a covenantal ecclesiology.
 - Useful corrective to both reductionist forensic and reductionist pietist tendencies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Merit:** Christ's earning of covenant blessings as federal head; juridical and covenantal rather than merely exemplary.
- **Maturity:** The sanctifying, formative effect of Christ's work in believers; covenantal growth rather than mere moral improvement.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's lifelong fulfillment of the law as a positive ground of merit.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death as penal/atoning satisfaction.
- **Imputation:** The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; Jordan affirms but frames imputation within covenantal union and application.
- **Impartation:** The communication of Christ's life within believers (sanctification); Jordan stresses both imputation and impartation as distinct but related.
- **Federal headship:** Christ as representative of the covenant people; the locus of meritorious action.
- **Forensic justification:** Legal declaration grounded in Christ's merit; affirmed but not isolated from covenantal life.
- **Covenant:** Central category for interpreting merit and growth; mediates how merit is applied (signs, word, sacrament).
- **Sacramentality:** Role of signs (baptism, Lord's Supper) in applying Christ's merit and producing maturity.
- **Union with Christ:** The relational nexus that connects believers to Christ's merit and to the process of maturity.
- **Sanctification:** Process of maturation distinct from but inseparable in effect from justification.
- **Moral influence theory:** Treated as a target - insufficient account of what Jesus accomplished.
- **Works of the law:** Reinterpreted in covenantal terms to avoid antinomian misreadings.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for covenantal treatments of merit and for distinguishing imputation/impartation language.
- As a **polemic** against moral-influence and antinomian tendencies, and as a locus in Federal Vision debates over justification by faith.
- As an **exegetical-pedagogical model** for teaching the interplay of Christ's legal accomplishment and the believer's sanctified life within ecclesial practice.
