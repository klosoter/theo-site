### TITLE
Predestination - Charles Hodge (Princeton Review articles)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Reformed context; Old Princeton theological school; response to rising Arminianism, revivalist voluntarism, and liberalizing currents.
 - Hodge writes as a systematic exegete and polemicist, aiming to restate classical Calvinism for American Presbyterianism and for seminary instruction.

- **Central thesis**
 - Predestination is an orthodox biblical doctrine: God, in his eternal and sovereign decree, elects some to salvation and passes over others (reprobation); this truth coheres with Scripture, preserves God's sovereignty and holiness, and is compatible with human responsibility and the moral order.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Ephesians, 9) and other canonical materials are marshaled to show election is divine, gratuitous, and not based on foreseen merits.
 - Logical distinctions:
 - Distinguishes divine **decree** from mere **foreknowledge** and from the **means** (the mediatorial work of Christ, the Spirit, faith).
 - Differentiates **election** (positive gracious choosing) from **reprobation** (negative judicial passing by).
 - Theodicy and pastoral application:
 - Addresses objections (justice, love, human responsibility, moral exhortation).
 - Emphasizes assurance through Christ, not speculative knowledge of decretal lists.
 - Practical outworking: doctrine should produce humility, gratitude, evangelistic zeal, and pastoral consolation, not fatalism or moral laxity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture, Augustine and Calvin as primary patristic/Reformation precedents.
 - Opposes Arminius, Pelagian tendencies, Socinian critiques, and contemporary liberal skepticism.
 - Dialogues implicitly with hyper-Calvinist extremes by guarding evangelical obligation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine decree, election, reprobation, sovereignty and providence, human sin and responsibility, atonement (particularity vs generality), Christology (Christ as the object and meritorious ground of election), assurance and justification as applied to believers.

- **Closing line**
 - Hodge situates predestination as a sober, Scripture-grounded affirmation of God's sovereign and gracious plan in Christ that grounds assurance and responsibility without dissolving either.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Method: tight mesh of exegesis, systematic categories, and pastoral sensitivity-predestination is treated both doctrinally and pastorally.
 - Emphasizes the mediatorial and Christocentric character of election: election culminates in Christ as its object and instrument.
 - Firm insistence that election is gratuitous (not based on foreseen faith or works) while rejecting fatalistic or immoral consequences.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Arminianism: rejects conditional election (foreseen faith) and locates ultimate ground in God's will and grace.
 - Against hyper-Calvinism: insists on preaching the gospel and the duty of all to repent; election does not negate universal proclamation.
 - Against rationalist and sentimentalist revisions: defends doctrinal integrity over pietistic de-emphasis of doctrine.

- **Conceptual/terminological notes**
 - Careful deployment of decree/foreknowledge distinction; treats the order of decrees as a theological aid, not a metaphysical necessity.
 - Reprobation articulated as judicial and permissive rather than arbitrary cruelty.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in American Presbyterian and Reformed theological education (Princeton seminary), shaping late 19th-early 20th-century Calvinist identity.
 - Criticized by liberal theologians and Arminian traditions; later evangelicals both inherit and contest Hodge's emphases.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of disciplined biblical theology and pastoral application of a contested doctrine; useful for teaching classical Reformed positions while avoiding caricatured extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination** - God's eternal decision concerning the ultimate destiny of individuals; central category.
- **Decree** - The eternal purpose of God; distinct from foreknowledge and distinct from temporal means.
- **Election** - Positive, gracious choosing of some to salvation; gratuitous and grounded in God's will.
- **Reprobation** - Divine passing by or judicial rejection of others; treated as the negative counterpart to election.
- **Foreknowledge** - Hodge distinguishes biblical foreknowledge (relational, not mere foresight) from a ground for election; it does not imply conditionality.
- **Unconditional election** - Election not based on foreseen faith or works; repeatedly affirmed as biblical and pastoral.
- **Efficacious grace** - The work of the Spirit that actually brings the elect to faith; necessary and effectual for salvation.
- **Mediatorial Christology** - Christ as the object and means of election; atonement and election are tightly linked.
- **Human responsibility** - Emphasized: predestination does not annul moral accountability or the universal duty to repent.
- **Order of decrees** - Hodge favors classic Reformed ordering as a theological clarification (treats infralapsarian concerns prudently).
- **Assurance** - Grounded in Christ and Scripture, not in speculative knowledge of who is elect.
- **Particular vs general atonement** - Hodge leans toward particularity in atonement's intent and efficacy, consistent with his election theology.
- **Theological method** - Exegetical-systematic-pastoral triad; careful use of historical sources.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise definitional source for classical Reformed positions on election and reprobation.
 - As a polemic resource against Arminian and liberal revisions of predestination.
 - As an exegetical-model for reading Romans and Ephesians within systematic theology, and as a pastoral template for teaching assurance without speculative pride.
