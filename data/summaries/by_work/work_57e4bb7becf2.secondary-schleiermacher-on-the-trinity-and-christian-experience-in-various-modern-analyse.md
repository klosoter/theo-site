### TITLE
Schleiermacher on the Trinity and Christian Experience (secondary analyses)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 18th-early 19th century German Protestantism; Romantic and post-Kantian intellectual climate; Friedrich Schleiermacher's Glaubenslehre (published 1821/22) as the locus classicus. Reaction against Enlightenment deism and scholastic metaphysics; attempt to ground theology in religious experience.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Trinity must be reinterpreted in light of Christian religious self-consciousness: persons are not primarily metaphysical substances but distinctive modes/relations of the one divine life as disclosed in the life, death, resurrection of Jesus and the ongoing presence of the Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Start from the existential datum: the **feeling of absolute dependence** in human religious consciousness as the criterion of the divine.
 - Infer a model of God as **absolute infinite consciousness** whose life is self-awareness and self-relation.
 - Define the divine persons by **distinctive relational functions** within that one consciousness:
 - the Son as the form in which the divine consciousness is manifested (the Logos-as-revelation);
 - the Spirit as the mode of divine appropriation and communal presence in finite life.
 - Emphasize **economic revelation** (how God is experienced in Christ and Spirit) as the epistemic ground for speaking of the immanent Trinity-without reconstructing a classical metaphysical ontology of three hypostases.
 - Conclude that Trinitarian language is theological description of divine relationality evidenced in Christian experience rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Kantian epistemology and Romantic affect theories; critiques of Cartesian and scholastic metaphysics; later interlocutors include modern commentators (Barth, Jenson, Bultmann), and contemporary participants in the Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) debates (Grudem/Ware vs. social-trinitarian critics).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (primary), revelation, Christology (Son as revelation), pneumatology (Spirit as communal presence), theological method (experience as theological ground).
- **Closing line:** Schleiermacher relocates the Trinity from metaphysical substance-talk to the structure of divine self-consciousness and Christian experience, making Trinitarian doctrine a theological description of relational modes disclosed in Christ and the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** radical grounding of theology in **religious feeling (Gefühl)** rather than propositional metaphysics; persons as **relational functions** within divine self-consciousness.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors:** rejects scholastic metaphysical scaffolding (substance/essence primacy) and Enlightenment natural theology; opposes purely speculative Trinitarian constructs by insisting on experiential warrant.
- **Conceptual innovations:** use of psychological and experiential vocabulary (consciousness, feeling, relation) to articulate Trinitarian distinctions; a proto-social-relational account without committing to later social-trinitarian metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence:** foundational for modern liberal theology and for many constructive social-trinitarian positions; influential in 19th-20th century Protestant theology; criticized by classicalists for apparent modalist tendencies or for diminishing ontological distinctions between persons.
- **Enduring value:** offers a clear methodological alternative to metaphysical-first Trinitarianism; valuable in teaching method and in debates about how to justify Trinitarian claims from Christian practice and experience; a provocation in contemporary EFS discussions because it highlights relational descriptions without straightforwardly affirming ontological subordination.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence:** the basic religious datum; Schleiermacher's epistemic ground for theology.
- **Religious self-consciousness:** human awareness that opens onto knowledge of God; primary theological criterion.
- **God as infinite consciousness:** concept of divine life as self-awareness rather than static substance.
- **Person (Personhood as relation):** persons defined by differentiating relations/functions within divine consciousness.
 - contrasts with classical hypostatic individuality (substance-based).
- **Economic Trinity:** the mode in which God is experienced (Christ and Spirit); Schleiermacher privileges this for theological speech.
- **Immanent Trinity:** reconstructed via descriptions of divine self-consciousness and relational functions rather than metaphysical categories.
- **Son as revelation / Logos:** the manifestation within finite history that makes the divine consciousness accessible.
- **Spirit as communal presence:** the mediating presence that unites finite minds to divine life.
- **Modalism risk:** frequent criticism - Schleiermacher's relational language can be read as collapsing persons into modes of the one consciousness.
- **Social Trinitarian resonance:** later theologians draw on Schleiermacher's relational idiom to defend a social account of persons.
- **Ontological vs. functional subordination:** Schleiermacher tends to describe **functional** distinctions (role/manifestation) and explicitly resists claims of ontological inferiority.
- **Experience as epistemic warrant:** using lived Christian experience as the justification for doctrine rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Theological anthropology:** human consciousness and dependence shape the theological account of God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for experience-based Trinitarian theology and for grounding doctrine in Christian praxis.
- As a **polemical resource** in Eternal Functional Subordination debates - cited both to support relational/functional distinctions and to warn against ontological subordination.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading New Testament revelation through the lens of human religious awareness and communal appropriation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** between classical metaphysical Trinitarianism and modern social/relational theologies.
