### TITLE
Image of God - Michael S. Horton, entry in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Horton writes from a contemporary Reformed-evangelical vantage within the early 21st century, contributing to a broad ecumenical Oxford Handbook (mid-2000s) that surveys central loci of systematic theology. His piece addresses longstanding debates shaped by modern biblical scholarship, analytic philosophy of personhood, and recent Trinitarian retrievals.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The imago Dei should be read Christocentrically and relationally: it is not merely a set of capacities or a biological status but a vocation and pattern for human life rooted in the triune God and restored in Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Critique of reductionisms: rejects purely **substantive** accounts (image = rational faculties) and purely **functional** accounts (image = dominion role) as insufficient alone.
 - Positive proposal: image as **relational-ontological + vocational**, grounded in the Trinity and concretized in Christ - which both locates human worth and frames human calling.
 - Anthropology and sin: explains how the image is wounded, disfigured, and distorted by sin (loss of original righteousness and vocational fidelity) but not entirely erased; restoration occurs through union with Christ (recapitulation and redemption).
 - Ecclesial and ethical implications: the church as community reflecting Trinitarian relations, and Christian vocation (stewardship, worship, service) as restoration of the image.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages classical sources (Genesis, Augustine, Calvin), modern and contemporary interlocutors (Barthian and neo‑orthodox themes, relational Trinitarianists, analytic accounts of personhood), and touches on modern philosophers and ethicists when critiquing secular accounts.
- **Doctrines treated:** anthropology, Trinity (as the normative pattern), Christology (Christ as the definitive image), sin and grace (original righteousness, depravity, restoration), ecclesiology (church as locus of restored image), and practical ethics (vocation, stewardship).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The image of God is supremely realized and restored in Christ and is essentially relational and vocational - human dignity is rooted in being created for Trinitarian communion and redeemed into that communion by Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the imago Dei is primarily **relational** (reflecting Trinitarian life) and **vocational** (task-oriented), not simply a list of intrinsic capacities.
 - Christocentric hermeneutic: Christ is the ontological locus and telos of the image rather than merely its moral exemplar.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against Enlightenment/modernist accounts that privatize personhood (reducing image to autonomy or cognition).
 - Counters some evangelical trends that overemphasize either function (dominion only) or substance (rationality only), arguing both are integrated in a covenantal framework.
 - Dialogues critically with relational Trinitarianists who might underplay sin's disfiguring effect or the necessity of Christ's redemptive work.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses a mediated vocabulary: image as "vocation-in-relation," tying metaphysical status to covenantal calling and ecclesial practice.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read among Reformed and conservative evangelical scholars as a succinct corrective to atomistic anthropology; influential in classrooms for bringing classic Reformed categories (original righteousness, federal headship) into conversation with modern Trinitarian emphases.
 - Engages ecumenically by appealing to shared concerns about human dignity and sin while preserving confessional distinctives.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, accessible synthesis that links doctrine (Trinity, Christology) to ethics and ecclesiology; useful as a teaching text for connecting biblical exegesis to systematic claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** central category; Horton's relational-vocational reinterpretation locates it in Trinitarian patterns and Christic restoration.
- **Substantive model:** view that image equals inherent capacities (reason, will); critiqued as incomplete.
- **Functional model:** view that image equals role or task (dominion); accepted but integrated into a broader account.
- **Relational model:** Horton's preferred emphasis - image as constituted by interpersonal relations mirroring the Trinity.
- **Christocentrism / Christ as image:** Christ as the definitive and restorative image, the telos and repairer of human likeness to God.
- **Original righteousness:** pre-fall state of fitting relation to God; its loss explains moral and vocational impairment.
- **Original sin / disfigurement:** doctrine of the image's damage (not total annihilation), necessitating redemptive restoration.
- **Federal headship:** Adam as representative head whose fall affects humanity; Christ as representative head who restores.
- **Vocation / stewardship:** human calling to rule and care for creation as an aspect of the image, reoriented by redemption.
- **Trinitarian anthropology:** anthropology shaped by the doctrine of Trinity - persons in relation as normative for human personhood.
- **Ecclesial embodiment:** church as concrete community where restored image is displayed and cultivated.
- **Dignity and worth:** theological grounding for human value, resisting reductionist secular accounts.
- **Union with Christ:** mechanism of restoration - participation in Christ heals and fulfills the imago.
- **Ethical/communal implications:** public and social dimensions of image-bearing (justice, care, vocation).
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Reformed, Trinitarian account of imago Dei in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist substantive/functional accounts and secular concepts of personhood.
 - As an **exegetical-model** linking Genesis anthropology to Christology and ecclesiology for classroom discussion and doctrinal synthesis.
