### TITLE
Pauline Eschatology - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton-Reformed milieu; Vos as founder of modern Reformed biblical theology. Reaction to liberal-critical and speculative approaches to Paul (e.g., Schweitzerian futurism and various "realized" readings).
 - Method: historical-biblical, tracing progressive revelation within Scripture rather than systematic abstraction.

- **Central thesis**
 - Paul's eschatology is fundamentally **inaugurated yet consummatory**: Christ's death, resurrection, and gift of the Spirit inaugurate the new eschatological order, while the final consummation (resurrection, parousia, full kingdom) remains future and decisive. Eschatology is the governing horizon for Paul's thought, not an optional motif.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Pauline texts that employ apocalyptic language-parousia, resurrection, "age to come", firstfruits, promise, baptism, new creation.
 - The death-resurrection event transitions history: Christ's resurrection initiates the eschatological age; believers participate now (Spirit, justification, new life) but await future bodily vindication.
 - Pneumatology as guarantor: Spirit is the present pledge/firstfruits that secures future glory.
 - Soteriological and ethical ramifications: present sanctification and community life derive from the already inaugurated kingdom yet retain forward-looking hope that shapes patience and perseverance.
 - Anthropological insistence: redemption concerns the whole person; bodily resurrection is the eschatological vindication.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Paul as primary interlocutor; Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic background; interlocution against liberal critics (who either over-spiritualize or postpone everything to the future) and against gnostic/Greek dualist tendencies.
 - Engages Reformed confessional tradition implicitly (covenant, resurrection), and the contemporary scholarly debates on "realized" vs. "future" eschatology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology, Christology, resurrection, pneumatology, anthropology, soteriology, ecclesiology, revelation (eschatology as the hermeneutic of Scripture).

- **Closing line**
 - Vos centers Paul's theology on the historical, eschatological act of God in Christ: salvation is already present in the Spirit and Christ's resurrection but awaits its full, bodily consummation at the parousia.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological: biblical-theological tracing of eschatological history rather than abstract speculative systems.
 - Theological: tight integration of Christ event + Spirit as the concrete inauguration of the eschaton; eschatology as the interpretive key for Paul's entire theology.
 - Anthropological: insistence on bodily resurrection and personal unity against disembodied immortality.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects extremes of both (a) full "realized eschatology" that collapses future hope into present spiritualization, and (b) radical futurism that severs present Christian life from God's inaugurated acts.
 - Opposes Platonic or gnostic trichotomies that fragment human nature and undercut bodily redemption.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Forcefully articulates the **already / not-yet** dynamic within Paul's corpus as a hermeneutical principle for Pauline theology.
 - Treats the Spirit explicitly as the **guarantee/firstfruits** that grounds present possession and future expectation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Strongly influential in Reformed biblical theology and in subsequent treatments of inaugurated eschatology. Served as a corrective to both liberal reductionism and pietistic otherworldliness.
 - Provided a template for later scholars (across confessional lines) who articulate the "already/not-yet" tension (e.g., mid-20th century developments in both evangelical and mainline scholarship).

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of exegetical-theological method: textually disciplined, historically situated, doctrinally informed.
 - Durable corrective on anthropology (favoring bodily future hope) and on integrating ethics, pneumatology, and soteriology under eschatological orientation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Already / Not-Yet** - central interpretive frame: present reality in Christ vs. future consummation at parousia.
- **Parousia** - the future, decisive arrival of Christ; eschatological consummation.
- **Resurrection** - the pivot of eschatology; bodily vindication and the goal of redemption.
- **Spirit as Pledge / Firstfruits** - the Spirit secures present possession and guarantees future glory.
- **Kingdom / Age to Come** - inaugurated by Christ, realized progressively, completed in final judgment and new creation.
- **New Creation** - eschatological horizon: redemption of the whole cosmos and person.
- **Apocalyptic Fulfillment** - Vos reads Paul as reinterpreting Jewish apocalyptic in light of Christ's historical act.
- **Eschatological Time** - replacement of linear, purely chronological time by a salvation-historical tension (inauguration / consummation).
- **Anthropological Unity (Dichotomy over Trichotomy)** - Vos rejects speculative trichotomy; affirms bodily-soulish unity destined for resurrection; critiques Greek dualism.
- **Justification / Glorification link** - forensic present justification is bound to future vindication; soteriology is eschatologically framed.
- **Ethics as Eschatological Practice** - present sanctification and community order flow from eschatological reality.
- **Revelation as Historical Act** - revelation is concrete action in Christ rather than abstract propositional system.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for **inaugurated eschatology** and the already/not-yet idiom.
 - As a polemic against **trichotomy, gnostic dualism, and both extreme realized and extreme futurist readings** of Paul.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Pauline texts on Spirit, resurrection, and parousia for systematic loci (soteriology, anthropology, ecclesiology).
 - As a conceptual pivot for teaching the unity of historical acts of God and their ethical/communal consequences.
