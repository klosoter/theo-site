### TITLE
**Monotheism, Polytheism, Monolatry, or Henotheism? Toward an Assessment of Divine Plurality in the Hebrew Bible** - Michael S. Heiser (Bulletin for Biblical Research)

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated in late 20th-early 21st century OT scholarship attentive to Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) parallels (Ugaritic, Mesopotamian texts) and the rise of the "divine council" paradigm in biblical studies.
 - Aimed at academics and advanced students debating how to classify Israelite religion relative to surrounding polytheistic cultures.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Hebrew Bible presents a calibrated form of divine plurality: a sovereign YHWH exercises supremacy over a council/assembly of other divine beings. This reality is neither simple polytheism nor later christological/trinitarian plurality; it is best described within categories such as monolatry/henotheism with distinctive Israelite constraints.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of key biblical texts (e.g., Psalm 82; Job 1-2; 38:7; 89:6; Genesis 1; Deut 32) that reference a divine assembly or "sons of God."
 - Comparative analysis with ANE evidence (Ugaritic theophanies, council motifs) to show shared imagery and functional roles for subordinate divine beings.
 - Lexical and syntactic attention to terms such as elohim and bene elohim to demonstrate semantic range and contextual specificity.
 - Theological assessment: distinction between belief in a single sovereign deity and recognition of other cosmic beings - how Israelite religion negotiates exclusivity of worship and divine plurality.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - ANE philologists (Ugaritic scholars), proponents of strict monotheism, defenders of classical monotheistic reading of the HB, and recent advocates of the divine-council model.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (OT witness to divine plurality), implications for later revelation and NT treatment of supernatural beings, boundaries with Trinitarian theology, covenantal monotheism.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The HB articulates a monotheistic center that canonically recognizes a subordinate divine plurality - a theological stance that demands nuance: affirm YHWH's unique sovereignty while acknowledging an Israelite worldview populated by other spiritual beings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong reliance on ANE comparative data to rehabilitate biblical texts that mention a divine assembly rather than dismiss them as rhetorical or secondary.
 - Precision in distinguishing ontological status: subordinate divine beings are real within the biblical worldview but do not share YHWH's unique covenantal status or exclusive worship.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that either (a) read the HB as strictly univocal monotheism that eliminates any divine plurality language, or (b) convert the council motif into evidence for classical polytheism or for proto-Trinitarian doctrine.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Advocates nuanced category use: prefers terms like **monolatry/henotheism** and the "divine council" paradigm over blunt labels of polytheism.
 - Clarifies functional vs. ontological plurality - many divine characters function as agents without undermining YHWH's supremacy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in OT studies and popular treatments; widely cited in discussions on the "divine council" and in evangelical debates about spiritual beings.
 - Provoked pushback from those defending an uncompromised classical monotheism and from scholars who caution against overreliance on ANE parallels.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a rigorous exegetical framework for treating texts that mention other divine beings.
 - Serves as a corrective to simplistic monotheism/polytheism poles and as a useful bridge for interdisciplinary work (philology, comparative religion, theology).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monotheism**
 - Israel's doctrinal claim of one supreme God; Heiser shows this coexists with recognition of other beings.
- **Polytheism**
 - Multiple gods as independent rivals; Heiser argues HB rejects full-blown polytheism in favor of hierarchical plurality.
- **Monolatry**
 - Worship of one god without denying existence of others; a primary descriptive category Heiser endorses.
- **Henotheism**
 - Reverence for one god as supreme among others; useful for capturing Israel's stance toward YHWH and other divine beings.
- **Divine plurality**
 - The biblical motif of multiple divine agents or beings (council members, "sons of God") functioning under YHWH's rule.
- **Divine council**
 - The assembly motif (Ps 82; 89:5-7; Job 1-2) where YHWH presides over subordinate heavenly beings.
- **Elohim**
 - Semantically variable: can denote the one God, gods in general, or divine beings; context determines usage.
- **Bene elohim / "sons of God"**
 - Designation for divine council members or celestial beings; Heiser emphasizes consistent councilic function.
- **Psalms 82**
 - Central case study: judgment pronounced by YHWH on the divine assembly; used to show accountability structure within the council.
- **Genesis 1 / "Let us"**
 - Example of plural language in creation; Heiser situates it within councilic idiom rather than Trinitarian proof from OT alone.
- **Job 38:7 / cosmic witnesses**
 - Demonstrates early poetic references to heavenly assembly rejoicing at creation.
- **Second Temple literature / NT reception**
 - Later Jewish and Christian texts rework council imagery; Heiser notes the NT reinterprets spiritual beings but does not equate them with the Trinity.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an exegetical model for reading plurality language in the OT (divine council paradigm).
 - As a definitional resource in debates over Israelite monotheism vs. henotheism/monolatry.
 - As a cautionary pivot in Trinitarian discussions: OT plurality language informs but does not supply a direct Trinitarian ontology; NT development must be treated on its own terms.
