### TITLE
The Gospel and the Second Coming - B. B. Warfield (Selected Shorter Writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton milieu; conservative Reformed evangelicalism engaged with rising dispensational premillennialism, popular apocalypticism, and liberal critiques that treated prophecy as failed prediction.
 - Warfield writes as a systematic and pastoral theologian defending the coherence of historic gospel proclamation in the face of perceived delays in eschatological fulfillment.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The apparent delay of the Parousia does not invalidate the Gospel; rather, divine purpose and pastoral fidelity require continued proclamation and doctrinal sobriety. Eschatological postponement must be read through Scripture's Christ-centered teleology, not speculative chronology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical diagnosis: surveys New Testament assurances about the Second Coming and addresses charges that non-fulfillment (delay) proves error.
 - Theological reframing:
 - Argues the delay is explicable as divine forbearance and purpose (not human miscalculation).
 - Maintains continuity between present gospel ministry and future consummation - the present kingdom is real though not yet exhausted.
 - Polemic and pastoral application:
 - Rejects sensationalist chronology and alarmist systems that make gospel urgency contingent on timetables.
 - Counsels steadfast proclamation and sober expectation until parousia actualizes consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit interlocutors: dispensational premillennialists (popular late-19th/early-20th-century currents), popular apocalypticists claiming imminent signs, and rationalist critics who saw prophecy as disproven by delay.
 - Scriptural exegesis concentrated on Pauline and Johannine eschatological texts; appeals to Reformed confessional tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (Second Coming, consummation)
 - Christology (eschatological Lordship)
 - Revelation and prophecy (fulfillment and interpretation)
 - Providence (divine patience/longsuffering in eschatological timing)
 - Soteriology/pulpit praxis (relation of proclamation to expectation)

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center: the temporal postponement of Christ's return must be read as providential patience within a Christocentric gospel that unites present redemption with assured consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses pastoral and ecclesial consequences of eschatological formulations: theology must serve faithful proclamation, not feed sensationalism.
 - Integrates systematic theology and Biblical exegesis to show delay is providential, not proof of prophetic failure.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensationalist literalism and sensational chronologizing that separate present gospel work from future consummation.
 - Counters liberal and rationalist claims that prophecy's delay invalidates revelation by locating prophetic fulfillment in God's timeline and purposes.

- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Recasts "delay of the Parousia" as theological category: not a failure but a moral-pastoral test and divine forbearance.
 - Avoids technical innovations in millennial taxonomy; rather, he reclaims classical Reformed emphases on present-but-not-yet kingdom realities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in conservative Reformed and Princeton-influenced circles as a model of sober eschatology and pastorally responsible polemic.
 - Used historically against early 20th-century premillennial and popular apocalyptic trends; continues to inform Reformed critiques of dispensational chronology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students as a model of combining exegetical care, doctrinal firmness, and pastoral application on eschatology.
 - Enduring as a corrective to speculative eschatologies and as a resource for defending the coherence of gospel proclamation amid "delay."

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia** - the New Testament term for Christ's coming; Warfield insists on reading its promises in continuity with gospel proclamation.
- **Delay of the Parousia** - treated as a theological category: divine forbearance that requires pastoral integrity, not theological capitulation.
- **Imminence** - contested notion; Warfield rejects timetabling but affirms that the Second Coming remains a real, expected event that should govern witness.
- **Consummation** - the eschatological culmination of redemption; Warfield emphasizes assuredness despite postponement.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / present-but-not-yet** - implicit framework: kingdom realities are presently operative yet await final fulfillment.
- **Providence / Longsuffering** - God's temporal patience explains delay and preserves opportunity for repentance and mission.
- **Premillennialism / Dispensationalism** - principal object of Warfield's critique: he opposes literalistic chronologies and sectarian schedules that distort gospel aim.
- **Millennial views** - Warfield situates himself within classical Reformed readings (critical of literalist millennial schemes) while focusing more on gospel-eschatology than on technical millennial taxonomy.
- **Prophecy fulfillment** - Warfield insists on interpretive restraint: fulfillments must be judged by canonical Christological horizons, not by sensational date-setting.
- **Advent / Parousia ethics** - the moral and pastoral implications of expectation: readiness, perseverance, and uninterrupted proclamation.
- **Eschatological judgment** - linked to consummation; delay is not remission of judgment but extension of redemptive opportunity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition source: clarifies "delay of the Parousia" theologically for Reformed eschatology.
 - As polemic: deployed against dispensational and sensationalist eschatologies.
 - As an exegetical-pastoral model: exemplifies how to read Second Coming texts with sober theology that sustains ongoing gospel ministry.
