### TITLE
Adam, Christ, and Covenant (essay in Biblical Hermeneutics: Five Views) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Appears in a methodological volume on biblical interpretation (late 20th / early 21st century context). Gaffin writes from conservative Reformed evangelical academia, reacting against reductionist or non-forensic readings of Pauline hamartiology and newer exegetical trends that undercut traditional federal-covenantal readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture presents Adam and Christ as two covenantal heads whose representative actions determine the legal standing and fate of humanity: Adam's transgression establishes the origin and juridical standing of sin for his descendants; Christ's obedience effects redemption by counter-imputation. The chief problem is to ground the nature and origin of sin exegetically and theologically in corporate/representative (federal) headship rather than in purely individualistic, biological, or merely typological accounts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchor: close reading of Romans 5 and Genesis, arguing for Paul's use of Adam as federal head.
 - Distinguishes between two senses of "inheritance" from Adam:
 - biological/ontological (corruption, propensity to sin); and
 - forensic/judicial (imputed guilt and condemnation).
 - Affirms covenantal framework:
 - Covenant of Works: Adam's probation as representative covenantal duty; failure brings corporate judicial consequences.
 - Covenant of Grace: Christ as second Adam effecting reversal by representative obedience and imputed righteousness.
 - Emphasizes union with Christ as the operative soteriological category that mirrors Adam's headship but effects reconciliation rather than condemnation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformation and classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, Westminster standards) as background; Paul (esp. Romans), Genesis narrative central; critiques of eminent modern exegetes who minimize forensic language or reject federal headship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Hamartiology (nature and origin of sin), covenant theology (works and grace), Christology (Christ as federal head), soteriology (imputation, justification), ecclesiology indirectly via corporate solidarity.
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's theological center of gravity: the biblical testimony interprets human sin and salvation juridically and covenantally through representative headship - Adam's transgression institutes the origin of sin's judicial consequences; Christ's representative obedience institutes their reversal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on a juridical/representative account of original sin rather than reducing it to merely natural depravity or socio-biological inheritance.
 - Strong coupling of covenantal categories (covenant of works / covenant of grace) with Pauline exegesis as the canonical way to read Adam-Christ typology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that: (a) treat Adam only as a moral example; (b) locate original sin primarily in biological transmission without judicial imputation; (c) secularize Paul's language into merely existential or corporate solidarity without forensic consequences.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the distinction between ontological corruption and forensic imputation in the doctrine of original sin, using covenantal language to anchor both.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used and respected in conservative Reformed seminaries as a robust defense of federal theology; influences treatments of Romans and systematic hamartiology; read less sympathetically by scholars favoring non-forensic or narrative-theological readings.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for integrating rigorous exegesis with classical Reformed covenant theology; remains a staple resource for teaching the origin of sin and the logic of atonement in confessional contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam as Federal Head**
 - Adam acts representatively; his single transgression yields judicial consequences for his descendants.
- **Christ as Second Adam**
 - Christ's obedient representation undoes Adam's juridical effects and secures justification for the elect.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The covenantal structure in which Adam stood as representative with a promise contingent on obedience.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The covenantal response in which Christ fulfills and reverses the covenantal failure through obedience and imputation.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of guilt/condemnation (Adam) and righteousness/merit (Christ) to persons on the basis of representative standing.
- **Original Sin**
 - Dual aspect: inherited corruption (ontological) and inherited guilt/condemnation (forensic); origin traced to Adam's federal action.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The relational reality that grounds salvific imputation; the positive correlate to Adamic union that grounds condemnation.
- **Representative / Corporate Solidarity**
 - The corporate-legal bond tying individuals to a head, used to explain shared destiny in sin or salvation.
- **Forensic / Judicial Categories**
 - Emphasizes legal metaphors (condemnation, justification) as primary in Pauline argumentation.
- **Typology (Adam-Christ)**
 - Typological relation: Adam as type prefiguring Christ, but with real juridical consequences, not merely illustrative.
- **Seminal vs. Federal Explanation**
 - Distinguishes biological/seminal propagation of a corrupt nature from federal, representative imputation of guilt.
- **Romans 5 Exegesis**
 - Interprets key Pauline text as canonical support for federal headship and imputation.
- **Hamartiology**
 - The theological analysis of the nature and origin of sin anchored in covenantal and forensic terms.
- **Canonical-Grammatical Hermeneutic**
 - Methodological insistence that the canonical texts, read in grammatical-historical context, sustain federal-covenantal conclusions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source for federal headship and imputation in systematic treatments of original sin and atonement.
 - Polemical resource against non-imputational, strictly biological, or merely existential accounts of sin.
 - Exegetical model for reading Romans 5 within a covenantal framework and as a pivot between hamartiology and soteriology.
