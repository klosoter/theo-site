### TITLE
The New Testament and the Parousia: A Critical Assessment - Grant Macaskill

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary academic New Testament studies; engages late 20th-early 21st century debates on early Christian eschatology.
 - Positioned against both classical apocalyptic readings (Schweitzer, Jeremias) and mid-century shifts (Ladd, "inaugurated eschatology"), dialoguing with recent figures (e.g., N. T. Wright, Bauckham).
- **Central thesis**
 - The NT corpus exhibits a plurality of parousia discourses; careful historical-literary and theological reading shows parousia language functions pastorally, rhetorically, and theologically rather than reducing uniformly to a single timetable problem (imminent/fulfilled/delayed).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: surveys the historiography of parousia studies and identifies oversimplifying binaries (e.g., imminent vs. delayed).
 - Exegesis: close readings across genres (Gospels, Pauline letters, Johannine and general epistles, Revelation) highlighting diverse usages and adaptive language.
 - Theological synthesis: argues for a model that integrates **performative** and **eschatological** dimensions - parousia language both proclaims future consummation and enacts present identity/ethics for communities.
 - Methodological claim: recommends a mixed method combining historical-critical reconstruction, literary-contextual analysis, and systematic-theological sensitivity.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: Albert Schweitzer, Joachim Jeremias.
 - Mid-century and modern: G. E. Ladd (inaugurated eschatology), J. D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright, Richard Bauckham; also Pauline scholarship on "delay of the Parousia."
 - Uses canonical texts as primary data with attention to intertextual Jewish apocalyptic backgrounds.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology** (central), with implications for **Christology**, **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, **revelation**, and **hermeneutics**.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological gravity: parousia in the New Testament is both a future hope and a present formative reality - an embodied proclamation that shapes belief, ethics, and communal identity rather than a single dated prediction to be solved.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes the **performative** and **pastoral** functions of parousia language (what such speech does in communities) over merely chronological problem-solving.
 - Emphasizes intra-canonical diversity: avoids forcing harmonization across NT genres.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects Schweitzer-style monism about imminent apocalyptic expectation by showing rhetorical adaptation after Jesus and within Pauline communities.
 - Nuances Ladd/Wright debates: affirms inaugurated eschatology's insight of "already/not yet" but resists reading this as a single explanatory model for all NT parousia texts.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts parousia as a **multi-functional category**: prophetic announcement, ethical summons, communal identification marker, and future event.
 - Proposes taxonomy of parousia usages (e.g., imminent-warning, judgment-vision, realized-presence, liturgical-hope).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Read favorably in contexts seeking to bridge historical exegesis with systematic concerns; cited in discussions on Pauline eschatology and pastoral implications of delay.
 - Adopted by instructors as a corrective to simplistic eschatological binaries; less traction among strictly confessional or narrowly technical philological specialists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching advanced students how to read eschatological language contextually and theologically; equips readers to link NT texts to contemporary pastoral and doctrinal questions about hope and temporality.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia**
 - Primary NT term for "coming"; treated as a flexible category with future and present functions.
- **Imminence**
 - Expectation of an immediate coming; shown to be variably endorsed, moderated, or reinterpreted across NT texts.
- **Delay of the Parousia**
 - The problem-theory that the expected coming did not occur; Macaskill reframes this as a pastoral-theological issue rather than merely a historical anomaly.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - "Already/not yet" framework; affirmed in part but critiqued as insufficiently discriminating for all parousia uses.
- **Realized eschatology**
 - Claims elements of the eschaton are present now; Macaskill locates genuine instances but distinguishes them from purely metaphorical usages.
- **Apocalyptic expectation**
 - Jewish background informing NT language; Macaskill stresses diversity in apocalyptic motifs and their rhetorical deployment.
- **Judgment / consummation**
 - Two prominent foci of parousia texts; the book parses where texts emphasize one over the other and why.
- **Kerygma (eschatological proclamation)**
 - How parousia language functions as preaching that shapes identity and practice.
- **Performative speech-act**
 - Analytic tool: parousia assertions do things (constitute community, call to repentance) beyond forecasting.
- **Pauline eschatology**
 - Treated as complex: uses imminent language, ethical urgency, and theological re-interpretation in light of delay.
- **Johannine eschatology**
 - Emphasizes realized aspects (eternal life now) alongside future coming motifs.
- **Liturgical/communal hope**
 - Parousia tied to worship and communal memory, not merely futurist speculation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating genre-sensitive readings of parousia texts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic reflection linking Christology, eschatology, and ecclesiology.
- As **polemic** against simplistic "failed-prophecy" narratives and against one-size-fits-all eschatological models.
