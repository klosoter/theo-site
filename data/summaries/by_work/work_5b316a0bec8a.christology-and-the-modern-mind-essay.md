### TITLE
Christology and the Modern Mind (essay) - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century theological landscape; post-WWI/WWII existential crisis, rise of secular scientific culture, and modern philosophical currents (existentialism, hermeneutics, analytic critiques).
 - Tillich writes as a Protestant theologian engaging modern philosophic anthropology and the "modern mind" shaped by anxiety, autonomy, and skepticism toward metaphysics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can a meaningful, intellectually credible Christology be articulated for the modern mind without surrendering the core Christian claim that in Christ God is present and saving?
 - Tillich proposes a non-metaphysical, ontological re-interpretation: Christ as the revelation of the **Ground of Being** and the incipient "New Being" that answers human estrangement.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modernity rejects metaphysical substance-theology; human experience is characterized by existential estrangement and anxiety; traditional Christological categories read literally fail to address contemporary existential needs.
 - Reinterpretation:
 - Move from substance-language (God as a being among beings) to **Ground-of-Being** language (God as "Being-itself").
 - Read incarnation and atonement ontologically: Christ reveals the power of being that overcomes estrangement by establishing "New Being."
 - Treat kenosis not as literal loss of divine attributes but as symbolic description of God's self-manifestation within finite existence.
 - Method: correlation of existential questions and theological answers; symbols mediate ultimate meaning; avoid naïve metaphysics while retaining theological substance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit conversation with classical Christology (Chalcedon), modern theologians (Kierkegaard, Schleiermacher), neo-orthodoxy (Bultmann, Barth), and kenotic theologians. Philosophical engagement with existentialists (Heidegger, Jaspers) and German idealism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central): incarnation, divinity and humanity of Christ, revelation as ontological disclosure.
 - **Doctrine of God**: transcendence reinterpreted as depth-dimension / Ground rather than supreme being-in-the-world.
 - **Revelation and symbol**: theological language as expressive, not merely literal or mythic.
 - **Atonement and salvation**: understood existentially as the establishment of New Being that heals estrangement.

- **Closing line**
 - Tillich's essay reframes Christology for the modern mind by replacing metaphysical guarantees with an ontological, symbolic Christology: Christ is the manifestation of the Ground of Being who creates "New Being" as the answer to human estrangement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Ground-of-Being** as pivot: God is not a supreme "being" but the condition for the possibility of being; Christ reveals this Depth.
 - **Existential/ontological soteriology**: salvation framed as entrance into New Being rather than forensic transaction.
 - Kenosis handled **symbolically**: self-emptying is meaningful as description of divine self-manifestation within finitude, not as divine de-ontologizing.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against literal kenotic readings that imply loss of divine attributes: Tillich insists on an ontological reading that preserves divinity understood as Ground rather than metaphysical substance.
 - Against both naive metaphysical theism and reductive secular readings: offers a third way that neither collapses God into finite being nor leaves theology unintelligible to modern thought.
 - In contrast to Bultmann's radical demythologizing, Tillich retains a robust ontological claim-though expressed through symbol.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Elevation of "New Being" and "Ground of Being" as central Christological categories.
 - Use of correlation method to align existential questions with theological answers.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in liberal and neo-orthodox circles seeking a credible modern Christology.
 - Provoked critique from conservative literalists (on symbolicism) and from some neo-orthodox theologians (on relativizing dogmatics).
 - Served as a bridge for later continental theology and pastoral theology engaging existential concerns.

- **Enduring value**
 - Persistent resource for theologians engaging modernity, secularization, and the critique of metaphysical theism.
 - Helpful corrective to simplistic kenotic literalism and to approaches that divorces Christology from human existential need.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ground of Being** - God as the ontological ground; not a super-being but the ultimate condition of existence; revealed in Christ.
- **New Being** - The ontological reality effected by Christ; the existential restoration/transformation of estranged human existence.
- **Correlation** - Method linking existential questions of modernity to theological answers; theology speaks meaningfully only insofar as it addresses the human situation.
- **Existential estrangement** - Human condition of anxiety, meaninglessness, and separation from the Source; the problem Christ addresses.
- **Symbolic language** - Theological claims are expressed via symbols that mediate ultimate meaning rather than literal propositional statements.
- **Kenosis (Tillich's critique)** - Not literal subtraction of divine nature; kenosis is a symbolic way to speak of God's self-limitation in manifestation within finite being.
 - Contrast: Tillich vs. ontological kenoticists (who propose real alteration in divine being).
- **Incarnation (ontological reading)** - God manifesting as finite presence that reveals the Ground and makes New Being possible.
- **Atonement (existential)** - Healing of estrangement; entrance into New Being rather than juridical exchange.
- **Demythologizing (qualified)** - Tillich reinterprets mythic forms symbolically but retains ontological claims.
- **Being-itself / Being-itself language** - Terminology to shift away from substance-metaphysics to existential ontology.
- **Ultimate Concern** - Religious significance oriented to the Ground; faith as orientation to ultimate meaning.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for ontological Christology and the concept of Ground of Being.
 - As a **polemic** against literal kenotic theories that imply loss of divinity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in modern theology curricula to connect existential philosophy and Christology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading incarnation and atonement symbolically while retaining doctrinal seriousness.
