### TITLE
Exegesis and Hermeneutics - Kevin Vanhoozer (chapter in The Cambridge Companion to Evangelical Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical theological conversation (late 20th-early 21st century). Situated within debates about the role of biblical scholarship for doctrinal formulation, reacting to historical-critical reductionism, capacious canonical and theological readings of Scripture, and renewed interest in hermeneutics among evangelicals.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Exegesis and hermeneutics are not neutral technical tasks but the indispensable theological mediations that make Scripture speak to doctrine; properly understood, hermeneutics secures the link between biblical theology (the Bible's witness) and systematic theology (doctrinal ordering).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Modern exegetical practice often fragments Scripture or subordinates it to external philosophical or methodological agendas, impoverishing doctrinal retrieval.
 - Recovery: Rehabilitate a **theological interpretation of Scripture** that reads texts as divinely intended communicative acts and as canonically located within the church's rule of faith.
 - Method: Combine careful historical-critical exegesis with speech-act theory (text as divine communicative action), canonical awareness (text in the canon), and credal/doctrinal sensitivity (text read for doctrine).
 - Integration: Show how robust exegesis supplies the content for systematic theology without reducing biblical particularity to schema; exegesis and systematics have a reciprocal, disciplining relationship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Conversations with canonical critics (e.g., Brevard Childs), narrative and theological readers (e.g., Hans Frei), philosophers of language (speech-act theorists such as J.L. Austin and John Searle), and contemporary evangelical exegetes and theologians. Critiques aimed at both historical-critical reductionists and purely confessionalist readers who bypass rigorous exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration (authority of Scripture as divine speech), epistemology of theology (how texts inform belief), covenant and redemptive-historical contours (biblical theology), Christology (textual christological witness), implicitly the Trinity (as governing theological reading and doctrine formation).
- **Closing line:** Properly conceived, exegesis and hermeneutics are theological acts that recover Scripture as divine communicative presence, thereby enabling faithful biblical theology to undergird and correct systematic theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats Scripture primarily as divine **communicative action** rather than merely propositional content or ancient data.
 - Stresses a disciplined reciprocity between careful historical exegesis and doctrinal formulation-neither dominates nor is reduced to the other.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects historical-critical approaches that neutralize divine agency and historicize away theological force.
 - Pushes back against purely confessionalist or dogmatic approaches that neglect philological and historical constraints.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Brings speech-act theory into evangelical hermeneutics as a way to conceptualize inspiration and authorial intention while preserving linguistic and historical responsibility.
 - Reframes the biblical/systematic divide as a dialectical partnership rather than a hierarchical dependency.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among evangelical scholars advocating theological interpretation of Scripture; cited in debates about canon, doctrine formation, and the role of philosophical linguistics in theology.
 - Served as a bridge for evangelicals engaging continental hermeneutics and analytic philosophy of language.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a practicable model for training students to do exegetical work with doctrinal sensitivity.
 - Offers a defensible middle way for evangelicals seeking fidelity to biblical particulars and to systematic coherence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Exegesis:** Close, historical-grammatical study of biblical texts; the primary source-input for theology.
- **Hermeneutics:** Theory and practice of interpretation that governs how texts are understood as theological speech.
- **Theological interpretation of Scripture:** Reading texts with overt attention to divine authorship and ecclesial/doctrinal ends.
- **Speech-act theory:** Philosophical framework treating utterance as action (locution, illocution, perlocution) applied to Scripture to account for divine communicative agency.
- **Authorial intention:** Recovery of what the divine and human authors meant; balanced so as not to collapse God into human author or vice versa.
- **Canonical criticism:** Attention to the place of texts within the canon; canonical shape guides theological reading.
- **Biblical theology:** The Bible's own redemptive-historical storyline and theological emphases as the content-basis for doctrine.
 - Contrast: Biblical theology supplies concrete scriptural witness; systematic theology orders and articulates that witness into coherent doctrinal loci.
- **Systematic theology:** The disciplined ordering and articulation of doctrines informed and corrected by exegetical results.
- **Inspiration / Revelation:** Scripture as divinely authoritative speech; interpreted through linguistic and theological means.
- **Communicative action / divine speech:** Emphasis on Scripture as God speaking to hearers, not merely data about God.
- **Contextualization:** The hermeneutical requirement to locate text historically, literarily, and canonically before doctrinal use.
- **Reader/community reception:** Role of the believing community and tradition in shaping legitimate theological readings.
- **Doxology:** Theology as worshipful response; hermeneutics as oriented toward right praise and life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for theological interpretation and for relating exegesis to doctrine.
- As a **polemic** against both reductionist historical criticism and uncritical confessionalism.
- As an **exegetical model** integrating linguistic, canonical, and speech-act insights for classroom and research practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology-arguing for disciplined reciprocity rather than strict separation.
