### TITLE
The Platform Society: Public Values in a Connective World - José van Dijck (van Dijck et al., platform studies; late 2010s)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the late 2010s amid heated debates about platform power, GDPR and EU regulatory initiatives, and rising critique of surveillance capitalism.
 - Situated at the intersection of media studies, sociology, and policy analysis; engages contemporary struggles over governance of digital infrastructure.
- **Central thesis**
 - Platforms are not neutral tools but infrastructural actors that reconfigure public values (privacy, equality, democratic participation, solidarity, and institutional trust) and thereby reshape what counts as the public sphere.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic phase: maps how social, economic and political life is being "platformized" - i.e., reorganized around proprietary connective infrastructures and data practices.
 - Analytic phase: identifies mechanisms of change (datafication, algorithmic governance, intermediated publics, economic extraction).
 - Normative phase: argues for a reassertion of public values through policy, design, and civic institutions; proposes regulatory and institutional remedies (e.g., interoperability, transparency, accountability).
 - Empirical grounding: uses case studies of major platforms, regulatory responses, and civic consequences across Europe and beyond.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on and converses with media and social theorists (Habermas on the public sphere; Castells on network society), and platform scholars (Gillespie, Couldry, Zuboff) as well as policy debates in the EU and scholarly work on surveillance capitalism.
- **Doctrines treated (theologically relevant)**
 - Public theology and the common good: rethinking how communal goods are constituted in digitally mediated publics.
 - Social ethics and human dignity: critique of commodification/datafication of persons.
 - Ecclesiology and civic formation: implications for how communities (including churches) form, witness, and exercise stewardship in a connective world.
 - Authority, mediation, and truth: questions about epistemic authority and trust in mediated publics.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Platforms restructure the conditions of communal life and moral agency; theological practice must attend to infrastructural power and advocate public-value design and governance as part of faithful stewardship of the common good.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **infrastructural analysis**: platforms as socio-technical infrastructures that mediate publicness rather than mere services or markets.
 - Marries empirical policy analysis with normative concern for public values, especially in the European regulatory frame.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contra techno-utopian narratives that celebrate connectivity as inherently progressive; also corrects techno-pessimism by offering institutional remedies rather than fatalism.
 - Diverges from market-focused accounts by centering **public values** (rather than purely economic metrics).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized analytics around **platformization** and the phrase **connective world** as more capacious than "network society."
 - Emphasizes **platform publics** (publics constituted through platform affordances) and **algorithmic governance** as key categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in media studies, digital sociology, and policy circles; shaped EU and civil-society conversations about platform regulation.
 - In theological and Reformed social-ethical contexts, increasingly used as a resource for analyses of the common good, public theology, and ecclesial responses to digital mediation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a concise, policy-attuned account linking platforms to normative public values - invaluable for courses in public theology, ethics of technology, and church governance in digital contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Platformization** - process by which economic, social, and political activities are reoriented around platforms and their governance rules.
- **Connective world** - framing that emphasizes mediated, infrastructural connectivity as constitutive of contemporary publics.
- **Public values** - normative goods (privacy, equality, solidarity, democratic participation, trust) used as a yardstick for evaluating platforms.
- **Datafication** - turning human action into quantifiable data streams that enable extraction and predictive governance.
- **Algorithmic governance** - the use of algorithms to mediate, rank, and regulate social interaction and visibility.
- **Platform publics** - publics that emerge within and through the affordances, rules, and economies of platforms.
- **Infrastructural power** - capacity of platform architectures to shape behavior, institutions, and civic capacities.
- **Attention economy** - model of value production based on capturing and monetizing human attention.
- **Surveillance capitalism** - the commercial logic of profiting from mass-scale behavioral data (dialogues with Zuboff).
- **Interoperability** - policy and design principle recommended to reduce lock-in and enable contestability.
- **Transparency / accountability** - governance ideals invoked for algorithms, content moderation, and corporate practices.
- **Commons / public sphere** - revived concern for non-proprietary spaces and practices that sustain democratic deliberation.
- **Platform capitalism** - economic formation where platforms mediate markets and labor relations.
- **Digital civicness** - capacities for civic participation enabled or constrained by platform design.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - standard reference for defining "platformization" and "platform publics" in interdisciplinary work.
- **Normative pivot** - frequently cited in public theology and social ethics as a framework for articulating the common good in a digital age.
- **Policy and pedagogy** - used in regulatory debates and classroom settings as a bridge between empirical description and concrete institutional remedies.
