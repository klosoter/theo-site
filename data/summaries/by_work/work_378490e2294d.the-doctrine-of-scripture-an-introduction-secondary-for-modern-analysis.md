### TITLE
The Doctrine of Scripture: An Introduction - Francis Turretin (selection/modern analysis from Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑17th century Reformed scholasticism (Turretin: 1623-1687), Geneva academy milieu; post‑Reformation polemical stage against Roman Catholic casuistry, Arminianism/Remonstrantism, Socinianism and emergent rationalism.
 - Work here is a focused modern introduction/extraction presenting Turretin's locus on Scripture for contemporary analysis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the sole, infallible rule of faith and life because it is divinely authored; its authority is ultimately **self‑attesting** by virtue of God as author and the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit, complemented by external evidences and ecclesiastical recognition.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: Scripture as "special revelation" - written, propositional, normative communication from God.
 - Inspiration: affirms **verbal plenary inspiration** - God is the principal author while true human authors remain real authors.
 - Inerrancy & infallibility: Scripture is without error in all it affirms (proper to its intention) and cannot fail in its saving purpose.
 - Canonicity: criteria for recognizing canonical books - apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholic reception, and divine attestation.
 - Authority & self‑attestation:
 - Primary claim: Scripture has intrinsic authority because God wrote it; therefore it requires no further autonomous external imprimatur.
 - The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit gives believers immediate assurance of Scripture's divine origin and authority; this testimony does not add new revelation but certifies what revelation already objectively is.
 - Role of the church: the church recognizes and defends the canon but is not the ultimate author or creator of Scripture's authority.
 - Polemical moves: refutes Socinian denials of deity/inspiration, counters Catholic claims that the Church is the final arbiter, and resists rationalist reductions of Scripture to mere human literature.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Roman Catholic scholastics, Remonstrants/Arminians, Socinians, and emergent rationalists/Deists.
 - Draws on Scripture itself, patristic appeals, Reformation confessions (e.g., Westminster), and Reformed scholastic method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), inspiration, canonicity, authority, inerrancy, infallibility, perspicuity, sufficiency, ecclesiology (as it relates to recognition/defense of the canon).

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin centers the doctrine: Scripture alone is God's propositional self‑disclosure and carries intrinsic, self‑attesting authority, confirmed to believers by the Spirit and defended against all external challenges.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, systematic defense of **self‑attestation**: Scripture does not need ecclesiastical imprimatur to be authoritative because its divine authorship and internal marks suffice.
 - Clear articulation of the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** as certifying faith's assent without making that testimony a separate revelatory source.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Roman Catholicism: denies that the Church is the fountain of canonical authority.
 - Against Socinians/rationalists: refuses to reduce Scripture to mere moral or historical writings; insists on supernatural origination.
 - Against crude dictation theories: affirms divine authorship without collapsing human agency - a guarded verbal‑plenary model.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise scholastic distinctions: intrinsic vs. extrinsic notes of canonicity; objective authority vs. subjective assurance; divine authorhood vs. human composition.
 - Use of juridical metaphors (testimony, attestation) to ground epistemology of Scripture.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major influence in Reformed seminaries and subsequent conservative evangelical theology (Princeton school onward).
 - Provided a durable polemical and pedagogical template for defenses of inerrancy and canonicity into modern debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - A compact, rigorous model for teaching the epistemic status of Scripture: balances objective claims about divine authorship with pastoral concern for believer's assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self‑attestation (autopistia)** - Scripture's property of bearing its own authority because God is its author; requires recognition, not conferment.
- **Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** - subjective certifying work in believers that confirms Scripture's divine origin; not a second revelation.
- **Verbal plenary inspiration** - all words and parts of Scripture are inspired by God while human authors' styles remain.
- **Inerrancy / infallibility** - Scripture is free from error in all that it intends to teach; reliable in doctrine and salvation.
- **Canonicity** - criteria and process by which books are recognized as Scripture (apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholic reception, divine attestation).
- **Objective authority vs. subjective assurance** - authority belongs objectively to Scripture; assurance is subjectively granted by the Spirit to believers.
- **Intrinsic vs. extrinsic notes** - intrinsic marks (miracles, prophecy, internal coherence) vs. extrinsic recognition (church reception) used to argue canonicity.
- **Revelation (special)** - propositional, salvific disclosure in Scripture distinguished from general revelation.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - Scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and obedience.
- **Perspicuity / clarity** - core teachings of Scripture are clear to the faithful; complex passages require learned interpretation.
- **Divine authorship / human agency** - theological model preserving both true divine origination and genuine human writing.
- **Ecclesial recognition** - church's role as guardian and recognizer, not originator, of canonical authority.
- **Polemic method** - scholastic-elencitic method: thesis, objections, solutions - used to defend Scripture doctrinally.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulations of inspiration, inerrancy, and canonicity.
 - As a **polemic manual** against anti‑scriptural positions (Catholic magisterium claims, Socinianism, rationalism).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in epistemology of faith: clarifying how objective revelation and subjective assurance cohere in Christian belief.
