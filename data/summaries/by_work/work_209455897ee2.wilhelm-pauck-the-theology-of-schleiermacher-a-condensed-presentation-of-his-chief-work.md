### TITLE
**Wilhelm Pauck, "The Theology of Schleiermacher: A Condensed Presentation of His Chief Work" - Friedrich Schleiermacher (as presented and assessed by Pauck)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Schleiermacher: late 18th-early 19th century (post-Kantian, German Romanticism); seeks a new Protestant theology grounded in religious experience and historical consciousness.
 - Pauck: 20th-century historian-theologian who condenses and interprets Schleiermacher for modern readers, situating him between Enlightenment criticisms and nineteenth-century confessionalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must begin with the immediate *feeling of absolute dependence* (religious self-consciousness), and from that ground construct doctrine organically; revelation is God's disclosure within this religious consciousness, culminating in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure (Pauck's condensation of Schleiermacher)**
 - Starting point: description of religion as a distinct mode of feeling (not primarily dogma or morality).
 - Revelation: not propositional transmission but the event of God becoming present to human religious consciousness.
 - Christology: Christ as the perfect exemplar and mediator of the divine-human religious life; redemption restores community with God by renewing religious feeling.
 - Ecclesiology and means of grace: church, preaching, sacraments, and prayer are formative and communicative practices that cultivate the Christian consciousness.
 - Method: historical-psychological exegesis-Scripture and tradition interpreted as expressions of Christian religious life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Kantian epistemology and critiques; influence of Fichte and Romantic thinkers; reaction to orthodox Lutheran/Reformed scholasticism and Enlightenment deism.
 - Pauck frames Schleiermacher against later critics (e.g., Barth) and subsequent liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, religion (religious consciousness), Christology, atonement (restoration/communion), ecclesiology, sacraments (baptism, eucharist), prayer, justification and sin reinterpreted as states of relation rather than forensic categories.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's theological center of gravity (as Pauck presents it): theology as a science of the religious life - doctrine as clarification and cultivation of the original feeling of dependence, with Christ and the church as its historical realization.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Primary theological datum is experiential: *feeling of absolute dependence* rather than metaphysical proofs or propositional revelation.
 - Sacraments and preaching are formative practices that shape consciousness, not automatic channels dispensing objective grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves away from scholastic forensic models of atonement and juridical paradigms of justification.
 - Responds to Enlightenment rationalism by relocating authority in lived religious experience and historical continuity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Elevates the category of *religious consciousness* and reframes revelation as *manifestation* within human feeling.
 - Recasts church as community of believers defined by shared religious life rather than merely institutional markers.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Deeply influential in liberal Protestantism and historical theology; catalyzed modern hermeneutics and experiential emphases.
 - In Reformed circles met with ambivalence: critics accuse subjectivism and downplaying of objective divine sovereignty; yet later theologians (including Barth in complex ways) were thrown into new engagement with the problem of experience vs. revelation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating historical-critical exegesis, pastoral concerns, and liturgical praxis.
 - Useful corrective to purely propositional accounts of faith; continues to shape debates on baptismal practice, ecclesial identity, and the nature of the means of grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence**
 - The foundational religious datum; immediate awareness of relation to the divine.
- **Religious consciousness**
 - The subject-matter of theology; the lived, communal form of the feeling of dependence.
- **Revelation as manifestation**
 - Revelation occurs when God is experienced within religious consciousness, especially in Christ.
- **Christ as revealer/mediator**
 - Christ embodies and enacts the perfect religious consciousness; the model for Christian life.
- **Atonement / redemption**
 - Restoration of communion and religious feeling, not principally juridical satisfaction.
- **Church**
 - Community of those sharing Christian consciousness; institutionally formed by common worship, prayer, and ministry.
 - Relates to debates over **Nature And Marks Of The Church**: Schleiermacher emphasizes shared life and worship more than juridical marks.
- **Sacrament**
 - Symbolic, communal acts that cultivate and make present Christian consciousness; efficacy tied to participants' receptivity.
 - Relevant to **Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer**: preaching and sacraments are formative practices, not mechanical dispensers of grace.
- **Baptism**
 - Sign of initiation into the Christian community; supports corporate identity.
 - Pertinent to **Baptism Mode Infant vs Believers Efficacy**: Schleiermacher accepts infant baptism as corporate inclusion but insists on subsequent personal appropriation-efficacy is not automatic.
- **Preaching**
 - Central formative means for articulating and nurturing religious consciousness.
- **Prayer**
 - Essential communal and individual practice evidencing and deepening dependence on God.
- **Historical consciousness / hermeneutics**
 - Scripture and doctrine must be historically interpreted as expressions of religious life.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theology rooted in religious experience and for understanding sacraments as formative practices.
 - As a **polemic** against scholastic forensic models (useful in debates on baptismal efficacy and church marks).
 - As an **exegetical and pedagogical model** for integrating historical-critical method with pastoral theology and liturgical formation.
