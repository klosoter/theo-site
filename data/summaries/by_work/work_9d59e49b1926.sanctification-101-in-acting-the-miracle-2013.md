### TITLE
Sanctification 101 - chapter in Acting the Miracle (2013) by Kevin DeYoung

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published within a pastoral, evangelical-Reformed essay collection (Acting the Miracle, 2013). Written for pastors, students, and informed laity reacting to modern misunderstandings of holiness and Christian living.
 - Milieu: 21st-century Reformed evangelicalism reacting to both pietistic/perfectionist and antinomian tendencies.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Sanctification must be understood as both **definitive (positional)** and **progressive (experiential)**. Confusion of these categories produces error: either legalism/perfectionism or complacent "easy-believism."

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Clarify two senses of sanctification: what God has done in Christ (positional) and what God is doing in the believer (progressive). 
 - Explain theological basis: union with Christ grounds definitive sanctification; the Spirit and means of grace drive progressive growth. 
 - Identify common errors and correctives: reject instantaneous perfection and reject a purely moralistic gradualism that severs grace from obedience. 
 - Provide pastoral application: call to mortification and vivification, use of Word, prayer, sacraments, and perseverance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit and explicit interlocution with Reformational resources (Calvin, Westminster tradition), Puritan praxis (mortification/vivification), and contemporary voices who emphasize either radical instantaneous sanctification or purely behavioral change. Also contrasts with Wesleyan perfectionism and Keswick-type triumphalism.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Soteriology (justification and sanctification), Pneumatology (Spirit's role), Christology (union with Christ), Covenant theology (means and promises), Ethics (holiness, good works), Assurance and perseverance.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Sanctification is a gracious, Spirit-wrought reality rooted in union with Christ that both secures our status before God and summons us to lifelong, gospel-powered moral transformation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Clear, pastoral insistence on holding **definitive and progressive sanctification together** rather than privileging one over the other. 
 - Reframes sanctification as primarily an identity issue (who we are in Christ) that issues in transformation (what we become).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against perfectionist schemes that collapse progressive sanctification into a single decisive event. 
 - Opposes antinomianism or "faith-only" readings that divorce justification from moral transformation. 
 - Contrasts with Wesleyan-Holiness and Keswick narratives by insisting sanctification is not merely a subsequent crisis experience but the Spirit's ongoing work within union with Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - No radical neologisms; however, the chapter stresses modern catechetical clarity - distinguishing legal status language (positional) from progressive practical language - as an interpretive instrument for pastors and teachers.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Received as a lucid, pastoral primer in Reformed and broader evangelical circles. Useful for small groups, pastoral training, and introductory courses on sanctification. Appreciated for balance and anti-sentimental realism.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models how to teach sanctification with theological precision and pastoral warmth, making it durable as a classroom or sermon-source for clarifying common pastoral confusions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification (definitive):** Believer's declared holiness in Christ; positional, forensic effect of union with Christ. 
- **Sanctification (progressive):** The Spirit-driven, lifelong process of becoming holy in practice and character. 
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological ground of both definitive and progressive sanctification; believers are "in Christ." 
- **Mortification:** Deliberate putting to death of sin; ethical discipline rooted in grace. 
- **Vivification:** The Spirit's enlivening work producing new obedience and virtue. 
- **Means of grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer, church discipline - instruments by which progressive sanctification is wrought. 
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration that secures one's status before God; distinguished from but related to sanctification. 
- **Perseverance:** Continuation in faith and holiness, presupposed by genuine sanctification. 
- **Law and Gospel distinction:** Law convicts and guides; Gospel empowers and justifies - crucial for avoiding legalism and antinomianism. 
- **Assurance:** Sense of confidence grounded in Christ's work and evidential transformation in the believer. 
- **Holiness:** Both positional standing and ethical imperative; living out of the covenant identity. 
- **Progressive growth (practical ethics):** Ordinary disciplines and trials as contexts where sanctification is worked out. 
- **Christian perfection (rejection of absolute):** Treated critically - ultimate perfection reserved for glorification, not present experience.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a concise **definition source** clarifying definitive vs progressive sanctification for courses and sermons. 
 - As a **polemic** against both perfectionist and antinomian errors, useful in pastoral counseling and doctrinal correction. 
 - As a practical **exegetical-pastoral model** for teaching means of grace and spiritual growth within a Reformed framework.
