### TITLE
**The Doctrine of the Covenants in Reformed Theology - Francis Turretin (with secondary orientation to Geerhardus Vos)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th‑century Reformed scholasticism (Turretin: Institutio Theologiae Elencticae; Geneva/Italian Reformed context). Reaction against Amyraldian compromise, Remonstrant influences, and Roman sacramentalism. Later reception reframed by 19th-20th‑century redemptive‑historical theologians like Geerhardus Vos.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Covenants are the juridical, gracious framework by which God administers redemptive relations with humanity: a strict federal structure (Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace) ordering law, promise, sanction, and sacramental signs.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Define covenant: essential elements (parties, obligations/conditions, promises/sanctions, signs/seals).
 - Distinguish covenants by type and administration: Covenant of Works (pre‑Fall, conditional) vs. Covenant of Grace (post‑Fall, promissory/mercy‑based).
 - Explicate continuity and distinction among biblical covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New): unity of grace across administrations with legal/typological differences.
 - Locate Christ as covenant head: personal fulfillment, federal imputation (obedience/penal); sacraments as seals of covenant promises.
 - Practical corollaries: effect on law/gospel relation, assurance, church polity, and sacramental practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Calvin, earlier Reformed scholastics, Westminster standards. Polemical interlocutors: Amyraut (hypothetical universalism), Remonstrants, Roman Catholic theology (merits/sacraments).
 - Secondary lens: Geerhardus Vos - emphasizes organic, historical unfolding of covenant; used to critique and expand Turretin's scholastic categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and covenanted revelation, soteriology (imputation, union with Christ), Christology (mediatorial headship), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church), sacramentology (signs/seals: baptism, Lord's Supper), law and moral order.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's covenant doctrine centers the **federal, juridical union of believers with Christ** as the controlling key to Scripture's promises, law, and sacraments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorously juridical/federal idiom: covenants treated as legal transactions with obligations, sanctions, and formal signs.
 - Clear analytical separation of covenant substance (promise/obligation) from covenant administration (types, signs).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Sharp rebuttal of Amyrautian universalism and any weakening of Christ's exclusive mediatorial role; defense of definite atonement in covenantal terms.
 - Polemic against Roman sacramental efficacy: sacraments as seals, not innate channels of grace apart from Christ's promise.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precision in distinguishing covenant from covenant administration; systematic use of federal headship and imputation language applied across redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in later Reformed circles (Princeton, Scottish and North American Presbyterianism); used as a resource for confessional teaching and polemics.
 - 19th-20th‑century scholars (notably Vos) reinterpreted covenant categories into a redemptive‑historical, organic schema, prompting fruitful dialogue and critique.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of scholastic clarity for teaching covenant structure, sacramental theology, and doctrinal precision; indispensable for comparing juridical and organic readings of covenant theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (foedus/foedus operum vs. foedus gratiae)**: legal pact language; two principal kinds-Works and Grace.
- **Covenant of Works**: pre‑Fall arrangement between God and Adam; conditional obedience as ground of covenant life.
- **Covenant of Grace (see Covenant Of Grace)**: promissory covenant established after the Fall; salvation by promise fulfilled in Christ.
- **Federal Headship / Federal Union**: Christ as covenant‑head; Adam as representative in Covenant of Works; imputation of obedience/penalty central.
- **Imputation**: crediting of Christ's obedience/penalty to believers legally within the covenant.
- **Administration of the Covenant**: successive historical forms (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New); unity of substance, difference in form and sign.
- **Signs and Seals (Sacraments)**: baptism and Lord's Supper as visible seals of covenant promises; efficacy tied to God's promise and Christ's work, not to ritual alone.
- **Typology**: historical‑typological reading of Old Testament institutions as foreshadowing Christ; analogy maintained but not confused with ontological identity.
- **Promise vs. Condition**: Covenant of Grace primarily promissory (monergistic), Covenant of Works conditional (merit based).
- **Law and Gospel relation**: law maintains civil/sanctifying role but does not replace covenantal promise as ground of salvation.
- **Biblical Covenants (see Biblical Covenants)**: classification and theological function of specific covenants in redemptive history.
- **Assurance and Perseverance**: assurance grounded in covenantal promises and the objective imputation of Christ's work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical federal categories (Works/Grace, imputation, signs).
 - As **polemic** against Amyraldian, Arminian, and Roman positions on atonement and sacramentality.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading covenant texts through juridical-federal categories and sacramental theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in comparing scholastic federalism (Turretin) with redemptive‑historical/organic covenant theology (Vos).
