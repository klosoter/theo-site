### TITLE
Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church - Richard Bauckham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century New Testament scholarship: renewed interest in the historical Jesus, the role of Jesus' family (the desposyni) in the primitive church, and sociological approaches to early Christian authority. Bauckham writes as part of a movement integrating philology, patristics, and social-history methods.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Epistle of Jude should be read in the light of the historical position of Jesus' relatives in the Jerusalem church; Jude the author is best identified with one of those relatives (a member of Jesus' family network), and the letter's rhetorical shape and concerns reflect that positional authority and an ecclesial response to internal corruption and eschatological delay.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Careful identification work: compares the name "Jude" in the NT and patristic tradition to reconstruct the author's likely identity within Jesus' kin.
 - Textual and intertextual analysis: examines Jude's use of Jewish apocalyptic traditions (notably 1 Enoch and Assumption of Moses) and how such citations function rhetorically.
 - Social-historical reading: situates the relatives as an authoritative kin group within Jerusalem; reads the epistle as enforcing boundary, discipline, and orthodoxy in a community facing false teachers and the problem of the parousia's delay.
 - Patristic corroboration: uses early church writers (Eusebius, Epiphanius, etc.) to map tradition about the desposyni and leadership roles (e.g., James the Just).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: the Epistle of Jude, New Testament references to "brothers of the Lord" (e.g., James), 1 Enoch and Assumption of Moses.
 - Patristic witnesses: Eusebius, Epiphanius, other church fathers who discuss Jesus' relatives.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: prior identifications of Jude, treatments that marginalize Jesus' family, and studies on the delay of the Parousia.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology**: authority and leadership in the Jerusalem church tied to kinship.
 - **Christology**: implications of Jesus' family-membership for early Christian identity and memory.
 - **Eschatology**: the epistle's stance toward false teachers and ethical laxity in the face of the delayed Parousia.
 - **Canon and revelation**: status and rhetorical use of apocalyptic writings (e.g., 1 Enoch) in early Christian proof-texting.
- **Closing line**
 - Bauckham reframes Jude as a text produced by a kin-based, authoritative actor within the early church whose polemical appeal to apocalyptic tradition and disciplinary tone is best understood against the twin pressures of false teaching and the delay of the Parousia.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Jesus' relatives not as marginal curiosities but as institutional agents whose social location shaped earliest ecclesial claims and texts.
 - Highlights Jude's informed use of Jewish apocalyptic sources as normative rhetorical resources, not merely borrowings.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that detach Jude from Jesus' family network or interpret the epistle solely as generic pseudepigraphal anti-heresy; pushes back on scholars who underplay the social authority of the desposyni.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the social category "desposyni" (relatives of the Lord) to analyze how kinship functioned as an organizing principle for authority and orthodoxy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential for research on the historical role of Jesus' family, the sociological reading of early Christianity, and studies on Jude as an embedded, context-sensitive text.
 - Adopted across historical, exegetical, and theological studies that reassess leadership and canonical formation in Jerusalem.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating textual exegesis, patristic testimony, and social-historical reconstruction; indispensable for courses on the New Testament background, ecclesial authority, and early Jewish-Christian relations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Jude (the author)** - identified as a relative of Jesus and a functioning authority figure; not merely an anonymous polemicist.
- **Desposyni** - technical term for Jesus' relatives; central to Bauckham's social-historical reconstruction of early leadership.
- **Jerusalem church / James the Just** - focal institutional locus where kinship and authority intersect.
- **1 Enoch & Assumption of Moses** - apocalyptic texts cited or alluded to by Jude; used rhetorically to condemn false teachers.
- **False teachers / intramural opponents** - the primary targets of Jude's polemic; ethical and doctrinal corruption in community life.
- **Delay of the Parousia** - contextual pressure prompting disciplinary and interpretive moves; Bauckham reads Jude's urgency as a response to postponed eschatological expectation.
- **Kinship authority** - the mechanism by which familial ties confer ecclesial legitimacy and disciplinary reach.
- **Patristic tradition (Eusebius, Epiphanius, etc.)** - sources for reconstructing identification and reputation of Jesus' relatives.
- **Apocalyptic argumentation** - method by which Jude invokes heavenly witnesses and traditions to settle community disputes.
- **Boundary maintenance** - sociological function of Jude's rhetoric: defining orthodox group identity and practice.
- **Pseudepigraphy vs. authentic authorship** - Bauckham leans toward a socially situated, authentic authorial identity rather than anonymous pseudonymity.
- **Christological memory** - the role of family testimony in preserving and enforcing traditions about Jesus.
- **Ecclesial discipline** - concrete pastoral-theological concern expressed in Jude's warnings and exhortations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "desposyni" and the social importance of Jesus' relatives.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Jude's intertextuality with Jewish apocalyptic literature.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting kinship, authority, and responses to the delay of the Parousia in early Christian theology and practice.
