### TITLE
The Son Who Learned Obedience: A Theological Case Against the Eternal Submission of the Son (D. Glenn Butner Jr., 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the post-2010s debate over Trinitarian relations sparked by contemporary complementarianism (notably Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware) and orthodox critics (Kevin Giles, Paul Helm).
 - Addresses a theological-political moment where intra-Trinitarian language is mobilized for social/ethical prescriptions (male headship vs. egalitarianism).
 - Situated within conservative Reformed/evangelical scholarly discourse but argues for recovery of classical Trinitarian orthodoxy.

- **Central thesis**
 - The obedience attributed to the Son in Scripture is properly understood as **economic and incarnational** (learned in human life and suffering), not as evidence of an **eternal ontological subordination** of the Son to the Father. ESS (eternal submission of the Son) is a theological error.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical core
 - Key texts (especially Hebrews 5:8, Philippians 2:5-11, John 14:28, John 5:19) are read in their incarnational/economic context; "learned obedience" and statements of the Son's dependence point to the Son's humanity and role, not to eternal inferiority.
 - Historical-theological core
 - Surveys patristic and medieval sources, arguing the classical tradition did not teach ontological subordination and that ESS is a modern imposition on the tradition.
 - Doctrinal synthesis
 - Reaffirms Chalcedonian Christology and Nicene formulations: **ontological equality** (same divine nature) maintained; any **functional subordination** belongs to the economic Trinity and is temporal.
 - Polemical application
 - Challenges the use of ESS as a scriptural warrant for gender hierarchies; insists that normative social ethics cannot be grounded on a contested Trinitarian ontology.

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Primary contemporary interlocutors: Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware (proponents of ESS).
 - Opponents and resources cited: Kevin Giles, Paul Helm, historical figures from the Cappadocians to Augustine and the Reformers.
 - Scripture is chief authority; classical creeds and Christological formulations play decisive roles.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs. economic), Christology (incarnation, kenosis, obedience), revelation and Scripture, ecclesiology/ethics insofar as Trinitarian doctrine informs gender roles.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically decisive claim: **the Son's obedience is learned in time and role; eternal equality of the Trinity remains non-negotiable.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places Hebrews 5:8 ("learned obedience") at the center of the debate as a hermeneutical fulcrum; insists learning implies temporality and incarnation.
 - Sharp analytic distinction between ontological (immanent) and economic relations, with the economic read strictly as temporal and role-based.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects contemporary ESS advocates by showing their move from economic texts to eternal ontology is exegetically and historically unjustified.
 - Contrasts modern ESS theology with the classical patristic and Reformation consensus that guarded divine equality.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces and clarifies the phrase "learned obedience" as a theological category tying kenosis, suffering, and human development of the Son to economic, not ontological, subordination.
 - Advocates a disciplined hermeneutic rule: statements about relations in the economy should not be transposed wholesale into the immanent Trinity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by critics of ESS as a concise, exegetically driven refutation; cited in subsequent Reformed debates on gender and Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Reception mixed among complementarians-some revise ESS formulations in response; others defend ESS against Butner's critique.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective for students and pastors who must navigate Trinitarian language used for ecclesial ethics.
 - Models careful biblical-theological method combining text, tradition, and systematic categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Submission of the Son (ESS)**: The thesis that the Son is eternally submissive to the Father in authority and will; target of Butner's critique.
- **Economic Trinity**: The Father-Son-Spirit relations as revealed in salvation-history and Scripture; for Butner this is temporal and role-oriented.
- **Immanent Trinity**: The inner life of God apart from creation; Butner defends its ontological equality and opposes importing economic relations into it.
- **Ontological equality**: Equality of being/nature among Father, Son, Spirit; non-negotiable in Butner's account.
- **Functional subordination**: The idea that the Son may be subordinate in role or function; allowed by Butner only in the economic sense, not ontologically.
- **Kenosis / Philippians 2**: The Son's self-emptying and incarnation; central to Butner's exegesis that obedience is learned in incarnation.
- **Hebrews 5:8 ("learned obedience")**: Key hinge-text used to argue obedience belongs to the incarnate Son's temporal life.
- **Incarnation as hermeneutical key**: The interpretive move that locates statements about the Son's dependence in the context of Christ's human experience.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling**: Emphasized implicitly to defend consubstantial unity and mutual equality.
- **Patristic tradition**: Read selectively against modern readings that claim patristic support for ESS.
- **Grudem / Ware**: Contemporary proponents of ESS engaged and critiqued.
- **Kevin Giles / Paul Helm**: Critics whose work provides allied arguments against ESS.

How this work is used:
- As a clear **exegetical model** for reading "submission" texts incarnationally (Hebrews, Philippians, John).
- As a **polemic** and reference in debates over grounding gender roles in Trinitarian ontology.
- As a **definition/source** for distinguishing economic vs. immanent claims in Trinitarian theology.
- As a **teaching resource** to re-center classical orthodoxy against modern innovations in Trinitarian relational language.
