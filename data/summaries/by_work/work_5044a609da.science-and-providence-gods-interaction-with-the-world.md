### TITLE
Science and Providence: Gods Interaction With The World - John Polkinghorne

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century science-theology dialogue written by a Cambridge theoretical physicist turned Anglican priest; situated in the post-war conversation about quantum mechanics, chaos theory, and the theological recovery of providence. Addresses a scientific milieu skeptical of interventionist miracles and a theological milieu seeking a credible doctrine of divine action.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God providentially interacts with the world without violating the integrity of nature or overriding secondary causes; divine action is compatible with contemporary physics, especially quantum indeterminacy and complex systems theory.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Clarify theological desiderata: a God who is both sovereign and respectful of created autonomy; avoid deism and intrusive interventionism.
 - Survey contemporary physics: deterministic classical physics vs. indeterminacy in quantum mechanics and sensitivity in chaotic systems.
 - Propose a model of **non-interventionist divine action (NIDA)**: God acts by influencing probabilities, boundary conditions, or top-down constraints rather than by inserting new physical forces.
 - Recast miracles as extraordinary providential events intelligible within the framework of natural law (e.g., low-probability but not law-violating occurrences).
 - Argue for a compatibility between classical theism (God as Creator and sustainer) and the empirical norms of science.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Quantum physicists and philosophers of science (Heisenberg-style indeterminacy), Thomistic and classical theistic resources (secondary causation), critics including deists, strict interventionists, and some process theologians; Polkinghorne dialogues with both scientific literature and theological tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Providence and divine action (primary focus); creation and sustaining of the world; philosophy of laws of nature; limited treatment of eschatology and revelation insofar as they bear on providential governance. Christology/Trinity are background commitments rather than central analytical themes.
- **Closing line:** God providentially governs a world of genuine autonomy by ordering possibilities and probability within natural processes, so divine action is neither coercive intervention nor absent deism, but an intelligible, theologically robust ordering of freedom and chance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on scientific literacy: theological claims about action must be informed by contemporary physics.
 - Emphasis on **probabilistic divine guidance**: God influences distributions of outcomes rather than contravening physical law.
 - Persistent advocacy for **secondary causation**-God respects the causal integrity of created agents and processes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects deistic non-involvement and supernatural interventionism that contradicts empirical regularities.
 - Distinguishes itself from process theology: retains classical theistic notions of God's transcendence and initiative while accepting relational interaction.
 - Challenges simplistic readings of miracles as law-breaking, arguing instead for intelligible providential models.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Operational use of contemporary physics terms (indeterminacy, chaos, boundary conditions) in theological description of divine action.
 - Practical articulation of NIDA as a middle path between interventionism and silent deism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in science-theology conversations as a measured, credentialed bridge between physics and theology.
 - Influential among Anglican and broadly ecumenical theologians who seek compatibility with scientific method; contested by process theologians and some conservative interventionists.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a durable model for teaching providence that is both scientifically informed and theologically traditional.
 - Valuable exemplar of interdisciplinary method: rigorous engagement with primary scientific concepts while retaining classical theological commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Providence:** God's ongoing governance and ordering of creation; the central theological locus of the book.
- **Divine action:** The manner in which God causally relates to the world; Polkinghorne emphasizes non-coercive, probability-shaping action.
- **Non-interventionist divine action (NIDA):** Core formulation-God acts within, not by breaking, natural processes.
- **Secondary causation:** The doctrine that creatures have genuine causal efficacy; God sustains but does not replace creaturely causality.
- **Quantum indeterminacy:** Physical unpredictability at micro-level offered as a locus where God could act without law-violation.
- **Top-down causation:** The idea that higher-level (holistic, informational, or divine) constraints can influence lower-level physical outcomes.
- **Laws of nature:** Treated as descriptive regularities that do not preclude providential ordering of probabilities or boundary conditions.
- **Miracles (reinterpreted):** Exceptional providential events intelligible as extremely low-probability outcomes under natural processes rather than intrusions.
- **Probability-guidance:** Phrase denoting God's influence on statistical distributions of events rather than deterministic control.
- **Autonomy of creation:** The theological principle that created order possesses genuine independence and responsibility.
- **Classical theism (contextualized):** Polkinghorne retains core classical commitments while stressing relational engagement with the world.
- **Chaos theory / sensitivity to initial conditions:** Used to show how small providential influences can have large outcomes in complex systems.
- **Epistemic humility:** A methodological stance: theology must remain open to scientific revision and avoid simplistic cosmological claims.
- **Anthropic considerations (secondary):** Occasional use in arguing for fine-tuning intelligible to providential ordering.
- **Boundary conditions:** Physical parameters God may influence to realize providential intentions without breaking lawlike regularities.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary models of divine action that respect scientific constraints (NIDA).
 - As a **polemic** against interventionist and deistic extremes in discussions of providence and miracles.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in science-theology curricula: model for integrating quantum physics, chaos theory, and classical theology.
