### TITLE
The Trinity and the Shape of Christian Teaching (essay in Advancing Trinitarian Theology, 2014) - Fred Sanders

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within a contemporary resurgence of Trinitarian theology (late 20th-early 21st c.) that seeks to recenter doctrine and practice around the Trinity.
 - Sanders writes as part of an ecumenical conversation engaging classical patristic retrieval, Barthian dialectical theology, and modern "social" Trinitarian debates.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Trinitarian doctrine is not merely one doctrine among many but the formative "shape" that should order Christian teaching: how we articulate revelation, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and worship must be determined by the Triune God as revealed.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Affirm the primacy of the Trinity for theological method: doctrine-arrangement should mirror the relational and revelatory life of the Triune God.
 - Revisit Rahner's Rule ("the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity") as a methodological dictum for letting God's works ground our doctrine of God.
 - Recover and recalibrate Barth's reformulation of Rahner - emphasizing revelation's priority and guarding against speculative ontology that divorces the inner life of God from concrete divine self‑revelation in Christ.
 - Propose a mediated model: let the economic (God's actions in history, especially in Christ) and the immanent (God's inner life) inform one another without collapsing into speculative identity nor into a purely functional reading of God.
 - Show practical consequences: how Trinitarian ordering alters pedagogy (what to teach first), pastoral theology, and sacraments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Key patristic witnesses (Athanasius, Cappadocians), Augustine implicitly as classic reference points.
 - Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule) and Karl Barth (Barth's reformulation) are central interlocutors.
 - Contemporary trinitarian scholars and the social-Trinitarian debate are presupposed as background conversation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (primary), Christology, revelation, ecclesiology, soteriology, doctrinal method and pedagogy.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Triune God as known in revelation should structurally govern Christian teaching: doctrine must be Trinitarian in form as well as content.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Stresses the *shape* of teaching (organizational and pedagogical form), not merely propositional content; theology's architecture must reflect Trinitarian relations.
 - Integrates Rahner's heuristic with a Barthian insistence on revelatory priority - neither speculative collapse nor mere doctrinal minimalism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects readings that treat Rahner's Rule as license for speculative ontology detached from revelation.
 - Pushes back on some strands of social Trinitarianism that reduce persons to functional roles or social analogy without robust grounding in historical revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses "shape" as a theological-educational diagnostic: an intentionally programmatic term for the ordering of loci and ministries.
 - Proposes a middle path that treats Rahnerian insight and Barthian caution as complementary rather than strictly opposed.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed and evangelical circles seeking a doxological, Christocentric Trinitarianism that avoids speculative metaphysics.
 - Cited in debates over curricular ordering in seminaries and in efforts to revivify worship and preaching with Trinitarian centrism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Practical for theological pedagogy; clarifies how Trinitarian commitments reshape other loci.
 - Serves as a balanced corrective between speculative and overly pragmatic accounts of the Trinity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian shape** - The organizational form of theology and practice determined by the Triune God; an organizing metaphor for curriculum and doctrine.
- **Rahner's Rule** - The heuristic that the economic Trinity (God's works) corresponds to the immanent Trinity (God's inner life); used as a starting point for letting revelation inform doctrine.
 - Sanders affirms the rule as heuristic, not an ontological identity thesis to be applied uncritically.
- **Barth's reformulation** - Barth's insistence that revelation (canonical, Christ‑centered) must govern any talk of the immanent Trinity.
 - Sanders uses Barth to check speculative excess in Rahner's application.
- **Economic / Immanent Trinity** - Distinction between God's actions in history and God's inner life; key to methodological balance in Sanders's argument.
- **Revelation‑primacy** - The principle that Christian theology must begin from God's self‑disclosure in Christ and Scripture rather than from autonomous metaphysical claims.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling)** - Emphasized as an example of relational ontology that should inform ecclesiology and worship.
- **Social Trinitarianism** - Contemporary emphasis on the persons' relation; Sanders acknowledges its insights but warns against superficial social analogies.
- **Doxological ordering** - The idea that worship and doxology provide the normative context for doctrinal ordering and theological method.
- **Christological termination** - Teaching must be ordered toward the revelation of the Son; Christ's person and work anchor the Trinity's doctrinal effects.
- **Theological pedagogy** - Practical outworking: how seminaries and churches sequence theological instruction in light of Trinitarian shape.
- **Analogy and attribution** - The way predicates are applied to God; Sanders insists on careful analogical talk grounded in revelation.
- **Canonical constraint** - Scripture as the decisive locus where economic acts disclose the immanent life of God.
- **Doctrinal architecture** - A programmatic term for how doctrines should be arranged so they bear Trinitarian form.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: for clarifying the relation of economic/immanent Trinity in teaching.
 - As a **polemic**: against non‑revelatory speculative accounts and against reductive social analogies.
 - As an **exegetical/pedagogical model**: used to reorder curricula, homiletics, and sacramental theology around Trinitarian revelation.
