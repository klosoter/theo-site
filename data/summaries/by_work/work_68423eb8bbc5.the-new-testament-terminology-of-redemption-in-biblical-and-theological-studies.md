### TITLE
**B. B. Warfield - "The New Testament Terminology of Redemption"** (in Biblical and Theological Studies)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton milieu; conservative Reformed scholarship reacting to rising historical-critical and liberal tendencies.
 - Warfield brings rigorous philological and dogmatic method to bear on biblical-theological vocabulary; essay appears amid broader apologetic and systematic work.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament uses a clustered, technically precise vocabulary for "redemption" that, taken together, defines the character of Christ's saving work: juridical payment, liberation from bondage, reconciliation of persons, and acquisition/possession by God.
 - The study opposes reductive readings (e.g., mere moral influence or purely existential notions) by showing terms presuppose legally efficacious and substitutionary action.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lexical survey of principal Greek terms in NT corpus (apolutrosis, lutron/luoo, exagorazo/agorazo, hilasterion/hilaskomai, katallagē/katallasso, soteria, etc.).
 - Semantic distinctions mapped onto theological categories: ransom/price, purchase/liberation, propitiation/expiation, reconciliation/imputation, possession/creation.
 - Pauline usage given primary weight: redemption functioning within federal/representative framework (Adam/Christ parallel), covenantal transactions, and forensic justification.
 - Correlative treatment of Jewish (LXX, rabbinic) background and early Christian rearticulation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Pauline corpus, Synoptic and Johannine texts, LXX terminology; secondary: patristic and Reformation interpreters (implicitly Calvin), contemporary critics who downplay substitutionary/forensic elements.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology broadly; atonement (penal/substitutionary emphases), justification, reconciliation, covenant theology (federal headship), Christology (mediatorial role), ecclesiology minimally (possession, adoption).
- **Closing line**
 - NT redemption vocabulary, properly read, anchors a Christ-centered soteriology that is juridical, vicarious, efficacious, and covenantal - not merely moral or metaphorical.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Warfield insists on a mosaic of metaphors: no single word exhausts "redemption"; theological clarity requires holding ransom/payment, purchase/liberation, propitiation, and reconciliation together.
 - Strong linking of lexical nuance to dogmatic loci (especially penal substitution and imputation).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against sentimental or liberal reinterpretations that strip "redemption" of legal and substitutionary content.
 - Correction of overly narrow treatments that collapse all terms into a single metaphor (e.g., treating "redemption" solely as deliverance).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic mapping of Greek technicalities onto covenantal transactions and federal headship; attention to ownership language (purchase, possession) as soteriological marker.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed/evangelical circles as a model combining careful exegesis with dogmatic clarity; often cited in defenses of penal substitution.
 - Critiqued by some modern scholars for overriding sociocultural and narrative aspects in favor of juridical categories.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for pastors, exegetes, and systematicians who require a compact resource linking NT vocabulary to classical doctrines; exemplary for philology-informed theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **apolutrosis** - "redemption" in the sense of release effected by a price; emphasizes removal from bondage via payment.
- **lutron / lutroo** - "ransom"/"to ransom"; concrete idea of price paid to free someone.
- **exagorazo / agorazo** - "to buy back" or "to purchase"; stresses acquisition and transfer of ownership for God.
 - Contrast: exagorazo often implies recovery of something once lost; agorazo more broadly purchase.
- **hilastērion / hilaskomai** - "propitiation"/"atonement"; focuses on placating divine wrath and removing divine hostility.
- **katallagē / katallasso** - "reconciliation"; relational restoration between God and humans; correlated with justification and peace.
- **sōtēria / sozo** - "salvation"/"to save"; umbrella term spanning deliverance, healing, and eschatological preservation.
- **dikaioō / dikaiosynē** - "justify" / "righteousness"; juridical declaration often linked to imputation and redemption results.
- **douleia / doulos** - "bondage / slave"; used rhetorically to set up need for ransom/liberation imagery.
- **peripoiesis (possession/possession by God)** - acquisition of a people; redeemed as God's possession.
- **ransom-price vs. sacrifice metaphors** - Warfield shows both transactional (price) and cultic (sacrifice/propitiation) language operate together.
- **federal headship (Adam/Christ typology)** - redemption vocabulary presupposes representative transaction: Christ as covenantal head reversing Adam's failure.
- **forensic vs. relational senses** - constant interplay: legal declarations (justification) and relational renewal (reconciliation) are complementary.
- **eschatological consummation** - many redemption terms carry both present efficacy and future consummation (already/not yet).
- **backgrounds (LXX, Jewish idiom)** - Warfield uses these to show continuity and reapplication in the NT.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: standard reference for precise NT meanings of "redemption" terms in dogmatic writing.
 - Polemic: deployed against non-substitutionary or purely moral-influence theories of the atonement.
 - Exegetical model: exemplar for integrating lexical study, LXX background, and Pauline covenantal theology as a unified hermeneutic.
