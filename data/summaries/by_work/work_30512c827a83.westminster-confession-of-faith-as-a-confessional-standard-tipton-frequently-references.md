### TITLE
Westminster Confession of Faith - confessional standard (as referenced by Lane Tipton)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Drafted by the Westminster Assembly (1643-1649); first published 1646 (Scotland 1647). Emerged amid the English Civil Wars, Puritan/Reformed reform movements, and debates with Arminianism, Roman Catholicism, and Socinianism. Established as a Presbyterian confessional standard in England, Scotland, and later Reformed churches worldwide.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To provide a comprehensive, binding summary of biblical, Reformed doctrine that orders church life, worship, sacraments, government, and Christian piety under the sovereignty of God and the authority of Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Systematic exposition built on Scripture as the infallible rule; begins with God, Scripture, and creation, proceeds through fall, covenant, Christ, salvation, sacraments, church, and last things.
 - Integrates theological loci through **covenant framework** (covenant of works -> covenant of grace) as the structural key linking creation, law, and redemption.
 - Affirms classical Trinitarian orthodoxy: **one God in three persons**, personal distinctions without division of essence; persons work in economy of redemption.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Assembly divines (e.g., Alexander Henderson, Samuel Rutherford among contributors), drawing on Nicene/Chalcedonian formulations, Reformation confessions (Heidelberg, Belgic), and contemporary polemics against Remonstrants, Socinians, and Roman Catholics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture, God (Trinity), providence, creation, fall, original sin, covenant theology, Christology, justification, sanctification, effectual calling, perseverance, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), church government (Presbyterian), civil magistrate, last things.
- **Closing line:** The Confession centers the life of the church and believer on God's sovereign covenantal ordering, grounded in Scripture and framed by a classical Reformed Trinitarianism that unites the ontological truth of three persons with their economic roles in redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Systematic **covenant schema** (works -> grace) as the hermeneutical key for redemptive history and soteriology.
 - Careful balancing of **personal distinctions** in the Trinity with staunch insistence on unity of substance, eternity, and equality of the persons.
 - Practical ecclesial clarity: precise stipulations on ministry, discipline, and sacraments aimed at confessional uniformity.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Arminian and Socinian denials of unconditional election and orthodox Christology.
 - Opposes Roman sacramentalism by emphasizing sacraments as **signs and seals**, not intrinsic channels of grace apart from faith.
 - Affirms civil magistrate authority in religious matters more robustly than later strict separationists.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematizing the covenant of works and covenant of grace as central theological categories.
 - Precise legal-political language for church-state relations reflective of 17th-century concerns.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Definitive confessional standard for Presbyterian churches; major influence on Reformed theology in Britain, North America, and globally.
 - Continues as a touchstone in contemporary Reformed debates (soteriology, sacramentology, Trinitarian formulations).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Concise, organized exposition of Reformed doctrine useful for doctrinal instruction, confessional formation, and adjudicating intra-Reformed disputes (including ontological vs economic Trinity debates).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (WCF II):** "One God in three persons" - affirms unity of substance and real distinctions of persons; foundation for Christology and Spirit's work.
 - **Ontological vs Economic Trinity:** WCF language supports both: affirms eternal relations (ontology) by one substance and eternity; describes distinct roles in redemption (economy) by attributing particular works to Father, Son, Spirit.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** Structural pair linking Adamic probation and redemptive promise in Christ; central hermeneutic for law and gospel.
- **Scripture (sufficiency & authority):** Infallible rule for faith and life; basis for all doctrine and church discipline.
- **Predestination / Election:** Unconditional eternal election to life; consonant with effectual calling and perseverance.
- **Justification by faith alone:** Forensic declaration of righteousness received through faith in Christ's merits.
- **Effectual Calling:** Spirit-enabled, sovereign calling that results in regeneration and faith.
- **Sacraments (signs and seals):** Baptism and Lord's Supper are visible means of grace, not channels apart from faith; infant baptism permitted within covenant families.
- **Church government (Presbyterian):** Rule by elders and assemblies; discipline and public worship regulated by Scripture.
- **Civil Magistrate:** Granted authority to promote true religion and restrain false; reflects 17th-century confessional polity.
- **Providence / Sovereignty:** God's governing of all creatures and events according to counsel and will.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed orthodoxy on the Trinity and covenant theology (used by Tipton and others to anchor confessional claims).
- As a **polemic** against Arminianism, Socinianism, and Roman Catholic sacramentalism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading redemptive history through covenant categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and sacramental practice for confessional Reformed communities.
