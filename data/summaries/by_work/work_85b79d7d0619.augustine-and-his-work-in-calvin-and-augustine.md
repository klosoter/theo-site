### TITLE
**Augustine and His Work** (essay by B. B. Warfield) - in Calvin and Augustine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Reformed scholarship (Princeton school). Warfield engages Augustine from a confessional, Protestant vantage to defend traditional doctrines of sin and grace against modernizing and semi-Pelagian tendencies.
 - Polemic occasioned by renewed 19th-20th century critiques of Augustine as anti-humanistic or fatalistic; Warfield writes to correct misconceptions and recover Augustine as a biblically rooted theologian.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Augustine is the indispensable defender of biblical grace against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials; his work recovers a coherent doctrine of human depravity, divine initiative, and efficacious grace without reducing human responsibility.
 - Warfield argues Augustine's position is scripturally warranted, philosophically defensible, and historically consistent enough to be trusted as a theological guide.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of the Pelagian controversy: Pelagius, Julian, Cassian, and the development of Semi-Pelagian reaction.
 - Exposition of Augustine's fundamental convictions: original sin, total corruption of the will, necessity of prevenient and efficacious grace, and divine predestination.
 - Defense of Augustine against two distortions:
 - caricature as fatalistic determinist who denies human moral agency,
 - dismissal as a medieval aberration from New Testament faith.
 - Demonstrates continuity between Augustine and later Reformed theology (especially Calvin) in essentials of soteriology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Pelagius, Julian of Eclanum, John Cassian (Semi-Pelagianism).
 - Sources: Augustine's major works (Confessions, On the Spirit and the Letter, On Grace and Free Will, Against Two Letters of the Pelagians), and early councils/letters (e.g., Council of Carthage) as mediated by Warfield's historiography.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology: original sin, concupiscence, total inability.
 - Soteriology: prevenient/effective grace, election/predestination, merit, justification by grace.
 - Freedom and responsibility: liberty of the will after the Fall, cooperant vs efficacious grace.
 - Indirectly: ecclesiology and sacramental theology where these bear on grace, but primary focus is sin and grace.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield presents Augustine as the biblically faithful and philosophically rigorous architect of a theology in which sovereign, efficacious grace is the necessary and gracious ground of salvation without negating moral responsibility.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses Augustine's nuanced middle path: uncompromising on grace, yet careful to affirm human accountability and moral exhortation.
 - Emphasizes Augustine's exegetical orientation - his theology springs from Scripture (especially Romans) rather than abstract metaphysics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Pelagian minimization of sin and overestimation of unaided will.
 - Opposes Semi-Pelagian attempts to preserve human initiative in salvation by showing their logical inconsistency with biblical texts.
 - Aligns Augustine with Calvin on essentials, yet acknowledges Augustine's distinct pastoral and polemical style.

- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications**
 - Clarifies differences between sufficient vs efficacious grace, prevenient vs cooperative grace, and the proper use of "free will" language in a fallen context.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Warfield's rehabilitation of Augustine fortified Reformed doctrinal claims in the 20th century; widely cited in conservative treatments of original sin and predestination.
 - Influential for polemics against modern Arminian and liberal revisions of Augustine.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of historical-theological method: careful textual reading, restraint in attributing later developments to Augustine, and robust theological synthesis suitable for teaching soteriology and patristic reception.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism** - denial of original sin's transmission and affirmation that the unassisted human will can choose good.
- **Semi-Pelagianism** - compromise view positing human initiative in conversion with grace responding; Warfield shows it as logically unstable against Scripture.
- **Augustinianism** - the cluster of convictions from Augustine: original sin, total inability, prevenient and efficacious grace, divine election.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - inherited corruption and guilt affecting human will and nature; foundational for necessity of grace.
- **Total inability / depravity** - human moral inability to effect salvation apart from divine action.
- **Prevenient grace** - grace that precedes and enables any movement of the will toward God; in Warfield/Augustine it is effective in producing conversion.
- **Efficacious grace** - divine grace that accomplishes what it intends (not merely sufficient in possibility).
- **Predestination / election** - divine sovereign choice in salvation; Augustine's grounding for assurance and doctrine of grace.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - retained as real but wounded; freedom to sin removed, freedom for obedience restored by grace.
- **Concupiscence** - disordered desire after the Fall; distinguished from guilt yet evidencing corruption.
- **Merit and works** - works cannot procure initial grace; merits are consequent to grace, not the cause of it.
- **Scriptural exegesis (esp. Romans)** - Augustine's interpretive anchor; Warfield prizes Augustine's patristic exegesis as exemplary.
- **Soteriological vocabulary** - Warfield highlights Augustine's precise use of "grace," "calling," "justification," shaping later Reformed terms.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed positions on sin and grace (anthropology and soteriology).
 - As a **polemic manual** against Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian positions in systematic theology and pastoral practice.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans and key Pauline passages through the lens of grace and human inability.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on patristics, historical theology, and Reformation antecedents.
