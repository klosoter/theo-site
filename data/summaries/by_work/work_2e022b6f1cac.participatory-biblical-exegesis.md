### TITLE
**Participatory Biblical Exegesis - Matthew Levering**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Catholic theological renewal (late 20th-21st c.). Situated within a post-conciliar effort to recover patristic and scholastic resources for biblical interpretation, and in dialogue with modern hermeneutical challenges (historical-critical method, reader-response, secular literary theory).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Biblical interpretation must be understood as a *participatory* encounter: the community reads Scripture not merely to extract historical facts but to participate in Christ and the life of the Trinity. Exegesis is therefore ecclesial, sacramental, and doctrinally shaped.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Defend the notion that Scripture functions sacramentally: it is a means by which God makes himself present and invites participation.
 - Reclaim patristic and medieval frameworks (senses of Scripture, typology, analogy) while subjecting them to responsible historical and critical work.
 - Provide a method that integrates canonical reading, Christological focus, ecclesial-liturgy context, and pneumatological reception (how the Spirit enables understanding).
 - Argue against exclusive privatized or purely historicist readings; propose criteria for theological appropriation that respect historical inquiry.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** St. Augustine, Gregory, Thomas Aquinas, Johann Sebastian D. (representative medieval and patristic sources); modern interlocutors include Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, contemporary Catholic biblical scholars, and critics of both historicism and naive allegory. Engages ecumenical voices on the role of tradition and the Spirit.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Trinity (pneumatology and Trinitarian presence in reading), Christology (Scripture centered on Christ), ecclesiology (ecclesial reading and sensus fidelium), sacramentology (Scripture as sacramental word), typology and eschatology, authority of tradition vs. historical method.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Scripture is not primarily a museum of past words but a sacramental, communal encounter through which the Church, by the Spirit, participates in the saving reality of Christ and the triune life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Explicitly frames exegesis as *participation* (a theological ontology) rather than only epistemic reception; participation borrows classical metaphysics (participatio) and adapts it hermeneutically.
 - Stresses the sacramental character of the biblical text: words as mediating presence, not mere signs pointing at external facts alone.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects naïve allegorizing by combining historical-critical rigor with theological criteria; resists the reduction of Scripture to private meaning (reader-response).
 - Opposes both sectarian literalism that detaches text from ecclesial tradition and historical skepticism that severs Scripture's soteriological intent.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Operationalizes "participation" as a methodological category for exegesis (not just metaphysical theology).
 - Integrates classical "senses of Scripture" language with contemporary hermeneutical vocabulary (canonical, pneumatological reception).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in Catholic theological and exegetical circles as a corrective to purely secular critical methods and as a resource for homiletics and sacramental theology.
 - Interest among Orthodox and some Protestant theologians for its integration of tradition, sacramentality, and Christocentrism; less uptake among methodological pluralists who prioritize socio-historical readings.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a pedagogical bridge between rigorous historical exegesis and doctrinal theology; useful in seminary formation, liturgical theology, and preaching contexts.
 - Offers a principled model for integrating doctrine, liturgy, and biblical scholarship without collapsing one into the other.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Participatory exegesis:** Reading that understands Scripture as enabling believers to participate in Christ and the triune life.
- **Sacramentality of Scripture:** The idea that the biblical word mediates divine presence; not identical to sacraments but analogous in function.
- **Senses of Scripture:** Literal and spiritual (allegorical/Christological, moral/tropological, anagogical/eschatological) refined by historical critique.
- **Canonical reading:** Attention to the final form and placement of texts within the canon as shaping theological meaning.
- **Pneumatological reception:** Emphasis on the Spirit's role in enabling the Church's understanding and appropriation of Scripture.
- **Typology:** A Christ-centered reading of Old Testament events and figures as prefigurations fulfilled in Christ; harmonized with historical-critical concerns.
- **Christological hermeneutic:** Priority of Christ as the interpretive key for the whole Scripture.
- **Ecclesial/sensus fidelium:** Communal discernment and the Church's received interpretation as normative for appropriation.
- **Analogy/participation (metaphysical underpinning):** Use of classical participatory metaphysics to ground theological claims about reading and being-in-Christ.
- **Tradition vs. historicism:** Balances respect for historical-critical scholarship with authority of received tradition; resists absolutizing either pole.
- **Liturgical context:** Reading attends to Scripture's use in worship and formation of embodied Christian life.
- **Spiritual senses as theological criteria:** Uses spiritual senses to evaluate theological fruitfulness and fidelity to revelation.
- **Eschatological reading:** Interpreting texts with attention to ultimate telos and consummation in Christ.
- **Hermeneutical method (integrative):** Sequence: historical/canonical-critical work -> Christological synthesis -> ecclesial appropriation via liturgy and Spirit.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for what a theological, sacramental approach to exegesis entails.
 - As an **exegetical model and pedagogical framework** in seminary courses: integrates critical method with doctrinal formation and homiletical application.
 - As a **polemic resource** against purely historical-critical or privatizing reader-response approaches and as a conceptual pivot linking biblical studies, sacramental theology, and Trinitarian doctrine.
