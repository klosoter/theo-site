### TITLE
**Sinclair B. Ferguson - "The Reformed View" (essay in The Person of Christ, edited volume)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed theology: pastoral, confessional, evangelical milieu seeking to restate orthodox Christology for church and academy.
 - Engages both classical patristic/Chalcedonian formulations and contemporary controversies (kenotic readings, modern "low" Christologies, revisionist proposals on the natures).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reformed orthodoxy must hold a robust Chalcedonian Christology: Jesus is truly God and truly man in one person. This commitment secures the doctrine of redemption, the perfection of Christ's obedience, and the efficacy of his priestly mediation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of the Chalcedonian formula as the correct grammar for describing the person of Christ; rejection of any schema that either splits the person (Nestorian tendency) or confuses the natures (Monophysite tendency).
 - Defense of **impeccability**: while Christ faced real temptation in his humanity, he was not capable of sin because of the personal union with the divine Logos and the covenantal oblation he voluntarily undertook.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences drawn: only a sinless, divine-human mediator can fulfill active and passive obedience that secures justification and reconciliation.
 - Pastoral application: Christ's real temptations make him a sympathetic high priest without rendering him susceptible to fall.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Chalcedon and patristic authorities (implicitly Cyril, Athanasius) for dogmatic shape.
 - Dialogues with Reformed tradition (Calvin, the Reformers, Reformed scholastics) on union, obedience, and covenantal headship.
 - Critical engagement with modern alternatives: kenotic interpretations, radical revisionists who dilute Chalcedonian categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): hypostatic union, two natures, communicatio idiomatum.
 - **Trinity** (implications for personhood and properties).
 - **Soteriology**: atonement, active and passive obedience, covenantal representation.
 - **Anthropology & temptation**: Christ's true human experience and impeccability.
- **Closing line**
 - The work's gravity: a disciplined Reformed retrieval of Chalcedonian Christology that secures both the full deity and true humanity of Christ while defending his freedom from sin as necessary for salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses that Chalcedonian categories are not merely abstract dogmatics but the indispensable grammar for preaching and pastoral assurance in Reformed piety.
 - Robust linking of **impeccability** to the person (the hypostasis) not as a denial of genuine temptation but as a necessary consequence of the divine-human union and covenantal role.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects kenotic or "emptying" models that suggest the Son relinquished divine attributes in the incarnation; argues for an unaltered divine identity united personally to a true human nature.
 - Contrasts with Nestorian fragmentation by insisting on personal unity; counters Monophysite conflation by insisting on two unconfused natures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the pastoral import of communicatio idiomatum in Reformed usage: the appropriation of divine benefits to human nature without ontological confusion.
 - Reframes impeccability language so as to preserve both Christ's real human experience and his irrevocable fidelity as mediator.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for combining rigorous dogmatic fidelity with pastoral sensitivity.
 - Frequently cited in evangelical Christological teaching and preaching as a concise Reformed defense of Chalcedon and of the doctrine that Christ "could not sin" while still being truly tempted.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, teachable model for seminarians and pastors: orthodox Christology that connects doctrine to soteriology and pastoral ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - The classical formula: one person (hypostasis) in two natures, without confusion, change, division, or separation; the essay treats it as normative for Reformed theology.
- **Two Natures (Dyophysitism)** - Christ is fully God and fully man; Ferguson insists on genuine properties retained in each nature.
- **Hypostatic Union** - Personal union of divine and human natures in the one Logos; the locus for explaining impeccability and mediatorial action.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - The communication of properties: how language about God and man can be applied to the one person without mixing natures.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - The claim that Christ, while truly tempted, was not capable of sin; grounded in the person of the Son and his covenantal vocation.
 - Clarifies difference between **inability to sin** (impeccability) and **lack of genuine temptation** (which he denies).
- **Kenosis** - "Emptying" (Phil 2) - treated critically where kenotic readings are used to argue Christ divested divine attributes; Ferguson resists ontological kenosis.
- **Active obedience** - Christ's fulfillment of the law by his life; essential for righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Passive obedience / Atonement** - Christ's suffering and death; efficacy secured because the actor is both God and man.
- **Covenantal Headship** - Christ as representative of elect humanity; links his personal impeccability to federal representation.
- **Temptation / Passibility** - Distinguishes genuine experiential temptation and Christ's susceptibility to suffering from any capacity to sin.
- **Nestorianism / Monophysitism** - Historical errors used as foils to sharpen Reformed commitment to Chalcedon.
- **Person (Prosopon / Hypostasis)** - Central category: unity of personhood that makes sinlessness and mediation coherent.
- **Soteriological Consequence** - How Christ's person and impeccability produce justification and sanctification for believers.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed readings of the Chalcedonian Definition in teaching and confessions.
 - As a **polemic** against kenotic and reductionist Christologies that threaten the communicatio idiomatum.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching on temptation, mediation, and the sympathetic high priest.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christ's person (hypostatic union) to practical soteriology (active/passive obedience, covenantal representation).
