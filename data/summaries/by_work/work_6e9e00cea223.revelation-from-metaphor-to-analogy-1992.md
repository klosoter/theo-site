### TITLE
**Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy (1992) - Richard Swinburne**

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion; reaction against non‑cognitive and purely poetic accounts of religious language (e.g., radical forms of Wittgensteinian and hermeneutic/linguistic approaches).
 - Builds on Swinburne's prior probabilistic epistemology of theism and his commitment to making religious claims intellectually serious and testable.

- **Central thesis**
 - Religious language should be treated primarily as **analogical**, not merely metaphorical; analogical predication makes meaningful, truth‑apt claims about God and so underwrites the existence‑and‑knowability project for divine attributes.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: sketches failures of univocal (literal) and equivocal uses of predicates to capture divine talk.
 - Critique of metaphor‑only accounts (e.g., Tillichian symbol, some Wittgensteinian readings) as reducing religious statements to expressive or non‑cognitive functions.
 - Positive proposal: define conditions under which predicates can be **analogically** applied to God; show how analogical application preserves enough semantic contact with human predicates to allow knowledge claims.
 - Establishes semantic rules for analogical predication (how meanings are extended while avoiding category mistakes).
 - Argues that analogical statements about God can be assessed for truth given appropriate epistemic access (experience, testimony, religious practices).
 - Connects analogical account to epistemology: argues that analogical theistic claims are subject to evidential appraisal and so contribute to debates about the existence and knowability of God.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical sources (Aquinas - analogia entis), modern analytic critics of religious language (R. M. Hare, D. Z. Phillips), and continental alternatives (Paul Tillich, Wittgensteinian interpreters).
 - Dialogues implicitly with Swinburne's own prior probabilistic defenses of theism and with verificationist legacies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (nature of propositional content and how language communicates divine reality).
 - **Divine attributes** (how predicates like "good", "powerful", "just" function).
 - Indirectly bears on **knowledge of God**, epistemology of religious belief, and the interface between philosophy and systematic theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Swinburne situates revelation as communicative and cognitively assessable: by moving from metaphor to analogy, theological language becomes a disciplined vehicle for claiming knowledge of God while preserving transcendence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Analogy is defended not merely as a theological tradition but as a rigorous semantic and epistemic device that makes religious claims testable and truth‑apt.
 - Strong analytic orientation: clarity, criteria, and conditions for analogical predication rather than homiletic or purely existential readings.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Tillichian/symbolic and Wittgensteinian/therapeutic readings that reduce religious language to non‑cognitive expression.
 - Distinguishes from Aquinas by offering more explicit semantic rules and by integrating contemporary semantic theory and epistemology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise framing of **analogical predication** in terms usable for contemporary philosophy of language (moving from medieval scholastic schema to modern semantic tests).
 - Emphasis on the epistemic consequences of analogy (how analogical language affects justification and knowledge claims).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among analytic philosophers of religion and theologians seeking a defensible cognitive model of revelation.
 - Criticized by some continental and postliberal theologians for underplaying mystery, narrative, and liturgical forms of knowledge.
 - Used in apologetics and systematic theology courses as a bridge between philosophy of language and classical doctrinal claims.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model for taking divine predicates seriously while avoiding category mistakes.
 - Provides tools for integrating philosophical clarity into theological claims about revelation and divine knowability.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogy / Analogical predication**
 - Extension of human predicates to God in a way that preserves truth‑conditions without implying literal identity of properties.
- **Metaphor**
 - Non‑literal, evocative language; Swinburne argues this is insufficient alone for propositional theology.
- **Univocity / Equivocity**
 - Contrasts showing why neither literal identity nor total semantic divergence suffices for God‑talk.
- **Analogía entis**
 - Classical notion (Aquinas) reinterpreted for analytic semantics and epistemology.
- **Cognitive vs non‑cognitive religious language**
 - Swinburne defends the cognitive status of much religious language via analogy.
- **Revelation (propositional)**
 - Revelation as communicative content that can be expressed analogically and evaluated.
- **Divine attributes**
 - How predicates like "good", "powerful", "knowing" are to be understood analogically.
- **Referentialism / Meaning transfer**
 - How reference and meaning transfer operate when predicates apply to transcendent referent.
- **Verificationism (critique)**
 - Engages and rejects strict verificationist dismissals of religious statements.
- **Epistemic access / Knowability**
 - Conditions under which analogical statements can yield justified belief about God's existence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the role and structure of analogical language in theology.
- As a **polemic** against non‑cognitive, metaphor‑only readings of revelation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking philosophy of language/epistemology to systematic treatments of divine attributes and the knowability of God.
