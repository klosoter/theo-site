### TITLE
From Eden to the New Jerusalem: An Introduction to Biblical Theology - T. Desmond Alexander

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century within conservative Reformed-evangelical scholarship seeking a faithful canonical and redemptive-historical biblical theology.
 - Responds to trends in canonical criticism (Brevard Childs), Vosian redemptive-historical method, and to popular dispensational and highly fragmented readings of Scripture.

- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture presents a unified, progressive covenantal story from creation (Eden) to consummation (New Jerusalem). Biblical theology must trace recurring motifs and covenantal promises that find their fulfillment in Christ and the eschatological people/kingdom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method and aims - defense of a canonical, historically sensitive, typological/redemptive-historical approach balanced with theological coherence.
 - Part II: Survey of the Old Testament - identification of central motifs and covenant structures (land, people, temple, kingship, seed).
 - Part III: Exile and return - function of prophetic literature and the development of messianic hope.
 - Part IV: New Testament fulfillment - Christ as the culmination of covenant promises; church and new covenant as inaugurated eschatology; consummation in New Jerusalem.
 - Repeated demonstration of **promise-fulfillment** pattern and of typology as the legitimate theological reading of covenantal correspondence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Geerhardus Vos (redemptive-historical method), Brevard Childs (canonical approach), Walter Brueggemann and N. T. Wright to varying degrees; interacts with Reformed covenant theologians and critiques dispensational readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (progressive and covenantal), Covenant theology (Adamic to New Covenant), Christology (fulfillment of OT promises), Kingdom and kingship, Temple and cultic symbolism, Eschatology (inaugurated and consummated), People and land, Typology and hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - Alexander situates the Bible as one unfolding covenantal drama: God's promised seed, people, place, and rule find their decisive fulfillment in Christ, whose inaugurated kingdom advances toward the New Jerusalem.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the covenantal structure (promise-fulfillment) as the hermeneutical key for both Testaments.
 - Balanced canonical-historical approach: canonical shape matters, but so does historical progression and typological development.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Radical canonical readings that downplay historical progression and typology.
 - Dispensational compartmentalization that fragments continuity between OT and NT.
 - Rehabilitates Vosian typology against overly allegorical or purely literary readings.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and re-prioritizes a short list of controlling motifs (land, people, temple, kingship, seed) as the organizing theological grammar of Scripture.
 - Treats the New Covenant as both continuity and transformative discontinuity - continuity in promises, discontinuity in their locus and nature (fulfilled in Christ).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as an introduc­tion to biblical theology; praised for clarity, pastoral applicability, and tight canonical-theological framing.
 - Influential in shaping curricula that emphasize covenantal motifs and in critiques of dispensational and purely historical-critical readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, pedagogical model for reading the Bible as a unified salvation-history; durable resource for pastors, students, and scholars seeking a covenantal canon-focused theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - the organizing principle of biblical history; Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant traced as a single redemptive trajectory.
- **Promise-fulfillment** - repeated pattern: divine promise, typological anticipation, eschatological fulfillment in Christ.
- **Typology** - legitimate theological interpretation seeing persons/events/institutions as foreshadows realized in Christ (e.g., Adam/Christ, temple/Christ).
- **Kingdom (of God)** - both present (inaugurated) and future (consummated); related to kingship motif centering on the Davidic promise.
- **Temple / Presence** - the spatial expression of divine presence; moves from Eden to tabernacle/temple to Christ and ultimately New Jerusalem.
- **Land** - not merely geographical but covenantal promise tied to the people and blessing; anticipates eschatological restoration.
- **People (Israel / Church)** - corporate continuity: Israel as covenant people finds true form in the people of God in Christ.
- **Exile / Return** - theological lens for understanding crisis and prophetic hope; central to shape of OT and its fulfillment.
- **New Covenant** - culmination of covenant promises; inaugurated in Christ and sealed by Spirit, pointing to consummation.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - the "already/not yet" nature of salvation-history emphasized throughout.
- **Canonical approach** - reading Scripture as a unified canon while retaining diachronic development.
- **Redemptive-historical method** - prioritizes salvation-history over isolated doctrinal proof-texting.
- **Seed** - messianic offspring motif culminating in Christ (contrast Adamic/Christ typology).
- **Temple symbolism** - theological function more than cultic detail; reinterpreted christologically and ecclesially.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for a covenantal, redemptive-historical biblical theology suitable for courses and syllabi.
 - As an exegetical model for sermon series and theological interpretation that links OT motifs to Christ and church.
 - As a polemical resource against dispensational fragmentation and against approaches that deny typological continuity.
