### TITLE
Karl Barth: A Theological Introduction - Clifford Green (introducing the theology of **Karl Barth**)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th‑century reception of Barth within post‑liberal and neo‑orthodox reactions to 19th‑century liberalism; Green writes as an introductory guide to Barth's dense corpus, especially the Church Dogmatics, for anglophone readers.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth relocates all systematic theology to the knot of **God's self‑revelation in Jesus Christ**: theology is response to the Word‑event, not construction from human experience or natural theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes **revelation** as the divine act and the norm (the Word-event).
 - Develops doctrine of God (transcendence, election) in relation to Christ.
 - Treats **Christology** as center: the Son and the man Jesus as the one decisive event (hypostatic unity).
 - Moves to reconciliation, the church, and the sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper) as witness and participation in that event.
 - Ethical and ecclesial consequences follow from the prior loci.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Critical engagement with **Ritschlian liberalism**, Schleiermacher, Emil Brunner, existentialist readings (Bultmann), Reformed scholastic categories; constant appeal to Scripture as normative.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity, **Christology** (hypostatic union), election, reconciliation, church, sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper), eschatology, ethics.
- **Site usages cited for targeted topics**
 - **Lord's Supper / Fencing & Admission** - Green's exposition of Barth's sacramental theology, especially on communal reception and church oversight (Green: sacraments/Lord's Supper).
 - **Hypostatic Union** - Green's concise presentation of Barth's person‑centered Christology (Green: Christology/Hypostatic Union).
 - **Baptism - Mode, Infant vs. Believer, Efficacy** - Green's treatment of Barth on baptism as covenantal sign and formative for the church (Green: baptism).
- **Closing line**
 - Barth's theological center of gravity: **the sovereign, eventful self‑disclosure of God in Jesus Christ**-the Word that judges, commands, and gathers the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Theology as theologia crucis in the form of a **Word‑event** rather than a philosophical system; Christocentrism makes Christ the single hermeneutical key.
 - Strong rejection of natural theology and the analogia entis; revelation is gratuitous and determinative.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Opposes Ritschlian moralized religion and Schleiermacher's anthropological starting point by insisting the starting point is God's act, not human religious experience.
 - Reframes classic Reformed categories (election, covenant) around the person‑event of Christ rather than static doctrines.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on **event** (Ereignis/Word‑event) language in systematic theology; resituates communicatio idiomatum around personhood and witness rather than metaphysical mixing.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Renewed Reformed orthodoxy and twentieth‑century evangelical/academic engagement; Barth became a touchstone for sacramental reform, Christology debates, and critiques of liberal theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for a **Christ‑centered, confessionally serious** systematic theology; invaluable for teaching Christology and sacramental theology that prioritize divine initiative and church praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (Offenbarung)** - God's self‑disclosure as decisive event in Christ; the norm and starting point for theology.
- **Word‑event** - Theology responds to the Word which is both proclaimed and accomplished; avoids abstract propositions detached from God's acting.
- **Dialectical theology** - Tension of divine transcendence and nearness; theology moves between "God is" and "God speaks."
- **Hypostatic Union** - Barth's Christology stresses the unity of person (Son) with twofold reality (divine and human) so that Jesus is the single subject of revelation and election.
 - Emphasis on **personhood**: the Son assumes human reality without metaphysical confusion; Jesus is both God's revealer and man as recipient.
- **Election (in Christ)** - Election centered in the historical person of Jesus: God elects in and as Jesus, overturning abstract predestination models.
- **Sacrament (baptism, Lord's Supper)** - Not mere signs: sacraments are **word‑and‑sign**, events in which the faithful receive the promise of reconciliation.
- **Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper** - **Real presence as event and promise**, not bodily ubiquity; Christ is present through the Word and promise enacted in the meal.
 - **Fencing and admission** - Church's pastoral and ecclesial responsibility to regulate participation; table practice protects the covenantal integrity of the meal (Green: Lord's Supper/fencing).
- **Baptism: infant vs. believer; mode; efficacy** - Baptism is covenantal initiation; Barth affirms **infant baptism** as incorporation into covenant community; mode (aspersion/immersion) is secondary; efficacy rests in God's promise and grace, not ritual mechanics (Green: baptism).
- **Analogia entis rejection / natural theology** - Denies that knowledge of God can be extrapolated from creaturely being; theology is dependent on revelation.
- **Church as witness and administration** - The church proclaims the Word, administers sacraments, and disciplines (including admission to sacraments).
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a succinct **definition source** for Barthian Christology and sacramental categories in teaching and seminars.
 - As a **polemic resource** against liberal and natural‑theology frameworks; a model for confessional, Christ‑centred systematic proposals.
 - As an **exegetical‑theological model** for reading the Church Dogmatics: clarifies Barth's movement from revelation to church praxis and sacramental theology.
