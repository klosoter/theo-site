### TITLE
**The New Perspective on Paul** (James D. G. Dunn)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1980s onward; catalyzed by Dunn's 1982 Tyndale Lecture and subsequent essays. Emerges within post-Sanders reassessment of Second Temple Judaism, ecumenical readings of Paul, and critiques of the Lutheran-Paul paradigm.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's doctrine of justification addresses the inclusion of Gentiles into God's people and the social function of the law, not an abstract struggle against Jewish legalism. "Works of the law" are boundary markers; justification declares covenant membership on the basis of faith in Christ, confirmed by the Spirit.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Re-reads Judaism as **covenantal nomism** (after Sanders), displacing the caricature of merit-earning legalism.
 - Interprets **works of the law** as identity badges (circumcision, food laws, calendar), drawing on 4QMMT and halakhic patterns.
 - Reframes **justification** as God's covenant-faithful verdict that includes Gentiles by faith, creating a single, Spirit-marked family.
 - Emphasizes **the Spirit** as the eschatological gift and badge of belonging, generating ethical transformation and communal unity.
 - Stresses **resurrection and new creation** as the eschatological horizon of Paul's soteriology and ecclesiology (Rom 8; 2 Cor 5).
 - Reads **union with Christ** corporately ("in Christ" as participation in the Messiah-people), with personal participation through the Spirit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Sanders and Stendahl as catalysts; engagement with Wright, Martyn, Käsemann; interlocution with Reformed and evangelical critics (Westerholm, Seifrid, Piper, Moo, Carson). Sources include Qumran (4QMMT), Josephus, Philo, and Greco-Roman social contexts.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture and Second Temple Judaism; law and covenant; justification and righteousness; pneumatology (indwelling, regeneration/new life); ecclesiology; eschatology (resurrection, new creation); Christology (Messiah identity and corporate representation).
- **Closing line:** For Dunn, the theological center is God's covenant faithfulness creating one new people in the Messiah, publicly vindicated in resurrection, and marked by the Spirit's indwelling life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Works of the law as boundary markers**, not moral striving.
 - **Justification as ecclesiological and forensic**: a courtroom verdict about who belongs to God's covenant family.
 - **Spirit as badge of membership** and power for new life; transformation flows from status, not vice versa.
 - **Corporate union**: "in Christ" primarily denotes belonging to the Messiah-community.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Challenges the **Lutheran-Reformed introspective conscience** reading of Paul; rejects the legalistic Judaism foil.
 - **Repositions imputation**: does not deny forensic grace but resists making imputed righteousness the controlling soteriological metaphor.
 - Disputes readings that collapse justification into moral renewal; maintains verdict/transformation distinction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "**Boundary markers**" and halakhic identity.
 - "**Righteousness of God**" as covenant faithfulness.
 - The Spirit as **eschatological identity-marker**.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential across Pauline studies; provoked significant **Reformed critiques** and refinements.
 - Shaped exegesis of Galatians and Romans; stimulated debates over pistis Christou, imputation, and participation.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Historicizes Paul within Judaism; integrates **pneumatology**, **ecclesiology**, and **eschatology**.
 - Offers a robust framework for addressing **Resurrection and New Creation**, **Justification and NPP critiques**, **Spirit and Union with Christ**, and **Regeneration and Indwelling** in concert.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenantal nomism:** Second Temple Judaism's pattern where obedience maintains, not earns, covenant status.
- **Works of the law:** Halakhic boundary markers (e.g., circumcision, food laws, days) guarding Jewish identity; central for Galatians/Romans disputes.
- **Justification:** God's forensic verdict of membership in the covenant family, now extended to Gentiles by faith in Christ; status first, ethics follow.
 - Sets the stage for debates on **forensic imputation**; Dunn relocates rather than erases the forensic dimension.
- **Righteousness of God:** God's covenant faithfulness; the divine initiative to fulfill promises to Israel for the sake of the world.
- **Pistis Christou:** Faith in Christ (Dunn's default), with awareness of "faithfulness of Christ" debate; either way, Christ-centered trust defines membership.
- **In Christ (union):** Corporate participation in the Messiah-people; personal union is mediated by the **Spirit** and expressed in baptism and communal life.
- **Spirit as eschatological gift:** The sign and power of the new age; creates unity across Jew-Gentile lines and energizes ethical transformation.
- **Indwelling:** The Spirit's presence in believers and the community as God's temple; evidences belonging and animates new obedience.
- **Regeneration / new life:** Dunn prefers Pauline idioms (new creation, life in the Spirit) to the term "regeneration" per se; emphasizes transformative vitality.
- **Resurrection and new creation:** Christ's resurrection inaugurates new creation; the Spirit applies resurrection-life now, with cosmic consummation to come.
- **Participation vs imputation:** Dunn tilts to participatory and ecclesial frames while retaining a forensic verdict; resists making imputation the controlling lens.
- **Boundary markers:** Sociological-legal practices distinguishing Jews from Gentiles; pivotal for reading Gal 2, Rom 3.
- **Inclusion of Gentiles:** The pastoral-missional engine of Paul's argument for justification by faith apart from boundary markers.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As an **exegetical model** for Galatians and Romans on law, faith, and Jew-Gentile relations.
 - As a **polemical dialogue partner** in debates on **Justification, Forensic Imputation, and NPP critiques**.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for **Spirit and Union with Christ** and **Regeneration and Indwelling** in ecclesiology and ethics.
 - As an **eschatological frame** for **Resurrection and New Creation** in Pauline theology.
