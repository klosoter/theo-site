### TITLE
Compendium and Catechism for the Young - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism (Turretin 1623-1687). Produced in the aftermath of the Synod of Dort and during ongoing controversies with Remonstrants (Arminians), Socinians, and emerging rationalists.
 - Written as a concise, pedagogical companion to Turretin's more technical works (notably the Elenctic Theology), aimed at catechesis and the general instruction of youth and laypersons.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To present a compact, systematic articulation of orthodox Reformed doctrine that defends divine sovereignty, the covenantal structure of Scripture, and the necessity of correct dogmatics for piety and church order.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Organized catechetical questions and answers covering:
 - Scripture and revelation (authority, sufficiency, perspicuity)
 - God (Trinity, attributes), creation, providence
 - Humanity (image of God, fall, original sin)
 - Christ (person, work, two natures, mediatorial office)
 - Salvation (justification by faith, union with Christ, effectual calling)
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works and covenant of grace; continuity of Old and New Testaments)
 - Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper as signs and seals)
 - Church, civil magistrate, and last things
 - Moves from propositional definition to practical application; frequently cites Scripture and patristic/Reformed authorities as proof texts.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Builds on Calvin, Beza, the Reformed confessions (e.g., Westminster/Belgic/Heidelberg senses), and scholastics like Ames and Voetius; directly polemical toward Remonstrants/Arminians and Socinians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, Trinity, Christology, soteriology (including predestination), covenant theology, sacraments, ecclesiology, eschatology, original sin, law/gospel distinction.
- **Closing line**
 - A tightly argued Reformed catechism that places covenantal continuity and divine sovereignty at the center of Christian doctrine and pastoral instruction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, clear articulation of federal (covenantal) theology: covenant of works vs. covenant of grace as organizing principle for redemptive history and soteriology.
 - Scholastic clarity and careful distinctions deployed in a catechetical form - technical precision translated into pedagogical questions and answers.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects perceived laxity in popular catechesis by restoring detailed doctrinal definitions and polemical clarity against Arminian and Socinian departures.
 - Opposes any bifurcation of redemptive history that undermines covenantal unity; resists the discontinuity characteristic of classical dispensationalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much novel neologisms as methodical application of scholastic categories (essence/attributes, active/passive obedience, federal headship) in a catechetical register.
 - Emphasizes the covenant as both juridical framework and living communion - combining forensic and relational language consistently.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed circles as a reliable concise statement of confessional theology; influential in the Swiss and Genevan contexts and later among conservative Reformed educators.
 - Served as a touchstone against theological novelties; later Reformed debates (19th-20th c.) invoked Turretin for classic federalist positions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary for teaching confessional precision without the full apparatus of scholastic elenchus; durable resource for pastors, catechists, and seminarians needing a compact, defensible summary of Reformed orthodoxy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-fall covenant with Adam requiring perfect obedience as the condition of life; breach explains human ruin.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - God's covenant for sinners mediated in Christ; central hermeneutical key for continuity between Testaments.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Adam and Christ as representative heads whose actions legally affect covenant members.
- **Predestination / Election**
 - Divine decree ordering salvation; explained with emphasis on God's sovereignty and scriptural proofs.
- **Sacraments: Signs and Seals**
 - Visible rites (baptism, Lord's Supper) that signify and confirm covenant promises to the faithful.
- **Perspicuity and Sufficiency of Scripture**
 - Scripture as clear in its saving message and sufficient for faith and life; basis for catechetical authority.
- **Original Sin**
 - Inherited corruption and guilt; universal need for divine grace.
- **Justification by Faith**
 - Forensic declaration based on Christ's righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Typology / Covenant Continuity**
 - Old Testament persons/events as types fulfilled in Christ; undergirds rejection of radical discontinuity.
- **Law/Gospel Distinction**
 - Law as covenantal rule revealing sin; gospel as promise of grace in Christ.
- **Ordo Salutis (soteriological order)**
 - Systematic outline of calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification.
- **Ecclesiology / Visible-Invisible Church**
 - Distinction used in sacramental and disciplinary practice; covenant community as locus of grace signs.
- **Christological Twofold Office**
 - Prophet, priest, king; emphasis on both active and passive obedience of Christ.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definitional source** for classic Reformed covenant theology and confessional catechesis.
 - As a **polemic resource** against dispensationalist discontinuity and modern progressive covenantal claims that minimize federal continuity.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Scripture typologically and covenantally across loci (soteriology, sacraments, ecclesiology).
