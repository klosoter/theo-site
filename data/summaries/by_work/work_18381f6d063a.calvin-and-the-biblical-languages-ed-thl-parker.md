### TITLE
Calvin and the Biblical Languages (ed. T. H. L. Parker) - selections illuminating John Calvin's use of Hebrew and Greek for the law/gospel distinction

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation; Protestant humanist philology informing exegesis.
 - Calvin writing from Geneva amid controversies with Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and rising antinomian strains.
 - Parker's modern edition collects Calvin's reflections on learning and using the biblical languages for theology and preaching.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin insists that mastery of Hebrew and Greek is indispensable to recover the *true sense* of Scripture so that the **distinction between Law and Gospel** is correctly perceived and applied; without philological care one either allegorizes the text or misapplies the Law as a means of justification.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Philology as theological safeguard
 - Learning original languages prevents corrupt traditions and fanciful allegory.
 - Scripture read in its plain (sensus literalis) and historical sense
 - Literal/grammatical-historical exegesis opens the text to its Christ-centered meaning.
 - Law and Gospel properly distinguished by exegesis
 - The Law convicts, restrains, and instructs (pedagogical role).
 - The Gospel reveals Christ and justification by faith.
 - Application to pastoral ministry
 - Preachers must use languages to avoid legalism or antinomianism and to present Christ as the fulfillment of the Law.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Protestant humanists (methodological debt to Erasmus' emphasis on Greek and Hebrew).
 - Opponents: scholastic Roman Catholic readings that prioritize tradition; some Lutherans on emphases in law/gospel; antinomian interpreters.
 - Patristic and biblical sources used Christocentrically (Augustinian strains favored over medieval allegory).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, sensus literalis, role of languages).
 - Justification by faith and the function of the Law.
 - Covenant and the continuity/discontinuity of Old and New Testament revelation.
 - Sanctification and the moral use of the Law in the life of the believer.

- **Closing line**
 - Calvin's theological center of gravity in these writings: faithful exegesis in the original languages secures a Christ-centered distinction of Law and Gospel that grounds Reformed preaching, soteriology, and pastoral care.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong coupling of **philological precision** with pastoral theology: language study is not an academic luxury but a ministry necessity to avoid confusion between Law and Gospel.
 - Calvin balances literal-grammatical exegesis with typological and Christological fulfillment; literal sense is primary but leads to Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against medieval allegorizing: rejects uncontrolled spiritualization that blurs law/gospel.
 - Against crude antinomian or legalistic readings: affirms the Law's continuing **use** without making it a ground of justification.
 - Compared to Luther: shares the law/gospel schema but stresses orderly exegesis and covenantal coherence more systematically.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reworked emphasis on the **sensus literalis** combined with a consistent Christocentric hermeneutic.
 - Clear articulation of the Law's multiple uses as part of interpretive and pastoral practice grounded in original-language exegesis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Cemented Reformed hermeneutical norms: philology + Christ-centered reading became a staple in Reformed seminaries.
 - Influenced later covenant theologians and pastoral homiletics concerned with faithful application of Scripture.
 - Served as a corrective to both scholasticism and lax biblical handling in Protestant circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models integration of language study, exegesis, and pastoral theology.
 - Remains a primary resource for understanding how language-critical methods function to secure doctrinal distinctions (especially Law vs. Gospel).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sensus literalis** - Calvin's insistence on the literal/grammatical sense as the foundation for further theological reading.
- **Philology / biblical languages** - Hebrew and Greek as tools to recover original sense and prevent corruption of doctrine.
- **Law (lex)** - the Mosaic command as covenantal instruction; a means to convict and guide but not to justify.
 - Sub-uses: civil/political restraint; pedagogical/curative (to show sin); normative/guiding for believers.
- **Gospel (evangelium)** - the proclamation of Christ's righteousness imputed to sinners; the fulfilment of the Law and promise.
- **Law-Gospel distinction** - hermeneutical axis for soteriology and pastoral application; clarified by careful exegesis.
- **Sensus Christologicus / typology** - Christ as the telos of Scripture; typological readings secured by literal sense and language study.
- **Justification by faith** - central soteriological doctrine safeguarded by distinguishing Law and Gospel.
- **Covenant** - continuity of God's redemptive purpose; languages help clarify covenantal promises and fulfillments.
- **Antinomianism** - error Calvin combats by showing the Law's proper uses via exegesis.
- **Analogia fidei (analogy of faith)** - theological coherence checked by Scripture read in original languages.
- **Pastoral exegesis** - exegetical method aimed at right preaching and pastoral care, not mere academic precision.
- **Grammatical-historical method** - foundational interpretive stance combining grammar and history in original languages.
- **Typological fulfillment** - patterns in OT made clear as Christological in NT when languages and context examined.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: grounds the Law/Gospel distinction in exegetical practice and soteriology.
 - Polemic: deployed against antinomianism, scholastic misreadings, and juridical abuses of the Law.
 - Exegetical model: exemplar for language-informed, Christ-centered interpretation used in homiletics and systematic theology.
