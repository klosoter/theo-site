### TITLE
Spirit Hermeneutics: Reading Scripture in Light of Pentecost (2016) - Craig S. Keener

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2016 in a context of sustained debate between charismatic/continuationist movements and cessationist critics.
 - Situated within Pentecostal scholarship but aimed at a broader evangelical and academic audience; integrates historical, biblical, ethnographic, and theological methods.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture must be read through a hermeneutic formed by the reality of Pentecost: the Spirit's post-resurrection activity enables ongoing charismatic phenomena and needs to shape interpretation, without abandoning scriptural norms.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Historical and biblical case that Luke-Acts and Pauline writings present Pentecost as inaugurating continuing Spirit activity.
 - Part 2: Survey of historical and contemporary evidence for charismatic gifts worldwide; methodological defense of eyewitness and ethnographic testimony.
 - Part 3: Theological synthesis-how Pentecost affects doctrines of revelation, authority, and interpretation; practical guidelines for discerning Spirit-led speech and ministry.
 - Repeated methodological move: combine close exegesis with real-world testimony, then subject claims to communal and scriptural testing.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary biblical witnesses: Luke-Acts, Pauline letters.
 - Early church fathers and patristic reception; global Pentecostal practice and testimonies.
 - Interlocutors include classical cessationist voices (historical and modern) and critics of charismatic excess; engages systematic theologians on revelation and authority.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (central), revelation and Scripture, Trinity, ecclesiology (gifts and order), eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), soteriology (Spirit's role in sanctification), prophecy and charismatic practice.
- **Closing line**
 - Keener advances a disciplined continuationist pneumatology: Pentecost reorganizes biblical reading and ecclesial expectation while requiring communal and scriptural discernment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust empirical-historical method: treats contemporary Pentecostal testimony as legitimate historical evidence alongside ancient sources.
 - Hermeneutical priority of Pentecost: the Spirit's present work is not merely an exegetical datum but a lens that shapes reading and application.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges typical cessationist exegesis that reads miraculous gifts as strictly first-century phenomena; argues such readings under-read Luke-Acts and Pauline expectation.
 - Critiques uncritical charismatic practice by insisting on scriptural testing and ecclesial discernment-avoids endorsing unchecked experientialism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Spirit hermeneutics" as a technical term: a disciplined method for reading Scripture in light of the continuing Spirit.
 - Emphasis on "tested witness" combining personal testimony, communal discernment, and scriptural conformity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Pentecostal and charismatic scholarship as a comprehensive resource; used by many evangelicals to rethink cessationist assumptions.
 - Provoked sustained engagement from Reformed theologians and cessationists, prompting more careful interaction between pneumatology and hermeneutics in those circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of integrating exegesis, history, and contemporary witness; valuable for teaching on biblical pneumatology, hermeneutics, and ecumenical pneumatological dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit Hermeneutics**
 - Reading Scripture with attention to the Spirit's continuing activity; not replacing exegesis but reshaping interpretive questions.
- **Pentecost (normative)**
 - Pentecost as the inaugurating event whose patterns and promises are normative for church life and gift-expectation.
- **Continuationism**
 - The view that charismatic gifts continue; Keener provides exegetical, historical, and empirical defense.
- **Cessationism**
 - The opposing view Keener critiques for methodological and exegetical weaknesses.
- **Charismatic Gifts**
 - Prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles - treated as ongoing possibilities that require testing.
- **Testing / Discernment**
 - Criteria Keener presses: conformity to Scripture, fruit-bearing, communal discernment, and ethical restraint.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology**
 - The "already/not yet" framework that explains both presence and partiality of Spirit gifts in the church.
- **Redemptive History (Spirit's role)**
 - The Spirit as active agent through Israel, Christ's resurrection, Pentecost, and ongoing mission - frames hermeneutics historically.
- **Witness / Ethnography**
 - Use of contemporary testimonies as historical evidence when critically assessed.
- **Trinitarian Pneumatology**
 - Integrates Spirit's gifts into doctrine of the Trinity without subordinating Spirit's witness to propositional revelation alone.
- **Experience vs Scripture**
 - Balance: experience informs reading but is subordinate to scriptural testing and communal accountability.
- **Ecclesial Authority**
 - Church structures and councils as necessary venues for discerning and regulating charismatic speech.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary continuationist pneumatology.
 - As a **polemic** against simplistic cessationism and against untested charismatic excess.
 - As an **exegetical and methodological model** for reading Luke-Acts and Pauline pneumatology within the arc of redemptive history.
