### TITLE
**A Declaration of the Glorious Mystery of the Person of Christ, God and Man** - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritan-Reformed milieu; Owen as leading Reformed theologian and parliamentary chaplain during the Interregnum.
 - Reaction against Socinian denials of Christ's divinity and against any modernizing tendencies that relativized classical Christology (e.g., early kenotic hints, Arminian speculations about Christ's moral possibility of sin).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The hypostatic union of the divine and human natures in the one Person of Christ entails an absolute, intrinsic **impeccability**: Christ could not sin. This is essential to his person and necessary for the validity and sufficiency of his mediatorial work.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and careful parsing of "person" and "natures": distinction between the divine and human natures and unity in one hypostasis.
 - Exposition of communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties): how properties of each nature relate to the one Person without confusion.
 - Examination of temptation and sinlessness in Scripture: proof texts that Christ was tempted yet did not, and that his temptations did not make sin possible in him.
 - Logical and metaphysical demonstration that divine properties (immutability, omnipotence, holiness) joined to the human nature preclude peccability.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences: Christ's impeccability secures both his worthiness and sufficiency as Mediator (active and passive obedience).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis centered on the Gospels and Hebrews.
 - Engagement with classical theologians (Augustine, Calvin), contemporary polemics (Socinians, Remonstrants), and scholastic formulations (Scholastic Thomists, Reformed scholasticism).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and natures, communicatio idiomatum)
 - Trinity (implications for divine properties)
 - Soteriology (obedience, satisfaction)
 - Anthropology & hamartiology indirectly (what it means for human nature to be assumed)
- **Closing line**
 - Owen's center of gravity: the real, personal union of God and man in Christ secures an intrinsic, non-accidental impeccability that undergirds his mediatorial efficacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on **absolute impeccability** (not merely factual sinlessness): peccability is metaphysically incompatible with the united Person of Christ.
 - Nuanced account of freedom: Christ's will is genuinely free but not capable of sin; Owen distinguishes freedom from the metaphysical possibility of sin.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects any reduction of Christ to a merely exemplary moral teacher (Socinianism) or to a creature who could have sinned (some Arminian intimations).
 - Opposes kenotic currents that suggest the divine Son emptied attributes in a way that would permit peccability.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines classical scholastic categories for a Reformed audience: tight linkage of communicatio idiomatum to soteriological necessity rather than mere metaphysical abstraction.
 - Emphasizes moral inability (in Christ) as theologically positive rather than a limitation to be lamented.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among Puritans and later orthodox Reformed writers as a touchstone for defending classical Christology and the doctrine of the Mediator.
 - Frequently cited in debates over Christ's temptations, kenosis, and the coherence of divine immutability with incarnational realities.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the metaphysical stakes of Christological language for pastoral assurance and for the doctrine of atonement.
 - Provides a model for integrating detailed exegesis with systematic metaphysics in Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - the personal union of divine and human natures in the one Person of the Son; Owen treats this as determinative for impeccability.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - the communication of properties between natures; used to show how divine immutability informs the assumed human nature.
- **Impeccability** - the doctrine that Christ could not sin; Owen argues for intrinsic impossibility of sin in Christ.
 - Contrasted with mere historical sinlessness (Christ did not sin) and with peccability (Christ could have sinned).
- **Peccability** - the capacity to sin; Owen denies this in the incarnate Son.
- **Temptation** - real and powerful but not constitutive of moral possibility to sin in Christ; serves to attest his obedience without implying liability to fall.
- **Freedom / Will** - genuine freedom defined as acting according to nature and aligned volition; freedom does not equal potential to sin.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Owen uses impeccability to secure the sufficiency of Christ's active obedience (perfect law-keeping) and passive obedience (suffered death).
- **Immutability / Omnipotence / Holiness** - divine attributes that, when united to the human nature, preclude moral failure.
- **Mediator** - the office whose efficacy depends on the Person being both God and man and therefore incapable of sin.
- **Moral inability** - a positive category: Christ's inability to sin is a safeguard, not a defect.
- **Satisfaction** - Owen links impeccability to the worthiness and efficacy of Christ's atoning work.
- **Kenosis (related term)** - addressed negatively: Owen resists interpretations of Philippians 2 that entail divine self-emptying to the point of peccability.
- **Person vs. Nature** - Owens' distinctions are deployed to guard against Confusion (mixing natures) and Separation (dividing the person).
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: Classic statement used to define and defend **impeccability** in Reformed theology.
 - Polemic tool: Employed against Socinian, Kenotic, and Arminian claims that undermine orthodox Christology.
 - Exegetical model: Serves as a template for reading temptation narratives and Pauline Christological passages to safeguard soteriological claims.
