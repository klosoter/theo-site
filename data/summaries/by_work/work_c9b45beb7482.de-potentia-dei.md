### TITLE
De Potentia Dei (On the Power of God) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-13th century scholastic theology (Dominican milieu). Composed against a backdrop of Aristotelian natural philosophy, Islamic and Jewish commentaries, and intra-Latin disputes over divine freedom, necessity, and the relation of reason to Scripture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to explain the scope and mode of God's power (potentia) in relation to God's essence, will, intellect, creation, and moral order - especially to reconcile God's absolute omnipotence with logical order, divine immutability, and the empirical order of creatures.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define divine power as identical with God's essence under the doctrine of **divine simplicity**; treat potency only analogically for creatures.
 - Distinguish **potentia absoluta** (what God can do in Himself) from **potentia ordinata** (what God can do under the divine will/decree, especially in relation to established order and promises).
 - Trace the relation of power to intellect and will: God's power flows from His know-how (exemplar knowledge) and free will; God can effect any logically possible state of affairs but cannot do the logically impossible or what contradicts His perfect goodness.
 - Address creation: God as first cause (primary causality), creatures as secondary causes; creation ex nihilo is voluntary and contingent, not necessitated by God's nature.
 - Treat questions of divine knowledge, foreknowledge of contingents, and the compatibility of divine immutability with divine action.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Aristotle (esp. Physics, Metaphysics), Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, Islamic and Jewish philosophers (Averroes, Avicenna), and medieval masters; engaged also with detractors who attribute necessity to creation or limit God's freedom.
- **Doctrines treated:** theology proper (omnipotence, simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity (implications for relations of origin and equality), creation and providence (primary/secondary causality), epistemology of God (exemplarism, eternal knowledge), and hermeneutics (Scripture vs natural reason).
- **Closing line:** Aquinas centers the doctrine of divine power on the unity of God's essence and free will: God is supremely powerful insofar as His power is identical with His simple, immutable being, freely ordering creation without contradiction to logical and moral perfections.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Potentia absoluta vs potentia ordinata:** a hallmark Thomistic nuance that allows talk of absolute divine freedom while maintaining commitments to the moral and ordained order (vital for sacramental/ethical theology and for discussions of miracles).
- **Identity of power and essence:** because of divine simplicity, power is not an added attribute but the very mode of God's being - avoids a multiplicity of internal divine properties.
- **Freedom without arbitrariness:** God can do any logically possible good, yet His freedom is ordered by His goodness and wisdom - excludes caprice and offers resources against voluntarism and deterministic readings.
- **Robust causal framework:** firm affirmation of primary causality with real secondary causality for creatures - supports the compatibility of scientific explanation and divine causation (relevant to Genesis 1-11 readings).
- **Trinitarian restraint on subordinationism:** Aquinas affirms real distinctions of relations (generation, spiration) without admitting personal inequality in power or will - a corrective to modern EFS (eternal functional subordination) tendencies.
- **Enduring influence:** foundational for later scholastic, Roman Catholic, and many Reformed appropriations of divine attributes, especially the potentia distinctions used in moral theology, natural law, and debates about miracles and providence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine simplicity:** God has no composition; attributes are identical to essence - explains why divine power is not an additional attribute.
- **Potentia absoluta:** God's absolute power to do all that is logically possible, independent of created order or divine decrees.
- **Potentia ordinata:** God's power as it is exercised within the ordered law/will that God has established (relevant for promises, liturgy, covenant).
- **Primary causality:** God as first cause - the ultimate source of being and motion.
- **Secondary causality:** real causal efficacy of creatures; allows natural causation alongside divine causation.
- **Creation ex nihilo:** voluntary, free act of God; not necessitated by divine essence.
- **Immutability & impassibility:** God's eternal unchangeableness; actions are not changes in God but effects of His eternal will.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence; grounds divine freedom and the doctrine that God is not caused.
- **Eternal generation & spiration:** inner-Trinitarian relations of origin stated as eternal and not implying subordination of power.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis):** predication about God is analogical, not univocal; shapes epistemology and limits scriptural-scientific clashes.
- **Divine knowledge (exemplar knowledge):** God knows creatures by knowing Himself as cause; foreknowledge of contingents is compatible with contingency.
- **Logical possibility:** boundary of omnipotence - God cannot do what is contradictory or against divine goodness.
- **Contingent creation:** created order could have been otherwise; supports theological pluralism about cosmic order.
- **Order and promise:** potentia ordinata grounds the trustworthiness of divine promises and moral law.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Thomistic attributes (omnipotence, simplicity, aseity).
 - As a **polemic tool** against voluntarism and deterministic necessity in debates on divine freedom and providence.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reconciling Genesis and natural philosophy (Scripture speaks to ends, not detailed natural science).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Trinitarian debates to deny ontological subordination while accounting for economic distinctions.
