### TITLE
Eleonore Stump, "Atonement" - reading Thomas Aquinas on Christ's active and passive obedience (analytic-Thomistic reconstruction and appraisal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary analytic-Thomistic engagement (late 20th-early 21st c.). Stump writes from a Catholic philosophical-theological vantage, bringing analytic clarity to medieval sources (primarily Thomas Aquinas) within current debates over satisfaction, penal substitution, and union with Christ.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To clarify and defend a Thomistic account of how Christ's twofold obedience (active and passive) effects salvation: how Christ's suffering pays the debt of sin and how his perfect obedience secures eternal life for humanity - and to articulate this in philosophically precise terms that meet modern objections to classical satisfaction theories.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Reconstruct Aquinas's distinction between **passive obedience** (Christ's suffering/passion: removal of penalty, satisfaction for sin) and **active obedience** (Christ's lifelong fulfillment of the law: acquisition of merit that secures eternal life for believers).
 - Show how **personal union** (the hypostatic union) makes Christ's merits available to humanity: Christ acts as our head and representative, so his meritorious acts count for the members of the body.
 - Analyze Aquinas's account of **merit** (condign vs. congruous) and explain why Christ's merits are fittingly applied to sinners without violating divine justice or gratuitous grace.
 - Respond to modern critiques (e.g., that satisfaction theories are juridical, retributive, or ethically problematic) by emphasizing moral, relational, and teleological dimensions in Aquinas as read by Stump.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Thomas Aquinas (primary), Anselm (satisfaction tradition), Augustine (sin and grace), Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Philippians), later medieval scholastics, modern critics of substitutionary models, and contemporary analytic theologians.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union, representation), soteriology (atonement, merit, justification), grace and merit, original sin, divine justice and mercy, ecclesiology/mediation (imputation/application).
- **Closing line:** Stump presents a philosophically sharpened Thomistic synthesis: Christ's passive suffering satisfies the debt of sin while his active obedience secures eternal life for humanity, and the hypostatic union plus the doctrine of merit explain how those salvific effects are justly and fittingly applied to believers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Tight analytic reconstruction of medieval categories (condign/congruous merit) to answer contemporary objections about fairness and divine sovereignty.
 - Strong stress on **personal union** as the metaphysical ground for transfer of merit, rather than purely forensic imputation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects simplistic readings that reduce Aquinas to a cold juridical model; emphasizes moral and teleological motifs in Aquinas absent in many Protestant caricatures.
 - Contrasts with modern penal-substitution proponents by positing a broader role for active obedience (positive merit for eternal life) that is not exhausted by punishment-bearing.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of analytic notions of agency, representation, and constitution to explicate medieval terms (e.g., "condign merit" as a transpersonal fittingness grounded in union).
 - Clarifies roles of **satisfaction** versus **merit** and their complementary functions within a single atoning economy.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely read among analytic theologians, Catholic systematicians, and ecumenical scholars seeking rapprochement between Thomistic and Reformed emphases on Christ's obedience.
 - Valued for neutralizing certain objections to satisfaction accounts while preserving substitutionary structure.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear map of how classical Thomistic categories answer modern puzzles about imputation, justice, and representation.
 - Serves as a bridge text for courses comparing Anselmian, Thomistic, and Reformation atonement models.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience:** Christ's positive, law‑fulfilling life; secures the righteousness/merit necessary for eternal life.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death; satisfies the debt and removes the punishment due to sin.
- **Satisfaction (satisfactio):** The making-good of what sin damaged - central to Anselmian and Thomistic thinking about atonement.
- **Merit (condign vs. congruous):**
 - **Condign merit:** Merit that makes a rightful claim on God (fitting, proportionate); applied to Christ's works.
 - **Congruous merit:** Merits granted by God's goodness though not strictly owed.
- **Hypostatic union / personal union:** The metaphysical ground by which Christ's acts (active/passive) are representative and communicable to believers.
- **Imputation / application:** How Christ's righteousness and satisfaction are ascribed to believers; Stump emphasizes metaphysical participation along with forensic language.
- **Penal substitution:** Briefly critiqued/reinterpreted - Stump seeks to retain substitution without reducing atonement to mere punishment transfer.
- **Atonement models (satisfaction vs. Christus Victor vs. moral influence):** Stump defends a blended Thomistic satisfaction-merit model while acknowledging elements of victory and transformation.
- **Representation:** Christ as head/representative agent acting for the body of humanity.
- **Supererogation:** Christ's surplus merit; a Thomistic locus invoked to explain how Christ can merit more than required and apply it to others.
- **Grace & infused righteousness:** How God effects our share in Christ's merits beyond forensic declaration.
- **Mediation:** Christ's role as sole mediator effectuating both satisfaction and merit for believers.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Thomistic distinctions (active/passive obedience; condign/congruous merit).
- As a **polemic resource** against reductive penal-only readings of atonement.
- As an **exegetical/modeling** aid for interpreting Pauline texts on righteousness and imputation within a metaphysical framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses that integrate Christology, soteriology, and metaphysics.
