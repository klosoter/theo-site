### TITLE
The Church and Its Vocation: Lesslie Newbigin's Missionary Ecclesiology (Michael W. Goheen with Timothy Sheridan)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Engages late-20th-century missional recovery and post-Christendom debates; Newbigin writes out of long missionary experience in India and mid-century ecumenical conversations.
 - Goheen (with Sheridan) writes from a contemporary Reformed-missional milieu aiming to recover Newbigin for theological method, ecclesiology, and public theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church's **essential identity is missionary**: it exists by vocation to witness publicly to the gospel as the decisive truth for all life, thereby mediating the reign of God in culture without triumphalism or privatization.
 - Problem addressed: how to think church, mission, and culture after the collapse of Christendom and under pluralism/modern secularism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Newbigin's life and the formation of his thought in cross-cultural mission and ecumenism.
 - Theological reconstruction: grounding ecclesiology in a Trinitarian, Christocentric missiology where God's sending (Father-Son-Spirit) constitutes the church's being.
 - Cultural implications: critique of both cultural accommodation and withdrawal; presentation of the gospel as **public truth** that judges and renews cultures under the eschatological reign of God.
 - Practical consequences: how the church witnesses, forms disciples, and lives as a prophetic sign and foretaste of the kingdom.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Lesslie Newbigin (central corpus: The Open Secret; The Gospel in a Pluralist Society; Foolishness to the Greeks; The Household of God).
 - Interlocutors: modern secularism and pluralism, ecumenical movement, Barthianism, classical Reformed categories (Kuyperian cultural engagement), contemporaries in the missional church movement.
 - Use of biblical exegesis (Trinity, mission texts, kingdom motifs) to underpin ecclesial claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology** (mission-shaped ontology of the church)
 - **Trinitarian theology** (sending as ontological ground of mission)
 - **Christology** (lordship of Christ as public, judgmental, and saving)
 - **Revelation / Gospel-as-truth** (gospel as public truth vs. privatized religion)
 - **Eschatology** (church as foretaste and sign; mission as anticipatory judgment/renewal)
 - **Cultural theology** (dominion/cultural mandate reframed as witness not takeover)

- **Closing line**
 - The church is not primarily an institution or interest-group but a **sent people** whose vocation is to witness publicly to Christ as Lord, thereby mediating God's reign within and against the structures of contemporary culture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that mission is constitutive of the church's identity (not merely one of its activities).
 - Gospel articulated as **public truth**-truth that judges social and cultural claims rather than a private option among many.
 - Mission grounded in the Trinity: God's sending provides ontological basis for ecclesial sending.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on both **Kuyperian triumphalism** (overconfident cultural takeover models) and **privatized pietism** (withdrawal from public life).
 - Critiques reductionist missiology that treats mission as programmatics rather than as formative identity.
 - Positions Newbigin against simplistic pluralist tolerance that relegates truth-claims to private spheres.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasting the **cultural mandate / dominion** as a vocation of faithful witness and formational presence rather than domination.
 - Tight integration of ecclesiology and missiology: the church's structures, worship, and discipleship are evaluated by their capacity to sustain missionary vocation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in the missional church movement, especially within Reformed and evangelical contexts seeking public theology alternatives.
 - Stimulated renewed attention to Newbigin among scholars of mission, public theology, and ecclesiology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust corrective to privatized religion and naïve culturalism.
 - Serves as a usable model for training congregations to think missionally in pluralist settings.
 - Promotes a Trinitarian framework that coheres doctrinal reflection with praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missionary ecclesiology**: the claim that the church's very being is defined by sending and witness.
- **Vocation**: the church's calling to embody and proclaim God's reign publicly.
- **Cultural mandate / dominion**: reframed as vocation to steward creation by witness and renewal, not domination.
- **Gospel as public truth**: the gospel makes truth-claims that stand in judgment over cultural narratives.
- **Public witness**: the church's speech and deeds in civil society as forms of apostolic proclamation.
- **Sign and foretaste**: the church as visible anticipatory manifestation of God's eschatological reign.
- **Trinitarian sending**: theological grounding that God's intra-Trinitarian mission authorizes and structures ecclesial mission.
- **Christendom critique**: analysis of the church's previous alignment with state power and the need for post-Christendom ecclesial forms.
- **Pluralism**: contested context requiring gospel truth to be held publicly without imperialism.
- **Formation / discipleship**: missional practices that shape identity for witness, not merely moral instruction.
- **Eschatological judgment**: mission includes judgmental dimension-gospel exposes and transforms false claims.
- **Prophetic public theology**: church's speech as critique and constructive alternative within civil space.
- **Sending / witness**: technical pair-sending (origin: God) and witness (task of the church in culture).

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: clarifies "missional church" and grounds ecclesial identity theologically.
 - As a **polemic**: deployed against privatizing religion, cultural accommodation, or triumphalist cultural dominance.
 - As an **exegetical model**: reads biblical texts (Trinity, mission, kingdom) to reframe ecclesial practices and formation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: serves instructors and pastors who wish to reorient congregational life around vocation and public witness.
