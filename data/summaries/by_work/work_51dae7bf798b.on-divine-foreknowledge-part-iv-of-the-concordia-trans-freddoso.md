### TITLE
On Divine Foreknowledge: Part IV of the Concordia (trans. Freddoso) - Luis de Molina (Concordia, 1588; English trans. Freddoso)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Jesuit scholasticism amid the Counter-Reformation; published as part of Molina's Concordia (Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis).
 - Polemical interlocutors: Dominican Thomists (notably Domingo Báñez) and, by extension, Calvinists; immediate context is intra-Catholic debate over grace, predestination, and human freedom.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God possesses a distinctive knowledge - **scientia media (middle knowledge)** - of true counterfactuals about how free creatures would act in any hypothetical circumstance. This knowledge enables God to providentially order creation without violating libertarian free will.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establish the trichotomy of divine knowledge:
 - **Scientia naturalis**: God's knowledge of all possible truths (including natural consequences).
 - **Scientia media**: knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (what free agents would do in any circumstance).
 - **Scientia divina (free knowledge)**: knowledge of actual future contingents after God decrees creation.
 - Show metaphysical status and truthmakers of counterfactuals of freedom - they are true independently of God's decree and intelligible because creatures have dispositions.
 - Argue that middle knowledge is logically prior to God's creative decree and so can be used by God to choose which feasible world to actualize; thus God foreknows free acts without causally determining them.
 - Reconcile efficacious grace with genuine freedom: God can foresee how particular graces will be freely received and thus order grace congruently without physical premotion (contra Báñez).
 - Respond to Thomist objections (novelty, undermining of divine sovereignty, doubts about truth of counterfactuals).
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Engages Augustine and Aquinas for patristic and scholastic context; principally opposes the Báñezian Thomists; later interpreters include Suarez, and modern interlocutors span Arminians, Calvinists, and analytic philosophers (Plantinga, Mackie, etc.).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine knowledge and omniscience, providence, predestination, grace (sufficient vs. efficacious), free will (libertarian), concurrence, contingency, election.
- **Closing line**
 - Molina's theological center of gravity: God's providential sovereignty is exercised through **middle knowledge** - God foresees true counterfactuals and selects a world so that divine governance and genuine libertarian human freedom coherently coexist.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic development of **scientia media** as the lynchpin for reconciling providence and libertarian freedom.
 - Emphasis on God's practical reasoning: God chooses among feasible worlds on the basis of what free creatures would do.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Explicitly rejects Thomistic **physical premotion** and the view that efficacious grace irresistibly moves the will; instead locates the compatibility of grace and freedom in God's prior knowledge of how grace would be freely received.
 - Opposes deterministic readings of predestination: election is not simple causal imposition but selection informed by middle knowledge.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Formalization and defense of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)** as meaningful, truth-bearing propositions that ground divine foreknowledge.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Sparked the Jesuit-Thomist controversy; became the foundation of **Molinism** within Catholic theology.
 - Influenced Protestant debates (used by Arminians against strict Calvinism) and revived in contemporary analytic philosophy of religion as a central model for addressing divine foreknowledge and free will.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust, systematic account for those seeking to retain libertarian freedom within a theistic providence; remains a primary resource for philosophical theology on omniscience, counterfactuals, and providential deliberation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)**: God's knowledge of true counterfactuals about what free creatures would do in specified circumstances; logically prior to God's creative decree.
- **Scientia naturalis (natural knowledge)**: knowledge of all possibilities and necessary relations; not contingent on God's will.
- **Scientia divina / free knowledge**: God's knowledge of actual future realities resulting from God's creative decree.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)**: propositions of the form "If A were in circumstance C, A would freely do X"; Molina defends their truth and metaphysical grounding.
- **Feasible worlds**: worlds congruent with God's knowledge of counterfactuals; God chooses among these when decreeing creation.
- **Predestination by foreknowledge**: Molina's account where election is informed by middle knowledge (God elects persons based on how He foresees they will freely respond under certain graces).
- **Efficacious grace (Molinist framing)**: grace that, in concrete circumstances God foresees, will be freely accepted and effect the intended good without physical premotion.
- **Physical premotion**: Thomist term for a divine motion that ensures a particular effect in the will; Molina rejects this as determinative of free action.
- **Concurrence**: doctrine of divine cooperation with created causes; Molina affirms concurrence understood compatibly with libertarian freedom.
- **Libertarian free will**: real alternative possibilities in human acts; central to Molina's account.
- **Providence (Molinist emphasis)**: divine governance achieved via foreknowledge of conditional human actions rather than micro-determinative causation.
- **Contingency**: genuine openness of future free acts prior to God's creative choice, preserved by middle knowledge.
- **Truthmakers for counterfactuals**: Molina insists counterfactuals have truth grounded in creaturely dispositions or inclinations, not merely divine decree.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and systematic exemplar for Molinist doctrine (scientia media).
- As a **polemic** against Thomist (and by extension strict Calvinist) accounts of predestination and physical premotion.
- As an **exegetical and theological model** for reading biblical texts that attribute foreknowledge and election to God without collapsing human freedom into determinism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates on divine foreknowledge, providence, and the metaphysics of counterfactuals.
