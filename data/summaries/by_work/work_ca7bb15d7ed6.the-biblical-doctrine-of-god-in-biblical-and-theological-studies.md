### TITLE
The Biblical Doctrine of God - B. B. Warfield (Princeton, Biblical and Theological Studies)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Warfield writes from the late 19th / early 20th‑century Princeton school. The work arises amid conservative Reformed responses to liberal theology, German historical criticism, and rising philosophical naturalism. Method blends confessional Calvinism, Biblical exegesis, and engagement with contemporary philosophy of religion.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A defense and exposition of classical theism rooted in Scripture: God is self‑existent, sovereign, immutable, and fully knowable only in revelation. Warfield aims to show the biblical warrant for classical attributes while answering modern challenges that relativize or humanize God.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Exegetical grounding: systematic exposition of divine self‑revelation in Scripture as the basis for doctrine.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: articulation of essential attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, eternity, omniscience, omnipotence) and relational/volitional aspects (will, covenantal love, grace).
 - Polemic: rebuttal of contemporary errors-anthropomorphism, modalism of divine change, and philosophies that reduce God to a finite or processual being.
 - Practical consequence: God's sovereignty and providence as the basis for worship, prayer, and assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** heavy reliance on Scripture, with appeal to Augustine and the classical scholastics, Reformation (especially Calvin), and engagement with contemporaries in the Princeton tradition (e.g., A. A. Hodge) and critics in modern liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and accommodation, divine attributes (absolute and relative), Trinity (classical orthodox formulation), providence, omniscience/foreknowledge, immutability and impassibility, condescension/accommodation in Christ and Scripture.
- **Closing line:** Warfield centers the doctrine of God on a biblical classical theism that insists on divine sovereignty and aseity while explaining God's condescending acts of revelation as accommodation rather than ontological change.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Stresses a disciplined balance: God is absolutely transcendent (essence and attributes) yet truly immanent through revelation and covenantal condescension.
 - Gives primacy to Scripture as corrective to both speculative metaphysics and sentimental religiosity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects liberal tendency to domesticate God by emphasizing divine independence and immutable character.
 - Refines scholastic language to avoid dry abstraction-attributes are tied to biblical acts and revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Nuanced use of **absolute vs relative attributes**: Warfield insists on distinguishing an attribute insofar as it belongs to God in Himself (absolute) and insofar as it is manifested toward creatures (relative); this preserves simplicity while accounting for relational theology.
 - Clear defense of **divine condescension** as accommodation: God condescends in revelation and incarnation without forfeiting immutability.
- **Reception and influence:** long‑standing authority in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; used extensively in seminary curricula as a model of biblically anchored systematic theology. Criticized by process theologians and later open theists for its strong claims about immutability and exhaustive foreknowledge.
- **Enduring value:** exemplary for integrating rigorous exegesis with systematic formulation; valuable pedagogically for showing how classical attributes function within Reformed piety and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity:** God's self‑existence and independence; the ground for all other attributes.
- **Divine simplicity:** No composition in God; attributes are identical to God's essence in Warfield's reading of classical theism.
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo essential change; volitional acts are consistent with eternal will.
- **Impassibility:** God is not passible in the sense of being subject to uncontrolled passions; Warfield allows relational suffering in the redemptive economy only as condescension, not essential change.
- **Omniscience / Foreknowledge:** Exhaustive knowledge of past, present, and future; Warfield's account opposes views that limit God's foresight (see relevance to Open Theism).
 - Site usage note: In answering modern debates, Warfield is frequently cited against Open Theism on the ground of exhaustive divine foreknowledge.
- **Omnipotence / Sovereignty:** Absolute authority over creaturely history; providence is God's sustaining and ordering action.
- **Providence:** Continuous, sovereign governance that includes permissive will; explained without compromising divine immutability.
- **Absolute and relative attributes:** 
 - **Absolute:** Attributes internal to God's being (e.g., aseity, simplicity).
 - **Relative:** Attributes expressed toward creation (e.g., mercy, grace, covenantal faithfulness).
 - Site usage note: Warfield's distinction is a primary reference for the topic "Absolute And Relative Attributes" in contemporary theological discussions.
- **Condescension / Accommodation:** God's voluntary lowering of divine self‑disclosure to communicate with finite creatures; crucial to Warfield's defense of scriptural anthropomorphic language.
 - Connection to Open Theism: Warfield's account of condescension is used polemically to show that God can genuinely relate without relinquishing exhaustive knowledge or immutability.
- **Revelation:** Christocentric and verbal Scripture as God's chosen means of self‑disclosure.
- **Grace / Covenant:** God's relational dealings grounded in sovereign election and covenant promises.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulations of divine attributes (esp. absolute vs relative).
- As a **polemic** reference against modern models (Open Theism, process theology) that modify immutability or exhaustive foreknowledge.
- As an **exegetical model** linking biblical text to systematic categories and homiletic/pastoral applications.
