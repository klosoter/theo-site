### TITLE
Justice: Rights and Wrongs - Nicholas Wolterstorff (Princeton Univ. Press, 2008)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century conversation on human rights; Wolterstorff writing as an analytic philosopher trained in Reformed theology. Part of a wider Christian intervention into political philosophy reacting to Rawlsian liberalism, utilitarianism, and secular defences of rights.
- **Central thesis**
 - Human rights are objective moral claims that require a theistic grounding; secular accounts (utilitarian, purely contractual, or proceduralist) are inadequate to secure the moral authority and bindingness of rights.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents a conceptual foundation: clarifies what rights are (claim-rights, correlative duties) using Hohfeldian tools.
 - Critiques dominant secular accounts (utilitarianism, social contract, autonomy-centered accounts) for failing to account for the inviolability and weight of rights.
 - Advances a theistic account: persons are created by God and bear inherent dignity; God's moral relation to creatures secures objective moral demands and thus rights.
 - Applies the view to practical justice questions (priority of rights over aggregate utility; obligations to repair injustice; political implications for law and public policy).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages analytic philosophers of rights and political theorists: Rawls, Nozick, utilitarians, and Hohfeld (rights analysis); draws on biblical and Reformed theological resources for theistic grounding.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropological doctrines: human dignity, creaturehood, moral standing.
 - Theological ethics: God as ground of moral obligation; implications for neighbor-love and reparative duties.
 - Political theology: public role of rights, limits of state action, obligations to victims.
- **Closing line**
 - Wolterstorff argues that justice rooted in objective human rights makes the most sense when rights are traced to the divine Creator and the attendant moral claims God places upon creatures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Explicit theistic metaphysical grounding of rights rather than appeal to secular moral intuitions or constructivist procedures.
 - Integration of analytic clarity (Hohfeldian rights taxonomy) with theological anthropology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects Rawlsian proceduralism and utilitarian reductionism as unable to account for why rights have inviolability or trumping force.
 - Distances from purely Kantian autonomy accounts by stressing relational and creational bases of dignity rather than autonomous self-legislation alone.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts "human dignity" as a theologically anchored moral status that does normative work in political philosophy - not merely rhetorical.
 - Emphasizes reparative obligations as essential corollaries of rights-violations (moral duty to repair wrongs grounded in God's justice).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Christian ethical and political theology circles; influential for scholars seeking a robust theistic account of rights.
 - Praised for clarity and for pulling theological resources into analytic debate; critiqued by secular theorists who resist theological grounding or who prefer secular foundations (e.g., Kantian or contractualist reconstructions).
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for bringing theology into serious analytic discussion of rights; useful for courses on political theology, Christian ethics, and philosophy of human rights.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rights (claim-rights)** - central moral entities: correlate to duties in others; not reducible to interests or utilities.
- **Hohfeldian analysis** - analytic tool Wolterstorff employs to clarify the logical structure of rights (claim, liberty, power, immunity).
- **Theistic grounding** - the claim that God and the doctrine of creation provide the metaphysical and moral basis for objective rights.
- **Human dignity** - theological account: dignity derives from creaturehood and divine relation, not merely autonomy or social contract.
- **Moral realism** - commitment that moral claims (including rights) are objectively true and binding.
- **Reparative justice** - emphasis on obligations to repair harms when rights are violated; not limited to procedural retribution or redistribution.
- **Trumping force of rights** - rights possess priority over aggregate utility or purely consequentialist calculations.
- **Critique of Rawls / utilitarianism** - argues these fail to secure the normative weight and grounding of rights.
- **Relational ontology** - persons are fundamentally relational creatures; relations help explain rights-bearing status and duties.
- **Public reason / political implications** - exploration of how a theistic grounding can inform public policy without collapsing into sectarianism.
- **Suffering as moral evidence** - appeals to suffering and wrong as moral phenomena that point beyond reductive secular accounts.
- **Duties to victims** - concrete theological-ethical prescriptions for restitution and care.
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: cited for a theologically grounded analytic definition of rights in moral theology and political theology.
 - Polemic/resource: used to critique secular foundations of rights and to argue for Christian public engagement on justice.
