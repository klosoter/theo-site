### TITLE
The Imputation of Christ's Righteousness - Michael Reeves

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical theology (early 21st century). Written for pastors, students, and theologians seeking a robust defense and exposition of classical Protestant teaching on justification in the face of both Roman Catholic and New Perspective critiques.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God reckons Christ's righteousness to believers by virtue of union with Christ; this forensic imputation is the necessary ground of justification and assurance, distinct from but inseparable in practice from sanctification.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, 2 Corinthians) to establish the language of righteousness, reckoning, and justification.
 - Historical-theological genealogy: tracing Protestant formulations (Luther, Calvin, Westminster divines) and contrasting them with medieval (infusion) and some modern (New Perspective) alternatives.
 - Theological logic: argues that the double exchange (our sin to Christ; his righteousness to us) coheres only if grounded in union with Christ - a real, covenantal, federal headship that makes the imputation intelligible.
 - Pastoral implications: assurance, gospel preaching, and sanctification flow from a right account of imputation without collapsing justification into moral transformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary biblical voice), Reformers (Calvin, Luther), Westminster and post-Reformation expositors (e.g., John Owen, John Murray), critics such as proponents of the New Perspective on Paul (N. T. Wright et al.), and Roman Catholic soteriology (infusional models).
- **Doctrines treated:** justification, union with Christ, atonement (substitution and satisfaction), active and passive obedience of Christ, sanctification, covenant theology, forensic/declarative language, Christology, righteousness of God.
- **Closing line:** The work insists that **forensic imputation rooted in union with Christ** is the doctrinal linchpin that preserves gospel assurance, proper Christology, and the distinction between justification and sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Union-centered account:** Strong emphasis that imputation is not merely a legal fiction but rests on the believer's real union with Christ (federal headship and mystical union together), bridging forensic and ontological language.
- **Balanced treatment of active/passive obedience:** Rehabilitates the doctrine that both Christ's passive obedience (suffering and atonement) and active obedience (perfect law-fulfillment) are imputed to believers, arguing this is necessary for positive righteousness.
- **Corrective to infusion and moral exemplarism:** Explicit rebuttal of Roman Catholic infusionist models and contemporary attempts to reduce justification to moral transformation or covenantal membership without forensic declaration.
- **Engagement with New Perspective:** Offers exegetical and theological counters to NPP readings, defending traditional Pauline readings of 'righteousness' and 'works' while acknowledging covenantal shapes of first-century Judaism.
- **Pastoral clarity and apologetic utility:** Written with pastoral concerns - assurance, preaching, pastoral counseling - making a technical doctrine accessible and pastorally serviceable.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a concise, readable synthesis that clarifies contested terminology, recovers classical Protestant emphases, and equips contemporary pastors and students for debates about justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation:** The forensic reckoning of Christ's righteousness to believers; an external, declarative transfer grounded in union with Christ.
- **Double imputation:** Twofold exchange - our sin is laid on Christ; Christ's righteousness is credited to believers.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's perfect law-keeping; presented as positively imputed to believers so they stand righteous before God.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and bearing of punishment for sin; imputed as the ground of atonement.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological-covenantal bond that makes imputation intelligible; believer is in Christ and shares his legal standing.
- **Forensic/forensic declaration:** Judicial language describing God's declaration of righteousness, distinct from internal moral change.
- **Alien righteousness:** Righteousness belonging to Christ but accounted to believers; maintained as gracious and non-meritous.
- **Infusion (contrast):** Roman Catholic notion of righteousness being infused into the soul; contrasted with Protestant imputation.
- **Righteousness of God (Pauline):** Explored as both God's own faithfulness and the righteousness he grants believers through Christ.
- **Justification vs. sanctification:** Justification is declarative and imputative; sanctification is progressive and transformative - both related but not identical.
- **Covenant of grace / federal headship:** The covenantal framework that locates Christ as representative; key to explaining how imputation operates.
- **Satisfaction/substitutionary atonement:** The penal and representative character of Christ's work that makes imputation theologically necessary.
- **Declarative assurance:** Assurance grounded in the declarative act of God imputing Christ's righteousness, sustaining pastoral confidence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for imputation in seminary courses and doctrinal summaries.
- As a **polemic** tool against infusionist Catholic theology and reductionist New Perspective readings.
- As an **exegetical model** for treating Pauline texts on righteousness and justification.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and pastoral theology on assurance, union with Christ, and the believer's legal standing.
