### TITLE
The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text (Sidney Greidanus, 1988)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical homiletical response to perceived fragmentation between biblical scholarship and pulpit practice.
 - Reaction to two dominant tendencies: liberal historical-critical reduction of theological content, and pietistic/topical preaching that severs exegesis from theological proclamation.
 - Emergent interest in redemptive-historical reading within Reformed and evangelical circles.

- **Central thesis**
 - Preaching must be both historically responsible and theologically centered: the preacher should read the "ancient text" with exegetical rigor and deliver a sermon that makes the redemptive-historical, Christological meaning of that text decisive for contemporary faith and practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: modern preaching often errs by (a) treating scripture as a repository of isolated moral lessons or (b) reducing scripture to historical data without theological connection to Christ.
 - Prescriptive: propose a method that unites exegesis, biblical theology, and homiletical application.
 - Step 1: careful exegesis within historical and literary context.
 - Step 2: locate the text within the canon and redemptive-historical progression (promise-fulfillment trajectory).
 - Step 3: formulate the theological/Christocentric point of the text.
 - Step 4: translate that theological point into contemporary addresses and applications for covenantal communities.
 - Practical chapters show how to preach Psalms, prophetic texts, narratives, and epistles without collapsing into allegory or irrelevant ethics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with contemporary homileticians, biblical theologians, and exegetes of the late 20th century.
 - Dialogues implicitly with trends from Schleiermacher-derived pietism (subjective application), historical-critical scholarship (descriptive exegesis), and with redemptive-historical voices from Reformed biblical-theology tradition (e.g., Vos, Ridderbos).
 - Draws on canonical reading and examples from OT and NT texts to demonstrate method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: scripture as authoritative, divinely guided revelation requiring theological reading.
 - **Christology**: Christ as the telos of Scripture; necessary center of sermon interpretation.
 - **Covenant**: covenantal-historical framework for connecting texts across epochs.
 - **Typology / fulfillment**: legitimate use of typology within controlled exegetical rules.
 - Auxiliary concerns: inspiration, authority, pastoral application.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Preaching must bridge the historical particularity of the ancient text and the gospel-centered demands of the church by showing how each text participates in the one unfolding redemptive work of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a disciplined, theologically informed exegesis that culminates in explicit Christological proclamation rather than implicit moralizing.
 - Treats the Old and New Testaments as a unified redemptive-historical story, not disconnected manuals.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges topical and homiletical models that prioritize immediate relevance over textual fidelity.
 - Counters both liberal reductionism (text as mere history) and pietistic subjectivism (text as mere ethical stimulus) by insisting on theological, Christ-centered meaning.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the phrase and practice of "preaching the Christ of the text" as an operational homiletical rule: the sermon must show the text's contribution to the gospel narrative.
 - Clarifies controlled typology and fulfillment patterns as legitimate exegetical moves when rooted in canonical and grammatical-historical constraints.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical and Reformed homiletical pedagogy; foundational text in many seminary preaching courses.
 - Stimulated later, more detailed works on preaching Christ from the Old Testament and helped normalize redemptive-historical approaches in mainstream evangelicalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a corrective to both historical skepticism and populist topicalism.
 - Practical and teachable method that links rigorous exegesis with congregational proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive-historical**: reading texts as part of God's unfolding covenantal work culminating in Christ.
- **Christocentric/Christological preaching**: making Jesus Christ the decisive interpretive key for every sermon.
- **Exegesis**: disciplined, historical-grammatical analysis as the preacher's starting point.
- **Typology**: legitimate identification of persons/events in Scripture as foreshadowings of Christ when responsibly constrained.
- **Promise-fulfillment**: interpretive motif showing how earlier promises are realized in later revelation, especially in Christ.
- **Canonical context**: reading each unit within the Bible's overall structure and trajectory.
- **Application (theological/practical)**: moving from the text's theological claim to contemporary covenantal responsibility.
- **Homiletical method**: staged process from textual analysis to theological claim to contemporary address.
- **Hermeneutical guardrails**: rules against arbitrary allegory and against reducing text to mere ethics or facts.
- **Historical responsibility**: respect for original meaning and authorial intent as the foundation for theological use.
- **Pietistic/topical critique**: label for preaching that prioritizes felt needs or moral tips over theological exposition.
- **Fulfillment**: the NT's realization of OT promises; a locus for connecting Testaments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for christocentric, redemptive-historical homiletics.
- As a **pedagogical model** in seminaries for structuring expository sermons that are theologically driven.
- As an **exegetical model and polemic** against purely topical or purely historical-critical preaching approaches.
