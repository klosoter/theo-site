### TITLE
The Mosaic Covenant: A "Republication" of the Covenant of Works? (essay by Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in The Law is Not of Faith)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed covenant-theology debate; published within a corrective volume addressing the role of law in Pauline and covenant theology.
 - Engages contemporary Klinean and post-Klinean discussions that argued the Mosaic covenant functioned as a renewed or "republication" of the Adamic covenant of works.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Mosaic covenant is not a republication of the covenant of works; instead it functions within the single historical covenant of grace as a distinct administration that contains law's condemning function but never reestablishes a covenantal principle of salvation by works.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: distinguishes several senses in which "republication" has been used (formal covenantal status vs. pedagogical/condemnatory function).
 - Exegetical move: reads key biblical texts (esp. Pauline texts like Romans and Galatians, and Old Testament covenant texts) to show Paul's use of the law and the Mosaic covenant does not equate to a reoffering of life-by-works covenantally.
 - Theological-historical move: appeals to Reformed confessional tradition and to the unity of the covenant of grace to show continuity between Adam, Abraham, Sinai, and Christ without a full return to covenantal works.
 - Doctrinal clarification: separates the law's **demand** (still categorical under Sinai) from the **covenantal status** of the Mosaic arrangement; emphasizes mediation, typology, and sacrificial institutions as pointers to Christ rather than a new works-based covenant.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Explicitly addresses proponents of the republication thesis (notably Klinean formulations); converses with Reformed confessional sources and Pauline exegesis tradition.
 - Uses covenant theologians and confessional standards as normative checkpoints.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as covenant witness), covenant (works/grace distinction and administrations), law (moral/ceremonial distinctions, function), soteriology (faith vs. works), Christology (mediatorial fulfillment), typology.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Gaffin centers the book's claim: Sinai's law performs a pedagogical and condemnatory role within the covenant of grace's history, but it does not reconstitute a covenant of life-by-works; Christ's mediatorial fulfillment preserves covenant unity and guarantees righteousness by faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing functional/legal aspects of Sinai from covenantal reconstitution; careful parsing of Paul's language about law and works.
 - Strong Christocentric reading: Sinai's institutions are covenantal administrations pointing forward to Christ rather than retroactive restorations of Adamic covenantal economy.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Klinean-style republication that collapses pedagogical condemnation into covenantal reestablishment of works-principle.
 - Pushes back on readings that make Sinai the locus where sinners are again offered life upon works; instead insists Sinai confirms Adamic condemnation while remaining under God's grace-history.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reasserts the helpfulness of distinguishing "administrations" of a single covenant of grace vs. multiple, competing covenants.
 - Clarifies the term "republication" by distinguishing moral demand, pedagogical use, and covenantal offer.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed scholarship and seminary instruction as a corrective to republication trends.
 - Stimulated further discussion on Pauline use of "works" and the nature of Mosaic covenant in covenant theology debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a cautious, exegetically disciplined template for preserving covenant continuity without collapsing the law/gospel antithesis.
 - Valuable for pastors and students adjudicating law's role in preaching and catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic covenant**
 - The covenant given at Sinai; holds law's demands, sanctions, and sacrificial institutions in a distinct administration.
- **Republication (of the covenant of works)**
 - The thesis that Sinai re-imposed the covenant of works; Gaffin restricts this term and denies a true covenantal republication.
- **Covenant of works**
 - Covenant in Adam where life is conditioned on perfect obedience; not reconstituted at Sinai according to Gaffin.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - Single redemptive covenant administered historically (patriarchal, Mosaic, New Covenant); central category for Gaffin's continuity argument.
- **Law (demand vs. administration)**
 - Distinguishes the unchanging moral demand from the Mosaic administration that applies and mediates that demand.
- **Tutor / pedagogical function**
 - Paul's language (e.g., Galatians) showing law's role to expose sin and lead to Christ; Gaffin affirms pedagogy without covenantal republication.
- **Works (Pauline sense)**
 - "Works of the law" as Paul's category for human performance-oriented righteousness; Gaffin insists on careful exegetical limits.
- **Typology / sacrificial system**
 - Sinai's rites as anticipatory, pointing to Christ's fulfillment rather than serving as a covenantal works-offer.
- **Mediator / Christological fulfillment**
 - Christ as the true mediator who secures the covenant of grace and fulfills the law's demands.
- **Condemnation vs. covenantal offer**
 - Key analytical contrast: law can condemn sinners without functioning as an offer of life-by-works.
- **Confessional covenant theology**
 - Gaffin appeals to the Reformed tradition's frameworks (Westminster) to ground his continuity claims.
- **Administration**
 - The idea that the covenant of grace has diverse historical administrations (patriarchal, Mosaic, evangelical).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for precise uses of "republication" and "administration" in covenant theology.
- As a **polemic** against Klinean republication readings and similar proposals.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline law texts within a covenant-historical framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching to preserve law/gospel balance while maintaining covenant unity.
