### TITLE
**Alvin Plantinga, Knowledge and Christian Belief** (Oxford University Press, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2010s analytic philosophy of religion and epistemology; capstone to Plantinga's long defense of Reformed epistemology (cf. Warranted Christian Belief).
 - Engages contemporary debates about religious epistemology, evidentialism, and the rationality/knowability of theistic claims. (Topics cited: **Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God**; **Existence And Knowability Of God**.)
- **Central thesis**
 - Christian belief can be genuine knowledge: many central Christian propositional and experiential beliefs are both rational and epistemically warranted - sometimes constituting knowledge - even if they lack the sorts of argument/evidence demanded by strict evidentialism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies the concept of knowledge and the nature of epistemic warrant (building on Plantinga's proper function account).
 - Argues that belief in God can arise from properly functioning cognitive faculties (including the sensus divinitatis) in appropriate epistemic environments and thus can have warrant.
 - Treats objections: doxastic defeaters, divine hiddenness, religious disagreement, and the evidentialist charge that belief without evidence is irrational.
 - Applies the account to specific Christian claims (e.g., knowledge of God, revelation, and particular Christian doctrines) to show how they may meet standards for knowledge.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Internal dialogue with Plantinga's own earlier work (Warranted Christian Belief), engagement with evidentialists (W. K. Clifford style), and contemporary epistemologists (internalists vs externalists).
 - Engages broader philosophy of religion conversations: theistic skepticism, Alvin Goldman's reliabilism (indirectly), and critics of Reformed epistemology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and the role of perceptual/transformative cognitive faculties (sensus divinitatis).
 - Faith and its relation to knowledge; epistemology of religious experience.
 - Implications for doctrines that rest on historical claims (e.g., resurrection, incarnation) insofar as they enter the epistemic calculus.
- **Closing line**
 - Plantinga locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that properly formed Christian belief - grounded in divinely designed cognitive faculties and reliable epistemic processes - can legitimately count as knowledge even absent evidentialist-style proofs.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Recommends a robustly externalist account of warrant applied to religious belief: epistemic credentials derive from proper function, design plan, and truth-directedness rather than solely from evidentialist justification.
 - Reasserts and refines the role of a sensus divinitatis (a cognitive faculty producing belief in God) as epistemically central.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts sharply with evidentialists (e.g., Clifford) who require propositional evidence before belief; rebukes the idea that absence of argument equals irrationality.
 - Moves beyond simple reliabilism by emphasizing design plans and the theistic explanatory framework for cognitive faculties.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Further develops Plantinga's notion of **warrant** as distinct from mere justification; emphasizes proper function in an theistic explanatory context.
 - Tightens discussion of **defeaters** in religious contexts - when communal, cognitive, or historical defeaters succeed or fail.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed epistemology and philosophy of religion; reinvigorated apologetic strategies that rely on cognitive faculties and experiential warrant.
 - Provoked critical responses from evidentialists, some naturalistic epistemologists, and those pressing defeater and disagreement challenges.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a contemporary, philosophically rigorous resource for articulating how Christian conviction can meet modern standards for knowledge; valuable in courses on epistemology of religion and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Warrant** - the property that, when added to true belief, yields knowledge; central technical concept refined from Plantinga's earlier work.
- **Proper function** - cognitive faculties operating in the environment for which they were designed and aimed at truth; key condition for warrant.
- **Sensus divinitatis** - proposed cognitive faculty producing belief in God; a primary source of warranted Christian belief in Plantinga's account.
- **Defeater / defeater status** - considerations or evidence that undermine warrant; treatment of when alleged defeaters for religious belief actually succeed.
- **Evidentialism** - epistemic view requiring evidence for belief; Plantinga's principal foil.
- **Externalism vs internalism** - debate over whether warrant depends on external factors (Plantinga's emphasis) or internal access; book favors externalist criteria.
- **Knowledge (religious)** - true, warranted belief about God or Christian claims; aim is to show Christian belief meets this standard.
- **Design plan** - the putative intended operation of cognitive faculties, invoked to explain reliability and warrant.
- **Epistemic environment** - background conditions affecting the proper function and reliability of faculties.
- **Religious experience** - treated as a source of belief and possible warrant when produced by proper function.
- **Rationality** - concept separated from evidential proof; Plantinga emphasizes rational permissibility of belief without proof.
- **Theistic epistemology** - the framing claim that theistic commitments can ground epistemic practices and explain warrant.
- **Defeaters from disagreement** - analysis of whether peer disagreement about religion undermines warrant.
- **Knowledge of God** - focal locus: how personal beliefs about God can satisfy conditions for knowledge.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "warrant" and proper-function accounts in theology and philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic** against evidentialist apologetics and skeptical critiques of Christian belief.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for courses on epistemology of revelation, faith-as-knowledge, and defenses of experiential warrant.
