### TITLE
**Justification and Union with Christ** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., essay in Justified in Christ (ed. James K. Beilby & Paul R. Eddy). 
Context: mid-21st century Reformed-evangelical intervention in post‑New Perspective debates; placed within a volume exploring biblical and systematic accounts of justification.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Reaction to late 20th-early 21st century debates (New Perspective on Paul; controversies about the nature of justification and covenantal belonging).
 - Situated in Reformed covenantal theology; aimed at preserving classical forensic categories while reasserting the centrality of union with Christ.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Justification must be understood as the forensic declaration of righteousness grounded in the believer's real, objective **union with Christ**; imputation of Christ's righteousness (derived from both his active and passive obedience) is the decisive ground of that declaration.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful reading of Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, 2 Corinthians) to show that Paul situates justification in believers' participation/union with Christ.
 - Theological construction:
 - Distinguishes **forensic declaration** from the ontic reality of participation - they are distinct but inseparable in the economy of salvation.
 - Defends **imputation** (both guilt-to-Christ and righteousness-to-believer) as the appropriate category to speak of how Christ's obedience is reckoned to believers.
 - Doctrinal corollaries:
 - Justification and sanctification are related through union but remain conceptually distinct; union supplies the ground for forensic reckoning without collapsing into moralism or Pelagianism.
 - Argues for the inclusion of both **Christ's active obedience** (positive righteousness lived) and **passive obedience** (suffering and death) in the content of what is imputed.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, Westminster divines), 19th-20th century defenders of imputation (Warfield, Murray), and contemporary interlocutors in the New Perspective (implicit contrast to Dunn/Sanders) and to revisionists like Norman Shepherd.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification), Christology (person and work; active/passive obedience), covenant theology (federal headship, imputation), original sin and Adamic imputation, union with Christ, forensic vs. participatory accounts.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **justification is a forensic declaration whose objective ground is the believer's real union with Christ and the imputation of Christ's obedience.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presses an integrated account: unity of justification and sanctification in union without erasing the forensic nature of justification.
 - Strong insistence that union with Christ is not merely relational language but the ontological vehicle by which imputation is wrought.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects two extremes: (1) purely forensic models that sever justification from union/participation; (2) participatory or covenantal readings that reduce justification to membership or moral transformation without preserving judicial declaration.
 - Reasserts imputation against those who redefine righteousness as merely "faithful covenant status" or presentism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines talk of imputation by tying the category explicitly to the metaphysic of union - imputation as the forensic effect of covenantal representation in the believer's union with Christ.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well regarded in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a balanced corrective to New Perspective tendencies and to revisionist pastoral proposals.
 - Frequently cited in courses on Pauline theology, covenant theology, and systematic treatments of justification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an exegetically anchored, theologically disciplined model that is pedagogically useful: preserves forensic clarity while taking union seriously as the theological linchpin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ**
 - The central relational/ontological reality by which believers share in Christ's person and benefits; the ground for imputation and sanctification.
- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration of righteousness; distinct from but grounded in participation in Christ.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic reckoning: Christ's obedience/guilt is counted to believers; Adam's guilt is counted to humanity in federal headship.
- **Active obedience of Christ**
 - Christ's lifelong obedience (fulfilled law-keeping) whose righteousness is imputed to believers as positive righteousness.
 - Used to defend the completeness of what is credited to believers (not only forgiveness but positive righteousness).
- **Passive obedience of Christ**
 - Christ's suffering and death; necessary aspect of redemption and imputed benefit alongside active obedience.
- **Original sin / Adamic imputation**
 - Federal headship: Adam's sin imputed to his posterity, contrasted and paralleled with Christ's representative obedience imputed to believers.
- **Forensic declaration (verdict)**
 - The judicial act of God in which the believer is pronounced righteous on account of Christ.
- **Participation (participatory language)**
 - Believers' real sharing in Christ's death/resurrection; the existential ground of union.
- **Federal headship**
 - Representation model that undergirds both Adamic imputation and Christ's representative obedience.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive renewal in union with Christ, related to but distinguishable from justification.
- **Double imputation (implicit)**
 - Guilt to Christ and righteousness to believer - conceptual framework used to explain exchange.
- **Alien righteousness**
 - Christ's righteousness as external to the believer but reckoned to them; defended as compatible with genuine participation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for **union-with-Christ** accounts of justification that preserve forensic categories. 
- As a polemical resource against New Perspective reductions and revisionist pastoral models (e.g., Shepherdian readings). 
- As an exegetical model for reading Pauline texts that link justification, imputation, and union (Romans/Galatians).
