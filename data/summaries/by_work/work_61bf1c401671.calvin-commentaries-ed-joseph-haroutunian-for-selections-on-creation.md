### TITLE
**Calvin: Commentaries** (ed. Joseph Haroutunian, selections on creation) - John Calvin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation exegesis from Geneva; humanist philology in service of church reform.
 - Haroutunian provides a 20th-century English selection, curating key passages, including Genesis and creation texts, for doctrinal and pastoral use.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How the triune God reveals himself in Scripture to form piety: God the Creator and Redeemer governs all by providence, is truly known by the Spirit through the Word, and is worshiped rightly in the church.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Method:** Grammatical-historical exegesis, Scripture interprets Scripture, restraint in speculation, pastoral clarity.
 - **Revelation:** God accommodates himself to human capacity; the Spirit attests the Word internally.
 - **Creation and providence:** Ex nihilo creation, ordered goodness, meticulous providence, human stewardship under the imago Dei.
 - **Sin and grace:** Total corruption post-Fall; Christ as the scope of Scripture; duplex gratia - justification and sanctification inseparably given in union with Christ.
 - **Church and sacraments:** Marks of the church, Word and sacraments as means of grace; spiritual presence of Christ in the Supper.
 - **Eschatology:** Hope of resurrection and renewal of creation grounds patient faith and vocation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively engages Augustine, Chrysostom, and the better humanists; critically corrects medieval scholastic excess and allegorizing.
 - Contends with Roman Catholic sacramentalism, Anabaptist biblicism, antitrinitarianism, and speculative cosmologies overshadowing Moses.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture,** **Trinity,** **creation and providence,** **anthropology and sin,** **Christology and atonement,** **Spirit and faith,** **covenant and church,** **sacraments,** **last things.**
- **Center of gravity**
 - The God who creates and governs all magnifies his glory by uniting sinners to Christ through the Spirit, as attested in the plain sense of Scripture for the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Accommodation:** God lisping to us in Scripture; Moses speaks for edification, not to satisfy curiosity.
 - **Providence without fatalism:** Comprehensive divine rule that does not negate secondary causes or responsibility.
 - **Christ the scope of Scripture:** Old and New Testaments exhibit covenantal unity tending toward Christ.
 - **Pastoral restraint:** Shuns speculative cosmology and allegory; prizes clarity and brevity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against allegorical overreach: insists on literal-grammatical sense with typology tethered to the text.
 - Against Rome: rejects transubstantiation and sacerdotalism; asserts spiritual presence and Word-centered worship.
 - Against radical reformers: defends civil order, infant baptism, and ecclesial discipline.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Duplex cognitio Dei** (Creator and Redeemer) and **duplex gratia** (justification and sanctification).
 - **Testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum** to ground Scripture's authority.
 - Mature deployment of **foedus** language to articulate unity of redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canon-forming for Reformed exegesis; shapes Reformed orthodoxy, confessions, and later biblical theology.
 - Serves ecumenical exegesis for its rigor and theological sobriety; frequently mined in modern dogmatics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of how exegesis feeds doctrine and piety; a stable reference for controversial loci across the system.
