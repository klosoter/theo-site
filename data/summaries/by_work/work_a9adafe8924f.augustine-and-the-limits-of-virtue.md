### TITLE
**Augustine and the Limits of Virtue** - James Wetzel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary scholarly monograph engaging Patristic studies and moral theology; assumes familiarity with Augustine's major works (Confessions, City of God, On Grace and Free Will, De Trinitate) and with classical virtue ethics (Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Cicero). Addresses late antique theological debates (Pelagianism, Manichaeism) and their ethical implications.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Augustine reconfigures classical virtue by delimiting its autonomous moral and soteriological power: virtues are necessary but not sufficient for salvation; they require grace and the right ordering of loves. Wetzel argues Augustine both critiques pagan virtue ethics and furnishes a distinctive, theology-driven account of moral agency and virtue's limits.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis of classical virtue: Wetzel reconstructs the Greco-Roman ideal of self-sufficient virtue as rooted in practical reason and habituation.
 - Augustine's critique: the will is disordered by sin; reason and habituated virtue cannot secure final end (beatitude) without grace.
 - Positive redefinition: virtues are reinterpreted as **ordered loves** (ordo amoris) centered on God; charity (caritas) subsumes and heals other virtues.
 - Theological consequences: doctrines of original sin, grace, merit, and forgiveness reshape moral accountability and moral development.
 - Pastoral and political implications: limits on moral moralism, critique of civic virtue as sufficient, emphasis on interior reorientation and divine agency.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Cicero, Plotinus, Ambrose; Pelagius and Pelagian critics; primary Augustine texts (Confessions, City of God, De Moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae?, De Trinitate, On Grace and Free Will, sermons).
- **Doctrines treated:** anthropology (will and desire), sin (original and particular), grace and justification, charity (caritas), merit, providence, moral psychology, beatitude, and ecclesial/communal dimensions of virtue.
- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** Augustine limits the autonomy of virtue by insisting that true moral order is an oriented, grace-enabled love of God; virtues are reformed and sustained, not replaced, by divine gift.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Centers **love (caritas)** as the determinative moral category; virtues gain moral identity only when subordinated to charity.
 - Focus on the **limits** (epistemic, moral, soteriological) of virtue rather than a simple replacement of classical ethics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges Stoic/Aristotelian claims of virtue as self-sufficient for happiness.
 - Polemically opposes Pelagian confidence in unaided human virtue and merit.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of **ordered loves (ordo amoris)** and **disordered will** as analytical tools connecting moral psychology with soteriology.
 - Treats virtue as dynamic and derivative: a habit transformed, not merely a preserved pagan legacy.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Reinforced Augustinian frameworks for grace and sin in medieval and Reformation traditions; influential in debates over merit and sanctification.
 - Contemporary theologians and ethicists draw on Wetzel to nuance Augustine's place in virtue-ethics debates (showing Augustine is not a simple opponent of virtue ethics but a critical reviser).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies Augustine's moral theology for ethicists, historians, and pastoral theologians.
 - Provides a compact corrective to readings that either secularize Augustine into a proto-virtue ethic or reduce him to deterministic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Virtue (virtus):** classical habituated excellence; for Augustine, reinterpreted and dependent on right-ordered love and grace.
- **Caritas (charity):** central Christian virtue; orders other virtues and grounds moral identity.
- **Cupiditas (disordered desire):** counterparts to caritas; explains moral failure as misordered loves.
- **Ordo amoris (ordered loves):** formative Augustinian idiom describing moral orientation toward God.
- **Will / voluntas / appetitus:** moral agency locus; weakened and disordered by sin; requires divine aid.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale):** explains universal impairment of virtue's sufficiency.
- **Grace (gratia):** enabling divine gift that heals will and renders virtues efficacious for beatitude.
- **Merit (meritum):** reinterpreted within a framework where merit presupposes prevenient and sustaining grace.
- **Privatio boni (privation of good):** metaphysical account of evil that informs Augustine's moral diagnosis.
- **Beatitude / felicitas:** final end; not attainable by unaided virtue.
- **Habit (habitus):** moral formation; Augustine maintains habituation but insists on its transformation by charity.
- **Moral psychology:** Augustine's integration of memory, time, interiority into ethical analysis.
- **Pelagian controversy:** polemical context shaping Augustine's limits on virtue.
- **Ecclesial dimension:** virtues as cultivated within church life under sacraments/grace.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Augustinian virtue reoriented by charity.
 - As a **polemic model** against secular/self-sufficient virtue ethics and Pelagianism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Augustine's texts on will, sin, and grace, informing contemporary ethics and pastoral theology.
