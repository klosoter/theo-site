### TITLE
The Marrow of Modern Divinity - (authorship: Edward Fisher; often treated historically in dialogue with Reformed scholasticism such as Francis Turretin for comparative context). 
Primary locus: pastoral-theological defense of the free offer of the Gospel, deployed in the later Scottish "Marrow Controversy" (early 18th c.) and contrasted with prevailing covenantal emphases.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - First published mid-17th century (Edward Fisher). Regained prominence in early 18th‑century Scotland when reprinted and defended by Thomas Boston and the "Marrow Men" against the Church of Scotland establishment (Marrow Controversy, c. 1718-1726).
 - Movemental milieu: pastoral Puritan/evangelical concern about legalism, assurance, and the practical preaching of grace; later opposed by moderate covenantal clergy worried about antinomian tendencies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Gospel must be preached as *free, full, and unconditional grace in Christ*, distinct from the law and not conditioned by human works; assurance and justification rest solely on Christ's righteousness imputed to sinners.
 - The immediate problem addressed: a creeping neonomian/legalistic strain in pastoral practice that blurred law and gospel and thereby undermined assurance and the free offer.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presented dialogically and pastorally: sets up questions and objections from seekers and legalists, answered by an advocate of free grace.
 - Major moves:
 - Clarify Gospel vs law: law demands and accuses; gospel promises and forgives.
 - Assert justification by faith alone on the ground of Christ's active/passive obedience and imputation.
 - Maintain the free offer: Christ's righteousness is presented to sinners without preliminary moral conditions.
 - Address assurance: rooted in Christ's work, not in fluctuating evidences of sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Edward Fisher (author); secondary historical actors: Thomas Boston, James Hadow, Ebenezer Erskine, the Marrow Men.
 - Interlocutors in later controversy: Church of Scotland moderators who alleged antinomianism and pastoral irresponsibility.
 - Comparative interlocutor for scholarly contrast: Francis Turretin - represents Reformed scholastic rigor and covenantal nuance.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant(s) (Covenant of Grace emphatically), justification, imputation, law vs gospel distinction, assurance, sanctification and obedience (as fruit, not ground), preaching and the free offer.
- **Closing line**
 - The Marrow centers the pastoral proclamation of salvation as a gratis, Christ‑grounded gift - preserving the assurance and liberty of believers by sharply separating the gospel from the demands of the law.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Pastoral and experiential insistence on assurance as grounded exclusively in Christ; vivid law/gospel polarity; uncompromising language about the free offer to all sinners.
 - Uses dialogue to expose pastoral confusion and to model preaching that comforts and summons without conditionalizing justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects perceived neonomianism (the tendency to recast the covenant as requiring new human conditions) by restating unconditional offer and imputed righteousness.
 - Contrasts with stricter high‑calvinist or scholastic emphases by prioritizing pastoral clarity and the universal offer language; contrasted with Turretin's method: Turretin gives systematic precision and caveats (e.g., guarding against antinomian misunderstandings) that the Marrow treats more pastorally.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized plain‑spoken language about the "free offer" and its pastoral consequences; coined no new metaphysical categories but reframed older covenantal terms toward assurance-centered preaching.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate: sparked the Marrow Controversy; critics feared antinomianism, defenders (Boston et al.) argued for its fidelity to Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Long-term: shaped Scottish evangelical piety, influenced later evangelical and revival currents, and remains a touchstone in debates over law/gospel and the free offer.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact pastoral theology of grace - indispensable in studying pastoral proclamation, assurance, and the practical outworking of Covenant of Grace language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Central framework: salvation mediated by Christ's work and offered to sinners; contrasted with Covenant of Works.
 - Marrow emphasis: administrations of the Covenant of Grace must be preached as unconditional promises in Christ.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Background covenant that highlights law's demands; used to sharpen law/gospel distinction.
- **Free Offer (of the Gospel)**
 - The proposition that Christ's salvific benefits are sincerely offered to all who hear; no preliminary human righteousness required.
- **Law-Gospel distinction**
 - Law: commands and condemns; Gospel: promise and forgiveness. Marrow stresses a sharp practical separation to secure assurance.
- **Justification by Faith Alone**
 - Forensic declaration based solely on Christ's imputed righteousness; the Marrow defends this against works‑based approaches.
- **Imputation (of Christ's righteousness)**
 - The ground of justification; non‑negotiable in the Marrow's scheme.
- **Assurance**
 - Psychological and spiritual certainty rooted in Christ's work and gospel promise, not in subjective evidence of sanctification.
- **Antinomianism**
 - The charge leveled by critics - Marrow defenders deny antinomianism, insist obedience follows justification as fruit, not as ground.
- **Neonomianism**
 - The error Marrow critiques: recasting the covenant so human obedience functions as a new ground or condition for salvation.
- **Marrow Men**
 - Later proponents (e.g., Thomas Boston) who defended the work and influenced Scottish evangelical practice.
- **Pastoral preaching / experiential theology**
 - The Marrow as a model for comfort‑oriented, assurance‑writ large preaching rather than abstract systematics.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **polemic** source against neonomian or legalistic tendencies in covenant preaching.
 - As a **pastoral‑theological model** for preaching assurance and articulating the free offer within Covenant of Grace frameworks.
 - As a **historical pivot** in studies of Scottish evangelicalism and the law/gospel controversies; used alongside scholastic sources (e.g., Turretin) for comparative theological method and balance.
