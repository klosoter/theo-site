### TITLE
**Living at the Crossroads** (with Michael Goheen) - Craig Bartholomew

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Situated within late 20th / early 21st century Reformed-evangelical conversation about worldview, vocation, and mission.
 - Responds to perceived bifurcations between "sacred" and "secular," and between systematic theology and everyday Christian practice.
 - Part of a broader resurgence of redemptive-historical and missional approaches to biblical theology and public engagement.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christians are called to live at a theological and practical "crossroads": where the biblical narrative (creation, fall, redemption, consummation) meets concrete cultural life. True Christian vocation reframes work, culture, and public life as arenas of faithful witness under Christ's sovereign rule.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Sketches the biblical meta-narrative as the interpretive frame for life and culture.
 - Reinterprets the cultural mandate and dominion language in light of Christ's kingship and the missio Dei:
 - Dominion as responsible stewardship and service, not triumphalistic control.
 - Vocation is normative for all believers: everyday callings are theological, ecclesial and missional.
 - Offers pastoral-practical implications: how churches and Christians live, work, and witness in plural societies.
 - Emphasizes ecclesial formation, practices, and narrative identity as preconditions for credible public engagement.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with Kuyperian themes (sphere sovereignty, cultural engagement), Newbigin's public theology, redemptive-historical interpreters, and contemporary evangelical discussions on vocation and worldview.
 - Draws on biblical-theological method, reformed doctrinal resources, and contemporary mission thought.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and the imago Dei, sin/fall, Christology (Lordship of Christ), covenantal structure, eschatology (consummation), providence, mission (missio Dei), church and sacraments, common grace; also issues in public theology and ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: Christians are vocationally formed by Scripture to live under Christ's reign at the intersection of gospel and culture, exercising dignified stewardship rather than domination as an authentic public witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The central metaphor of the "crossroads": life as ongoing navigation between biblical narrative and cultural complexity.
 - Strong vocational hermeneutic: calling is pervasive (family, work, polity, art), not merely professional or ecclesial.
 - Recasts dominion/cultural mandate as stewardship within Christ's redemptive story.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques both privatizing pietism (faith confined to personal piety) and aggressive dominionism (political/creedal takeover).
 - Nuances Kuyperian impulses: affirms cultural engagement and sphere-distinction but insists on missional dependence on church-formed identity and Christocentric orientation.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Integration of redemptive-historical narrative with everyday vocation as hermeneutical default.
 - Terminological pivot from "control/domination" to "careful stewardship and creative cultural service."

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in Reformed-evangelical seminaries and congregational training as an accessible bridge between biblical theology and public life.
 - Influenced curricula on vocation, worldview, and mission; cited in discussions seeking a middle path between privatism and theocratic aspirations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a pedagogically clear, theologically informed framework for thinking about Christian life in plural societies.
 - Durable resource for pastors, laity, and scholars seeking to integrate doctrine and practice without reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Crossroads** - central metaphor: intersection where biblical story meets cultural reality; site of vocational decision-making.
- **Vocation** - comprehensive calling of believers into daily work and public life as avenues of ministry and witness.
 - Not merely occupational; includes familial, civic, artistic, and economic callings.
- **Cultural mandate** - Genesis mandate re-read through Christ: cultural creativity and ordering as stewardship under God, not autonomous human mastery.
- **Dominion** - recast as responsible stewardship and service in the world, constrained and oriented by Christ's kingship and redemptive purposes.
- **Imago Dei** - foundation for human dignity, vocation, and creativity; grounds ethical claims in public engagement.
- **Missio Dei** - God-centered sending that shapes Christian vocation; church participates in God's restorative mission to the world.
- **Kingdom of God** - lens for interpreting cultural engagement: present-inaugurated and eschatologically consummated, informing ethical and political posture.
- **Common grace** - explains cultural goods and creativity outside the church; supports engagement without syncretism.
- **Worldview / narrative hermeneutic** - use of Bible's metanarrative as organizing matrix for life, resisting compartmentalization.
- **Two kingdoms / sphere sovereignty** - engaged critically: affirms distinct spheres but insists on gospel-shaping of all spheres via church-formed witness.
- **Public theology** - applied aim: equip Christians to think theologically about policy, arts, business, education.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - shapes method: every locus of life interpreted in light of God's unfolding covenantal action.
- **Stewardship** - practical ethic for exercising dominion; emphasizes care, cultivation, hospitality.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed accounts of vocation and cultural mandate (practical theology and discipleship).
- As a **corrective polemic** against privatizing pietism and triumphalist dominionism.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Genesis and Gospel together to derive public ethical implications.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula linking biblical-theological formation to lay missional engagement.
