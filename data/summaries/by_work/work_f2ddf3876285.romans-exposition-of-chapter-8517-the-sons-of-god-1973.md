### TITLE
Romans: Exposition of Chapter 8:5-17, The Sons of God (1973) - Martyn Lloyd‑Jones

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Sermonic-expository treatment drawn from Lloyd‑Jones' long-running Westminster Chapel ministry and later publication series on Romans (mid‑20th century evangelical exegesis). Published 1973 amid renewed interest in Pauline theology in evangelical circles and the rise of charismatic movements.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Paul's teaching in Romans 8:5-17 describes the defining mark of God's children: living by the Spirit rather than by the flesh. Theologically this passage locates sanctification, assurance, and adoption in the Spirit's present, internal work - producing filial life and ethical transformation.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):**
 - Contrast of two mindsets: **mind set on the flesh** vs **mind set on the Spirit** (vv. 5-8).
 - The Spirit as the decisive power of life: **law of the Spirit of life** vs **law of sin and death** (vv. 9-11).
 - Adoption and assurance: the Spirit's witness and the filial cry **"Abba, Father"** as marks of sonship (vv. 12-17).
 - Practical implications: present sanctification (mortification and vivification), perseverance in suffering, ethical fruit as evidence of life in the Spirit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Principal interlocutor: Paul's epistolary theology (Romans).
 - Lloyd‑Jones dialogues implicitly with: Augustine, Calvin, Puritan writers (for experiential emphasis), and contemporary streams - liberalism (overintellectualized faith) and charismatic excess (experience divorced from doctrine).
- **Doctrines treated:**
 - Pneumatology (role and work of the Holy Spirit), soteriology (justification and sanctification relation), adoption (filial sonship), anthropology (flesh vs spirit), assurance of salvation, union with Christ, eschatological hope in inheritance.
- **Closing line capturing theological center:** 
 - The life of the sons of God is defined not by external profession or gifted experience but by the Spirit's sovereign, sanctifying presence which effects filial relation, ethical transformation, and confident hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **present objective reality** of Spirit-wrought sonship (not merely future or forensic) coupled with equally strong attention to **progressive holiness** as its transpiring evidence.
 - Lively pastorally charged distinction between mortification (putting sin to death) and vivification (living by the Spirit) as paired processes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects antinomian tendencies that divorce justification from practical holiness.
 - Critiques sentimental or purely experiential views (including some charismatic assertions) that treat ecstatic gifts as the primary sign of the Spirit's presence; affirms doctrinal grounding and biblical markers (fruit and filial assurance).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No novel technical terms, but a repeated rhetorical framing: the Spirit as the operative "law" (law of the Spirit of life) that counteracts the "law" of sin - making Pauline metaphor vivid and pastorally actionable.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in Reformed‑evangelical preaching and pastoral theology for its blending of robust doctrine and pastoral application; used widely in homiletics and discipleship curricula.
 - Served as a corrective resource in debates over charismatic experience and assurance in late 20th‑century evangelicalism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of expository preaching on Pauline pneumatology; lucid treatment of how Spirit, sanctification, and assurance interrelate - useful for pastors, pastoral counselors, and seminarians.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit / Holy Spirit:** active agent of regeneration, sanctification, and witness of adoption; not reducible to phenomena or gifts.
- **Flesh:** Pauline term for the sinful principle opposed to the Spirit; explains moral inability and propensity to sin.
- **Mind set on the Spirit / on the flesh:** existential orientations that determine ethical outcome and destiny.
- **Law of the Spirit of life:** dynamic principle by which the Spirit enlivens believers, opposing the law (power) of sin.
- **Law of sin and death:** systemic power that enslaves the unregenerate and produces death.
- **Mortification:** the believer's cooperative putting to death of sin (ethical discipline).
- **Vivification (life in the Spirit):** the Spirit's enabling of holy living; positive counterpart to mortification.
- **Adoption / sons of God:** forensic and relational status effected by the Spirit, yielding filial access and inheritance.
- **"Abba, Father":** Paul's proof-text for the Spirit's internal witness and intimacy with God; grounds assurance.
- **Assurance / witness of the Spirit:** subjective assurance rooted in objective Spirit-wrought realities and fruit.
- **Union with Christ:** the ontological basis for Spirit-led life, suffering participation, and inheritance.
- **Inheritance / heirs with Christ:** eschatological hope and present confidence of future consummation.
- **Suffering and present trials:** interpreted as markers that confirm sonship and participation in Christ's sufferings toward glory.
- **Spiritual gifts and sanctification:** Lloyd‑Jones' emphasis: gifts may accompany the Spirit but **sanctification and filial fruit** are the proper evidences of true sonship; charismatic phenomena must be tested by holiness and doctrinal fidelity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Evangelical/Reformed pneumatology and filial sonship.
 - As a **polemic resource** against antinomianism and ungrounded charismatic claims.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline preaching: close textual exposition married to pastoral application.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking justification, sanctification, and assurance in practical pastoral theology.
