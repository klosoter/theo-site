### TITLE
Gospel and Spirit: Issues in New Testament Hermeneutics - Gordon D. Fee

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical scholarship amid renewed interest in Pentecostal/charismatic renewal and its relation to mainstream New Testament studies.
 - Moves against both pietistic anti-intellectualism and sterile historicism: argues for exegetical rigor shaped by pneumatological conviction.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Proper New Testament interpretation must be governed by the New Testament's own pneumatology: the Spirit is not merely a doctrinal appendix but the key hermeneutical principle for reading gospel texts.
 - This bears directly on contested issues such as the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** and the continuation of charismatic gifts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates that exegetical method and doctrinal commitments are inseparable when texts themselves claim Spirit-authority.
 - Major moves:
 - Systematic demonstration that New Testament authors interpret Jesus and the gospel in light of the Spirit.
 - Exegetical analyses (Pauline and Johannine loci) showing how Spirit-language functions theologically and ecclesiologically.
 - Practical hermeneutical proposal: let the NT's pneumatology constrain contemporary theological conclusions about baptism, gifts, and experience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages mainstream NT scholars and hermeneuticians (e.g., J. D. G. Dunn, C. K. Barrett, other contemporary exegetes).
 - Dialogues with Pentecostal/charismatic interpreters and with conservative evangelicals who minimize present-day charismatic phenomena.
 - Uses primary NT texts (Pauline corpus, Acts, Johannine letters) as the central data.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (primary), ecclesiology (Spirit as constitutive of the church), soteriology (Spirit as mark of incorporation), revelational authority (Spirit and Scripture), gifts/charisms, baptism (esp. Spirit-baptism).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The New Testament's own theology makes the Spirit the indispensable hermeneutical key: to read the gospel aright is to read it pneumatologically, with immediate implications for how we understand **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**, spiritual gifts, and corporate identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a hermeneutic in which Scripture's pneumatology shapes both exegesis and praxis rather than allowing experience or abstract theology to dictate interpretation.
 - Treats **baptism with the Spirit** as central to Pauline soteriology and ecclesiology, not an optional or peripheral charismatic adjunct.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that separate "doctrine" from "experience" by arguing the NT fuses doctrinal claim and Spirit-wrought life.
 - Contrasts with cessationist hermeneutics that relegated charismatic references to the primitive church or to historical-cultural phenomena.
 - Pushes back on simplistic Pentecostal proof-texting by demanding rigorous historical-grammatical exegesis informed by pneumatology.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames the Spirit explicitly as a hermeneutical category - not only an ontological actor - so that "reading in the Spirit" has methodological weight.
 - Reclaims the distinction between Spirit-baptism (incorporation) and Spirit-filling (empowerment) while arguing both are normative themes in NT theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in debates between charismatic and non-charismatic evangelicals; foundational for later evangelical defenses of continuationism.
 - Influenced how New Testament scholars treat pneumatology as central, not marginal, to theological interpretation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for integrating careful exegesis with theological conviction; valuable for teaching Pauline pneumatology and for pastors grappling with Spirit-claims in congregational life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneumatology**
 - The doctrine of the Spirit treated as the primary lens for NT interpretation.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Read as the Pauline means of incorporation into Christ/ the body (1 Cor 12; Gal 3:27-29); central to identity, not merely an adjunct experience.
- **Filling (Spirit-filling)**
 - Distinguished from baptism: recurring empowerment for witness and ministry (Eph 5:18; Acts examples).
- **Charismatic gifts / charisms**
 - Treated as normative phenomena in the NT church; argued to require careful exegesis rather than dismissal or uncritical acceptance.
- **Continuationism**
 - Fee's overall posture supports ongoing charisms; the work supplies hermeneutical foundations rather than only polemical assertions.
- **Historical-grammatical exegesis**
 - Maintained as necessary but to be nuanced by pneumatological awareness; Scripture's own theology constrains method.
- **Experiential-exegetical correlation**
 - Principle that ecclesial experience must be tested by, and interpreted through, NT exegesis informed by Spirit-language.
- **Incorporation into Christ**
 - Theological outcome of Spirit-baptism: positional and communal belonging to the body of Christ.
- **Hermeneutical priority**
 - The claim that the NT's pneumatology takes methodological precedence in interpretation decisions.
- **Glossolalia / tongues**
 - Treated as one kind of charismatic phenomenon noted in NT evidence; Fee urges careful contextual appraisal, not instantaneous dogma.
- **Ecclesiology**
 - Church defined by Spirit; Spirit-wrought unity and diversity of gifts are central.
- **Authority of Scripture and Spirit**
 - Interplay: Scripture interprets Spirit experiences; Spirit illumines rightful reading of Scripture.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for pneumatologically-informed hermeneutics in NT studies.
- As a **polemic** against both reductionist cessationism and uncritical proof-texting by some charismatic interpreters.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts where Spirit language governs soteriology and ecclesiology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in evangelical debates over the normative place of Spirit-baptism and charismatic gifts.
