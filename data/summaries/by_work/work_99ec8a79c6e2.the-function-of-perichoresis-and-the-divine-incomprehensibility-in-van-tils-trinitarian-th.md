### TITLE
The Function of Perichoresis and the Divine Incomprehensibility in Van Til's Trinitarian Theology (Lane Tipton, WTJ 2012)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in Westminster Theological Journal (2012). Situated within contemporary Reformed/Presuppositionalist debates about Cornelius Van Til's Trinitarian commitments and the interface of epistemology and doctrine. Engages 20th-21st century Reformed apologetics and recent Trinitarian retrievals.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Tipton examines how Van Til deploys the concepts of **perichoresis** and **divine incomprehensibility** to undergird his Trinitarian epistemology, and whether that deployment coheres with orthodox Trinitarian grammar (especially critiques that Van Til's language collapses personal distinctions into a "one-person" model).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of Van Til's basic commitments: revelation-centered epistemology, the priority of the Triune God as epistemic presupposition, and a robust doctrine of divine transcendence/incomprehensibility.
 - Analysis of Van Til's use of **perichoresis**: treated functionally - as the relational matrix that both distinguishes and unites the divine Persons, enabling a non-autonomous creaturely participation in knowledge of God.
 - Treatment of **divine incomprehensibility** in Van Til: read as epistemic humility that resists creaturely claims to autonomous intelligibility rather than as a denial of real, analogical knowledge of God.
 - Synthetic move: Tipton argues Van Til's framing aims to preserve both the economy of revelation and immanent Trinitarian relations, but creates tension that requires careful theological tempering to avoid modalist or overly apophatic readings.
 - Conclusion: Van Til's resources are valuable but need clarifying theological stipulations to fully safeguard orthodox Trinitarian distinctions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Cornelius Van Til (primary); implicit dialogue with critics who accuse Van Til of "one-person" Trinitarian language; appeals to classical Trinitarian sources (Cappadocians, Augustine) and Reformed confessional commitments to interpret Van Til.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (immanent vs economic), revelation, epistemology (presuppositionalism), divine incomprehensibility, relation of ontology to language about God.
- **Closing line:** Tipton locates the theological gravity of Van Til in a **relationally framed incomprehensibility** - perichoretic functionally preserves Trinitarian knowledge while insisting upon creaturely dependence, but it demands careful exegesis to avoid collapsing personal distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Frames **perichoresis** as an epistemic and functional category (not merely metaphysical ornament) in Van Til's theology.
 - Reads **divine incomprehensibility** primarily as a corrective to creaturely pretensions to autonomous intelligibility.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters readings that portray Van Til as a modalist or as collapsing the Persons into a single personal center by clarifying how Van Til's relational language is intended to secure both unity and distinction.
 - Pushes back against overly apophatic appropriations that would render revelation ineffective for propositional knowledge.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses the phrase **"functional perichoresis"** to describe the way intra-Trinitarian mutual indwelling operates as an epistemic facilitator in Van Til's thought.
 - Re-articulates **incomprehensibility** as a doctrine with positive epistemic consequences (guarding analogical knowledge) rather than only negative limits.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valuable for Van Tillians seeking to defend Trinitarian orthodoxy against modalist critiques.
 - Received as a careful theological corrective by some Reformed theologians and as a helpful bridge between apologetics and systematic Trinitarian reflection.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies terminological confusions in the Van Til literature.
 - Offers a concise model for integrating Trinitarian doctrine with epistemology in Reformed theology courses and seminars.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Perichoresis:** Mutual indwelling of the divine Persons; Tipton emphasizes its **functional** role in Van Til - enabling an intra-Trinitarian relational ground for revelation and creaturely knowledge.
- **Divine incomprehensibility:** God's otherness and transcendence; interpreted as an epistemic limit that preserves dependence on revelation rather than total unknowability.
- **One-person language (Van Til critique):** The controversy over whether Van Til's language effectively reduces the Trinity to one person; Tipton argues the problem is often terminological and correctable.
- **Presuppositionalism:** Van Til's apologetic method; treated as the epistemic outworking of Trinitarian theological commitments.
- **Immanent vs economic Trinity:** Distinction used to evaluate whether Van Til's perichoresis language properly respects both intra-Trinitarian life and God's self-revelation.
- **Analogical knowledge of God:** Knowledge that is true and proportionate to creaturely capacity; Tipton claims Van Til's incomprehensibility secures analogical rather than equivocal or purely negative knowledge.
- **Relational ontology:** The view that divine being is constituted by relations; Tipton reads Van Til as functionally relational without collapsing personhood.
- **Apophaticism (theological negativeology):** Emphasized in relation to incomprehensibility; Tipton warns against letting apophatic stress nullify positive revealed knowledge.
- **Epistemic humility:** A theological virtue emerging from incomprehensibility that preserves dependence on revelation and prevents syncretistic appropriation of autonomous reason.
- **Revelational priority:** The principle that revelation frames all true knowledge of God; central to Tipton's reading of Van Til.
- **Functional perichoresis (term):** Tipton's shorthand for perichoresis as an operational principle in apologetic and epistemic contexts.
- **Intra-Trinitarian relations:** Distinctions of origin and relation among Persons; must be preserved against any one-personal collapse.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and clarification source** for Van Til's Trinitarian vocabulary (perichoresis, incomprehensibility).
- As a **polemic/defense** against charges of modalism in Van Til studies.
- As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating how doctrinal Trinitarian commitments inform apologetic method.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine of God (Trinity, incomprehensibility) to epistemology (presuppositionalism, analogical knowing).
