### TITLE
Aquinas on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit (with reference to John of St. Thomas)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 13th century scholasticism; Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, Secunda Secundae) synthesizes Scripture, Patristic tradition, and Aristotelian metaphysics. John of St. Thomas (17th c. Thomist) provides systematic commentary and metaphysical clarification in the post-Tridentine Thomistic revival.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Gifts of the Holy Spirit are infused, supernatural habitus distinct from infused virtues; they perfect the intellect and will by rendering the soul *docile* to the Spirit so as to act promptly and rightly in the pursuit of sanctification and final end.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and number: Gifts named from Isaiah (seven traditional gifts) and treated as habitual dispositions.
 - Ontological status: Gifts as infused habits (habitus) distinct from virtues (virtus) and from acquired habits; metaphysical grounding in Aristotelian act/potency language.
 - Psychological economy: Gifts illumine and incline the intellectual and volitional faculties to immediate consonance with the Spirit (promptitude, suppleness).
 - Relation to other graces: Gifts presuppose sanctifying grace and perfect the virtues; they are especially linked to Confirmation and the interior life.
 - Moral and ecclesial consequences: Gifts operate toward right judgment, piety, fear of God, and perseverance in holiness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Scripture (Isaiah 11:2), Augustine, Gregory the Great, Peter Lombard, Aristotle; interlocutors include medieval scholastics (Albert, Lombard) and later critics (Reformation theologians).
 - John of St. Thomas functions as technical exegete and metaphysical clarifier within later Thomism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (sanctifying vs. actual), virtues (infused and acquired), Trinity (operation of the Spirit), Christology (Spirit sent by the Son), sacramental theology (Confirmation), anthropology (powers of soul), eschatology (perfection for final end).
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas locates the gifts as divinely infused dispositions that make the soul immediately responsive to the Spirit, thereby uniting moral formation, sacramental economy, and metaphysical structure into a coherent account of sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats gifts as a specific metaphysical category: habitual but distinct from moral virtues; primarily ordered to *promptitude* and *docility* rather than merely to moral strength.
 - Emphasizes the Spirit's operative role in perfecting both intellect and will so that human action aligns with divine counsel without delay.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against purely Pelagian or semi-Pelagian tendencies: gifts are gratuitous, not merely cultured human habits.
 - Against reductions that collapse gifts into virtues or into charismatic phenomena: Aquinas preserves a middle path-objective, habitual dispositions enabling supernatural responsiveness.
 - Contrasts with some later Protestant readings that emphasize external gifts or charismatic manifestations divorced from habitual sanctifying orientation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinction between *infused virtue* and *gift* as separate species of habitus; focus on *docilitas Spiritus* (docility to the Spirit) as the operative character of the gifts.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central in Catholic sacramental and moral theology, catechesis on Confirmation, and neo-Thomistic revival; John of St. Thomas deepened precision in metaphysical grounding.
 - Limited uptake in Reformed theology, where scholastic metaphysics and the habitus-concept were generally rejected; Reformed interest often reframed gifts in moral or charismatic language rather than scholastic categories.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable conceptual bridge between Scripture/Patristics and a systematic metaphysical account; indispensable for teaching on Confirmation, sanctification, and the spirituality of docility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gifts of the Holy Spirit**
 - The seven dispositions (traditional list from Isaiah) that make the soul receptive to the Spirit.
- **Infused habitus (habitus)**
 - A supernatural disposition given by God, contrasted with acquired habits.
- **Infused virtues**
 - Morally disposing graces (e.g., faith, hope, charity) which are perfected by the gifts.
- **Docility (docilitas)**
 - The characteristic responsiveness of the soul under the Spirit; central to gifts' function.
- **Promptitude**
 - Readiness to act rightly without delay; an operative effect of the gifts.
- **Seven gifts (traditional list)**
 - Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, Fear of the Lord (each linked to intellect/will in Aquinas).
- **Sanctifying grace**
 - The habit by which the soul is made holy; presupposed by and cooperating with the gifts.
- **Actual grace**
 - Momentary divine assistance; distinguished from the habitual gifts which dispose for action.
- **Confirmation (sacrament)**
 - Principal sacramental locus in which the gifts are signified and strengthened in Catholic theology.
- **Ordo (order)**
 - Teleological ordering of gifts to the final end and to the perfection of virtues.
- **Charity**
 - The primary infused virtue; gifts always subordinate to and ordered by charity.
- **Human faculties (intellect and will)**
 - Principal recipients of the gifts; gifts render these faculties more susceptible to the Spirit.
- **Receptivity vs. productivity**
 - Gifts as receptive dispositions (making one open to the Spirit) not simply productive abilities or talents.
- **John of St. Thomas**
 - Thomist commentator who systematizes metaphysical foundations of the gifts in post-Tridentine scholarship.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: standard Catholic formulation of what the gifts are and how they relate to virtues.
 - Exegetical and doctrinal model: reading Isaiah and Patristic tradition through scholastic metaphysics to explain sanctification and Confirmation.
 - Polemic resource: defense against reductionist or charismatic readings that divorce gifts from habitual sanctifying structure.
