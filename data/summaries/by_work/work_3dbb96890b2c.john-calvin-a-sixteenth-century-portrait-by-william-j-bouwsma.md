### TITLE
**John Calvin: A Sixteenth-Century Portrait (William J. Bouwsma)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation Europe; Calvin in Geneva as pastor, reformer, exile network node. Bouwsma writes a contextual, biographical study emphasizing social, institutional, and intellectual milieus rather than purely doctrinal systematics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin is best understood as a pastor-scholar shaped by humanist method, pastoral necessities, and polemical engagement; his theology emerges from pastoral practice and Scripture-centered exegesis rather than from abstract scholastic system-building.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biography organized around key phases: early humanist training, Strasbourg exile, Geneva reform and institutional consolidation, later controversies and correspondence.
 - Major moves:
 - Show how humanist training shaped Calvin's exegetical and rhetorical methods.
 - Demonstrate how pastoral needs (discipline, catechesis, liturgy) directed theological emphases (covenant, union with Christ, assurance).
 - Trace Calvin's bibliological stances (Scripture's authority, self-attestation) as responses to Catholic and Protestant rivals.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Luther and Lutheranism (contrast on sacrament/authority), Erasmus (humanist method), Bucer and Farel (colleagues), Sadoleto and Roman Catholic critics, and Beza (successor). Sources: Institutes, sermons, correspondence, Geneva records.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Bibliology (Scripture as authoritative, Spirit-attested), Inspiration and inerrancy (Reformed construal), Covenant theology (covenant of grace), Union with Christ and Adoption, Predestination and assurance, Good works and merit (as fruits, not meritorious causes), Nature and task of theology (pastoral, practical, scientific-principia tensions).
- **Closing line**
 - Bouwsma portrays Calvin as a Scripture-rooted pastor-theologian whose singular blend of humanist exegesis, pastoral governance, and doctrinal rigor reshaped Reformed bibliology and soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Calvin as pastoral organizer: theology emerges from liturgy, catechesis, and discipline as much as from disputation.
 - Bibliological realism: Scripture's authority rests on its intrinsic witness and the Spirit's attestation, giving Calvin a strong claim for Scripture's self-authentication.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that cast Calvin as a pure systematic scholastic; Bouwsma emphasizes contingency, context, and pragmatism.
 - Contrasts Calvinian pastoral precision with Lutheran doctrinal polemics and medieval scholastic abstractions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames Calvinian method as a hybrid: rhetorical humanism + emerging Protestant "principia" for theology-as-science, where first principles are Scripture and divine revelation rather than Aristotelian categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Bouwsma's portrait influenced late-20th-century Calvin studies by humanizing Calvin and stressing institutional formation; it is often cited in debates about Calvin's pastoral motives and bibliological doctrines.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to overly systematized portrayals; valuable for teaching Calvin's integration of exegesis, pastoral care, and confessional formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture self-attestation**
 - Calvin's claim that Scripture bears its own authority through the internal witness of the Holy Spirit; a key bibliological move in Bouwsma's account.
- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Central principium: Scripture governs doctrine and church life; polemical tool against Rome and errant Protestant doctrine.
- **Inspiration and inerrancy**
 - Reformed construal in Calvin: Scripture inspired and trustworthy for faith/practice; Bouwsma stresses practical assurance over modern technical inerrancy formulations.
- **Theological method (principia / theology as science)**
 - Theology anchored in scriptural first principles; method blends humanist exegesis with systematic ordering for pastoral ends.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - Structural soteriological frame for Calvin: covenantal relations explain election, faith, assurance, and the role of sacraments.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological motif: believers' solidarity with Christ explains justification, sanctification, adoption, and assurance.
- **Adoption**
 - Treated as covenantal belonging and relational status granted in union with Christ; pastoral assurance theme.
- **Good works and merit**
 - Good works portrayed as necessary fruits and signs of election, not as meritorious causes within the covenant of grace.
- **Existence and knowability of God**
 - Calvin's God is knowable through Scripture and creation; Bouwsma emphasizes Scripture as primary means for true knowledge.
- **Self-attestation and authority of Scripture** (paired term)
 - Highlights how Calvin argued Scripture's authority is not reducible to church decree but is apprehended by Spirit-enabled reading.
- **Predestination**
 - Emphasized as pastoral doctrine that both comforts and disciplines; Bouwsma nuances Calvin's language against caricatures of fatalism.
- **Nature and task of theology**
 - Practical, edifying, oriented to church order and soul care rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Union/Assurance nexus**
 - Calvin links assurance to real union with Christ mediated by the Spirit and received through faith and sacraments.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies Calvinian bibliology and pastoral theology for courses on Reformation theology.
 - Polemic: deployed in debates over Scripture's self-authenticating claim versus ecclesial or magisterial authority.
 - Exegetical model: used as exemplar of humanist-driven, sermonic exegesis informing dogma.
 - Conceptual pivot: reframes Calvin studies from system-builder to pastor-theologian, influencing bibliology and soteriology research.
