### TITLE
**Christliche Sittenlehre (Christian Ethics)** - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestant theology; Romantic and post-Kantian intellectual milieu. Schleiermacher writes amid debates with Enlightenment moral philosophy, Kantian ethics, and orthodox scholastic dogmatics.
 - Aimed to reconstruct Christian moral doctrine on the basis of religious experience and communal formation rather than metaphysical natural law.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian ethics must be grounded in the Christian *religious consciousness* (the feeling of absolute dependence) and formed within the ecclesial community; moral norms flow from Christ as the perfect exemplar of that consciousness rather than from abstract metaphysical propositions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary ethics are either formal (Kantian) or heteronomous (empirical); both fail to account for religion as formative.
 - Foundational principle: the feeling of absolute dependence as the core religious-moral disposition.
 - Moral agency: development through Christian institutions (Word, Sacrament, church life) that cultivate conscience and virtue.
 - Christology as ethical center: Christ embodies the perfected religious consciousness and so functions as normative exemplar and mediator for moral transformation.
 - Practical outworkings: virtues, social duties, and law interpreted through the lens of community formation and religious experience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian ethics, Enlightenment moralists, Romantic thinkers, and contemporary dogmaticians; uses Scripture and selective patristic and confessional motifs but reframes them psychologically/ethical-communally.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: Christology, atonement, sanctification, ecclesiology, conscience, sin.
 - Secondary: doctrine of revelation, limited appeal to metaphysical Trinitarian formulations (Schleiermacher prefers functional language).

- **Closing line**
 - Christian ethics, for Schleiermacher, centers on the church-formed cultivation of the feeling of absolute dependence, with Christ as the definitive exemplar whose person and work model and mediate moral life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes *religious feeling/consciousness* over metaphysical categories; ethics is transformational and pastoral rather than primarily juridical.
 - Strong ecclesiocentric account: moral life is sustained and taught in sacramental and communal practices.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves away from forensic and metaphysical accounts of justification and imputation common in Reformed scholasticism; resists purely Kantian formalism by restoring normative content via religious life.
 - Critiques speculative Christological formulations when they are abstracted from the moral and redemptive significance of Christ.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts Christological categories in psychological-ethical language: the person of Christ as perfected religious consciousness rather than primarily a metaphysical union of natures in scholastic terms.
 - Ethical reading of doctrines like obedience and atonement (emphasis on exemplar and moral influence alongside representative aspects).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply formative for modern liberal Protestant theology and for later theologians (e.g., Ritschlian and social gospel currents).
 - Contentious for confessional and conservative Reformed readers who saw Schleiermacher's reinterpretations of Christology and soteriology as reductionist.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for integrating moral theology with pastoral formation and for challenging schematic metaphysics; a pivotal resource for studying the ethical implications of Christology and communal formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence**
 - Central datum: the religious sentiment that grounds duty and moral orientation; ethical formation aims to cultivate and perfect this feeling.

- **Religious consciousness**
 - The psychological locus of faith and virtue; Christ is its fulfilled exemplar.

- **Exemplar theory of Christ**
 - Christ's moral perfection as the normative pattern for believers; ethical persuasion and formation emphasized.

- **Atonement (moral-influence / regenerative emphasis)**
 - Interprets atonement principally as transformative and reconciling of conscience rather than forensic imputation alone.

- **Active and Passive Obedience**
 - Reinterpreted ethically: Christ's obedience exhibits interior conformity of will (active) and receptive suffering (passive) as elements of perfected religious consciousness that are formative for believers.

- **Impeccability of Christ**
 - Affirms moral sinlessness but understands it as perfection of religious consciousness and freedom from sinful disposition, not as a mere metaphysical exemption.

- **Kenosis**
 - Treated cautiously: kenosis read as Christ's self-limitation in historical embodiment and exemplariness rather than as metaphysical divestment; emphasizes functional humility.

- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine**
 - Not rejected outright but relativized: Chalcedon's categories are reinterpreted in psychological-functional terms; Schleiermacher stresses Christ's unique union insofar as it effects moral and religious mediation.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Uses the language of communication of properties minimally; favors ethical and experiential communication (how believers participate in Christ's life) over ontological transfers.

- **Hypostatic Union (recast)**
 - Understood as the union that enables exemplary mediation; priority given to moral-existential consequences rather than technical metaphysics.

- **Sinlessness / Moral Formation**
 - Sin viewed as alienation from the feeling of dependence; ethics aims to restore congruence with that feeling.

- **Church / Sacrament**
 - Primary locus for ethical education and formation; means by which Christ's exemplarship is communicated.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for liberal/progressive readings of Christology and ethics emphasizing consciousness and formation.
 - As a **polemic** against scholastic forensic models and strict Kantian formalism.
 - As an **exegetical-model/resource** for pastors and ethicists seeking to connect Christology, sacramental life, and moral transformation.
