### TITLE
"Revelation and Inspiration" - Geerhardus Vos (Princeton Theological Review). 
Primary locus: early-20th-century Princeton Biblical Theology addressing the relation of divine self-disclosure and scriptural authorship.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Princeton Seminary milieu (conservative Reformed, reaction to 19th-century liberalism and higher criticism). Vos writes as a Biblical theologian who insists on the historical, redemptive shape of revelation.
 - Conversant with debates over natural theology, the status of general revelation, and mechanical theories of inspiration.
 - (Reference: Vos, "Revelation and Inspiration" - Princeton Theological Review)
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Distinguishes clearly between *revelation* (God's self-disclosure in history, culminating in Christ) and *inspiration* (the divine causation/supervision that secures the truthfulness and authority of the biblical record).
 - Seeks to preserve both the historical concreteness of revelation and the trustworthiness/authority of Scripture without reducing either to mere propositions or mere human products.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition stage: sets out what is meant by revelation (objective act and content) and inspiration (assistance/preservation of testimony).
 - Historical argument: revelation is redemptive-historical and organic; its content is given in events, persons, and documents that point to Christ.
 - Theological argument: inspiration must be understood in relation to revelation - it is not an abstract dictation but divine oversight ensuring fidelity of testimony.
 - Polemic: opposes rationalist and purely naturalistic accounts (which collapse revelation into general revelation) and mechanical dictation theories (which strip human authorship away).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Opposes liberal critics and rationalists (e.g., those reducing revelation to ethical or religious feeling).
 - Works within Reformed tradition lines (echoing Calvinic emphasis on Christ as center of revelation) while dialoguing with contemporary Princeton colleagues.
 - Implicitly addresses scholastic categories when discussing natural theology and analogies between God and creation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs special), Inspiration, Authority of Scripture, Christocentrism in revelation, the historical character of redemptive acts, and (by implication) issues touching upon natural theology and the analogy debate.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Vos argues that Scripture is the faithful, divinely supervised testimony of God's historical self-revelation in Christ - revelation supplies the content; inspiration secures the reliability of the record.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Organic, historical conception of revelation**: revelation happens in concrete events and persons; Scripture is the covenantal testimony of those events rather than an abstract repository of propositions.
 - **Non-mechanical inspiration**: divine action preserves, guides, and guarantees truth without obliterating individual authorship and literary diversity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects liberal reductions of revelation to subjective religious experience or mere moral teaching.
 - Counters mechanical verbal dictation models by emphasizing the role of human authors within divine supervision.
 - Opposes the primacy of natural theology when it would claim parity with special revelation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tight coupling of *revelation-as-event* and *inspiration-as-testimonial-guarantee*, phrasing inspiration as divine assurance of the historical testimony.
 - Emphasis on redemptive-historical testimony as the proper object of inspiration.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed Biblical Theology; shaped subsequent treatments of revelation and inspiration at Princeton and in evangelical circles.
 - Served as a corrective to both liberal and hyper-mechanical evangelical positions; read as a model for integrating historical theology with doctrine of Scripture.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for showing how to hold together historical concreteness and doctrinal authority; valuable for teaching doctrines of revelation, inspiration, and biblical theology method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (revelatio)** - God's objective self-disclosure in history; includes acts, persons (Christ), and events that constitute redemptive content.
- **Special Revelation** - The normative, saving disclosure in Christ and the biblical testimony; necessary for knowledge of saving truth.
- **General Revelation** - Natural revelation in creation and conscience; genuine but insufficient for saving knowledge; subordinate to special revelation.
- **Inspiration (inspiratio)** - Divine supervision/assurance that secures the truth and authority of the biblical testimony without erasing human authorship.
- **Organic Unity** - The idea that Scripture's unity is historical and theological rather than merely literary or propositional; unity grows from redemptive-historical continuity.
- **Historical Revelation** - Emphasis that revelation is accomplished in time and space (events, covenants) rather than in timeless ideas.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Grounded in the combination: God has revealed (content) and guaranteed the testimony (inspiration).
- **Verbal vs. Non-verbal theories of inspiration** - Vos rejects crude mechanical verbal dictation while affirming propositional truth and divine safeguarding of words as needed for reliable witness.
- **Analogia entis** - (contrastual term) the medieval/scholastic notion of an analogy of being between God and creation that underwrites natural theology; Vos is wary of granting parallel status to such natural knowledge.
- **Analogia fidei** - (related term) the Reformed emphasis that analogy is grounded in faith/revelation rather than speculative metaphysics; revelation interprets analogies and humanity's knowledge of God.
 - Contrast: **analogia entis** presumes an ontological bridge accessible by unaided reason; **analogia fidei** presumes revelation as the hermeneutical key.
- **Natural Theology** - Legitimate as knowledge of God's existence/attributes from creation, but limited and subordinate to special revelation in Vos's schema.
- **Covenant-historical method** - Using redemptive-historical sequence as the key interpretive principle for understanding revelation and inspiration.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a non-mechanical, historically-grounded doctrine of inspiration.
 - As a **polemic** against conflating general revelation (or analogia entis) with saving revelation - used in debates over natural theology and the analogia entis vs analogia fidei issue.
 - As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for redemptive-historical theology that anchors doctrinal loci (Scripture, Christology, covenant) in the event-character of revelation.
