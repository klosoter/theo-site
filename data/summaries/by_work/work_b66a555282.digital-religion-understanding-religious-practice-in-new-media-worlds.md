### TITLE
Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds - Heidi A. Campbell

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century scholarship at the intersection of media studies, sociology of religion, and practical theology.
 - Responds to the rapid spread of social media, mobile technologies, and platform-mediated communication; addresses global and denominational diversity rather than a single theological tradition.
 - Methodologically rooted in qualitative media ethnography and comparative case studies.

- **Central thesis**
 - Digital media do not simply replace or eradicate embodied religion; rather, religious actors negotiate, adapt, and reconfigure practice, authority, and community within *networked* and mediated environments. Understanding religious life requires attention to the affordances of technologies and the agency of religious communities.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theoretical framing: critiques both techno-determinism and moral panic; adopts concepts from media studies (affordances, mediatization, remediation) and network theory.
 - Empirical chapters: ethnographic case studies across Christian, Muslim, and other communities showing how practices (ritual, community, authority) are reworked online.
 - Analytic moves:
 - Identify technological affordances (e.g., persistence, searchability, scalability) and how communities exploit or constrain them.
 - Show processes of negotiation: adaptation of ritual, re-articulation of authority, governance of boundary and identity.
 - Argue for a hybrid model: online and offline are continuous, producing new forms of religious presence and practice.
 - Methodology: participant observation, interviews, archival traces of online interactions; cross-cultural sensitivity to local appropriations of global platforms.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Media scholars: concepts from Jenkins (convergence), Hjarvard (mediatization), and affordance theory.
 - Religious studies and sociology of religion interlocutors who examine practice, identity, and institutional change.
 - Engages with pastoral and ecclesial concerns about authority, authenticity, and sacrament/ritual integrity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Implicit rather than systematic theological treatment, with strongest relevance to:
 - **Ecclesiology** (community, authority, membership)
 - **Sacramental and ritual theology** (reconfigurations of ritual practice online)
 - **Theology of mediation** (how revelation, word, and presence are mediated)
 - **Practical theology / pastoral care** (digital ministry, formation)
 - Less emphasis on classical doctrines like Trinity or Christology; rather focuses on praxis and institutional theology.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Digital Religion reframes theology and ministry to attend to mediation, embodiment, and negotiated authority: religious truth and community persist but are re-shaped by networks, technologies, and human agency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Practice-centered and empirically grounded rather than speculative or purely normative.
 - Focus on *affordances*-what media make possible and what they constrain-shifts analysis from medium determinism to contingent agency.
 - Global and comparative perspective that avoids an exclusively Western, Christian bias.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects simplistic claims that online religion is "less real" or that technology alone causes religious decline.
 - Contrasts with early Internet-utopianism and with alarmist critiques by showing nuanced, negotiated appropriation by religious communities.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and operationalized the term **"networked religion"** to describe hybrid practices across digital/physical domains.
 - Systematizes use of **affordances**, **remediation**, and **mediatization** within religious studies as analytical tools.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited across digital religion, media theology, and pastoral studies; forms a core text in courses on religion and media.
 - Adopted by scholars as a baseline framework for studying online religious authority, ritual innovation, and community governance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable conceptual vocabulary and methodological model for future empirical work.
 - Useful corrective for theologians and ministers confronting congregational life in digitally mediated contexts.
 - Serves as bridge between media theory and theological reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Networked religion**
 - Religion practiced across interconnected online and offline networks; emphasizes relational flows and distributed authority.
- **Affordances**
 - Capacities of media (e.g., persistence, visibility, scalability, editability) that shape possible religious practices.
- **Mediatization**
 - The process by which religion is shaped by and through media logics and institutional practices.
- **Remediation**
 - How religious content and practices are refashioned across old and new media forms.
- **Hybrid/online-offline continuum**
 - Analytical rejection of strict binary; practices move across physical and digital spaces.
- **Digital vernacular religion**
 - Local, everyday appropriations of digital tools for religious expression and identity work.
- **Authority (digital)**
 - Negotiated forms of leadership and gatekeeping in mediated spaces (moderation, algorithmic visibility, charismatic influencers).
- **Ritual adaptation**
 - Reworking liturgy, sacraments, or devotional acts to fit mediated formats while negotiating authenticity.
- **Materiality of media**
 - Attention to platform architectures, code, and corporate governance as theological actors shaping practice.
- **Governance / moderation**
 - Community rules, platform policies, and algorithmic moderation shape theological expression and inclusion.
- **Embodiment / presence**
 - Theological concern with presence when bodies are mediated or absent; questions of sacramental efficacy and pastoral encounter.
- **Translocality & diaspora**
 - How digital networks enable sustained communal ties across space, impacting identity and memory.
- **Participation/engagement**
 - Patterns of consumption, production, and sharing that constitute digital religious life.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: authoritative framing of "digital religion" and "networked religion" in scholarship and pedagogy.
 - As a **methodological exemplar**: guides ethnographic and comparative studies of online religious practice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and pastoral theology: reorients questions of authority, ritual, and community in mediated contexts.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both techno-utopian and alarmist accounts of digital religion.
