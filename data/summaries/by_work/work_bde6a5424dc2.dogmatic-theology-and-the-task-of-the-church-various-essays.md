### TITLE
Dogmatic Theology and the Task of the Church (essays)
Author: Scott R. Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed theological context (early 21st century). Situated within recent recoveries of classical dogmatics and confessional Reformed theology against trends of pragmatic/therapeutic or privatized Christianity. Engages both ecclesial formation debates and academic-method questions in systematic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Dogmatic theology is not an abstract academic discipline but the church's normative, formative discipline for thinking, worshiping, and acting. The task of theology is ecclesial: to articulate the faith that forms Christian identity, worship, preaching, sacraments, and mission.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Reassert the churchly character of dogmatics: theology serves the life of the covenant community rather than autonomous intellectual inquiry.
 - Anchor dogmatics in Scripture and the church's rule of faith (creeds, confessions); doctrine shapes ecclesial practices (lex orandi - lex credendi).
 - Show how doctrines (especially the Trinity, Christology, covenant, and soteriology) function as resources for worship, preaching, catechesis, and mission.
 - Critique modern bifurcations (e.g., theory vs. practice, private vs. public faith) and propose methodological unity between confession, exegesis, and pastoral application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary interlocutors include Calvin and historic Reformed confessional tradition, theological heirs like Bavinck and Kuyper, and modern figures such as Barth and Torrance where their ecclesial emphases intersect. Also sets itself against liberal and pragmatic evangelical tendencies that demote doctrinal rigor.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (authority and normativity), Trinity (God's being and life as formative for worship), Christology (uniqueness of the Son in church proclamation), Covenant (ecclesial identity and sacramental life), Soteriology/Justification (doctrinal heart of church proclamation), Sacraments (means of grace integral to formation), Ecclesiology (church as locus of dogmatics).
- **Closing line:** Dogmatic theology is the church's disciplined speech about the triune God that shapes worship, catechesis, and witness; theology thus must be both doctrinally robust and ecclesially formative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that dogmatics is an ecclesial practice - theology as formative action rather than merely propositional knowledge.
 - Prioritizes Trinitarian and covenantal frameworks as the organizing centers for all loci of doctrine and for ecclesial life.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects tendencies in modern theology that detach doctrine from liturgical and pastoral formation (against privatized or purely theoretical theologies).
 - Distinguishes itself from non-confessional or purely experiential approaches by reasserting confessions and creeds as normative mediators.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulates a sustained vocabulary linking "dogmatics" with "task" - the vocational, communal, and practical obligations of theology within the church.
 - Recasts classical categories (e.g., covenant, sacrament) in explicitly ecclesial-formation terms rather than merely propositional categories.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely taken up in Reformed seminary circles and by pastors interested in confessional formation; used as a corrective to pragmatic ministry models. Influences discussions on theological method, confessional identity, and curriculum in conservative Reformed settings.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a compact, robust framework for integrating systematic doctrine with ecclesial praxis; valuable for pastors, seminary teachers, and students aiming to reclaim theology's formative role in the life of the church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dogmatic theology:** The church's reflective articulation of the faith; normative and formative for worship and life.
- **Task of the church:** The vocational responsibilities of theology to form believers, sustain worship, and govern ecclesial practice.
- **Lex orandi, lex credendi:** Rule of prayer and rule of belief; doctrine and worship inform one another reciprocally.
- **Confessionalism:** Use of creeds and confessions as canonical mediators shaping dogmatic reflection.
- **Trinitarian center:** The doctrine of the Trinity as the organizing principle for theology and ecclesial life.
- **Covenant framework:** Covenant as the matrix for ecclesiology, sacramentality, and the continuity of God's saving work.
- **Sacramental formation:** Sacraments as means by which doctrine is embodied and taught in the church.
- **Scriptural normativity:** Scripture as the ultimate criterion for dogmatic claims and church practice.
- **Ecclesial practice:** Worship, preaching, catechesis, discipline - the arenas where dogmatics is enacted.
- **Doctrine-practice unity:** The methodological insistence that right doctrine must result in shaped practice and vice versa.
- **Public witness:** Theology's role in forming the church's corporate testimony in the world.
- **Catechetical theology:** Use of doctrinal instruction for ongoing formation across life stages.
- **Theological formation:** Process by which pastors and congregations are shaped by sustained doctrinal engagement.
- **Pastoral-dogmatic integration:** Bringing doctrinal rigor into pastoral care and liturgical planning.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what constitutes mature, ecclesial dogmatics and its methodological commitments.
 - As a **polemic** against privatized, pragmatic, or non-confessional forms of ministry and theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating Trinitarian, covenantal, and sacramental emphases into preaching, catechesis, and seminary curricula.
