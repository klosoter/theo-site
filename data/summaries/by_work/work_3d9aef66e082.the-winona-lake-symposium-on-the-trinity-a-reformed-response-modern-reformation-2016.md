### TITLE
The Winona Lake Symposium on the Trinity: A Reformed Response (Modern Reformation, 2016) - Lane Tipton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in Modern Reformation (2016) amid renewed intra-evangelical debates over Trinitarian formulations; emerges from the Winona Lake gathering which sought to revisit classical Reformed Trinitarian commitments against contemporary departures (social models, revisionist person-language, modalist tendencies).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Tipton defends a classical Reformed articulation of the Trinity by critiquing attempts to reorder person/essence language - notably the use and critique of **"one-person" language** - and argues that certain modern terminologies and rhetorical moves risk undermining orthodox distinctions between God's unity and threeness.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Describes the background of the Winona Lake symposium and the contested vocabulary in recent evangelical Trinitarian discourse.
 - Analyzes the critique of "one-person" language (citing Van Til's critique as a key interlocutor) and shows how careless use can slide into modalism or collapse distinctions among hypostases.
 - Reaffirms the classical parameters: distinction of persons (hypostases) without division of essence, the priority of the economic Trinity for doxology and doctrine, and caution about readapting everyday metaphors into precise theological categories.
 - Proposes corrective hermeneutical principles for Reformed teachers and pastors to use historically grounded person-language while resisting both social-Trinitarian overemphasis and reductive monarchian language.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Contributors to the Winona Lake symposium; historic touchstones (Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, Augustine, Reformed confessions); critical interlocutor referenced explicitly: **Van Til's One Person Language and Its Critique** (used as a foil for the discussion). Also engages contemporary evangelical debates over social Trinitarianism and modalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (primary), with implications for Christology (person/office language), revelation (how God is named and known), and pastoral theology (wording used in worship and preaching).
- **Closing line:** Tipton situates a careful, confessionally Reformed Trinitarian vocabulary as the indispensable guardrail against both modalist simplification and novel social-model fragmentation - insisting that orthodox person-language must preserve both divine unity and personal distinction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses confessional continuity: theological vocabulary should be inherited and disciplined by the creeds, not supplanted by contemporary heuristics.
 - Emphasizes hermeneutical prudence: theological terms may be analogical and provisional; therefore precision in speech about personhood in God is pastoral as well as theological.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on proponents who flatten person-language into functional or relational descriptors (the social-Trinitarian tendency).
 - Corrects rhetorical misuses identified in Van Til's critique by distinguishing legitimate caution about "one-person" language from caricatures that would ban historically orthodox descriptors.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Offers pragmatic guidelines for when and how to use "person" language in preaching and doctrine without tipping into modalism or over-socialized ontology.
 - Reframes the debate around *discursive discipline* rather than wholesale terminological revision.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Read widely among conservative Reformed pastors and theologians as a clarifying, pastoral corrective.
 - Served as a reference point in subsequent essays defending classical Trinitarian vocabulary in evangelical circles.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful pedagogically for training ministers to speak Trinitarianly with theological fidelity and pastoral sensitivity.
 - Functions as a compact summary of how one Reformed voice navigates modern terminological controversies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One-person language**
 - Phrase criticized when used to collapse distinctions between persons; Tipton treats Van Til's critique as a springboard for correction and nuance.
- **Person (hypostasis)**
 - Retained as central; must be distinguished from essence/being to avoid modalism.
- **Essence/ousia**
 - The shared divine substance; critical to maintain unity while affirming persons.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - Tipton emphasizes its revelatory primacy: how God acts and is known in history grounds rightful person-language.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - Treated cautiously; talk of intra-Trinitarian relations must not eclipse the Scriptural economic revelation.
- **Modalism (Monarchianism)**
 - Identified as a persistent risk when "one-person" rhetoric is misused.
- **Social Trinitarianism**
 - Critiqued where it anthropomorphizes divine personhood or posits relationality as ontologically prior.
- **Perichoresis**
 - Affirmed as describing interpenetration without confusion; used to safeguard against isolationist personhood.
- **Analogy of being / analogical predication**
 - Recommended as a methodological tool for theological speech about God.
- **Hermeneutical prudence**
 - Term for Tipton's rule: doctrinal terms must be historically informed and pastorally accountable.
- **Discursive discipline**
 - Innovation: normative restraint in theological language to preserve orthodoxy.
- **Confessional fidelity**
 - The standard by which new terminologies are assessed.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against both modalist simplification and certain strains of social Trinitarianism.
- As a **teaching resource** for pastors and seminarians on disciplined Trinitarian vocabulary and preaching.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for arguing that the creeds and Reformed confessions remain primary arbiters of theological language.
