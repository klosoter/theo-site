### TITLE
**Chalcedon and the Two Natures of Christ** 
John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed analytic theology; Frame writes as a conservative Presbyterian theologian responding to both popular evangelical imprecision and academic revisionism on Christology.
 - Moves in the broad post-Reformation stream that seeks to recover classical creedal orthodoxy (Chalcedon 451) with philosophical rigor and pastoral application.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Chalcedonian Definition is the indispensable, theologically coherent formulation that secures Christ as one Person with two complete natures (divine and human). Departures (Nestorian or Eutychian tendencies) jeopardize redemption, mediation, and worship.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical and historical defense of Chalcedon: explains the council's four negatives and why they guard against error.
 - Analytic clarification: distinguishes carefully between "nature" (whatness) and "person" (who-ness), showing how attributes can be predicated of Christ without confusion.
 - Shows logical entailments for predication and attribution (communication of properties) while avoiding category mistakes.
 - Soteriological and pastoral application: links the doctrine to atonement, intercession, and assurance-if Christ is not fully God and fully man, saving work fails.
 - Critique of modern misuses: corrects rhetorical or pietistic flattening that collapses the two natures or makes Chalcedon obscure.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: Councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon, Cyril of Alexandria, Leo I.
 - Opponents/contrast: Nestorius, Eutyches (monophysitism), later Arian and semi-Arian tendencies.
 - Reformation and post-Reformation: Luther, Calvin (occasional appropriation of communicatio idiomatum), modern theologians who reframe Christology (some analytic theologians and Barthian critics).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: Christology (Hypostatic Union, two natures)
 - Secondary: Trinity (implications for personhood and relations), soteriology (atonement and mediation), revelation and worship (who we pray to and trust).

- **Closing line**
 - Chalcedon, rightly understood and carefully articulated in terms of nature and person, is the linchpin for coherent Christian doctrine: it alone preserves Christ as the true mediator who is worthy of worship and efficacious for salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong analytic clarity: Frame presses philosophical distinctions (nature vs person) to make Chalcedon's language accessible and defensible in modern categories.
 - Pastoral-soteriological focus: doctrinal precision is shown to have direct consequences for redemption, assurance, and worship.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both Nestorian separatism (which fractures the unity of the Person) and Eutychian fusion (which abolishes full humanity or deity).
 - Challenges pietistic or popular talk that attributes only human emotions/limits to Christ or only divine attributes-insists disciplined predication via Chalcedon.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts classical categories in contemporary philosophical idiom without abandoning creedal language; emphasizes predicate logic of ascription to avoid equivocation on communicatio idiomatum.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used within conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a clear, disciplined defense of Chalcedon.
 - Productive bridge between historical theology and analytic theology; respected for clarity though less influential in more continental/Barthian circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise tutorial on how Chalcedon functions doctrinally and pastorally; valuable for teaching, preaching, and apologetic encounters about the person and work of Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chalcedonian Definition**
 - One Person (hypostasis) in two natures, "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."

- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The personal union of divine and human natures in the one person of Christ; central explanatory concept.

- **Nature (physis) vs Person (hypostasis/prosopon)**
 - Nature: what a thing is (divine, human). Person: who the subject is (the one who has these natures). Frame stresses keeping these categories distinct.

- **Two Natures (dyophysitism)**
 - Full deity and full humanity coexisting in one person; each nature retains its properties.

- **Communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties)**
 - The orthodox rule for predicating attributes of Christ: properties may be ascribed to the person without confusing the natures; Frame clarifies logical constraints.

- **Nestorianism**
 - Error of dividing Christ into two persons; Frame rejects this as a denial of personal unity.

- **Monophysitism / Eutychianism**
 - Error of fusing the natures into a single nature; Frame shows this undermines true humanity or true deity.

- **Predication and appropriation**
 - Distinction between what properly belongs to each nature and what is properly ascribed to the person for theological speech and worship.

- **Atonement & Mediation**
 - Practical necessities that depend upon Chalcedonian Christology: only One who is fully God and fully man can redeem and represent.

- **Personhood and Worship**
 - Chalcedon secures that worship is due to Christ as God and trust in him as man; Frame links doctrine to liturgical and devotional fidelity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and exegetical source for teaching Chalcedonian Christology in systematic theology courses.
- As polemic against Nestorianism and Monophysitism in historical and ecumenical debates.
- As a conceptual model for precise predication (communicatio idiomatum) in philosophical theology and apologetics.
- As a pastoral-theological pivot tying doctrinal clarity to soteriology, worship, and assurance.
