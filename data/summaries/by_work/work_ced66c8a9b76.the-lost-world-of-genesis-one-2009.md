### TITLE
The Lost World of Genesis One (2009) - John H. Walton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Published 2009 by IVP Academic. Walton writes as an OT scholar conversant with ancient Near Eastern (ANE) literature, temple studies, and contemporary science-theology debates. The book addresses modern misunderstandings of Genesis 1 rooted in modern material ontology and the scientific revolution.
- **Central thesis:** Genesis 1 should be read as **functional ontology** and a description of cosmic temple inauguration - God assigning roles and functions - rather than as a material account of material origins. The chapter tells us what the cosmos is for, not how its material components came into being.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Genealogical and genre groundwork: situates Genesis 1 in ANE cognitive world where function and purpose are primary.
 - Reading Genesis 1 as an act of **assignment/commissioning**: days = divine workdays of giving functions and offices.
 - Cosmic-Temple thesis: creation language mirrors temple dedication language; God "rests" as enthroned ruler in his finished temple.
 - Implications: reframes debates about chronology, scientific compatibility, and theological anthropology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - ANE texts (e.g., Enuma Elish, temple texts), comparative religion studies.
 - Dialogue with modern interpreters: young-earth literalists, framework theorists, and various evangelical commentators.
 - Implicit engagement with covenantal and patristic readings that assume material creation narratives.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical genre (hermeneutics).
 - Creation and providence (ontology of creation).
 - Anthropology (image of God as functional office).
 - Soteriology & fall: consequences interpreted in terms of loss of function/role.
 - Science and scripture relations (epistemology and concordism debates).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Genesis 1 proclaims God's ordering of cosmic functions and his enthronement in the cosmos - theology of purpose and vocation rather than a scientific primer on material origins.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Functional ontology**: being = function; Genesis 1 communicates why things exist (their role), not primarily how they materialized.
 - **Cosmic temple / inauguration model**: the cosmos as God's temple; creation week as liturgical/administrative days of commissioning.
 - Reading humanity's image-bearing as an **office** (task-holder) more than an intrinsic metaphysical category.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against both naive concordism (Genesis as proto-science) and simplistic literalist material creationism; also differs from the classic Framework Hypothesis by rooting reading in ANE temple imagery, not only literary structure.
 - Challenges readings that make Genesis 1 primarily about material origins, thereby reshaping debates on death, evolution, and chronology.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularization and systematic use of the term **functional ontology** for Genesis 1.
 - Recasting "days" as **workdays of assignment**, not necessarily 24-hour material-creation markers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Wide influence across evangelical and academic circles; embraced by many as a sober middle way between literalist and purely figurative readings.
 - Critiqued by conservative Reformed and creationist scholars concerned about implications for original sin, historical fall, and scriptural inerrancy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative exegetical model for classroom and pulpit; useful as a corrective to modern anachronistic readings.
 - Valuable for science-theology dialogue by offering a non-concordist hermeneutic that preserves theological seriousness of Genesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Functional ontology** - the claim that Genesis 1 defines what entities are by their functions and roles, not by material origins.
- **Cosmic temple / temple inauguration** - reading the cosmos as God's temple and the creation week as its ceremonial dedication.
- **Days as workdays/assignments** - the six days represent divine commissioning acts assigning roles and offices.
- **Image of God (functional)** - humanity's image-bearing is primarily about *task and role* (stewardship/priestly function).
- **Divine rest / enthronement** - God's rest on day seven denotes enthronement in his temple, signifying rule rather than fatigue.
- **Non-concordism** - methodological posture that Genesis 1 is not intended as a scientific account; frees the text from modern empirical questions.
- **Accommodation (hermeneutical)** - Walton often appeals to ANE cultural-linguistic accommodation: Genesis communicates in the cognitive categories of its first hearers.
- **Material ontology (contrast)** - the modern assumption Walton critiques: to be = material composition and origins.
- **Intrusion / disorder language (Fall consequences)** - Walton frames the Fall primarily as a disruption of function and role (loss of vocation), interacting with models like Klinean intrusion ethics that view sin as disorder penetrating created order.
- **Genre and ANE parallels** - use of ANE dedicatory and temple literature as keys to Genesis 1's intent.
- **Work-week motif** - theological liturgical structure locating Sabbath as consummation of divine reign.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Exegetical model:** Primary resource for reading Genesis 1 as temple-inauguration and for teaching functional ontology.
 - **Science-and-theology resource:** Canonical pivot for non-concordist dialogues that accept evolutionary science while affirming theological claims of purpose and teleology.
 - **Polemic/reference:** Cited in debates with young-earth creationism and in critiques of literalist/modern-materialist hermeneutics.
 - **Definition source:** Standard reference for the term "functional ontology" and for reframing the image of God as office/role in systematic and pastoral theology.
