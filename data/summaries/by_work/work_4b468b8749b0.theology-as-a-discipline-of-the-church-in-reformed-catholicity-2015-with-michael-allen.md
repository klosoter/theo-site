### TITLE
Theology as a Discipline of the Church (essay by Scott Swain, in Reformed Catholicity, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-2010s Reformed renewal movement often labeled "Reformed Catholicity" seeking retrieval of ecumenical and pre-modern resources; conversation located within US/English-speaking Reformed academic and ecclesial formation contexts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Theology must be understood and practiced as an ecclesial discipline - a communal, confessional, worship-shaped activity of the church governed by Scripture and ordered to the service of Christ - rather than as a privatized, purely academic enterprise.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Theology is ordered by the Word of God: Scripture provides normative content and rule (regula fidei) for theological labor.
 - The church is the proper subject and locus of theology: theology is shaped by offices, worship, sacraments, creeds, and the life of the covenant community.
 - Confession and catholicity are complementary: a Reformed theology that is truly catholic preserves doctrinal continuity with the church catholic while retaining Reformation commitments.
 - Method follows ecclesial ends: theological method must be subservient to pastoral care, catechesis, and liturgical formation; academic disciplines are resources, not masters.
 - Practical corollaries: seminary-ecclesial relations, ministerial formation, and confessional fidelity receive renewed emphasis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural authority; canonical and creedal tradition (patristic and conciliar contours); Reformers (esp. Calvinic sensibilities); contemporary interlocutors in Reformed renewal and voices critical of privatized theology (implicit engagement with modern secularizing trends in theology).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Word and Scripture), Trinity (as grounding theological identity), Christology (the church's theological center), ecclesiology (church as subject of theology), sacraments, covenant, authority and tradition, the relation of faith and reason.
- **Closing line:** Theology, rightly practiced, is a disciplined, confessional, worship-formed craft of the church that serves the gospel by shaping the church's faith, preaching, and life in continuity with the catholic tradition and fidelity to Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The repeated formulation of theology as a *discipline of the church* - discipline in both pedagogical and regulative senses - situates theological method within ecclesial practice rather than the academy alone.
 - Strong insistence on combining *Reformed* commitments with *catholic* continuity: not retrieval for novelty but for corrective depth.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Explicit corrective to privatized, individualistic, or purely academic models of theology that detach doctrine from worship and pastoral life.
 - Challenges both anti-confessional tendencies and confessionalism that is inward-looking, arguing for outward-facing catholic fidelity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting "catholicity" within a Reformed framework as a discipline-forming horizon rather than mere historical antiquarianism.
 - Use of "discipline" to denote an ecclesial epistemology (how the church knows) as much as a curriculum.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among conservative and confessional Reformed seminaries, pastors, and students seeking integration of doctrine and practice.
 - Cited in debates over seminary purpose, ministerial formation, and the recovery of liturgical/creedal resources in Reformed contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a robust framework for curricular reform in seminaries and for church-centered theological education.
 - Useful corrective against both secularizing academic theology and sectarian isolation; aids pastors in grounding doctrinal instruction within worship and sacrament.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theology as a discipline:** Theology conceived as a practiced, regulated craft of the church - educational, pastoral, and formative.
- **Ecclesial epistemology:** Knowing God through the church's offices, worship, and sacramental life rather than private speculation.
- **Reformed catholicity:** A dialectic of Reformation principles and catholic continuity; fidelity to Scripture expressed in historic creedal and confessional forms.
- **Word-centered theology:** Primacy of Scripture (and the preached Word) as norming the content and procedure of theology.
- **Confession/confessionality:** The church's public, creedal self-articulation as both guide and boundary for doctrinal work.
- **Worship-shaped doctrine:** Claim that doctrinal formation arises from and returns to liturgical life (sermon, sacraments, prayer).
- **Church as subject:** The church, corporately constituted, is the agent and audience for theology rather than the detached scholar.
- **Discipline (pedagogical/regulative senses):** Training and governance of believers' faith; also the normative pattern that disciplines theological inquiry.
- **Covenantal ontology:** The view that ecclesial identity and theological categories are framed by covenantal relations (God, Christ, church).
- **Authority & tradition:** Tradition and confessions are resources subordinate to Scripture but formative for theological practice.
- **Creedal-linguistic formation:** The role of creeds and confessions in forming theological speech and thought in the church.
- **Sacramental theology as formative:** Sacraments as loci of doctrinal knowledge and ecclesial formation.
- **Pastoral telos:** Theology ordered to the care and edification of the church - preaching, catechesis, and pastoral ministry.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for ecclesial or confessional models of theological method in seminary pedagogy.
- As a **polemic** against privatized/academic secularizing tendencies in modern theology and as a corrective toward worship- and office-shaped theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating historical theology, doctrine, and pastoral formation within confessional Reformed curricula.
