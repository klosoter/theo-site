### TITLE
**Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 10, 20, 22** 
Deity of Christ; Gods justice and mercy in Christ; Faith as the instrument of justification

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Composed in 1561 in the Low Countries amid persecution, aligning with the Reformed stream of the magisterial Reformation.
 - Aimed to demonstrate biblical, catholic orthodoxy over against Rome, radical movements, and emerging anti-Trinitarian errors.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - A10: Confesses Christ as true and eternal God, consubstantial with the Father, against subordinationist or adoptionist claims.
 - A20: Explains how God remains perfectly just and merciful by punishing sin in Christ and granting us mercy in Him.
 - A22: Asserts justification by faith alone; faith is the Spirit-given instrument that embraces Christ and all His merits.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - A10: Christ is God by nature, not by adoption; He is begotten, not made; Scripture witnesses (John 1; Col 1; Heb 1; Phil 2).
 - A20: The Father sent the Son in our flesh to satisfy divine justice; the cross displays justice and mercy together (Isa 53; Rom 3:25-26; 2 Cor 5:21).
 - A22: Faith unites to Christ and appropriates His benefits; it does not merit; justification excludes works as ground or part of the instrument (Rom 3-5; Gal 2-3).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Nicene-Chalcedonian tradition (consubstantiality; eternal generation).
 - Scripture as supreme norm; echoes of Augustine and the Reformers (Luther, Calvin) on grace, merit, and faith.
 - Polemical horizon: Rome on merit and justification; Anabaptist spiritualism; anti-Trinitarians (Arians/Socinians).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology and authority of Scripture; Trinity and Christology; atonement (satisfaction, substitution); justification; union with Christ; beginnings of covenantal reasoning about justice and mercy.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: the one true God reveals perfect justice and mercy in the incarnate, consubstantial Son, whose saving benefits are received by faith alone.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong Nicene language: Christ is God by essence, begotten from eternity.
 - Tight justice-mercy dialectic: Gods justice satisfied in Christ for us; mercy bestowed without denying righteousness.
 - Faith as instrument: faith embraces Christ and His merits, contributing nothing meritorious.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against adoptionism/subordinationism: Son is not a creature nor God by dignity.
 - Against Roman accounts of merit: excludes works as ground or co-instrument; rejects that faith itself merits.
 - Against moral-exemplar or merely governmental atonement: insists on satisfaction and substitution.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Confessional articulation of eternal generation in service of soteriology.
 - Satisfaction language joined to mercy without compromise of either.
 - Instrumentality of faith (not cause), preparing later precision on imputation (developed in A23).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical within the Three Forms of Unity; formative for Reformed orthodoxy on Christology and justification.
 - Echoed in Heidelberg Catechism on true faith and in later confessions on sola fide.
 - Used in polemics versus Socinianism and in Protestant-Catholic debates post-Trent.
- **Enduring value**
 - Concise template for preaching and catechesis on who Christ is, what His cross accomplishes, and how salvation is received.
 - Reliable touchstone for ecumenical dialogue on Trinity and justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Consubstantial (of one essence)**: Affirms the Sons full deity with the Father; excludes creaturely status.
- **Eternal generation**: The Son is begotten, not made, from eternity; grounds deity without tritheism.
- **Adoptionism rejected**: Christ is not God by promotion or grace but by nature.
- **Mediator**: The incarnate Son who satisfies justice and restores communion.
- **Satisfaction**: Christs obedient life and atoning death meet the demands of divine justice on our behalf.
 - Related: substitution; He bears our sins, we receive His benefits.
- **Justice and mercy**: Coordinated in the cross; God remains just while justifying the ungodly.
- **Propitiation/expiation**: Godward removal of wrath and sin; biblical logic underlying A20.
- **Incarnation**: The Son assumes our nature to represent and redeem us.
- **Merits of Christ**: The righteousness and obedience of Christ credited to believers; faith receives these merits.
- **Faith alone (sola fide)**: Exclusive instrument of justification; excludes works as ground or part of the instrument.
- **Instrumentality of faith**: Faith unites and appropriates; it is receptive, not meritorious cause.
- **Union with Christ**: The bond by the Spirit through which all benefits flow; faith is the bond or its instrument.
- **Assurance**: Stabilized by Christs objective merits received by faith, not by self-merit.
- **Scripture sufficiency**: Articles argue by Scripture proofs, modeling confessional biblicity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Christology: A10 as a standard for Nicene orthodoxy and exegesis of key texts.
 - Soteriology: A20 and A22 as concise statements of satisfaction and sola fide; catechetical anchor.
 - Covenant theology: Template for justice-mercy coherence within the covenant of grace.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: Grounds that sacraments confirm faith but do not replace its instrumental role.
