### TITLE
**Christless Christianity: The Alternative Gospel of the American Church** - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid debates over the direction of American evangelicalism; written from a conservative Reformed perspective reacting to post-1960s cultural accommodation, seeker-sensitive ministry models, and the rise of therapeutic/consumer Christianity.
 - Theological milieu: Reformed confessionalism wrestling with popular evangelicalism and North American civil religion.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Horton argues that much of American Christianity advances an **"alternative gospel"** that obscures or removes the historical, incarnate Christ, substituting cultural accommodation, moralism, or therapeutic religion for saving union with Christ. The principal problem is not nominalism but a gospel that functions without Christ as Savior and Lord.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: surveys empirical signs - flattening of doctrine, worship shaped by consumer culture, eschatological domestication - showing how Christ is marginalized.
 - Theological analysis: reasserts classic Reformation categories (law/gospel, justification by faith, repentance) as corrective lenses.
 - Distinguishes true saving faith (knowledge of and union with Christ) from mere intellectual assent or moral reform.
 - Reinscribes repentance as an indispensable partner to faith.
 - Cultural critique: examines how American civil religion, optimism, and eschatological minimization produce a domesticated gospel that lacks the cross and final judgment.
 - Pastoral prescriptions: calls for recovery of preaching centered on Christ, catechesis in covenant theology, and renewed attention to sacraments and ecclesial formation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Resources: Reformation theologians (Luther, Calvin), Westminster tradition, contemporary Reformed theologians.
 - Interlocutors: mainstream American evangelical leaders, seeker-sensitive and therapeutic movements, and cultural theologians whose practice divorces gospel from courtroom and cross realities.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (incarnation, atonement), soteriology (justification, sanctification), law/gospel distinction, repentance and faith, ecclesiology, eschatology, covenant theology, and the relation of church to culture/state.

- **Closing line**
 - Horton's theological center: the church survives and reforms only when the preaching and life of the church insist on Christ as the decisive, crucified, risen, and reigning Lord - not as a cultural accessory but as the sole ground of salvation and judgment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp insistence that a gospel can be functionally "Christless" even while using Christian language and rites.
 - Integration of pastoral critique with classical doctrinal recovery (law/gospel, repentance).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic and therapeutic tendencies that privatize faith and avoid forensic categories of sin, judgment, and justification.
 - Contrasts with cultural accommodationists who subordinate gospel claims to national identity or pragmatic church growth strategies.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the phrase **"alternative gospel"** to describe Christianity emptied of Christological and forensic substance.
 - Reframes consumer Christianity as a theological problem, not merely sociological.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed and confessional evangelical circles as a rallying cry for doctrinal recovery and ecclesial reform.
 - Used polemically against seeker-sensitive and therapeutic strands; critics accuse Horton of sweeping generalization and insufficient engagement with pastoral complexity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for diagnosing doctrinal drift and for integrating historical doctrinal categories into contemporary pastoral strategy.
 - Valuable for seminarians and pastors as both critique and practical theology handbook.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christless Christianity**
 - Christianity that retains Christian forms while removing Christ as the decisive object of salvation.
- **Alternative gospel**
 - Horton's label for substitutes that promise flourishing without participation in Christ's death and resurrection.
- **Law/Gospel distinction**
 - Central analytic tool: law exposes sin and drives to Christ; gospel declares forensic justification through Christ alone.
 - Used to critique moralistic and therapeutic distortions that collapse law and gospel.
- **Justification by faith**
 - Forensic declaration by God; Horton stresses a robust, relational understanding tied to union with Christ.
- **Repentance**
 - Not mere moral improvement but a covenantal turning from sin inseparable from faith; corrective to decisionism.
- **Therapeutic deism / therapeutic gospel**
 - Describes faith reduced to personal well-being and self-help rather than repentance and union with Christ.
- **Seeker-sensitive movement**
 - Empirical target: ministry methods that prioritize attraction and accommodation over doctrinal fidelity.
- **American civil religion / Christianized Americanism**
 - Cultural lid that domesticates gospel claims and fuses national identity with gospel promises.
- **Eschatological perspective**
 - Horton argues that diminished eschatology (softened judgment, privatized hope) undergirds Christless practices.
- **Ecclesiology**
 - Church as covenant community centered on preaching, sacraments, and discipline - antidote to consumerized church life.
- **Sanctification**
 - Treated as fruit, not substitute, for justification; tied to union with Christ and covenantal discipleship.
- **Covenant theology**
 - Framework for catechesis and pastoral formation; restores corporate and historical contours of salvation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for diagnosing "alternative gospel" phenomena in contemporary ministry.
 - As a **polemic** against seeker-sensitive and therapeutic trends, often cited in ecclesial reform debates.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** for preaching that privileges law/gospel clarity and the centrality of Christ.
