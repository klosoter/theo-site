### TITLE
**Types of Modern Theology (1937) - H. R. Mackintosh**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Interwar period; reaction to nineteenth-century liberalism and the flowering of historical-critical methods; placed at the crossroads between older Scottish Reformed scholarship and emergent twentieth-century theological movements (Ritschlianism, neo-orthodoxy, existential approaches).
 - A systematic survey and critique offered by a conservative-Reformed scholar concerned to classify modern tendencies and to defend the classical dogmatic corpus.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Modern theological types are best explained as methodological responses to the modern intellectual situation; many contemporary Christological innovations (notably kenotic theories) are symptomatic attempts to solve the problem of God's relation to history by altering traditional doctrines of the divine nature.
 - The primary doctrinal problem addressed: how to account for the incarnation and the divine-human relation without undermining the attributes of God (immutability, simplicity, omnipotence).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey and typology: Mackintosh sketches several "types" of modern theology categorized by their controlling presuppositions (historical-critical, ethical/Ritschlian, existential/personalist, neo-orthodox, rationalist).
 - Diagnostic move: he locates kenotic Christologies within the subclass of theologies that privilege historical immanence and ethical intelligibility over metaphysical transcendence.
 - Normative move: defends the classical Chalcedonian and patristic formulations as the appropriate balance of divine and human in Christ; warns that kenotic solutions tend to dissolve the divine identity or to posit an arbitrary limitation of divine attributes.
 - Practical implication: theological method must remain tethered to normative revelation and received dogma rather than to philosophic fashions or ethical exigencies.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with Ritschlian ethics, nineteenth-century kenotic proponents (background figures in German theology), and the critical apparatus of historical criticism; interacts implicitly with neo-orthodox concerns (e.g., Barthian stress on God's otherness) while differing on preserving classical metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), incarnation, Trinity (per implications for divine attributes), atonement (as affected by how one conceives the divine-human exchange), revelation, and related methodological concerns (historical criticism vs. dogmatic theology).

- **Closing line**
 - Mackintosh's theological center of gravity: a principled defense of classical Christology and divine attributes against modern methodological tendencies-especially kenotic theories-that solve historical problems by revising the ontology of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats modern theological varieties sociologically and methodologically: theological types are explained by their intellectual presuppositions (ethical, historical, existential), not merely by doctrinal propositions.
 - Sees kenoticism as a symptom (not a neutral alternative): an outcome of overemphasizing the historical intelligibility of Jesus at the expense of theologically necessary traits of God.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects kenotic proponents who posit an ontological self-limitation of the divine will or attributes by insisting on the coherence of Chalcedonian and classical metaphysical categories (immutability, simplicity).
 - Contrasts with radical liberal reductions (which domesticate the divine) and with some neo-orthodox moves that, while restoring transcendence, may not fully account for the continuity of classical metaphysics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic typology of modern theology as a pedagogical tool for tracing how method begets doctrine.
 - Emphasizes "symptom-reading" of doctrinal innovation (e.g., kenosis as diagnostic of ethical/historical priorities).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative academic circles as a clear guide to common modern errors in Christology.
 - Cited in mid-twentieth-century debates on kenotic Christology as a representative conservative critique; less influential among liberal or radical theologians who embraced kenosis for methodological reasons.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a concise map of modern theological tendencies and as a principled resource for students needing a defense of classical Christology against methodological reductions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis / Kenoticism** - the doctrine that the Son "emptied" himself (Phil 2) understood as a real limitation of divine attributes in the incarnation; Mackintosh treats it as symptomatic and problematic.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - the received formula for Christ's two natures; used as the normative standard against kenotic reconfigurations.
- **Immutability** - God's unchanging nature; invoked to critique any kenotic claim that entails real metaphysical change in the divine essence.
- **Divine Simplicity** - theological insistence that God is not composite; used to argue that attribute-limitation models are incoherent.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - the communication of properties; deployed to clarify how divine and human attributes relate without ontological subtraction.
- **Hypostatic Union** - the personal union of divine and human in Christ; central corrective to kenotic models that imply separate hypostases or attrition of deity.
- **Historical-critical method** - methodological root for several modern types; identified as a driving force behind kenotic accommodations.
- **Ritschlian / Ethical Interpretation** - theological tendency to prioritize moral/religious value of Christ over metaphysical claims; linked to kenotic emphasis on ethical intelligibility.
- **Neo-orthodoxy** - twentieth-century movement emphasizing divine otherness; Mackintosh partially sympathetic but critical where metaphysics are not recovered.
- **Atonement theories** - discussed insofar as kenotic adjustments reshape notions of efficacy and divine action.
- **Symptomatology** - Mackintosh's method of reading doctrinal innovations as symptoms of deeper methodological shifts.
- **Transcendence vs. Immanence** - key polarity diagnosing why kenotic proposals arise.
- **Methodological presuppositions** - the guiding philosophical or hermeneutical commitments that produce particular theological types.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: concise taxonomy for "types of modern theology" used in lectures and syllabi.
 - Polemic: frequent citation in conservative critiques of kenotic Christologies and in defenses of classical metaphysical attributes.
 - Pedagogical/conceptual pivot: employed to teach how method shapes doctrine; less used as an exegetical model for Phil 2 than as a doctrinal caution.
