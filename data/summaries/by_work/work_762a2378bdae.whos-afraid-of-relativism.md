### TITLE
Who's Afraid of Relativism? - James K. A. Smith

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the early 2000s amid debates over postmodernism, pluralism, and public reason. Smith writes from a broadly Reformed/evangelical academic context (Calvin College/Calvin Theological Seminary milieu), interlocuting with Continental and Anglo-American critics of modern epistemology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The problem of judgment in a plural, contingent world: how can Christians make truth-claims and exercise moral-political judgment without succumbing either to an oppressive, ahistorical objectivism or to nihilistic relativism? Smith argues for a middle path-acknowledging contingency and tradition without abandoning normative truth-claims.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modern claims to neutral, universal standpoint are untenable; critiques of relativism often conflate distinct senses and fail to appreciate contingency.
 - Clarification: distinguishes several types of relativism (epistemic, moral, cultural) and shows that acknowledging situatedness need not entail epistemic collapse.
 - Constructive proposal: defends a **communitarian/contextualist epistemology**-judgment is exercised within traditions and practices that provide standards and corrective mechanisms; community rather than atomistic subject furnishes warrant.
 - Practical/political implications: urges cultivated judgment (virtues, ecclesial formation, public argumentation) rather than epistemic triumphalism or withdrawal.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Alasdair MacIntyre, Richard Rorty, Charles Taylor, proponents of Rawlsian public reason, critics of postmodern skepticism, and broader Anglo-American epistemology. Smith draws on both philosophical and theological resources (tradition-critical and ecclesial sources).
- **Doctrines treated:** Less systematic theology than theological epistemology-treats revelation and truth-claims indirectly (how doctrines are known and defended), ecclesiology (community as epistemic locus), ethics (moral judgment), and implications for public theology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Christians must own the contingent, communal character of judgment without surrendering the claim that the gospel provides a truth-constituting formation for life and public reason.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Advocates **committed contextualism**: commitment to truth and normative claims is compatible with robust historicity and local practices of judgment.
 - Recasts the "threat" of relativism as an invitation to sharpen communal standards and practices rather than to retreat to abstract universality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters MacIntyrean nostalgia for pre-modern unity by allowing for plural democratic negotiation of goods; resists Rortyan anti-foundationalism by insisting on accountable communal standards.
 - Corrects Rawlsian public reason readings that demand a metaphysical neutrality he argues is impossible.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Moves beyond the binary of "objectivism vs. relativism" toward language of **situated judgment**, **epistemic practices**, and **tradition-constituted warrant**.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Influential among evangelical and Reformed scholars seeking to navigate postmodern pluralism; often cited in discussions of public theology, Christian higher education, and ecclesial formation.
 - Seen as a stepping stone to Smith's later work on liturgy and formation (showing continuity from epistemology to cultural theology).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a careful way for students to hold together commitment and humility, conviction and civility.
 - Serves as a hermeneutic corrective to both triumphalism and capitulation in public theological engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Relativism:** treated as plural (epistemic, moral, cultural); not dismissed outright but problematized and reinterpreted as indicative of contingency.
- **Objectivism (strong):** critique of the claim to a neutral, God's-eye standpoint in modern epistemology.
- **Committed contextualism:** Smith's preferred posture-truth-commitment located within traditions and communities.
- **Tradition/Community:** primary locus of epistemic warrant and critical testing of claims.
- **Judgment:** the skill/virtue cultivated through practices and communal deliberation; not merely individual inference.
- **Contingency:** the human, historical situatedness of belief and judgment-affirmed, not feared.
- **Epistemic humility:** an attitude cultivated by acknowledging situatedness while still making normative claims.
- **Public reason:** reworked-calls for argument that is genuine and accountable to plural interlocutors without pretending to transcend tradition.
- **Formation/practices:** practices (including ecclesial formation) that shape the dispositions needed for sound judgment.
- **Normativity:** retained through community standards and practices, not through abstract foundations.
- **Particularity vs. universality:** argues for particular, contestable claims that nevertheless can make universal moral and theological assertions via reasoned intercommunity engagement.
- **Corrective mechanisms:** communal critique, dialogical exchange, and practices rather than epistemic infallibility.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theological epistemology courses to move students beyond objectivism/relativism dichotomy.
 - As a **polemic** in public theology to reject both triumphalist and privatist responses to pluralism.
 - As a **model** for integrating ecclesiology and epistemology in seminars on doctrine, ethics, and church formation.
