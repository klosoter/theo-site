### TITLE
**"The Humanity of Christ in the Theology of the Reformation" - Robert Letham (chapter in edited volumes)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written from a late 20th-early 21st century Reformed-Anglican perspective, surveying 16th-century Reformation theology within the longer patristic and Chalcedonian Christological tradition. Addresses debates amid confessionalizing Europe, especially Eucharistic and soteriological controversies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reformation theologians sought to preserve a robust, scriptural account of Christ's true humanity without collapsing it into his divinity; the communicatio idiomatum is the central doctrinal tool but was variably understood and sometimes abused. Letham argues that a properly Chalcedonian appropriation undergirds Reformed Christology and corrects excesses (both Lutheran and radical) while conserving soteriological commitments.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of Chalcedonian baseline: two complete natures, one person (hypostatic union) as the necessary framework for any recovery of the humanity of Christ.
 - Survey of Reformation uses of communicatio idiomatum: how Reformers used the concept to speak of the attribution of properties between natures for soteriological, ecclesial, and sacramental claims.
 - Comparative critique:
 - Luther: emphasis on the genus maiestaticum (elevating the human nature) and its consequences for ubiquity and sacramental presence.
 - Reformed (Calvin, Cranmer, Bucer, Bullinger): insistence on the distinction of natures, caution about divine properties being confined to human nature (anticipating the extra calvinisticum), and stress on the reality of Christ's human experiences (suffering, temptation, growth).
 - Practical implications: atonement (active/passive obedience), the believer's union with Christ, and sacramentology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Chalcedon and patristic witnesses; Luther and Melanchthon; John Calvin; Bucer, Cranmer, Bullinger; later confessional documents (e.g., Augsburg, Helvetic, Articles). Letham also dialogues with medieval scholastic categories (Thomas Aquinas) and modern interpreters where necessary.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union), soteriology (imputation, active and passive obedience), Eucharistic theology, pneumatology (as it bears on union and reception), and doctrinal method (use of Councils and Scripture).
- **Closing line:** The chapter centers on a disciplined Reformation retrieval: affirm Christ's genuine human life and experiences within Chalcedonian boundaries, using communicatio idiomatum to secure communion with God and a coherent soteriology without lapsing into ontological confusion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Letham stresses that for Reformation theology the **humanity of Christ is not a mere addendum** to divinity but essential for atonement, covenant representation, and our union with Christ.
 - He emphasizes a **Chalcedonian-cum-Reformed corrective** to both Lutheran "maiestatical" excesses and radical denials of real human properties.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Critiques the Lutheran tendency to attribute divine omnipresence to Christ's human nature (ubiquity) as risking confusion of natures.
 - Corrects radical Reformed caricatures that underplay the communicatio's genuine soteriological force.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful distinction between different senses of communication (attribution, appropriation, causation) rather than a flat, single notion.
 - Reframes "kenosis" debates by locating human limitations within the economy of the person, not as loss of divinity.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used as a concise, balanced account in teaching Reformation Christology; influential among conservative Anglican and Reformed scholars seeking fidelity to Chalcedon while reading Reformers sympathetically.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to read Reformers theologically rather than polemically; provides a usable framework for addressing Eucharistic, soteriological, and pastoral implications of Christ's humanity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The doctrine that properties of both natures of Christ are attributed to the one person; treated judiciously to avoid confusion of natures.
- **Hypostatic union:** The one personal subsistence of Christ in which two complete natures (divine and human) subsist - the non-negotiable Christological baseline.
- **Genus maiestaticum:** Luther's formulation whereby divine majesty is ascribed to the human nature; Letham critiques its propensity to blur natures.
- **Extra calvinisticum:** The Reformed insistence that the divine nature cannot be exhausted by or confined within the human nature - a boundary against ubiquity claims.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying):** The economic self-limitation of the Son (Philippians 2) discussed as real human limitation without divestment of deity.
- **Active and passive obedience:** Christ's human obedience and suffering as essential to atonement and imputation; communicatio language secures attribution to the believer's standing.
- **Ubiquity / omnipresence:** Debated term in Eucharistic and Christological contexts; Letham warns against attributing divine spatial properties to the human nature.
- **Appropriation (appropriato):** The devotional and theological practice of assigning certain works or attributes to one nature as fitting, while recognizing the personal unity.
- **Personal vs. natural properties:** Distinction stressed to maintain Chalcedon: what belongs to the person (loge) versus what belongs to a nature (physikon).
- **Sacramental presence:** The communicatio is mobilized differently by Lutherans (corporeal presence tendencies) and Reformed (spiritual presence) - Letham articulates conservative Reformed rationale.
- **Patristic retrieval:** Use of Fathers (e.g., Cyril, Leo) to ground Reformation appeals to Chalcedon and avoid novel ontologies.
- **Soteriological pivot:** The humanity of Christ is indispensable for substitution, representative obedience, and union.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for disciplined Reformation readings of communicatio idiomatum and hypostatic union.
 - As a **polemic and corrective** in Eucharistic and kenotic debates - defending Chalcedonian boundaries while affirming real human experience.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 and Passion texts through Reformational categories.
