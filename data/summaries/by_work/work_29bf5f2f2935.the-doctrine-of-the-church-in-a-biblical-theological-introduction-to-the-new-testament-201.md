### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Church - Guy Prentiss Waters, chapter in A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament (2016). 
Tradition: **Reformed / covenantal** ecclesiology; biblical-theological method.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary Reformed biblical-theological introduction to the New Testament (2016). Waters writes from a confessional, covenantal vantage amid renewed evangelical interest in ecclesiology and church order; seeks to bridge NT exegesis and Reformed polity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** The NT presents the church as the covenantal, corporate people of God constituted and ordered by Christ through office, sacrament, and discipline; faithful ecclesiology must follow biblical categories rather than modern individualism or purely voluntarist models.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Definition and biblical metaphors for the church (ekklesia, body, household, temple, pillar and ground).
 - The church's **constitution** in Christ: union with Christ (soteriological basis) grounds corporate life.
 - **Offices and government:** Biblical evidence for elders/pastors and deacons; plurality of elders and eldership as normative; articulation of oversight (presbyterial shape) over against unchecked congregationalism or hierarchical episcopacy.
 - **Sacraments and worship:** Baptism and Lord's Supper as covenant signs/seals, corporate and formative.
 - **Discipline and holiness:** Biblical warrant for corrective discipline as intrinsic to church identity and witness.
 - Eschatological and missional orientation: church as pilgrim community with covenant continuity from Israel.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary engagement with Scripture (Gospels, Acts, Pauline corpus, Pastoral Epistles), dialogue with Reformed confessions (e.g., Westminster), and contemporary evangelical/Reformed interpreters (implicitly Calvin, Vos, Murray, and recent NT scholarship on church office and polity).
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology centrally; with implications for covenant theology, Christology (union with Christ), sacraments, church government (polity), discipline, and mission.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The NT frames the church as Christ-constituted covenant community ordered by offices and covenant rites, morally bounded and disciplinarily sustained - a corporate organism calling for Reformed, presbyterial ordering.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Covenantal framing:** Waters insists on reading NT ecclesiology through covenant categories - the church as continuation/fulfillment of Yahweh's covenant people - rather than merely sociological or institutional models.
- **Priority of union with Christ:** Ecclesial identity derives first from organic union with Christ (soteriological grounding), which then shapes polity, sacraments, and discipline.
- **Polity emphasis:** Strong argument for a **presbyterial** (plural-elder) pattern as the best fit to NT data: elders/pastors (plural oversight), deacons as distinct servant office, and ordered accountability across congregations.
- **Discipline as constitutive:** Formal church discipline is not optional pastoral practice but an essential mark of a covenant community's fidelity and witness.
- **Correctives:** Pushback against contemporary individualism and congregational voluntarism; also careful not to conflate early episcopacy development with later hierarchical models.
- **Reception / influence:** Useful within Reformed and Presbyterian circles as a readable, exegetically-minded articulation of polity and discipline; contributes to teaching ecclesiology in seminaries that emphasize biblical-theological method.
- **Enduring value:** Clear linking of NT texts to Reformed church practice; valuable concise resource for presbyteries, pastors, and advanced students seeking biblical warrant for office and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ekklesia:** NT term for assembly/constituted people; analyzed as covenant congregation called out by Christ.
- **Union with Christ:** The soteriological basis for ecclesial identity and authority.
- **Body of Christ:** Organic metaphor emphasizing interdependence, gifts, and corporate life.
- **Household of God / Temple:** Social-covenantal categories that connect church to Israelic identity and cultic continuity.
- **Elders / Presbyters:** Primary pastoral-oversight office; plurality normative; role in teaching, ruling, shepherding.
 - Contrast: **Elder plurality** vs. singular episcopacy and vs. pure congregational autonomy.
- **Bishops / Episkopoi:** Terminology addressed as functionally equivalent to elders in NT context rather than later monarchical episcopate.
- **Deacons:** Servant office with distinct role, tied to mercy and service, complementary to eldership.
- **Ordination / Laying on of hands:** Rite for instituting officers; ecclesial authorization and sacramental-significance implied.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** Covenant signs and seals; corporate rites that form and mark the covenant people.
- **Discipline:** Process and practice of corrective exclusion/restoration; constitutive for church holiness and witness.
- **Visible / Invisible church:** Implicit Reformed distinction-visible congregation defined by marks (preaching, sacraments, discipline) vs. elect hidden to God.
- **Mark of the church:** Biblical criteria (preaching of Word, faithful sacraments, exercise of discipline) used to identify true churches.
- **Covenant continuity:** Theological thread linking OT Israel and NT church in identity and promise.
- **Presbyterian polity:** Practical outworking of NT patterns in church government, accountable courts, and inter-congregational relations.

How this work is used:
- As an **exegetical-model** for deriving polity from NT texts (esp. Pastoral Epistles, Acts, Pauline letters).
- As a **definition and defense** of Reformed/Presbyterian ordering of offices and the necessity of discipline in pastoral practice.
- As a **teaching resource** in seminary courses on ecclesiology, especially when arguing for covenantal and presbyterial structures.
