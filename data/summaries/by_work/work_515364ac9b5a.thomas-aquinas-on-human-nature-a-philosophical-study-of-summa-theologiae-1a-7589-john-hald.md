### TITLE
Thomas Aquinas on Human Nature: A Philosophical Study of Summa Theologiae 1a 75-89 (ed. John Haldane & Anthony Kenny) - focused study of Aquinas on the psychosomatic unity and powers of the human soul.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Primary text: Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae (First Part, qq. 75-89), composed mid-13th century within Latin Scholasticism and the Aristotelian revival.
 - This volume is a modern philosophical study/edition (Haldane & Kenny as editors) bringing analytic clarity to medieval hylomorphism for contemporary readers.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Aquinas offers a sustained account of human nature as a composite unity of soul (form) and body (matter), answering how an immaterial intellect can be the form of a material body and how personal identity, cognition, and moral agency are grounded.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Establish the soul as a substantial form (hylomorphic thesis): the soul is not an accidental property but the principle that makes the body a living human body.
 - Defend the unity of the human person against dualists and Averroists:
 - The soul is a single form of the whole body (not multiple forms).
 - The soul is the principle of life, operations, and change for the organism.
 - Distinguish faculties: vegetative, sensitive, appetitive, and intellectual - with special treatment of the intellect's immateriality and operations.
 - Treat origin and individuation: the question of ensoulment and whether the soul is directly created by God or transmitted via semen (Aquinas argues for creation by God, with caveats about generation of body).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Aristotle (De Anima) is primary philosophical source; major interlocutors include Augustine, Boethius, Avicenna, Averroes, and contemporary scholastics.
 - Engages later medieval debates (Averroist unity of the intellect, debates on generation and ensoulment).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christian philosophical anthropology (soul, body, image of God implicitly present), epistemology (nature of intellect and senses), moral psychology (appetites, passions, voluntary vs. involuntary), and creation doctrine (divine causation of the soul).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Aquinas's account situates the human person as an irreducible psychosomatic unity: an immaterial intellectual principle that as substantial form grounds bodily life, cognition, moral agency, and divine origination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Hylomorphic unity**: human person = form + matter; no separation of identity into two conflicting substances.
 - **Single substantial form** for the whole body (contrasts with multi-form theories).
 - Sharp **distinction of powers**: intellect (immaterial, universal) vs. sensitive/perceptual faculties (bodily conditions).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Platonizing separability (soul as wholly independent) and rejects Averroist notion of a single shared intellect.
 - Anticipates a robust rebuttal of Cartesian res cogitans/res extensa dualism by emphasizing embodied cognition.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of Aristotelian categories (substance, form, matter, act/potency) to Christian anthropology.
 - Clarifies notions of "principle of operations" and "substantial causality" for persons.
- **Reception & influence**
 - Deep influence on medieval and early modern scholasticism; later resurgence in 20th-21st century via Thomistic revival and analytic Thomism.
 - Reformed theology adopted some Thomistic anthropological insights (psychosomatic unity) but often reinterpreted under different soteriological and covenantal emphases.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a philosophically disciplined theological anthropology that integrates metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics; indispensable for debates on ensoulment, cognitive embodiment, and critiques of dualism/materialism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hylomorphism** - doctrine that beings are composites of matter (materia) and form (forma); central to Aquinas's human ontology.
- **Substantial form** - the soul as that which makes a body a living human substance (not an accidental property).
- **Vegetative, sensitive, intellectual faculties** - hierarchical powers of the soul: growth/nutrition, perception/motion, and intellect/will.
 - Vegetative/sensitive are tied to bodily organs; intellectual is immaterial and capable of universal cognition.
- **Agent intellect / passive intellect** - Aquinas's analysis of cognitive structure: the agent intellect makes intelligible forms present to the passive intellect.
- **Principle of operations** - the soul as the causal principle actualizing bodily operations (life, sensation, voluntary action).
- **Psychosomatic unity** - the philosophical-theological claim that human persons are unified body-soul composites.
- **Ensoulment / creation of the soul** - doctrine that individual rational souls are created by God (Aquinas affirms creation by God for each soul).
- **Individuation** - the account of what makes each human numerically distinct (matter plus form and divine causal ordering).
- **Appetites & passions** - internal movements motivated by sensation and reason, relevant for moral responsibility.
- **Substantial causality** - the form's causal role in making a thing what it is (distinct from accidental causation).
- **Embodied cognition** - Aquinas's implicit precursor to contemporary discussions: intellect depends on bodily senses for material knowledge while remaining immaterial in operation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** in philosophical theology and classical theism for what constitutes a human person.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Cartesian dualism, modern reductionism, and Averroist monopsychism.
 - As an **exegetical/anthropological model** in systematic theology and ethics for integrating doctrine of creation, imago Dei, and moral agency.
