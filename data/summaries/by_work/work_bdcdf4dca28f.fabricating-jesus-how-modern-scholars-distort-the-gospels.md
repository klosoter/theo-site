### TITLE
Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels - Craig A. Evans

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century response within conservative-evangelical New Testament scholarship to trends in historical-Jesus studies that emphasize skepticism, mythicist claims, or reconstruction of a non-messianic Jesus.
 - Part of a broader apologetic and methodological corrective to popular critical voices (mythicists, radical form-critics, and some literary deconstructionists).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Modern scholarship often "fabricates" portrait(s) of Jesus by imposing methodological biases or discarding competent historical evidence; sound historical method recovers a Jesus with genuine messianic consciousness who proclaimed and embodied the Kingdom of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates methodological failures in prominent skeptical reconstructions (selective use of criteria, wholesale dismissal of Gospel testimony).
 - Reasserts the credibility of Gospel testimony through:
 - careful textual and historical critique,
 - appeal to standard criteria of historical authenticity (e.g., multiple attestation, embarrassment),
 - situating Jesus within first-century Jewish apocalyptic and messianic frameworks.
 - Argues that Jesus' self-understanding and proclamation of the Kingdom are historically plausible and central to the evangelists' accounts.
 - Exposes contemporary mythicist and radical-critical positions as motivated by philosophical presuppositions rather than neutral evidence assessment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Targets a range of modern scholars and popularizers (mythicists and radical critics) who deny Gospel historicity or argue for a radically different Jesus.
 - Employs canonical Gospels, Jewish background literature, and mainstream historical-critical tools.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (historical self-awareness of Jesus; relation of the Jesus of history to the Christ of faith).
 - **Revelation and inspiration** (indirectly, via defense of Gospel reliability).
 - **Eschatology / Kingdom of God** (Jesus' proclamation as historically grounded).
 - **Hermeneutics and historical method** (criteria for authenticity; epistemic limits of reconstruction).

- **Closing line**
 - Evans' theological center of gravity: a historically grounded, Jewish-contexted Jesus who self-consciously proclaimed the Kingdom and bears continuity with the Christ confessed by the church, defended against modern scholarly distortions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that New Testament testimony should be treated as historically competent unless cogent reasons for rejection exist.
 - Emphasizes Jewish apocalyptic and messianic contexts to resist privatized, modern reconstructions of Jesus.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on radical form-criticism, mythicism, and minimalist reconstructions that detach Jesus from messianic consciousness.
 - Contrasts with scholars who prioritize literary or sociological reading over historical plausibility.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses the term **"fabricating"** as polemical framing: not mere error but methodologically induced re-creation of Jesus.
 - Reclaims classical historical-criteria language against their perceived misuse or neglect.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative and evangelical circles as a clear rebuttal to mythicist and radical-critical claims.
 - Criticized by more skeptical scholars for perceived apologetic priorities and for underappreciating complexities in historical methodology.
 - Influential as a classroom and popular-level corrective; less influential for those committed to programmatic critical revisions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for defenders of traditional Christology, courses on historical Jesus, and pastors confronting popular skepticism.
 - Serves as a concise methodological primer advocating responsible use of historical criteria and Jewish contextualization.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fabrication**
 - Polemical label for reconstructions of Jesus that, according to Evans, impose modern presuppositions and discard credible data.

- **Historical Jesus vs. Christ of Faith**
 - Evans argues for continuity: sound historical method supports the basic contours of the Christ confessed by the church.

- **Messianic consciousness**
 - Central claim: Jesus had some form of self-awareness consistent with Jewish messianic expectations; not a later ecclesial projection.

- **Kingdom of God**
 - Portrayed as Jesus' core proclamation; historically embedded in Jewish apocalyptic hopes and prophetic renewal language.

- **Criteria of authenticity**
 - Reaffirms multiple attestation, embarrassment, coherence, and contextual credibility; criticizes selective or inconsistent application.

- **Jewish apocalyptic context**
 - Frames Jesus' sayings and actions within first-century Jewish eschatological hope and messianic expectations.

- **Mythicists / radical skepticism**
 - Targeted interlocutors who deny Jesus' historicity or essential Gospel claims; Evans documents methodological flaws.

- **Oral tradition and transmission**
 - Defends the reliability of early oral streams and the competence of Gospel evangelists to preserve historical memory.

- **Gospel reliability**
 - Argues for prima facie trustworthiness of the evangelists absent strong counter-evidence.

- **Historical method / hermeneutics**
 - Emphasizes disciplined, modest historical reasoning over speculative reconstructions.

- **Apologetics**
 - The work functions overtly as apologetic; methodology serves theological defense.

- **Apocalyptic eschatology**
 - Connects Jesus' Kingdom language to imminent eschatological expectation in Judaism.

- **Text-critical concerns**
 - Notes textual stability sufficient for historical claims despite minor variant readings.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against mythicism and radical-critical portrayals of Jesus.
- As an **exegetical model** for arguing that Gospel data support Jesus' messianic consciousness and Kingdom proclamation.
- As a **methodological primer** in NT courses advocating disciplined use of authenticity criteria.
- As a **definition source** for conservatives seeking to articulate continuity between historical Jesus research and confessional Christology.
