### TITLE
Sin and Salvation in Christian Counseling (journal articles) - Anthony Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu engaging the rise of professional psychotherapy and emergent Christian counseling movements. Hoekema writes as a systematic and pastoral theologian addressing how biblical doctrine should shape counseling practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian counseling must be grounded first in the biblical doctrine of the Fall and its consequences; without a robust account of sin, counseling either secularizes Christian care or reduces the gospel to therapeutic technique.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose: modern counseling often misreads human problems as primarily psychological dysfunctions rather than primarily moral and relational ruptures resulting from the Fall.
 - Theological anthropology: humans are created in the Imago Dei, corrupted by original sin; sin is both guilt (legal alienation) and power (corrupt inclinations affecting personality, will, and relationships).
 - Pastoral response: effective Christian counseling integrates proclamation of gospel (justification, forgiveness) with Spirit-enabled sanctification (progressive mortification of sin, renewal of mind and will).
 - Practical integration: pastors and counselors should employ psychological insights where compatible, but always subordinate them to Scripture's categories (repentance, faith, grace).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** secular psychology and psychiatry (behavioral, psychoanalytic tendencies), contemporary Christian counseling leaders and critics (representative debates between integrationists and strictly theological/pastoral approaches), and classic Reformed sources on sin and grace.
- **Doctrines treated:** The Fall and original sin, human nature and the Imago Dei, conscience and moral responsibility, Christology and atonement (as grounds for forgiveness), justification and sanctification, work of the Holy Spirit, pastoral theology and ethics.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Sound Christian counseling must begin with a theological diagnosis of sin and conclude with the gospel of Christ as the only sufficient remedy for the sinner's alienation and corruption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emphasizes a dual-aspect view of sin: not merely an act or a set of symptoms but a pervasive condition affecting will, faculties, and relationships.
 - Stresses the primacy of covenantal and forensic categories (guilt, imputation, justification) alongside therapeutic categories (healing, growth).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against therapeutic relativism that minimizes moral culpability and gospel proclamation.
 - Critiques strict anti-psychologizing pietism that rejects all psychological insight; Hoekema allows for disciplined use of psychology under theological supervision.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear articulation of sin as both "power" and "guilt" used as an organizing framework for pastoral diagnosis and treatment.
 - Integration model that places Scripture as the governing norm and psychology as a subsidiary tool.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed seminary instruction on pastoral care and counselor training as a balanced corrective between reductive psychology and anti-psychological pietism.
 - Influenced subsequent evangelical efforts to define faithful integration of theology and counseling; often cited in curricula that require theological grounding for clinical practice.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise theological framework for diagnosing human problems in counseling.
 - Offers a durable bridge between doctrine (Fall, atonement, sanctification) and pastoral praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The Fall:** foundational event explaining radical disruption of created order and human relationship with God.
- **Original sin:** inherited corruption affecting will, understanding, and affections; grounds for pastoral realism.
- **Total depravity (functional):** practical impairment of all faculties - not absolute inability but pervasive corruption relevant to counseling expectations.
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** basis for human dignity and the possibility of restoration; counseling must respect restored personhood in Christ.
- **Guilt vs. Power:** sin as legal alienation (guilt) and as corrupting influence (power) - both require distinct pastoral responses (forgiveness and sanctification).
- **Repentance:** turning of will; primary goal and measurable movement in counseling.
- **Conversion:** decisive, Spirit-wrought reorientation; gospel proclamation is counseling's center.
- **Justification:** forensic declaration that removes guilt; counseling must root assurance here, not mere behavioral change.
- **Sanctification:** progressive healing and renewal; counseling contributes by encouraging practices of mortification and renewal of mind.
- **Grace:** enabling reality that grounds both forgiveness and moral transformation.
- **Conscience:** exercised and educated through Scripture and pastoral ministry; distinguishes moral culpability from clinical pathology.
- **Counseling integration:** disciplined use of psychological tools under theological governance.
- **Moral responsibility:** maintained against deterministic interpretations of psychology or environment.
- **Therapeutic common grace:** psychological findings may aid pastoral care but never supplant the gospel.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** in pastoral theology and counseling courses for the doctrine of sin applied to practice.
 - As a **polemic** against therapeutic moralism and secular reductionism in counseling.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for translating doctrines of fall, atonement, and sanctification into counseling goals and methods.
