### TITLE
Popular Lectures on Theological Themes - A. A. Hodge 
(mid‑ to late‑19th century Princeton/Old School Presbyterian context; popularized lectures treating central Reformed doctrines, notably **Total Depravity** and **Total Inability**)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Delivered and published within the Princeton theological milieu (son of Charles Hodge; representative of Old School Presbyterian, classical Reformed theology).
 - Aimed at a broad Protestant audience: didactic, pastoral, corrective to revivalistic and Arminian readings common in 19th‑century America.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Humans, by virtue of the Fall, are radically corrupt in all faculties; therefore they possess no spiritual ability to turn to God apart from sovereign, regenerating grace.
 - Teaches that responsibility and reprobation coexist with inability: moral blame remains although ability to do saving good is lacking.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis (chiefly Pauline anthropology and Johannine soteriology) establishes the depth of sin.
 - Philosophical and theological analysis distinguishing kinds of ability (natural, moral, physical).
 - Historical‑theological refutation of Pelagianism, Semi‑Pelagianism, and Arminian notions of prevenient grace as enabling.
 - Pastoral application: evangelism, assurance, and the ministers' dependence on means of grace plus divine sovereignty.
 - Concluding appeal to Reformed confessions and to the necessity of sovereign regeneration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Augustine and Calvin for classic formulations; engages contemporary American revivalists, Arminians, and rationalist critics.
 - Draws on systematic categories familiar to Princeton: sin, depravity, regeneration, and election.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Human nature and sin (original sin, corruption)
 - Grace and regeneration (sovereign effectual calling)
 - Free will / ability (natural vs. moral ability)
 - Means of grace, responsibility, and assurance of salvation
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The work centers on the claim that salvation is dependent upon sovereign grace because fallen human nature is wholly unable to perform saving spiritual good.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Precise distinctions about "ability"**
 - Hodge carefully separates types of ability: natural power (capacity), moral ability (inclination/willingness), and physical/psychological capability - insisting fallen humans retain natural faculties but lack moral ability to will spiritual good.
- **Pastoral‑popular tone with rigorous theological framing**
 - Unlike purely polemical treatises, the lectures combine pastoral application with technical care, making dense doctrines accessible without sacrificial clarity.
- **Correction of common misunderstandings**
 - Emphasizes that "total" in total depravity refers to the extent of corruption, not that every act is as evil as possible; "inability" does not negate responsibility.
- **Contrast with predecessors and rivals**
 - Opposes both Pelagian optimism and a softened Arminianism that attributes morally enabling prevenient grace to the unregenerate.
 - Distinguishes itself from "hyper‑deterministic" caricatures by affirming human accountability and the real operations of means.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in American Reformed and Presbyterian circles; used pedagogically in seminaries and churches to defend classic Calvinism.
 - Criticized by Arminian theologians and some revivalists for perceived determinism; nevertheless respected for clarity and pastoral utility.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful definitional work and pastoral application; still valuable for teaching the interplay of sin, grace, and human responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity** - the pervasive corruption of all human faculties by the Fall; not total in every action but total in extent.
- **Total Inability** - the inability of unregenerate humans to perform saving spiritual good or to come to God without divine regeneration.
- **Natural Ability** - retained capacities (intellect, will as power) that enable non‑spiritual actions.
- **Moral Ability** - the disposition or inclination to do morally good (absent in the unregenerate for spiritual good).
- **Regeneration** - sovereign, efficacious act of the Holy Spirit that creates new spiritual life and enables faith.
- **Sovereign Grace (Effectual Calling)** - divine initiative that overcomes total inability and results in salvation.
- **Means of Grace** - ordained instruments (Word, sacraments, prayer) which God uses in effecting salvation - not merely contingent human methods.
- **Responsibility** - moral accountability of sinners despite inability; Hodge insists inability does not excuse guilt.
- **Original Sin** - inherited corruption and guilt affecting all humans as descendants of Adam.
- **Prevenient Grace** - (as critiqued) the Arminian idea of enabling grace prior to regeneration; Hodge resists this as insufficient to produce saving faith.
- **Free Will** - discussed in relational terms: will is real but bound by sinful affections until liberated by grace.
- **Conversion** - comprehensive change involving repentance and faith produced by regeneration, not by mere human decision.
- **Assurance** - pastoral consequence: assurance rests in God's works (regeneration, Christ's atonement), not in unaided moral effort.
- **Civil vs. Spiritual Good** - fallen persons can do civilly good acts, but cannot do spiritual good that results in salvation.
- **Means vs. Merit** - Hodge stresses means are instrumental and God's grace is the only meritorious cause.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for classical Reformed formulations of depravity and inability.
 - As a **polemic** against Arminian/prevenient‑grace models and revivalist voluntarism.
 - As an **exegetical/pedagogical model** for reading Pauline anthropology (esp. Romans/Ephesians) and for applying doctrine to pastoral ministry.
