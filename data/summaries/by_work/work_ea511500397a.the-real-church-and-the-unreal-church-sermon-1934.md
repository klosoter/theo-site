### TITLE
"The Real Church and the Unreal Church" (Sermon, 1934) - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Delivered and published in 1934 amid the rise of National Socialism in Germany and the concurrent ecclesial crisis.
 - Barth centrally involved in the Confessing Church movement and the drafting milieu of the Barmen Declaration (1934); sermon functions as ecclesial response to politicization of the church.
 - Theological milieu: Barthian dialectical theology resisting liberal accommodation, insistence on the Word-event and Christocentric revelation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church's identity is not determined by social position, political power, or cultural conformity but by its fidelity to the Word and person of Jesus Christ; where the church substitutes human power, it becomes an "unreal" church and, in effect, a locus of the Antichrist/man of lawlessness.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary churches that align with state ideology or human wisdom have ceased to be the true Church.
 - The criterion: The Word of God and the presence of the crucified and risen Christ as authoritative and constitutive for the church.
 - Polemic: Exposes the "unreal church" as idolatrous, self-justifying, and legally bound to worldly law rather than divine command.
 - Ethical-eschatological consequence: The true church must witness against the false and await Christ's sovereignty, resisting lawlessness in whatever guise.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture (implicitly Pauline eschatology and Johannine/Pauline Christology), contemporary German "German Christian" movement and church leaders who capitulate to Nazism, and the broader liberal theological tradition Barth opposes.
 - Implicit interlocutors include liberal ecclesiology and politico-ecclesial ideologies that conflate nation and church.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology**: definition of true church as community called by and subject to the Word.
 - **Revelation/Christology**: Christ as the decisive, present Word-event ruling the church.
 - **Eschatology**: present reality of antichristian forces; "man of lawlessness" as embodied in worldly church-power.
 - **Authority and law**: contrast between divine command and human legalism/idolatry.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically: the church is real only where Christ's Word has sovereign rule; wherever the church bows to human power it becomes unreal - a present manifestation of antichristian lawlessness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Barth reframes ecclesial authenticity in terms of the **Word-event**: the church is not an institution that merely receives doctrine but a community constituted continuously by Christ's addressing Word.
 - Strong insistence that the threat of the Antichrist is not merely future eschaton but a present ecclesial reality when the church usurps Christ's lordship.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects liberal theology's cultural accommodation by reasserting the discontinuity between divine revelation and human culture.
 - Contrasts with any ecclesiology that grounds the church in nationality, polity, or social service rather than in Christ's authoritative Word.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The pair "real church" vs "unreal church" as a theological diagnostic tool to name ecclesial fidelity vs idolatry.
 - Reading Pauline "man of lawlessness" language as a hermeneutic for ecclesial critique in present history.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in framing the Confessing Church's stance and the theological rhetoric of the Barmen Declaration.
 - Influenced later political theology and ecclesiology, especially debates on church-state relations and the church's prophetic role.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a sharp, usable model for diagnosing ecclesial compromise and for teaching the primacy of Word-Christology in ecclesiology.
 - Remains a resource for pastors and theologians resisting conflation of gospel and political ideology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Real Church**
 - Church constituted and governed by the living Word and presence of Christ; faithful, confessing community.

- **Unreal Church**
 - Church that has substituted worldly power, ideology, or law for the Word; effectively functions as antichristian.

- **Word of God / Word-event**
 - Revelation as active, decisive address of God in Christ that forms and judges the church.

- **Christ as Lord**
 - Central Christological claim: Christ's exclusive lordship is the test of ecclesial reality.

- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness**
 - Interpreted as present whenever the church turns from Christ to worldly rule, manifesting lawlessness against divine command.

- **Idolatry (ecclesial)**
 - The replacement of divine authority with nation, race, or political ideology as the church's guiding principle.

- **Confessing Church / Barmen context**
 - Historical locus for Barth's sermon; exemplifies real church resisting state-capturing of ecclesial identity.

- **Law vs Gospel**
 - The church must not convert the Gospel into human law; lawlessness appears when human law supplants Gospel authority.

- **Election and calling**
 - The church exists by divine calling; human self-legitimation discloses unrealness.

- **Prophetic witness**
 - The church's vocation to confront falsehood where institutions claim authority over Christ.

- **Political theology**
 - Barth's sermon is a formative text for a theology that opposes sacramentalization of the state.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and historical-theological witness against church complicity with oppressive regimes.
- As an **ecclesiological definition source** emphasizing Word-Christology as the criterion of church authenticity.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline eschatological warnings (Antichrist/man of lawlessness) as concrete institutional critique rather than only distant prophecy.
