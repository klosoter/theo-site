### TITLE
**The Problem of Evil in Reformed Orthodoxy** - Richard A. Muller (in The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-17th century Reformed scholasticism framed by post-Reformation confessional controversies (Calvinist orthodoxy confronting Arminianism, Jesuit Molinism, and Catholic scholasticism).
 - Muller's essay surveys this scholastic-reformed milieu and its theological vocabulary for treating divine foreknowledge, providence, and evil.
- **Central thesis**
 - Reformed orthodoxy resolves the apparent tension between divine sovereignty and the existence of evil by distinguishing metaphysical causation from moral authorship: God is the sovereign first cause who ordains and concurs in all that happens without being the moral author of sin.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses the problem as threefold: how God foreknows evil, how God providentially governs events, and how God may be sovereign without culpably causing sin.
 - Reconstructs the scholastic conceptual toolkit used by Reformed theologians:
 - **Decretive vs. permissive/ordinative will** - God's absolute decree versus his permissive allowance.
 - **Primary (first) causality and secondary causes** - creatures are genuine causes; God ordains their causal agency.
 - **Concurrence** - God's cooperation with created causes is real but nonculpable.
 - **Predestination and reprobation** - distinction between ordaining ends and permitting means that include sinful acts.
 - Deploys case studies of key Reformed authors to show continuity with Calvin and refinement in scholastic formulations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Calvin as foundational exemplar; Reformed scholastics (Ames, Turretin, Voetius, Witsius, others); opponents include Arminians and Jesuit Molinists; engagement with Augustinian and late-medieval categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine foreknowledge** (certainty of future contingents under divine decree)
 - **Providence** (governing concurrence and governance)
 - **Predestination/reprobation** (logical relation to the permission of sin)
 - Relatedly: theology of freedom, causation, and theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - Reformed orthodoxy seeks to preserve uncompromised divine sovereignty and meticulous moral culpability by deploying scholastic distinctions that make God the ultimate ordainer of history while denying him the role of moral author of sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in causal language: careful use of scholastic causal categories to avoid facile determinism while affirming God's meticulous governance.
 - Stress on the coherence of foreknowledge and decretive will - God's knowledge is grounded in his decree, not vice versa.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that equate Reformed orthodoxy with mechanical fatalism; shows deliberate compatibilist anthropology that upholds genuine responsibility.
 - Contrasts with Molinist attempts to preserve libertarian contingency (middle knowledge) by showing Reformed rejection of middle knowledge as foreign to its theological commitments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reformed theologians refined distinctions between **decretive (absolute) will** and **preceptive/ordinative will**, and sharpened notions of **concurrence** (concurrence causalis vs. concurrence permissiva).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Muller's reconstruction has influenced both historians and systematicians by rehabilitating Reformed scholasticism as a coherent, nuanced theodicy resource rather than sterile formalism.
 - Used as a corrective against revisionist narratives that downplay the intellectual sophistication of post-Reformation Reformed theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust conceptual repertoire for contemporary Reformed theodicy, showing how classical distinctions can still address modern formulations of the problem of evil.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Providence**
 - God's sustaining and governing action that includes ordaining, permitting, and concurring with creaturely causes.
- **Divine foreknowledge**
 - God's infallible knowledge of future contingents; in Reformed orthodoxy tied to the decree rather than to a prior contingent knowledge.
- **Decretive will (will of decree)**
 - God's sovereign, efficacious will by which he ordains all that comes to pass.
- **Permissive will (will of permission)**
 - God's allowing of creaturely choices and events without being the moral author of the evil those choices entail.
- **Concurrence**
 - Doctrine that God cooperates with secondary causes so their effects obtain; formulated to avoid making God the moral cause of sin.
- **Primary/First cause vs. secondary causes**
 - God as primary cause who ordains and upholds; creatures as genuine secondary causes with morally significant agency.
- **Predestination / reprobation**
 - Eternal decrees concerning election and reprobation; discussed in relation to whether God ordains sin or only permits it for ordained ends.
- **Moral authorship**
 - The attribution of moral responsibility; Reformed orthodoxy insists moral authorship lies with the creature, not God.
- **Compatibilist freedom**
 - Human freedom compatible with divine determinative sovereignty; central to Reformed ethics and responsibility.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism)**
 - Presented as a rival account; repudiated by Reformed orthodoxy because it undermines decretive sovereignty.
- **Causal responsibility vs. moral responsibility**
 - Reformed scholastics distinguish causal ordering from moral culpability to defuse the charge that God is the author of sin.
- **Order of decrees (logical/eternal)**
 - Decrees are logically ordered (not temporally) and provide the framework for foreknowledge and providential ordering.
- **Theodicy (Reformed approach)**
 - Emphasizes divine sovereignty, creaturely culpability, and a teleology in which God brings greater good from permitted evil.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed accounts of providence, foreknowledge, and human freedom.
- As a **polemic** against Molinist and Arminian alternatives, clarifying why Reformed orthodoxy rejected middle knowledge.
- As an **exegetical-model** resource for reading Calvin and later scholastics on theodicy and divine causation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary theodical debates seeking resources from historical Reformed thought.
