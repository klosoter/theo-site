### TITLE
**Excusing Sinners and Blaming God: A Response to the Problem of Divine Determinism** - Guillaume Bignon

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-theological engagement (late 20th-21st century context); situated within Reformed/Calvinist debates over providence and freedom.
 - Interfaces with the philosophy of action, free will literature, and evangelical systematic theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Tackles the charge that *divine determinism* (God's exhaustive decree of all events) either (a) excuses moral agents of blame (they are not properly responsible) or (b) renders God blameworthy for evil. Bignon defends a theologically robust divine determinism while preserving genuine human moral responsibility and divine justice.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Stage 1: Clarify terms - distinguishes *causal determinism*, *theistic determinism* (divine decree), and varieties of freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist).
 - Stage 2: Diagnose the "excusing/blaming" dilemma - demonstrates where critics conflate causal provenance with moral responsibility and where theists misstate the implications of decrees.
 - Stage 3: Offer a compatibilist account of moral responsibility adapted to divine sovereignty:
 - Moral responsibility grounded in agents' internal states (desires, reasons, character) and their normal capacities to respond - not in metaphysical indeterminacy of action.
 - Distinguish *explanatory responsibility* (God as causa causans and ultimate ground) from *moral blameworthiness* (attributable to the creature because of volitional endorsement of motives).
 - Stage 4: Theodical and pastoral closure - situates evil under God's economy (permission, instrumental purposes, and just retribution/atonement) to avoid imputing blame to God while upholding divine justice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical Reformed voices (Augustine, Calvin, Edwards), contemporary compatibilists (e.g., John Frame-style Reformed compatibilism), and the philosophy-of-religion literature (critics from libertarian camp: Peter van Inwagen-type intuitions; Molinists and some analytic philosophers such as Alvin Plantinga's broader work on providence).
 - Dialogues with theodical literature on providence and moral responsibility.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence and Divine Decree, Freedom and Responsibility, Sin and Guilt, Atonement and Forgiveness, Divine Justice, Theodicy, Sovereignty vs. Human Agency.

- **Closing line**
 - Bignon's theological center of gravity: **divine determinism and authentic human culpability are compatible because moral blameworthiness rests on creaturely endorsement and responsibility, not on metaphysical openness of outcomes.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between *ontological causation* (God as primary cause) and *moral agency* (creatures as proximate agents) to defuse the "blaming God" intuition.
 - Prioritizes a theological account of *reasons-responsiveness* that is framed in doctrinal categories (sinful will, depravity, prevenient grace) rather than purely philosophical semantics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects libertarian critiques that presuppose a necessary link between alternative possibilities and moral blame; rejects the view that only uncaused choices ground blame.
 - Contrasts with Molinist attempts to preserve libertarian freedom via middle knowledge; Bignon argues middle knowledge is unnecessary and theologically problematic for divine authorship.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the pair: **explanatory authorship** (God's role in causation) vs **moral culpability** (creaturely endorsement) as a controlling conceptual frame.
 - Advocates a calibrated notion of "could-have-done-other-wise" compatible with determinism (a counterfactual rooted in character and motives).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful within Reformed academic circles defending double-predestination-adjacent views and pastors seeking resources for preaching on providence and guilt.
 - Cites moderately among analytic theologians addressing responsibility under divine sovereignty; less traction with libertarian or Molinist audiences.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically integrated model for defending divine determinism without collapsing into theological fatalism or moral nihilism.
 - Valuable as a pedagogical bridge between systematic theology and analytic philosophy of action.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine determinism** - The doctrine that God's decree is causally efficacious for all events; Bignon reads this in traditional Reformed terms.
- **Compatibilist freedom** - Freedom compatible with determinism; construed as actions issuing from one's settled will and reasons-responsiveness.
- **Libertarian freedom** - The opposing view that genuine freedom requires indeterministic alternatives; treated as critique Bignon answers.
- **Explanatory authorship** - God as ultimate cause or ground of being and events; distinguished from moral responsibility.
- **Moral culpability (blameworthiness)** - Attributed to creatures when actions flow from their endorsing wills and volitional character.
- **Permission vs. decree** - Distinguishes God's permissive will (allows evil for purposes) from efficacious decrees.
- **Reasons-responsiveness** - Agents' capacity to act for reasons; central criterion for responsibility in Bignon's account.
- **Counterfactuals of character** - "Could-have-done-other-wise" defined via a counterfactual dependence on character and motives, not indeterministic metaphysics.
- **Theodicy and divine justice** - Framework explaining how God remains just despite being the ultimate cause of a world containing evil.
- **Agent-proximate causation** - Humans as proximate causes whose mental states are the immediate explanations of actions.
- **Prevenient and common grace** - Pastoral-theological resources to explain responsibility and natural goodness within a deterministic economy.
- **Atonement's role** - Atonement as vindication of divine justice and as addressing creaturely culpability without shifting ultimate blame to God.
- **Blame-transfer fallacy** - The mistaken inference that divine causation of an event entails divine moral culpability for the creature's sin.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for a Reformed compatibilist account of providence and responsibility.
- As a **polemic** against libertarianism and Molinism in debates over free will and divine sovereignty.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** for preaching and pastoral counseling on guilt, providence, and repentance.
