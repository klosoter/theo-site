### TITLE
The Human Being: A Theological Anthropology - Hans Schwarz

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Protestant (largely Lutheran) theological scholarship engaging post-Enlightenment philosophy, modern science, and ecumenical doctrinal traditions. Written as a synthetic, classroom-ready treatment responding to both historical dogmatics and contemporary cultural critique.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Human identity can only be properly understood theologically as created, embodied, relational, sinful, redeemed, and eschatologically oriented; any adequate anthropology must integrate biblical-theological claims (creation, fall, incarnation, eschaton) with insights from history of doctrine and contemporary thought.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Methodological opening: the legitimacy and limits of doing systematic theological anthropology in conversation with Scripture, tradition, philosophy, and the empirical sciences.
 - Biblical foundations: Genesis (imago Dei), Psalms and wisdom literature, New Testament (Pauline, Johannine, incarnational emphases).
 - History of doctrine: patristic personhood, medieval hylomorphism, Reformation emphases (Lutheran and Calvinist), modern critiques (Enlightenment, existentialism).
 - Contemporary issues: body-soul relation, freedom and determinism, conscience, personality and personhood, sociality, technology and bioethics.
 - Soteriological and eschatological horizons: incarnation as corrective to dualism; redemption and resurrection as the goal of human existence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer; modern philosophers and thinkers such as Descartes, Hegel, Heidegger, and contemporary discussions in phenomenology and analytic philosophy; dialogue with empirical disciplines (psychology, neuroscience, sociology) where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation (imago Dei), Trinity as interpretive horizon for personhood, sin (original and personal), Christology (incarnation and its anthropological implications), grace and sanctification, ecclesiology (humanity as corporate), sacraments (embodiment), eschatology (resurrection, consummation).
- **Closing line:** Schwarz presents a holistic theological anthropology that refuses both ancient dualisms and modern reductionisms by grounding human identity in the triune God's creative, incarnatory, redeeming, and eschatological work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the **imago Dei** must be read trinitarianly and christologically - human relationality and personhood reflect divine relationality and are realized in Christ.
 - Balanced rejection of both Platonic/Cartesian dualism and modern materialist reductionism; emphasis on **embodied personhood** and historical situatedness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Enlightenment individualism by stressing social and ecclesial dimensions of personhood.
 - Counters purely existentialist accounts of human meaning that ignore objective theological claims about creation and redemption.
 - Challenges reductionist readings from some contemporary neuroscience by arguing that empirical descriptions cannot exhaust theological categories like soul, conscience, and vocation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses terms such as **constitutive sociality**, **relational personhood**, and **eschatological orientation** to unite classical doctrine with modern concerns.
 - Frames vocation and work as intrinsic to the imago Dei rather than merely instrumental.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted widely as a clear, ecumenical textbook in European and North American Protestant seminaries; valued for bridging dogmatics and practical ethics.
 - Influential among those seeking a confessional yet dialogical anthropology; less polemical than Barthian or radical Protestant alternatives, hence accessible across traditions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact, systematic orientation to theological anthropology that integrates Scripture, tradition, and contemporary thought; particularly useful for courses linking doctrine, ethics, and pastoral concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei:** Human beings made in the image of God - relational, responsible, vocational; read trinitarianly and christologically.
- **Embodied personhood:** Rejection of soul-body dichotomy; persons are historical, bodily agents.
- **Relational personhood:** Persons constituted by relations (God, neighbor, community), not isolated subjects.
- **Constitutive sociality:** Sociality is intrinsic to human nature, not merely an accidental feature.
- **Eschatological orientation:** Present human identity is shaped by future consummation (resurrection, new creation).
- **Sin (personal and structural):** Both individual moral failure and communal/structural distortions of creation.
- **Incarnation as anthropological key:** Christology redefines human dignity and destiny; incarnation corrects dualism and secures human worth.
- **Freedom and responsibility:** Freedom is real but bounded by finitude and sin; freedom grounded in vocation and grace.
- **Vocation and work:** Human labor as participation in divine creational stewardship, integral to human flourishing.
- **Conscience and moral knowledge:** Conscience is theologically mediated, shaped by revelation and tradition alongside reason.
- **Holistic soteriology:** Redemption addresses whole person - body, mind, will, social relations.
- **Dialectic of nature and grace:** Nature not opposed to grace; grace heals and elevates created structures.
- **Dialogue with sciences:** Empirical findings inform but do not determine theological categories.
- **Historical theology as resource:** Tradition (Patristic, medieval, Reformation) provides corrective categories to contemporary distortions.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for imago Dei and embodied, relational personhood in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist materialism and unchecked individualism in ethics and bioethics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology to practical concerns (vocation, social justice, pastoral care).
