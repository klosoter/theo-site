### TITLE
**Natural Theology: A Reader** (eds. William Lane Craig, J. P. Moreland)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Emerges within the late-20th/early-21st c. revival of analytic philosophy of religion and evangelical apologetics.
 - Pushback against mid-century positivism and post-Barthian suspicion of natural theology; retrieval of classical sources through contemporary analytic tools.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Can reason, independent of special revelation, furnish rational warrant for theism and certain divine attributes? The volume curates pro and con texts to display the range, power, and limits of natural theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method and epistemology: faith and reason, evidentialism vs. properly basic belief, defeaters.
 - Classical arguments:
 - Cosmological: kalam (temporal beginning), Leibnizian contingency (sufficient reason), Thomistic (act/potency, causal series).
 - Teleological: design-regularity, fine-tuning assessments.
 - Ontological: Anselmian and modal reformulations.
 - Moral: objective moral values/duties pointing to a personal Lawgiver.
 - Consciousness and reason: irreducibility and intentionality as theistic evidence.
 - Religious experience: doxastic practices and prima facie justification.
 - Objections and replies: Humean critiques, Kantian limits, problem of evil, divine hiddenness, probabilistic underdetermination.
 - Inferential strategies: Bayesian confirmation, cumulative-case reasoning, explanatory virtues.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Classical: Plato/Aristotle (causality, teleology), Anselm, Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Leibniz, Samuel Clarke, Paley, Butler.
 - Critics: Hume, Kant; modern/analytic critics such as J. L. Mackie, William Rowe, Paul Draper, J. Howard Sobel.
 - Contemporary defenders: Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne, William Lane Craig, J. P. Moreland, Robin Collins, Robert Adams, William Alston.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), creation and providence, doctrine of God (aseity, necessary being, intelligence, goodness), anthropology (rational and moral faculties), evil and theodicy, miracles/nature order.
- **Closing line**
 - The reader contends that a suite of convergent, probabilistic arguments grounded in the world's intelligibility provides significant rational support for theism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Side-by-side curation of historical classics with rigorously formulated analytic reconstructions and replies.
 - Prominent use of Bayesian confirmation and cumulative-case strategy rather than a single knockdown proof.
 - Inclusion of newer lines (fine-tuning, consciousness) alongside revived classical forms.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters neo-orthodox and fideist skepticism by rehabilitating natural reason's theistic reach.
 - Updates cosmological and teleological arguments with contemporary cosmology and philosophy of science.
 - Nuances evidentialism by engaging Reformed epistemology (proper basicality) without abandoning arguments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Modal and probabilistic reformulations of traditional arguments.
 - Distinction between metaphysical and scientific cosmological premises; use of likelihood ratios for design.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in philosophy of religion and apologetics courses; a standard gateway anthology.
 - Mixed within Reformed circles: appreciated by classical theists; queried by presuppositionalists wary of autonomous reason.
 - Contributed to normalizing analytic theistic argumentation in broader theological discourse.
- **Enduring value**
 - A map of the field with primary texts and model arguments; ideal for structured debate, syllabus building, and comparative analysis across methods and eras.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural theology**: Reasoned knowledge of God from creation without appeal to special revelation.
- **General revelation**: Universal disclosure of God in nature, conscience, and rational order.
- **Cumulative case**: Multiple independent lines of evidence jointly increase theism's plausibility.
- **Kalam cosmological argument**: Whatever begins to exist has a cause; the universe began; therefore caused.
- **Leibnizian contingency argument**: Sufficient reason for contingent reality terminates in a necessary being.
- **Thomistic cosmology**: From act/potency and hierarchical causation to an uncaused Pure Act.
- **Ontological argument (modal)**: If a maximally great being is possible, it exists in every possible world.
- **Teleological/design**: Order and purpose suggest intelligence; includes modern fine-tuning analyses.
 - Fine-tuning: Life-permitting constants are highly improbable absent design; evaluated via likelihoods.
- **Moral argument**: Objective moral values/duties imply a transcendent personal ground.
- **Argument from consciousness**: Irreducible mentality and intentionality favor a theistic explanation.
- **Religious experience**: Prima facie justified belief formed in reliable doxastic practices.
- **Bayesian confirmation**: Evidence raises or lowers the probability of hypotheses via likelihood ratios.
- **Defeaters**: Reasons that undermine or undercut justification for a belief.
- **Hiddenness and evil**: Phenomena posed as evidence against theism; addressed within probabilistic frameworks.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Doctrine of God/Creation: Sourcebook for arguments to God's existence and core attributes.
 - Revelation: Framework for articulating general revelation's scope and limits vis-a-vis Scripture.
 - Anthropology/Ethics: Grounds for moral knowledge and rational faculties as theistic pointers.
 - Apologetics method: Models for cumulative-case strategy and probabilistic reasoning in theology.
