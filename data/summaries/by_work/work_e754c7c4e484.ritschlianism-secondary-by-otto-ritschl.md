### TITLE
**Ritschlianism - Albrecht Ritschl (secondary presentation by Otto Ritschl)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid- to late-19th century German Protestant theology; reaction against speculative metaphysics (Hegelian system) and against Romantic feeling-theologies (Schleiermacher).
 - Ritschl taught and wrote in the 1860s-1880s; his major systematic articulation appears in lectures and in Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation).
 - Otto Ritschl served as a later systematizer and defender of his father's thought (hence "secondary" treatments that popularized and clarified Ritschlian emphases).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be a practical, historically-grounded evaluation of God's self-revelation in Christ aimed at the realization of the moral kingdom of God; doctrines are normative judgments about the divine will that guide ethical life and communal reconciliation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Epistemology: religious knowledge is a value-judgment (Werturteil) formed by the religious experience of the Christian community, not speculative metaphysics.
 - Christology and revelation: Christ is the historical manifestation of God's will and love; revelation is historical, not metaphysical.
 - Soteriology: atonement and justification understood as reconciliation that restores the believer to the moral fellowship of God - emphasis on moral transformation within the community rather than forensic imputation.
 - Ethics and ecclesiology: the church/Christian community is the locus and instrument of regeneration, moral formation, and realization of the kingdom.
 - Eschatology: future judgment is construed as the moral consummation of God's will (realization of the kingdom), not as detailed metaphysical speculation about states of the soul.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Kantian critique of metaphysics, Schleiermacher (critique of pietistic subjectivism), Hegel (rejection of speculative system), Lutheran forensic assumptions (criticism of imputed righteousness).
 - Sits in dialogue with Neanderic church-historical emphases and anticipates later liberal Protestantism; Karl Barth is the principal modern critic.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (historical), Christology, atonement/reconciliation, justification, sanctification (ethical regeneration), church as ethical community, eschatology (kingdom as telos), limited metaphysical claims about Trinity and immortality.

- **Closing line**
 - Ritschlianism centers theology on the historical revelation of God in Christ as the normative ground for moral reconciliation and the communal realization of the kingdom of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as practical, ethical normativity: doctrine serves the moral life of the Christian community.
 - Historicist, anti-metaphysical stance: strict limits on speculative theology; reliance on historical Christ-event.
 - Priority of community and the kingdom over individualistic pietism and private mysticism.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Schleiermacher's psychologizing of religion by relocating the source of religious knowledge in communal value-experience rather than individual feeling.
 - Challenges traditional Lutheran forensic paradigms by reframing justification as moral reconciliation and inclusion in the kingdom, not merely forensic acquittal.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of the **value-judgment** (Werturteil) concept to ground theology in religious experience of worth rather than metaphysical truth-claims.
 - Kingdom of God as the organizing category for systematic theology and soteriology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on late 19th-century liberal Protestantism, Protestant ethics, and historical-critical theology.
 - Provoked sharp reactions: Karl Barth's dialectical theology partly formulated in explicit opposition to Ritschlian reduction of revelation to ethics.
 - Continued influence in ecclesiology and theological method (historicist, ethical emphases).

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to speculative overreach; provides a clear model for ethics-centered theology, historical-critical Christology, and ecclesial theology that links doctrine closely to communal praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God** - Central telos and criterion of theological truth; theology judged by its capacity to foster the kingdom's moral life.
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)** - Epistemic framework: religious claims are assessments of value grounded in communal experience.
- **Revelation (historical)** - God's self-disclosure in the concrete person and work of Jesus Christ; resists metaphysical abstraction.
- **Christology (ethical-revelatory)** - Christ as the moral revealer whose life and action disclose God's will for human community.
- **Reconciliation (Versöhnung)** - The primary meaning of atonement: the restoration of relational, ethical communion with God and others.
- **Justification (ethical inclusion)** - Inclusion into the kingdom and moral standing before God, not forensic legal fiction.
- **Church / Community** - The locus of regeneration, moral formation, and embodiment of the kingdom.
- **Sanctification / Regeneration & Indwelling** - Regeneration is understood primarily as moral renewal accomplished in the believer through their incorporation into the Christian community; indwelling language is subordinated to ethical transformation enacted by communal life. [See: Regeneration And Indwelling]
- **Eschatology (judgment)** - Final judgment construed as the moral and social consummation of God's will; eschatological language pressed into ethical and communal terms rather than metaphysical descriptions. [See: Final Judgment And Eternal States]
- **Religious experience** - Communal experience of God's saving action; the basis for theological norms.
- **Moral personality of God / Will** - God is apprehended as personal will oriented to moral ends rather than abstract being.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for ethics-centered accounts of justification, atonement, and ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic** target and foil (notably for Barthian neo-orthodoxy) when defending non-reductionist accounts of revelation and divine transcendence.
 - As an **exegetical-model**: historical-critical reading of Christ's life as normative revelation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses illustrating the shift from metaphysical to ethical-historical theological method.
