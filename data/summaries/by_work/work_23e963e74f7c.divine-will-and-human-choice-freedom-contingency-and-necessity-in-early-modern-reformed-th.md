### TITLE
Divine Will and Human Choice: Freedom, Contingency, and Necessity in Early Modern Reformed Thought (Scott Swain with Richard A. Muller, 2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - A scholarly collection situated in the early modern Reformed theological milieu (16th-18th centuries). Aimed at historians of doctrine and systematicians concerned with how Reformed authors handled divine agency, human responsibility, and modal language about necessity and contingency.
 - Engages post-Reformation scholastic, Puritan, and continental Reformed sources against modern interpretive categories.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:**
 - Early modern Reformed theologians developed a careful, technical vocabulary that preserves both divine sovereignty (necessity of decree) and genuine human responsibility (contingency of creaturely choices). The volume contends that these thinkers should not be read as crude determinists nor as advocates of libertarian indeterminism.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Historical-theological surveys and case studies that map how key terms (will, necessity, contingency, freedom, concurrence, decree) were used by early modern Reformed authors.
 - Major moves:
 - Distinguish kinds of necessity (logical, causal, modal, moral) and show which kinds were attributed to God and creatures.
 - Reconstruct Reformed compatibilist accounts of human freedom grounded in divine concurrence and preservation.
 - Demonstrate how doctrines of election, reprobation, and providence were articulated without compromising moral accountability.
 - Clarify Trinitarian implications: economic distinctions (will ascribed in roles) vs. metaphysical unity of the divine will.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Representative early modern Reformed figures (e.g., Arminius and his opponents, continental scholastics, seventeenth-century Reformed scholastics such as Turretin and others), Puritan treatments, and canonical confessional formulations. Editors interact with modern scholarly interpreters and contemporary theological debates.

- **Doctrines treated:**
 - Providence, decree, election/reprobation, freedom and moral responsibility, concurrence, divine simplicity, and Trinitarian language about will and relation.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):**
 - Early modern Reformed theology articulates a robust sovereignty of God that preserves human moral responsibility by finely distinguishing types of necessity and modes of divine action so that divine unity of will is maintained without dissolving creaturely contingency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precision in modal language: careful parsing of "necessity" and "contingency" rather than collapsing them into a single binary.
 - Stress on compatibilist models endorsed by many early modern Reformed authors, not simple determinism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters simplistic readings (both libertarian and hard determinist) that project modern categories onto early modern texts.
 - Challenges readings that interpret early modern language as implying multiple wills in God by insisting on the classical Reformed unity of the divine will while allowing economic distinctions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-emphasis of classical scholastic distinctions (e.g., decretive vs. preceptive will, antecedent vs. consequent will) and their systematic theological import for freedom and responsibility debates.
 - Highlighting functional distinctions (economic expressions of willing) vis-a-vis ontological unity.

- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used by historians of doctrine and systematic theologians as a corrective historical resource. Cited in contemporary debates about divine freedom and intra-Trinitarian relations (notably in discussions over Eternal Functional Subordination).

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides accessible primary-source reconstruction and clarifies technical vocabulary that is essential for fair historical appropriation and for informed engagement in present-day doctrinal controversies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Decretive will** - God's sovereign will as expressed in eternal decree; ground of providential necessity.
- **Preceptive will** - God's moral will as commanded in law and covenant; pertains to human obedience and moral obligation.
- **Antecedent vs. consequent will** - Distinction used to explain God's permissive/motivating ways of willing relative to sin and grace.
- **Necessity (modal distinctions)** - Multiple senses (logical, metaphysical, causal, moral) distinguished; early moderns ascribe some forms to God, others only to creatures.
- **Contingency** - Creaturely openness and real causal dependence on God; sustains moral responsibility.
- **Compatibilism (Reformed)** - Human freedom is compatible with divine determinative decree through concurrence and voluntariness of actions.
- **Concurrence** - Doctrine that God cooperates causally with creaturely acts without extinguishing their creaturely causality.
- **Divine simplicity** - Classical commitment that guards against ontological composition in God; grounds insistence on unity of the divine will.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity** - Functional attributions of will in the economy are distinguished from metaphysical distinctions among persons.
- **Voluntarism (theological sense)** - Emphasis on God as acting freely; early moderns balance voluntarist language with commitments to goodness and wisdom.
- **Election and reprobation** - Treated within the framework that combines decretive necessity and creaturely culpability.
- **Moral government** - Framework for understanding God's preceptive will and the ends toward which human responsibility is directed.
- **Foreknowledge** - Related to predestination debates; early moderns articulate foreknowledge consistent with decrees without reducing contingency.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition and historical-source resource** for technical vocabularies (decretive/preceptive, antecedent/consequent).
 - As a **polemic-historical pivot** in contemporary debates (e.g., Eternal Functional Subordination) to show early modern nuance and to caution against anachronistic readings.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Reformation and post-Reformation texts about divine will, providence, and human responsibility.
