### TITLE
**After Calvin: Studies in the Development of a Theological Tradition** 
Richard A. Muller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Focus: late 16th to 17th century Reformed orthodoxy amid confessionalization.
 - Milieu: humanist philology plus scholastic method; universities, disputations, commentaries.
 - Interlocutors: Roman Catholic scholastics (e.g., Bellarmine, Molina), Lutherans, Socinians, and Remonstrants.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The so-called shift from Calvin to scholastic Reformed orthodoxy is not declension but **organic development** within a broader catholic (patristic-medieval) tradition, deploying scholastic tools ministerially to clarify Scripture.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Prolegomena and method**: Theology as a **science** with principia; Scripture as principium externum, Spirit as internum; archetypal vs ectypal theology; theology ordered to **piety** and practice.
 - **Bibliology and hermeneutics**: Sensus literalis with multiple uses; analogia Scripturae/fidei; exegesis undergirds loci; tradition is critical yet subordinate.
 - **Theology proper**: Divine **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility** articulated with precision; attributes categorized (absolute/relative; incommunicable/communicable) to safeguard the Creator-creature distinction.
 - **Trinity**: Eternal **generation** and **spiration**; processions-missions relations; anti-Socinian clarifications.
 - **Decree, foreknowledge, providence**: Natural and free divine knowledge; rejection of **scientia media**; compatibilist account of contingency (synchronic contingency); concurrence and evil.
 - **Covenant and salvation**: Pactum salutis and federal theology; careful distinction and coordination of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**.
 - **Polemic architecture**: Systematic differences explained by rhetorical aims and opponents, not betrayal of Calvin.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed: Calvin, Beza, Junius, Polanus, Perkins, Ames, Wollebius, Voetius, Turretin, Mastricht, Owen, Rutherford, Maccovius.
 - Catholic/medieval: Augustine, Lombard, Aquinas, Scotus; early modern opponents: Bellarmine, Molina; Lutheran: Gerhard; Socinian writers; Remonstrants.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theological method and nature of theology; Scripture and principia; doctrine of God and attributes; Trinity; decree, providence, evil; middle knowledge; covenant; salvation order/history; Christology in relation to federal structure.
- **Center of gravity**
 - A **catholic Reformed** theology: exegetically driven, scholastically tooled, metaphysically careful, practical in end.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong account of **archetypal/ectypal theology** governing prolegomena.
 - Theology as **habitus** oriented to wisdom and piety, not bare speculation.
 - Ministerial use of **philosophy and metaphysics** to serve exegesis.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rebuts the Calvin vs the Calvinists declension narrative.
 - Distinguishes **method** (scholastic form) from **content** (confessional Reformed substance).
 - Clarifies that Reformed orthodoxy is diverse (Thomist, Scotist inflections) yet materially united.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise mapping of **principia** (externum/internum; cognoscendi/essendi).
 - Careful taxonomy of **divine attributes** (absolute/relative; negative/positive) within classical theism.
 - Deployment of **synchronic contingency** and refined accounts of concurrence without Molinism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Reset historiography of post-Reformation theology; foundational for the Leiden school and subsequent retrievals.
 - Resource for contemporary debates on **simplicity, impassibility, eternal generation**, and anti-Molinism in Reformed circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies the **categories and sources** needed to read primary texts accurately.
 - Models integrative theological method balancing exegesis, dogmatics, and metaphysics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reformed Orthodoxy**: 1560s-1700s confessional, academic phase of Reformed theology; not a deviation but consolidation.
- **Scholastic Method**: Disputation, quaestio, loci-ordered system serving scriptural teaching.
- **Principia Theologiae**
 - **Principium essendi**: God as the being-principle of theology.
 - **Principium cognoscendi externum**: Scripture as external cognitive principle.
 - **Principium cognoscendi internum**: Spirit illumining to receive Scripture.
- **Archetypal / Ectypal Theology**: Gods self-knowledge vs creatures participation by revelation; structures humility and method.
- **Nature and Task of Theology**: A **habitus** that is scientia and sapientia; end is doxology and the churchs edification.
- **Divine Simplicity, Aseity, Immutability, Impassibility**: Classical perfections safeguarding unity, independence, and perfection of God.
- **Absolute / Relative Attributes**
 - Absolute: perfections considered in se.
 - Relative: ad extra relations (e.g., Creator) without composing God.
- **Eternal Generation and Spiration**: Processions grounding Son and Spirit; basis for missions without subordinationism.
- **Decree and Providence**: Eternal, simple decree; providence via concurrence and government, permitting evil without authoring it.
- **Natural and Free Knowledge**: Gods necessary knowledge of all possibilities vs free knowledge of what will be; excludes **scientia media**.
- **Molinism / Middle Knowledge**: Rejected as undermining divine simplicity and decree; Reformed opt for compatibilist contingency.
- **Synchronic Contingency**: Creaturely acts contingent though certain under the decree; bases moral responsibility.
- **Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis**
 - Historia: once-for-all acts in redemptive history.
 - Ordo: application of redemption to persons; coordinated, not collapsed.
- **Analogia Fidei / Scripturae**: Scripture interprets Scripture; doctrinal rule derived from the whole.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Prolegomena template**: Defining principia and the nature of theology for doctrinal method.
 - **Theology proper anchor**: Norms discussions of attributes, Trinity, and providence against revisionism.
 - **Anti-Molinist polemic**: Historical-theological grounding for rejecting scientia media.
 - **Soteriological coordination**: Clarifies interplay of historia and ordo salutis in teaching and preaching.
