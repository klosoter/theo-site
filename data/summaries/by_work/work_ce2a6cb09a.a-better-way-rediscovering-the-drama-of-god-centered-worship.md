### TITLE
A Better Way: Rediscovering The Drama of God-Centered Worship - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed milieu (post-1990s debates over contemporary worship).
 - Part of a neo-Reformed revival seeking to recover confessional and liturgical resources for evangelical churches.
 - Reaction to seeker-sensitive, entertainment-driven, and therapeutic models of worship popular in many Protestant congregations.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Worship has been distorted by a human-centered consumerism; the remedy is a return to **God-centered, covenantal, liturgical worship** where God is the primary actor.
 - Worship shapes doctrine and discipleship; therefore liturgy is theological and must be reclaimed.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary worship often centers on human experience, performance, and pragmatics rather than the Word and sacraments.
 - Theological foundation: Reformed/Trinitarian account of worship as the drama in which God acts (Word proclaimed, sacraments administered) and the congregation responds.
 - Practical prescription: recover liturgical forms, the Lord's Day pattern, Word-and-Sacrament priority, congregational singing rooted in doctrine, confession/assurance, and catechesis within worship.
 - Pastoral implications: worship as catechesis/formation for the whole people of God; elders and pastors steward worship according to Scripture and confession.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformation and post-Reformation sources (Calvin, the Reformed confessions, Puritans) and contemporary critics/proponents of contemporary worship.
 - Interlocutors include proponents of seeker-sensitive models and charismatic/experiential emphases; also engages modern liturgical renewal voices.
 - Scripture is the primary canonical interlocutor; Horton's Reformed systematic theology shapes exegetical moves.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Worship theory (regulative principle implied), Trinity (worship directed to triune God), Christology (atonement as basis for sacramental life), Sacramental theology (Baptism, Lord's Supper as means of grace), Covenant theology, Ecclesiology (corporate nature of worship), Revelation (Word), Practical theology (liturgics, hymnody).

- **Closing line**
 - Horton locates the church's recovery of worship in a **theologically disciplined, liturgical, Word-and-Sacrament practice** that makes visible the drama of God's covenantal action and forms the faithful for holy living.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Explicit framing of worship as a **drama** in which God is the principal actor and the congregation participates in response - a theatrical metaphor used to clarify roles and ordering.
 - Strong insistence that **liturgy is doctrine**: form and pattern teach theology as much as sermons do.
 - Recovery of **objective means of grace** (Word and sacraments) against subjectivist spirituality.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects evangelical minimalism that reduces worship to preaching or evangelistic programing.
 - Counters charismatic/experiential priorities that privilege feeling over covenantal structure.
 - Contrasts with seeker-driven worship by reasserting corporate identity and confessionally-ordered service.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The stark **God-centered vs. man-centered** binary applied across liturgical practice.
 - Apt use of "drama" to reconfigure liturgical participation without collapsing into mere performance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and confessional evangelical circles as a concise defense of liturgical renewal.
 - Influential in seminary and church practice for those shifting from contemporary to more historic forms of worship.
 - Criticized by some for being overly prescriptive or insufficiently appreciative of legitimate charismatic expression.

- **Enduring value**
 - Practical theology that marries doctrine to worship practice; useful for pastors, liturgists, and theologians seeking grounded reform.
 - Serves as a bridge text for evangelicals moving toward liturgical recovery without surrendering evangelical convictions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered worship**
 - Worship practices ordered primarily to God's action and glory rather than human preferences or emotional outcomes.

- **Drama**
 - Metaphor: God acts (Word, sacrament), people respond (confession, praise, obedience); clarifies roles and sequence in liturgy.

- **Liturgy**
 - Ordered public worship; Horton emphasizes forms that embody theology and shape the congregation.

- **Word-and-Sacrament**
 - The twin means of grace in Reformed worship: preaching of the Word and administration of Baptism and the Lord's Supper.

- **Means of grace**
 - Objective channels by which God works in the church; counter to subjectivist views that reduce God's work to feelings.

- **Covenant theology**
 - Framework for understanding worship as covenantal encounter - promises, fulfillment in Christ, and sealing in sacraments.

- **Doxology**
 - Worship as praise of the Triune God; Horton stresses Trinitarian orientation in every element.

- **Regulative principle (implicit)**
 - The idea that worship should be governed by Scripture; Horton provides a practical Reformed application without lengthy technical defense.

- **Lord's Day / liturgical year**
 - Emphasis on weekly and seasonal rhythms that teach and form communal memory.

- **Catechesis**
 - Worship as formative instruction for faith and life; hymnody and confession serve educational ends.

- **Seeker-sensitive / entertainment critique**
 - Horton's polemical target: models that prioritize attraction and entertainment over covenantal fidelity.

- **Congregational singing**
 - Preferred over performance; songs should be theologically rich and doxological.

- **Objective assurance**
 - Assurance of salvation grounded in gospel promises and sacramental seals, not merely subjective experience.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "God-centered" and liturgical renewal within contemporary evangelical theology.
- As a **polemic** against seeker-sensitive and entertainment-driven worship models.
- As a **practical-exegetical model** for ordering worship services (sermon-sacrament-song-confession pattern).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses connecting systematic theology, ecclesiology, and liturgics in Reformed contexts.
