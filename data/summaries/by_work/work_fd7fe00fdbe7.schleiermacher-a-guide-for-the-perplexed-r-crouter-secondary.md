### TITLE
**Schleiermacher: A Guide for the Perplexed (Robert Crouter, secondary introduction to Friedrich Schleiermacher)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th century German Protestantism; post-Enlightenment and Romantic intellectual milieu.
 - Dialogue with Kantian epistemology, Fichtean subjectivity and Pietist religious sensibilities; reaction to dry dogmatism and rationalist reduction of religion.
 - Crouter's guide (secondary) seeks to orient modern readers to Schleiermacher's major texts (Religion: Speeches...; The Christian Faith) and their legacy.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Schleiermacher reframes theology as reflection on the human condition of **absolute dependence** - religion as a felt relation to the Absolute - and reinterprets traditional Christian doctrines around this center.
 - Problem addressed: how to make Christian doctrine credible and meaningful in a culture shaped by reason, historical criticism, and individual subjectivity.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Establishes **religion as the immediacy of God-consciousness** ("feeling of absolute dependence") as primary datum.
 - Interprets Christ as the perfect consciousness of God - the paradigm for human religious self-consciousness and communal formation.
 - Recasts doctrines (Trinity, atonement, justification) as expressive of religious experience and normative for transformed communal life rather than as metaphysical proofs.
 - Positions church and sacraments as mediating institutions for cultivating and expressing religious consciousness and moral vocation in culture.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Kant, Fichte, Hegel (philosophical context); Pietism and Enlightenment theology (ecclesial context).
 - Reformation heritage (Luther, Calvin) reinterpreted - Crouter highlights Schleiermacher's critique of purely forensic readings.
 - Later interlocutors: Barthian reaction, liberal theology, contemporary debates (e.g., forensic imputation critiques, Federal Vision engagements).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as self-manifestation in religious feeling), Trinity (relational structure of divine-personal life), Christology (Christ as paradigmatic God-consciousness), soteriology (union with Christ reinterpreted ethically/experientially), ecclesiology (church as community of feeling), sacraments (mediating signs), anthropology (finite, dependent, social human being), vocation and culture mandate (ethical engagement of believers in world).

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's theological center of gravity: **the Christian faith reimagined as a communal cultivation of the God-consciousness inaugurated in Christ and enacted in vocation and the church**, rather than as primarily a set of metaphysical propositions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of subjective religious experience ("feeling") over propositional assertion; theology as descriptive-analytic of faith consciousness.
 - Christ as exemplar and center of communal formation rather than merely legal substitute.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects both Enlightenment deism (which evacuates feeling) and confessional dogmatism (which neglects subjectivity).
 - Moves away from strict forensic-imputation models of justification toward **relational/transformatory accounts** emphasizing union and moral renewal.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Absolute dependence" as a theological axiom; "God-consciousness" and the use of psychological categories in doctrinal exposition.
 - Correlational method linking human experience and doctrine.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for 19th-century liberal Protestantism; major target for 20th-century neo-orthodoxy (Barth's reactive emphasis on divine act).
 - Modern theologians use Schleiermacher to argue against purely forensic accounts of justification and to ground ecclesiology in communal formation.
 - Controversially cited in debates over Federal Vision and other Reformed critiques as an alternative interpretive path.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how doctrine can be both historically credible and existentially meaningful.
 - Valuable for students exploring intersections of hermeneutics, anthropology, ecclesiology, and ethics; useful corrective to purely propositionalist theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute dependence** - foundational human stance: consciousness of reliance upon the Divine; starting point for theological method.
- **God-consciousness (Gottesbewusstsein)** - immediate, non-propositional awareness/feeling that grounds religion.
- **Religion as feeling** - religion primarily a lived, affective orientation, not merely assent to facts.
- **Christ as paradigmatic consciousness** - Christ exemplifies perfected God-consciousness and inaugurates communal formation.
- **Union with Christ (experiential/ethical)** - emphasis on participation and transformation rather than forensic imputation alone.
 - Often read against strict forensic models; grounds sanctification and identity in communion with Christ.
- **Justification reinterpreted** - skepticism toward standalone forensic imputation; justification described relationally and existentially.
- **Visible / invisible church** - church defined by shared religious consciousness; Schleiermacher collapses rigid visible/invisible binaries in favor of ecclesial cultivation.
- **Sacraments as mediating signs** - means that foster communal God-consciousness; less juridical transaction, more formative.
- **Vocation and culture mandate** - Christian life as vocation in culture; faith expresses itself through ethical agency and dominion of creation as stewardship.
- **Anthropology: finitude and sociality** - humans are dependent, relational beings constituted for communal religious life.
- **Mediation vs immediacy** - tension between immediate feeling of God and mediated forms (Word, sacrament, tradition).
- **Forensic-imputation critique** - Schleiermacher's framework provides resources for contemporary critiques of imputation-first models.
- **Correlational method** - theology as dynamic interplay between human experience and doctrinal articulation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for liberal/experiential readings of doctrine (especially justification and union).
 - As a **polemic resource** against forensic-only accounts of justification and for sacramental/communal emphases.
 - As an **exegetical model** for ecclesiology and sacraments that centers formation and vocation over juridical status.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about vocation, culture, and the visible/invisible church distinction.
