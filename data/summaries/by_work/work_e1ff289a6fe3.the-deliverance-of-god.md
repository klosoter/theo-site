### TITLE
The Deliverance of God - Douglas A. Campbell

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Published in two volumes (2009, 2012) amid the ongoing debates produced by the New Perspective on Paul. Engages both classical Reformation readings of Paul and scholarship from E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright, Stephen Westerholm and others. Part of a broader late 20th/early 21st-century reassessment of Pauline soteriology and covenant language.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** Campbell argues that Paul's primary concern is God's act of *deliverance* in history - the rescue of God's people from the power of Adam, sin and death - rather than primarily a forensic declaration of individual moral guilt and imputed righteousness. Traditional categories of forensic justification are examined and largely rejected as the controlling schema for Paul.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Reconstructs Pauline vocabulary and theology around a narrative of Adam/Christ and corporate covenantal identity rather than forensic legal metaphors.
 - Shows that terms like "justification," "righteousness," "salvation" and "law" function within Paul as markers of covenant inclusion/exclusion and as signs of delivered status in Christ.
 - Argues that Paul's soteriology is fundamentally participatory: believers are delivered by union with Christ (death/resurrection) from Adamic power.
 - Critiques both classical Reformed forensic approaches and some New Perspective readings that still retain juridical assumptions.
 - Reads Paul letter-by-letter in their rhetorical and social contexts to overturn certain long-standing theological inferences.
- **Figures/sources/interlocutors engaged:** Luther, Calvin, Augustine, Aquinas; moderns including E. P. Sanders, James Dunn, N. T. Wright, Stephen Westerholm, John Barclay; uses ancient rhetorical and social-scientific tools and extensive Pauline exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification, atonement/soteriology, covenant, Christology (Adam-Christ typology), law (nomos), righteousness (dikaiosyne), Pauline ecclesiology, eschatology/apocalyptic.
- **Closing line:** Campbell reframes Paul as narrating God's decisive historical *deliverance* in Christ - making covenantal belonging and ontological participation, not forensic imputation, the pivot of Pauline theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Elevates *deliverance* language as the organizing center of Paul rather than forensic justification.
 - Emphasizes Adam/Christ typology and ontological participation as the mechanism of salvation.
 - Treats "righteousness" primarily as covenantal status and God's faithful action, not as forensic credit.
- **Corrections/contrasts:**
 - Challenges Reformation-era accounts that read Paul chiefly as addressing individual guilt and judicial justification before God.
 - Distinguishes itself from some New Perspective accounts by insisting that even those retain some juridical assumptions; Campbell pushes further toward participatory/apocalyptic models.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts justification language in terms of deliverance, covenantal inclusion, and ontological transformation.
 - Stresses the rhetorical-historical functioning of Pauline terms rather than retrofitting later theological semantics.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Marked as provocative and influential in Pauline studies; widely cited and heavily debated.
 - Praised for meticulous exegesis and for forcing re-evaluation of categories; criticized by defenders of forensic views (e.g., Westerholm) and by those who argue Campbell underplays forensic elements in Paul.
 - Influential in some evangelical and academic circles seeking alternatives to both classical Reformation and mainstream New Perspective frameworks.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Sharpens questions about doctrinal categories (justification, imputation, atonement) and their historical-theological baggage.
 - Provides a sustained exegetical model for reading Paul as a narrative/apocalyptic theologian.
 - Helpful as a corrective or counterbalance in courses on Pauline theology, justification, and covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Deliverance:** Central organizing category for Paul in Campbell - God's rescue of his people from Adamic power through Christ.
- **Justification (dikaiosis/dikaioo):** Reinterpreted as covenantal vindication/deliverance rather than primarily forensic acquittal.
- **Righteousness (dikaiosyne):** Treated as status within covenant and as God's faithful action; resists being reduced to imputed moral status.
- **Imputation:** Downplayed as the controlling Pauline concept; Campbell questions classic forensic formulations.
- **Adam-Christ typology:** Key mechanism - Christ as the new Adam whose death/resurrection reconstitutes human membership and delivers from Adamic death.
- **Participation/union with Christ:** Central soteriological mechanism - deliverance effected by union (death and resurrection) rather than by declarative sentencing alone.
- **Law (nomos) / Works of the law:** Read as boundary markers of covenant identity; "works of the law" function to identify covenant membership rather than meritorious earning of salvation.
- **Covenant / covenantal nomism:** Campbell affirms covenantal frameworks but reorients them toward deliverance and participation.
- **Apocalyptic / inaugurated eschatology:** Paul's language is rooted in the present-outworking of God's eschatological rescue.
- **Forensicism:** Term used to identify the theological stance Campbell criticizes - projecting later legal categories onto Paul.
- **Salvation/deliverance:** Treated corporately and historically - rescue from Adam's order.
- **Rhetorical-historical method:** Campbell's exegetical approach, attending to ancient letter genres and argumentation.
- **Eschatological vindication:** Paul's view of God's action culminating in vindication of his people.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: reframing key Pauline terms (justification, righteousness) around deliverance/covenantal belonging.
- As a **polemic**: deployed against forensic/penal-centric readings of Paul and against some Reformation readings.
- As an **exegetical model**: exemplar for rhetorical-historical readings that prioritize narrative, participation, and Adam-Christ typology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses debating Pauline soteriology, prompting redefinition of imputation, atonement, and justification.
