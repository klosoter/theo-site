### TITLE
**"The Trinity and the Incarnation" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in The Glory of the Atonement (ed. J. I. Packer & Mark Jones / Hill & Letham collection context)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical scholarship (late 20th-early 21st century). Appears amid renewed interest in classical Christology and the relation of Trinitarian doctrine to soteriology; situated in a volume bringing historical-theological reflection to the atonement.
 - Gaffin writes from a confessional Reformed posture with strong commitments to biblical exegesis and historical dogmatics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The incarnation must be understood as the eternal Son's assumption of human nature; proper Christology and atonement theology depend on grounding the historical incarnation in the eternal personal relations of the Trinity.
 - Opposes any account that treats "the Son" as merely an office, role, or temporary designation (adoptionism, functionalism, or kenotic reductionism).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with a biblical and patristic-theological premise: the Word of God (Logos) is personally the Son whose eternal relation to the Father grounds the act of becoming flesh.
 - Develops the necessity of **eternal Sonship** for a coherent incarnation: only the eternally begotten Son is the one who assumes human nature without ceasing to be divine.
 - Defends the classical Chalcedonian framework:
 - Two natures (full deity, full humanity) united in one hypostasis (person) without confusion, change, division, or separation.
 - Emphasizes the communicatio idiomatum properly understood as personal attribution, not metaphysical fusion.
 - Rejects kenotic or ontological subordinationist proposals that imply change in the divine being or loss of divine attributes in the incarnate Son.
 - Connects Trinitarian ontology to soteriological efficacy: the Son's personal identity and unity of natures secure both representative obedience and substitutionary atonement.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the biblical witness (Johannine Logos, Pauline christology), patristic authorities (Athanasius, Cappadocians), Chalcedon, and the Reformed orthodox tradition (Owen, Turretin, Bavinck by affinity).
 - Contemporary interlocutors include proponents of kenotic Christology, functional subordination models, and some modern revisionists in evangelicalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (eternal relations, generation), Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum), soteriology (atonement), revelation (Word-Flesh nexus), and covenantal implications implicit in the incarnational act.

- **Closing line**
 - The incarnation is intelligible and the atonement effective only when the historical Son is identified with the eternally begotten Son - preserving full deity and full humanity in one personal subject.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **eternal Sonship as ontologically prior** to and constitutive of the incarnation; incarnation is not a temporary assumption by an anonymous divine being.
 - Careful deployment of patristic categories to protect both the unity of person and the distinction of natures.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects kenotic and functionalist accounts that either diminish divine immutability or relegate the Son's status to economic role alone.
 - Pushes back on modern proposals that separate eternal personal relations from the grounding of redemptive action.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Not so much new terms as disciplined reapplication: reclaims classical language (generation, hypostasis, communicatio) within contemporary Reformed exegesis and theological method.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed and confessional contexts as a robust corrective to revisionist Christologies.
 - Cited by scholars addressing the coherence of Trinitarian ontology and historic atonement theories; helpful against popular evangelical truncations of orthodox Trinitarian doctrine.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically disciplined model linking doctrine of the Trinity to Christology and soteriology - useful for teaching why orthodox Trinitarian formulations matter for salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Sonship / eternal generation**
 - The Son's personal relation to the Father that is ontologically prior to temporal missions; grounds the identity of the incarnate Son.

- **Incarnation**
 - The eternal Son's assumption of a genuine human nature without relinquishing deity.

- **Hypostatic union**
 - One person (hypostasis) in two complete natures; the organizing formula for Gaffin's defense of orthodox Christology.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The personal attribution of properties of both natures to the one person; guarded against metaphysical confusion.

- **Kenosis**
 - Criticized where it implies loss or alteration of divine being; Gaffin rejects ontological kenosis while allowing volitional self-limitation in the economy.

- **Ontological change vs. economic role**
 - Distinguishes between real change in divine being (rejected) and economic self-limitation/role in salvation history (accepted as volitional).

- **Chalcedonian criteria**
 - Used as the normative framework for safeguarding deity and humanity together.

- **Person / nature (hypostasis / ousia)**
 - Clarifies classical categories for contemporary Christological debates.

- **Functional subordination**
 - Critiqued insofar as it attempts to make economic ordering a reflection of eternal ontological inequality.

- **Assumption**
 - The Son's taking up of human nature - central to linking Trinity to atonement.

- **Representative obedience / substitution**
 - Soteriological implications of the incarnate Son acting as the one mediator.

- **Patristic witness**
 - Employed as a theological resource to adjudicate modern revisions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for grounding incarnational Christology in eternal Sonship (Trinity locus).
- As a **polemic** against kenotic and adoptionist tendencies in contemporary evangelicalism.
- As an **exegetical-model** example that reads biblical texts through classical dogmatic categories to secure atonement theology.
