### TITLE
Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus (2000) - David W. Pao

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2000 amid renewed interest in canonical and intertextual readings of Luke-Acts and in "new exodus" motifs in OT/NT scholarship.
 - Part of a broader late-20th-century turn toward biblical-theological readings that read Luke-Acts intertextually with Isaiah and the prophetic corpus.

- **Central thesis**
 - Luke-Acts is deliberately shaped by the Isaianic "new exodus" motif: Jesus and the nascent church are portrayed as the eschatological fulfillment of Isaiah's promises of deliverance, return, and restoration. Acts narrates the inauguration and expansion of that new exodus through Spirit-empowered proclamation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes the Isaianic new exodus as a coherent cluster of prophetic expectations (deliverance from exile, return to land/temple, eschatological vindication).
 - Demonstrates Luke's sustained use of Isaiah-language and themes (e.g., liberation, restoration, Servant motifs) across Luke-Acts, not only in isolated fulfillment quotations.
 - Shows specific correspondences in Acts:
 - Pentecost as a new Sinai/empowering event (parallels with prophetic promises of Spirit and empowerment).
 - Mission to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth as fulfillment of prophetic restoration and universalizing hopes.
 - Temple, land, and covenant motifs reframed in light of Jesus' death, resurrection, and the Spirit-community.
 - Argues that Luke's portrayal of Jesus and the church reconfigures Israel's identity rather than simply displacing it-Israel is being restored/renewed through Jesus.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Close readings of Isaiah (especially Isa 40-55 and Servant material) and Luke-Acts.
 - Engages contemporary NT scholarship on fulfillment and typology, and discussions of Israel/Church relations (scholars such as N. T. Wright, Richard Bauckham, and typology proponents are implicit interlocutors).
 - Dialogues with Old Testament interpreters who have articulated the "new exodus" paradigm.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: Jesus as eschatological deliverer and Israel's Servant.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit as the power of the new exodus (Pentecost-Sinai parallel).
 - **Ecclesiology**: Church as renewed/called Israel, corporate continuity and boundaries.
 - **Covenant theology / Israel**: Restoration of covenant people, land/temple themes reinterpreted.
 - **Eschatology**: Inaugurated eschatology-present realization and ongoing fulfillment.

- **Closing line**
 - Luke-Acts reads Jesus and the church as the Isaianic new exodus brought to history: restoration of Israel and the nations through cross, resurrection, Spirit, and proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the Isaianic new exodus as the controlling theological and narrative framework for Luke-Acts rather than a peripheral motif.
 - Emphasizes intertextual, canonical reading-Luke's narrative is best read against the prophetic horizon of Isaiah.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that isolate Lukan fulfillment to a few quotation formulas; shows pervasive Isaiah-shaped narrative strategy.
 - Offers a corrective to approaches that celebrate Acts primarily as Gentile-mission narrative by restoring Israel-centric prophetic expectations to the center.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic mapping of Isaianic motifs (exodus, Sinai/Spirit, Servant, return to the land/temple) onto Lukan episodes.
 - Frames Pentecost and mission as integrated components of a single new-exodus act rather than separate theological loci.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by scholars and pastors interested in typological / canonical biblical theology and in rethinking Israel-Church relations.
 - Cited in subsequent Luke-Acts studies and in work on the Spirit as eschatological power; influential in readings that resist strict supersessionism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust exegetical model that connects OT prophetic expectation to NT narrative.
 - Useful for preaching, teaching, and doctrine formation where unity of Scripture and typological fulfillment are central.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Isaianic New Exodus** - The prophetic pattern in Isaiah that promises a fresh, climactic act of deliverance akin to the exodus, including return, restoration, and universal blessing.
- **Typology (Luke-Acts usage)** - Luke's portrayal of Jesus and the church as fulfilling and recapitulating earlier redemptive events (not merely allegory but historical-eschatological fulfillment).
- **Fulfillment (telos/pleonasm)** - Luke's narrative strategy of bringing prophetic promises to their intended end in Christ and the church.
- **Pentecost-as-Sinai** - Reading Acts 2 as a new Sinai event: Spirit-outpouring that inaugurates covenant renewal and prophetic empowerment.
- **Corporate Israel / Renewed Israel** - The idea that Luke frames the church as the renewed corporate entity of Israel, fulfilling covenantal restoration promises.
- **Temple and Land motifs** - Lukan reconfiguration of temple/land hopes in light of Jesus' death/resurrection and the Spirit-community.
- **Servant motif** - Use of Isaianic Servant language to interpret Jesus' suffering and vindication as part of the new exodus.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The "already/not-yet" character of the new exodus: restoration has begun in Christ and awaits consummation.
- **Prophetic intertextuality** - Method: reading Lukan narrative through Isaiah's theological vocabulary and narrative themes.
- **Mission as Restoration** - Mission in Acts framed as the spread of Isaianic restoration to nations; proclamation is part of the exodus-act.
- **Pneumatological empowerment** - Spirit as the operative force effecting the new-exodus deliverance and sustaining the restored people.
- **Covenant continuity** - Emphasis on continuity between OT covenant promises to Israel and the church's identity and vocation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an **exegetical model** for Luke-Acts studies: demonstrates method for intertextual canonical reading.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of Israel-Church relations within covenant theology.
 - As a **definition source** for the "new exodus" paradigm when teaching typology and fulfillment in biblical theology.
 - As a **polemical resource** against readings that marginalize Israelic prophetic horizons in NT interpretation.
