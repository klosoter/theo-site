### TITLE
R. Scott Clark, "Caspar Olevian and the Substance of the Covenant" (secondary essay; covenant-theology context; engagement with later Reformed scholasticism, esp. Turretin)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary historical-theological essay by R. Scott Clark situating Caspar Olevian (16th century) in early Reformed covenant theology and tracing implications into Reformed orthodoxy. Interacts with the development from magisterial Reformation pastoral-catechetical theology into 17th-century scholastic formulations (e.g., Turretin).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Clark argues that Olevian articulates a clear sense of the *substance of the covenant* that preserves the absolute centrality of Christ's promise and imputed righteousness, thereby precluding any notion that believers' good works *merit* salvation. This reading illuminates the continuity and tension between early Reformed pastoral theology and later scholastic refinements about merit and reward.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Survey of Olevian's texts and catechetical style to establish his working definition of the covenant's "substance." 
 - Distinguishes *substance* (what the covenant essentially promises) from *administration* (how obligations and sacraments function). 
 - Shows Olevian treats good works as necessary fruit and condition of covenant life but not as condign causes of justification. 
 - Compares Olevian's posture with Turretin's later scholastic distinctions (condign vs. congruous merit) to show how orthodoxy systematized what Olevian presupposed pastorally.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary focus: Caspar Olevian. 
 - Secondary interlocutors: Calvinic covenant language broadly, later Reformed scholastics (Francis Turretin as representative), and Clark's own historiographical claims about continuity and development.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Covenant theology (substance vs. administration), justification (imputation), sanctification and good works, merit (condign/congruous distinction), promise/condition structure, sacraments as covenant signs.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Clark reads Olevian as upholding a covenantal center in which Christ's promise and imputed righteousness constitute the covenant's substance, while good works remain necessary fruits/obligations but not meritorious grounds of salvation - a pastoral matrix later formalized in Turretin's scholastic categories.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphasizes Olevian's practical-pastoral mode of theological expression (catechetical and polemical) as formative for how covenant substance was understood prior to scholastic precision. 
 - Sharp analytic distinction between "substance" and "administration" applied to early Reformed sources rather than treated as only later technical terms.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Challenges readings that anachronistically project later scholastic merit-language back onto Olevian; argues Olevian is not a proto-scholastic defender of merit but a pastoral covenant theologian resisting meritorious readings. 
 - Contrasts Olevian's pastoral idiom with Turretin's technical categories, showing continuity of intent but difference in method.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes the "substance of the covenant" as an interpretive key to reconcile promise-centered assurance with covenantal obligation - a bridge between catechetical theology and scholastic precision.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Useful to historians and theologians re-evaluating early Reformed writers as formative for later orthodoxy. Influential in debates about whether Reformed orthodoxy taught any form of merit; supports the position that later merit distinctions are explanatory, not corrective, of earlier pastoral language.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Clarifies pastoral origins of covenant language and provides a model for reading early Reformed theology on justification, sanctification, and reward without conflating charity/obedience with meritorious causes of salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Substance of the covenant:** The essential content promised (Christ and his righteousness); Clark treats this as central to Olevian.
- **Administration of the covenant:** The outward forms, obligations, and sacraments; distinguished from substance to avoid confounding means with meritorious cause.
- **Promise vs. Condition:** Promise = God's gift in Christ; Condition = moral covenant obligations - Olevian frames obligations as required but not earning justification.
- **Imputation:** Christ's righteousness reckoned to believers; the ground of justification in Olevian's and later Turretin's schema.
- **Good works:** Necessary fruits and duties of covenant life; in Olevian's view they evidence covenant fidelity but do not condignly merit salvation.
- **Merit (condign vs. congruous):** 
 - Condign merit = deserving of wage in strict justice (denied as source of salvation). 
 - Congruous merit = fitting reward by God's good pleasure (used by Turretin to explain reward without making works a ground of salvation).
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace:** Federative framework clarified by Olevian's emphasis on promise and by Turretin's later scholastic refinement.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration based on imputed righteousness, not the intrinsic quality of works.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive obedience that is necessary and rewarded but non-meritorious for justification.
- **Federal headship:** Representative union (Christ vs. Adam) underlying imputation language.
- **Catechetical-pastoral theology:** Mode of expression for Olevian; shapes how covenant substance is taught to congregations.
- **Scholastic clarification:** Turretin's role in rendering pastoral distinctions into technical metaphysical categories.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition source** for the early-Reformed sense of "substance of the covenant" (promise-centered). 
- As a **polemic resource** against readings that ascribe meritorious soteriology to early Reformers. 
- As an **exegetical-historical model** linking pastoral catechesis (Olevian) to later scholastic systematization (Turretin), useful for teaching continuity in Reformed doctrine.
