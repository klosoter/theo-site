### TITLE
Technology And Religion: Remaining Human In A Co-Created World - Noreen L. Herzfeld

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early twenty-first century conversation at the intersection of theology, computer science, and science-and-technology studies (STS).
 - Responds to rapid developments in information technology, AI, and biotechnology and to philosophical critiques of technology (e.g., Heidegger) while drawing on theological resources.
 - Aimed at interdisciplinary readers: theologians, ethicists, scientists, and designers.

- **Central thesis**
 - Technology is not merely neutral instrument but participates in the ongoing act of creation; humans are co-creators with God and with technological artefacts. Theology must reconceive human identity, agency, and responsibility so that we can "remain human" in a co-created world.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary accounts either romanticize or demonize technology; both fail to account for technologies as active mediators of human being and world-making.
 - Theological reframe: Read doctrines of creation and imago Dei so they account for *co-creation* - humans are made for collaborative partnership with God and with created means.
 - Ethical implications: If technologies participate in shaping persons and societies, moral responsibility extends to design, deployment, and social structuring of technologies.
 - Practical theology: Proposes virtues and habits (humility, accountability, prudence) for technologists, theologians, and communities to sustain human flourishing.
 - Concludes with case-oriented reflection on AI, robotics, and biotechnologies as testing grounds for the approach.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Broad engagement with STS and philosophy of technology (e.g., Heideggerian critiques, Bruno Latour-style mediations), theologians who treat science-technology relations (e.g., Philip Hefner-style "created co-creator" themes), and contemporary debates in AI and bioethics.
 - Draws on biblical-theological motifs (creation, stewardship) and on interdisciplinary empirical examples from computing and biology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation**: reframed as ongoing and relational rather than a closed past event.
 - **Imago Dei**: reinterpreted to stress vocation and relational agency rather than static status.
 - **Providence and agency**: explores divine action in a world where human/technological agency is distributed.
 - **Ethics and eschatology**: gestures toward responsible telos for human-technology co-flourishing.
 - **Revelation**: treated implicitly in questions about where meaning and discernment about tech arise (scripture, tradition, practical wisdom).

- **Closing line**
 - Technology compels a theological shift: to remain human is to accept our vocation as responsible co-creators within God's creative economy, cultivating moral practices and designs that sustain human dignity and communal flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, sustained claim that technologies are participants in creation - not mere tools - and thus require theological account.
 - Focus on vocational and communal dimensions of imago Dei: being human is a task to be performed well, particularly in technological contexts.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both triumphalist techno-utopianism and deterministic or "anti-technology" readings (e.g., crude Heideggerian enframing) by insisting on agency distribution and human responsibility.
 - Refines Philip Hefner's "created co-creator" by centering ethical formation and design practices rather than merely descriptive anthropology.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Popularizes language of a "co-created world" and advances a theology of technological mediation and distributed agency.
 - Moves theological attention from abstract metaphysics to practical design ethics and communal habit formation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in theology-of-technology circles, ethics of AI, and courses that pair theology with computer science/engineering.
 - Less uptake in strictly confessional or anti-modern theological milieus but valued in interdisciplinary academic theology and ethicist communities.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a portable framework for integrating doctrinal claims about creation and imago Dei with concrete technology debates.
 - Useful for pedagogical introduction, for shaping ethic-of-design conversations, and for prompting theological formation geared to technological professions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Co-creation**
 - Humans and technologies participate with God in ongoing creative work; creation is open and relational.
- **Remaining human**
 - Ethical and spiritual imperative: to preserve human dignity and vocation in the face of technological reconfiguration.
- **Technological mediation**
 - Idea that technologies mediate perception, action, and social relations; they shape human experience and agency.
- **Distributed agency**
 - Agency is shared among humans, artifacts, institutions, and sometimes nonhuman actors; responsibility must track this distribution.
- **Imago Dei (vocational reading)**
 - Emphasizes role and vocation (co-worker, steward) rather than merely ontological status.
- **Design ethics**
 - Moral responsibility embedded in the design process; technical choices instantiate normative priorities.
- **Moral formation / virtues for technologists**
 - Humility, prudence, accountability, and attentiveness as necessary virtues for those who shape technologies.
- **Sacramentality of artifacts (analogical use)**
 - Artifacts as loci where human meaning and values are incarnated; not literal sacraments but formative mediators.
- **Providence in a technological age**
 - Rethinks divine action alongside human-technological agency without lapsing into determinism or deism.
- **Tool vs. participant distinction**
 - Moves beyond binary: tools can become participants in shaping persons and contexts.
- **Practical theology of design**
 - Calls for theological engagement in engineering curricula and tech policy to guide co-creation responsibly.
- **Ethics of attention and discernment**
 - Emphasizes slow, communal discernment about adoption and deployment of technologies.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "co-creation" and theological readings of technological mediation in ethics syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against instrumentalist and determinist accounts of technology in theological anthropology debates.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in interdisciplinary programs: bridges theology with computer science, design ethics, and STS for curricular development.
