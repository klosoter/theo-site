### TITLE
**Principles of Conduct** (John Murray, 1957) - A biblical-ethical synthesis from creation to consummation, arguing that Christian morality is grounded in revelation, covenant, and union with Christ.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Westminster Seminary ethos; postwar moral tumult; rise of neo-orthodoxy and ethical relativism; Reformed retrieval of creational and covenantal categories.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Christian ethics is revelational, covenantal, and Christocentric:** the commands that bind the believer are grounded in God's character, disclosed in Scripture, structured by creation ordinances, fulfilled in Christ, and empowered in union with him.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Revelation and authority:** Scripture is the principium cognoscendi for ethics; general revelation is real but normed by special revelation.
 - **Creation ordinances:** marriage, labor/dominion, procreation, and Sabbath as abiding moral structures.
 - **Law and grace:** moral law's continuity; grace does not annul but establishes obedience; the redemptive indicatives ground the imperatives.
 - **Worship and the first table:** exclusive worship, prohibition of images, sanctity of God's name, sanctification of the Lord's Day.
 - **Life together and the second table:** sanctity of life (including civil sanctions), sexual fidelity, property, truth, contentment, oaths and vows.
 - **Christ and the Christian life:** imitation of God and Christ, fear of God, love as fulfillment of the law, life in the Spirit.
 - **Eschatological orientation:** the pilgrim people live between the times; hope clarifies and intensifies moral obligation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy exegesis of Genesis, Decalogue, wisdom literature, Sermon on the Mount, Pauline paraenesis; engagement with Calvin and Reformed confessions; contrasts with antinomianism, legalism, and neo-orthodox ambivalence toward law.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology:** sufficiency and clarity of Scripture for ethics.
 - **Anthropology/Creation:** image of God, dominion, male-female complementarity.
 - **Covenant theology:** creation ordinances and moral law within covenantal history.
 - **Christology/Soteriology:** union with Christ, redemption as ground for new obedience, Spirit-wrought sanctification.
 - **Ecclesiology/Worship:** regulative concerns, Lord's Day, corporate holiness.
 - **Eschatology:** moral seriousness under judgment and hope of consummation.
- **Closing line**
 - **Ethics is the grateful conformity of redeemed image-bearers to the holy God, from creation's order through redemption's grace unto glory's consummation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Creation-Redemption-Eschatology axis:** moral norms are creational, confirmed and elevated in redemption, directed toward the eschaton.
 - **Abiding validity of the moral law** with a robust case for the Christian Sabbath/Lord's Day.
 - **Fear of God and imitation of God/Christ** as master-motifs, not mere rules but filial reverence shaping conduct.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **antinomianism:** grace establishes obedience; faith does not dissolve law.
 - Against **legalism and externalism:** obedience is evangelical, arising from union with Christ and the Spirit's work.
 - Against **relativism/neo-orthodox ambivalence:** clear, revealed norms over situational elasticity.
 - Against **dispensational abrogation of law:** continuity of the Decalogue's moral substance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Consolidation of **creation ordinances** as normative; careful articulation of **Lord's Day transposition**; systematic use of **indicative-imperative** logic in ethics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard text in Reformed ethics; widely mined for Sabbath theology, marriage and divorce, oaths, sanctity of life, and truth-telling; informs Westminster-influenced seminaries and pastors; cited for exegetical method and covenantal grounding.
- **Enduring value**
 - Integrates exegesis and dogmatics; balances creational givens with redemptive power; provides clear, pastorally oriented norms without moralism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation ordinances:** creational structures (marriage, labor, procreation, Sabbath) that remain morally binding.
- **Moral law (Decalogue):** abiding norm revealing God's character; distinguished from civil/ceremonial.
- **Law and grace:** grace renews and empowers obedience; no ethical antithesis.
- **Indicative and imperative:** God's saving acts and identity statements ground commands.
- **Fear of God:** filial reverence as a comprehensive ethical disposition.
- **Imitation of God/Christ:** patterning conduct after God's holiness and Christ's self-giving.
- **Union with Christ:** ethical source and sphere; sanctification as participation in Christ.
- **Lord's Day/Sabbath:** creational and redemptive rest and worship, transposed to the first day.
- **Sanctity of life:** image-of-God grounding for prohibitions on murder and rationale for measured civil sanctions.
- **Truth and oath:** integrity in speech; lawful oaths and vows under God's name.
- **Marriage covenant:** monogamous, indissoluble except for narrowly defined biblical exceptions; sexual ethics rooted in creation.
- **Christian liberty:** freedom from human traditions and from sin for service to God.
- **Idolatry and images:** exclusive worship; rejection of images of God in worship.
- **Dominion/culture mandate:** responsible stewardship of creation under God's authority.
- **Pilgrim eschatology:** conduct shaped by the coming judgment and hope of glory.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Sabbath, marriage, oaths, and truth-telling.
 - As a **polemic** against antinomianism, relativism, and law abrogation.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Decalogue, creation, and New Testament paraenesis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** tying creation ordinances to union-with-Christ ethics under an eschatological horizon.
