### TITLE
**The Christian Faith and the Modern Mind (secondary)** - Friedrich Schleiermacher: sketch and analysis focused on Science and Scripture (Genesis 1-11)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century Germany (post-Enlightenment, Romantic reaction). Schleiermacher writes from the intersection of Kantian epistemology, Romantic sensibility, and rising historical-critical scholarship (c. 1799-1821 foundational writings; "The Christian Faith" 1821-22 as capstone).
 - Theological milieu: challenge to confessional orthodoxy and rationalist deism; need to make Christianity intelligible to the "modern mind."

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity must be reconceived so that its center is the religious consciousness - the *feeling of absolute dependence* - rather than a set of propositional metaphysics. This recasting allows a faithful appropriation of scripture and Christian doctrine in light of modern science and historical criticism, especially where Genesis 1-11 appears to conflict with natural knowledge.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Religious knowledge is rooted primarily in immediate religious experience (Gefuhl), not speculative metaphysics or external proof.
 - Revelation is the self-manifestation of God in and through religious consciousness, historically mediated by Christ; Scripture is the record/witness of such revelation, not the revelation itself.
 - Biblical narratives (e.g., Genesis 1-11) function as **mythic/poetic vehicles** conveying religious truth about dependence, finitude, sin, and redemption rather than scientific or literalist accounts of origins.
 - Consequently, modern scientific accounts of origins do not necessarily threaten the theological content of Genesis when the latter is read as theological narrative, not natural science.
 - Practical outcome: dogmas (Trinity, Christology, sin, redemption) are retained but reinterpreted as expressions of redeemed religious consciousness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit interlocutors: Kant (epistemology), Enlightenment rationalists, Biblical literalists, early historical-critical exegetes.
 - Engages patristic and Reformation doctrinal categories but reframes them within Romantic hermeneutics and inwardness.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, creation, original sin, Christology (Christ as revelation and exemplar of perfect dependence), Trinity (analytic/relational account), soteriology (renewal of consciousness).

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher centers theology on transformed religious consciousness: Scripture and Genesis 1-11 teach the shape of dependence and redemption, not a handbook of natural science; thus faith and the modern mind are reconciled by a hermeneutic that privileges inner religiosity over literalist externalism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Religio-affective epistemology**: faith as experiential feeling (Gefuhl) of absolute dependence is primary.
 - **Scripture as witness, not identity** with revelation: the Bible testifies to God's self-communication in human experience, and so admits historical and literary plurality.
 - **Mythic/poetic reading of primeval history**: Genesis 1-11 functions theologically, not scientifically.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both confessional literalism (which posits scriptural infallibility in all claims) and rationalist reductionism (which reduces religion to ethics or mere reason).
 - Contrasts with Hegelian speculative system-building by refusing to subordinate personal religious feeling to abstract metaphysical synthesis.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reassertion of **"absolute dependence"** as theological nucleus.
 - Reframing of **revelation** as an existential, historical mediation rather than propositional dictation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to 19th-century Liberal Protestantism and modern Protestant theology; formative for hermeneutics, pastoral theology, and theological method.
 - Criticized by confessional conservatives for subjectivizing doctrine; praised by modern exegetes and theologians seeking engagement with science.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for theology that respects scientific knowledge while preserving theological distinctives by reframing biblical genres and revelation.
 - Valuable for teaching hermeneutics, theology of revelation, and science-religion dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gefuhl (feeling)** - the basic datum of religion: immediate, non-propositional awareness of dependence.
- **Absolute dependence** - Schleiermacher's theological center: human relation to God as foundational experience.
- **Revelation** - God's self-manifestation in and through religious consciousness and history; mediated rather than identical with Scripture.
- **Scripture as witness/testimony** - Biblical texts testify to revelation; their historical and literary forms must be critically discerned.
- **Myth / primeval history** - Genesis 1-11 interpreted as theological-poetic narrative conveying existential truth, not scientific report.
- **Accommodation** - theological explanation for divergences between biblical language and scientific description; Scripture communicates in forms intelligible to human contexts.
- **Christ as redeemer/exemplar** - Christ manifests perfect dependence and redeems human consciousness; revelation is centered in the person of Christ.
- **Original sin (psychological/relational account)** - sin conceived as egocentric self-consciousness and alienation, not merely inherited juridical guilt.
- **Hermeneutical method** - emphasis on historical-critical reading combined with theological sensitivity to existential meaning.
- **Mediation / mediating theism** - Schleiermacher's attempt to mediate between Enlightenment critique and confessional orthodoxy.
- **Non-overlap of methodological aims** - science explains empirical processes; theology interprets existential meaning and origin narratives.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for liberal/progressive theology emphasizing experience and hermeneutics.
- As a **polemic** against biblical literalism and rationalist reductionism in debates over Genesis 1-11.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading primeval narratives as theological-poetic material compatible with scientific accounts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on revelation, theology and modernity, and the science-religion interface.
