### TITLE
The Existence and Attributes of God (Discourses II-VI) - Stephen Charnock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-century English Puritan / Reformed milieu; lectures collected and published posthumously (1682). Charnock writes as a pastor-theologian addressing pastoral, polemical, and scholastic needs of nonconformist audiences after the Restoration.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To demonstrate that God exists and to explicate the divine nature by distinguishing and defining His attributes so that believers may both know God truly and worship aright. Particular emphasis on how divine perfections relate to God's essence and to creatures.
- **Core argument / structure (Discourses II-VI)**
 - Discourse II: **Absolute vs. Relative Attributes** - establishes method: attributes examined in themselves (absolute/incommunicable) and as they relate to creatures (relative/communicable).
 - Discourses III-VI: systematic treatment of chief incommunicable attributes: **simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility**, showing their logical interdependence and pastoral implications.
 - Shows attributes are not parts but identical with divine essence (simplicity).
 - From simplicity follows aseity (self-existence), then immutability (unchangeableness), and impassibility (freedom from creaturely passions).
 - Argues for coherent theological account that preserves transcendence without making God cold or remote.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scriptural exegesis is primary; engages patristic and scholastic categories (Augustine, Aquinas style categories), Reformed authorities implicitly (Calvinic emphases), and opposes contemporary errors: Socinianism, deism, anthropomorphism, and anti-Trinitarian reductions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (how God is known), doctrine of God (essence and attributes), and implications for worship, providence, and prayer. Trinitarian presuppositions shape but do not dominate these particular discourses.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Charnock insists that a right knowledge of God's simple, self-existing, immutable, and impassible nature is foundational to true worship, sound doctrine, and proper reliance upon God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the **identity of essence and attributes**: attributes are not separable qualities but the very being of God - used to combat any composite or anthropomorphic conceptions.
 - Pastoral register: theological precision married to devotional aims - knowledge of attributes is meant to deepen prayer, faith, and consolation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Counters both scholastic tendencies to reify attributes into parts and modern tendencies (deists, anthropomorphizers) to reduce God to naturalistic processes or human passions.
 - Clarifies and often sharpens Calvinic language on immutability and simplicity against sloppy analogies that imply change or composition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear twofold taxonomy (absolute/relative) applied as a hermeneutical rule for speaking about God; careful linking of aseity, simplicity, immutability, impassibility as mutually reinforcing.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed pastoral and systematic theology; frequently cited in later Puritan and Reformed writings for clear expositions of incommunicable attributes.
 - Used by preachers and pastors as an accessible yet rigorous account of how doctrine informs devotion.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how rigorous metaphysical claims about God can be integrated with pastoral concern; remains a go-to resource for teaching classical theism in Reformed contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes**
 - Qualities of God considered in Himself (e.g., simplicity, aseity, immutability); grounding for metaphysical claims about divine being.
- **Relative attributes**
 - Attributes considered in relation to creatures (e.g., mercy, justice, truth); explain God's actions toward creation without altering His essence.
- **Simplicity**
 - God is not composed of parts; attributes are identical with the divine essence, preventing any internal division or potentiality.
 - Contrast: opposed to any notion of metaphysical composition or "parts" in God.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; God is the fountain of being, not caused or sustained by anything external.
 - Practical import: grounds absolute divine freedom and sufficiency in worship.
- **Immutability**
 - God is unchangeable in His being, will (properly understood), and promises; change would imply defect or potentiality.
 - Qualified nuance: God is immutable in nature though He may act variably within providence toward creatures.
- **Impassibility**
 - God does not experience passion or emotional perturbation as creatures do; divine "affections" are not passive sufferings but morally ordered dispositions.
 - Distinguish from denial of relational responsiveness - God is relationally active without being passively affected.
- **Essence-attributes identity**
 - The doctrine that attributes are not additions but fully identical with God's essence; central to Charnock's argument for unity and simplicity.
- **Communicable vs. incommunicable attributes**
 - Communicable: those we can share analogically (wisdom, goodness); incommunicable: those unique to God (aseity, simplicity).
- **Eternity / Timelessness**
 - Treated as related to immutability: God's existence is not temporal change; eternity secures faithfulness and unchanging counsel.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** in systematic theology for incommunicable/communicable distinctions and classical theism.
 - As a **polemic tool** against anthropomorphism, deism, process theology, and reduced conceptions of divine change.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading anthropomorphic biblical texts: balance literal speech with metaphysical correction.
 - As a **pastoral/conceptual pivot** linking doctrinal precision to prayer, consolation, and pastoral counsel.
