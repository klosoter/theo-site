### TITLE
The "Republication" of the Covenant of Works in the Westminster Confession of Faith and in Seventeenth‑Century Reformed Orthodoxy (Mark Jones, JETS 53.4, 2010)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early modern Reformed theology (17th century), post‑Westminster reaction and consolidation.
 - Jones reads the Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF) in conversation with broader Reformed orthodoxy (British and continental) where disputes about law, gospel, and covenant theology were active.
 - Polemical background: debates with Arminians, Socinians, and alternate covenant schemes (e.g., Cocceian variants).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jones argues that the Westminster divines and many seventeenth‑century Reformed theologians accepted a qualified doctrine of **republication**: the Mosaic law functions in some respects as a re‑publication (or re‑enactment) of the **covenant of works** without thereby collapsing the Mosaic covenant into the original Adamic covenant or denying the centrality of the covenant of grace.
 - The key issue: how to account for the law's demand of perfect obedience under Moses while upholding a distinctive covenant of grace mediated in Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical trace: Jones maps how the language and logic of republication appears in divines' exegesis and systematic theology.
 - Analytical distinctions:
 - **Adamic covenant of works**: original, antecedent covenant requiring perfect obedience.
 - **Republication**: Mosaic law's function of re‑enforcing the works principle pedagogically or diagnostically, not identical ontologically to the Adamic covenant.
 - **Degrees of republication**: full juridical re‑imposition versus didactic/typological use (Jones argues Westminster leans to the latter).
 - Demonstrative evidence: careful readings of WCF chapters and representative authors showing consistent nuance - affirmation of a covenant of works and an acknowledgment that the law under Moses sometimes serves to expose sin and renew the works‑condition in a temporary fashion.
 - Polemical consequence: republication explains why Paul's critique of law‑works remains robust while contemporaries could still speak of the law's threatening, condemnatory role under Moses.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary focus: Westminster Confession and writings of the Westminster divines.
 - Secondary corpus: seventeenth‑century Reformed theologians (e.g., John Owen, Francis Turretin, William Ames, Samuel Rutherford and others across British and continental contexts).
 - Polemical interlocutors: Arminians, Socinians, and covenant theorists who either denied a covenant of works or reinterpreted the Mosaic covenant.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Adamic covenant of works, covenant of grace)
 - Law and gospel distinction; the Mosaic law and its functions
 - Soteriology (works vs grace), anthropology (sin) and pedagogy of law

- **Closing line**
 - Jones locates the WCF within a **mediated republication** tradition: Reformed orthodoxy held the Mosaic law's re‑enactment of a works‑demand as real and useful for exposing sin and administering condemnation, yet strictly subordinated this to the unbroken priority and sufficiency of the covenant of grace in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Jones emphasizes a middle path: republication as **functional and pedagogical**, not ontologically identical to the Adamic covenant.
 - He stresses the WCF's careful balancing - affirming both an historical covenant of works and the practical role of the Mosaic law without conflating covenants.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Counteracts caricatures that either (a) read Westminster as collapsing Mosaic law into a full covenant of works, or (b) deny any notion of republication among the divines.
 - Clarifies that earlier scholarship overstated polarization; Jones shows nuance in primary texts.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines the analytic vocabulary around "republication" by distinguishing **juridical republication** (full re‑imposition of works) from **didactic/diagnostic republication** (law's pedagogy to show sin).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful corrective in WCF scholarship and studies of law/gospel relations.
 - Cited in subsequent work on covenant theology, Pauline doctrine of law, and historiography of Reformed orthodoxy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a tight, document‑based model for reading WCF in its confessional and polemical milieu; valuable for courses on covenant theology, Reformed systematic theology, and history of doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Republication** - the thesis that the Mosaic law re‑enacts the works principle of the Adamic covenant in some operative sense.
 - Juridical republication: full, renewed covenant of works (Jones argues this is not Westminster's posture).
 - Didactic/diagnostic republication: law's pedagogical role to unveil sin and prepare conscience for grace (primary emphasis).
- **Covenant of works** - the original covenant with Adam requiring perfect obedience for life.
- **Covenant of grace** - covenant administered in Christ, the means of salvation by promise and faith.
- **Mosaic law** - the law delivered at Sinai; subject of republication debates regarding its function and relation to Adamic requirements.
- **Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF)** - confessional locus analyzed for its implicit and explicit treatment of republication.
- **Reformed orthodoxy** - 17th‑century theological milieu surveyed for doctrinal patterns and authorship.
- **Didactic function of law** - law educates, exposes sin, and drives to Christ; central to Jones's reading.
- **Nomistic/legalist reading** - the interpretation that sees Mosaic law purely as a works covenant (Jones treats this as an overstatement of some contemporaries' rhetoric, not WCF's conclusion).
- **Federal theology** - the broader covenantal framework within which republication arguments operate.
- **Polemical contexts** - debates with Arminians, Socinians, and covenant innovators that shaped theological formulations.
- **Typology / pedagogy** - ways the law functions to prefigure Christ and instruct the believer.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **historical‑theological definition source** for what "republication" meant in the Westminster and post‑Westminster era.
 - As a **polemic/clarifying tool** in debates about law and gospel to rebut both extreme legalism and dismissals of covenantal continuity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline critiques of law alongside Reformed confessional statements.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching covenant theology - exemplifies how careful distinctions preserve both the condemning power of law and the priority of grace.
