### TITLE
Adoption - Vern Poythress (entry in New Dictionary of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical scholarship; concise dictionary entry aimed at pastors, students, and scholars needing a compact, theologically precise synthesis. Reflects Poythress's broader method of careful biblical-theological and covenantal analysis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Adoption is a multifaceted Pauline doctrine that must be understood both as a legal/forensic bestowal of family status and as a rich relational, pneumatological, and eschatological reality grounded in union with Christ and divine election.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition and biblical data: surveys Pauline usages (notably Romans 8, Galatians 4, Ephesians 1) and the NT suffused with filial language.
 - Forensic/declarative dimension: God legally grants children status (adoption as an act of divine will and decree).
 - Relational/experiential dimension: adoption issues in loving communion, prayer (addressing God as Father), sanctification, and assurance via the Spirit's witness.
 - Eschatological/inheritance dimension: adoption points to full consummation - inheritance as future hope as well as present possession.
 - Theological grounding: ties adoption to union with Christ, election, and Trinitarian economy (Father chooses, Son secures, Spirit applies).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary engagement with Pauline texts; dialogue implicitly with classical Reformed interpreters (Calvin, Murray), patristic uses of filial imagery, and contemporary evangelical treatments emphasizing either narrow forensic or overly domestic metaphors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (justification and sanctification), covenant theology, Christology (atonement as basis for adoption), pneumatology (Spirit's witness), ecclesiology (corporate sonship), eschatology (inheritance, glorification), and Trinitarian economy.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Adoption is the divinely willed conferral of filial status in Christ - a forensic declaration rooted in union with the Son and applied by the Spirit that produces present filial life and guarantees future inheritance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Balanced insistence that adoption is simultaneously legal and relational - neither mere forensic transaction nor only metaphorical intimacy.
 - Clear Trinitarian mapping: Father as sender/chooser, Son as procuring the right, Spirit as witness and applicator.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects views that isolate adoption from justification or reduce it to sentimental language; stresses its covenantal and soteriological grounding.
 - Pushes back against individualistic readings by emphasizing corporate and covenantal aspects of sonship (church as body).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Treats adoption as a locus where **status** (legal declaration) and **relations** (domestic fellowship) intersect; highlights how Pauline language welds these ideas rather than setting them in opposition.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used as a succinct, orthodox reference among Reformed and evangelical students and pastors; valued for clarity and theological economy rather than groundbreaking novelty.
 - Cited in teaching contexts and introductory expositions on adoption as a doctrine linked to union with Christ.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a reliable, balanced template for integrating exegetical data with systematic categories; excellent for sermon preparation, classroom summaries, and as a corrective to imbalanced emphases.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adoption:** The divine act of constituting believers as children of God; both declarative and relational.
- **Sonship / Filial status:** The identity conferred by adoption; entails privileges, duties, and intimacy with God.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological basis for adoption - what makes believers eligible for filial status.
- **Justification vs. Adoption:** Distinct but related - justification concerns legal acquittal; adoption concerns conferment of family status and privileges.
- **Election / Predestination:** Adoption is portrayed as grounded in the Father's eternal choice (linked to Eph 1).
- **Spirit's witness / Application:** The Spirit testifies to sonship and effects the believer's appropriation of the status (Rom 8).
- **Inheritance:** The eschatological outworking of adoption; present entitlement and future possession.
- **Forensic/legal dimension:** Emphasizes the declarative, judicial act of God conferring family standing.
- **Relational/domestic dimension:** Emphasizes intimacy, prayer as "Abba, Father," and ongoing filial life.
- **Corporate sonship / ecclesiology:** Adoption locates believers within the family-body of Christ, not only individual status.
- **Eschatological fulfillment:** Adoption points forward to consummated sonship in glory.
- **Covenant framework:** Adoption is embedded in covenantal promises and corporate identity.
- **Pastoral implications:** Grounds assurance, prayer life, and ethical filial conduct.
- **Biblical loci:** Primary reliance on Pauline passages (Romans 8, Galatians 4, Ephesians 1) as exegetical anchors.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for theological summaries and syllabi.
- As an **exegetical-model** reconciler connecting Pauline texts to systematic categories (union with Christ, Spirit application).
- As a **pastoral/theological pivot** for sermons and teaching on assurance, prayer, and Christian identity.
