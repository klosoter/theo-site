### TITLE
The Christological Confession of the World Council of Churches (1952) - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar ecumenical context; World Council of Churches adopting a concise Christological confession (early 1950s) intended as a common formula of faith.
 - Bultmann writes as a leading New Testament scholar and proponent of existentialist interpretation and demythologization; engages a modern-critical audience skeptical of metaphysical assertions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Can a contemporary, critical theology consistently affirm the church's traditional Christological confession (e.g., "true God and true man", Chalcedonian vocabulary) without reverting to pre-critical metaphysics? Bultmann argues the confession must be reunderstood as kerygmatic confession about the Christ-event rather than as ontological metaphysics.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Traditional formulations (Chalcedon-type language, hypostatic union read ontologically) risk turning salvific proclamation into speculative metaphysics unintelligible to modern hearers.
 - Reinterpretation: The confession should be read existentially - as a statement about God's revelatory act in the person of Jesus (the Christ-event), not as a metaphysical description of two natures fused in one substratum.
 - Theological method: Return to New Testament kerygma and the existential appropriation of revelation; prioritize proclamation (kerygma) and faith response over philosophical ontology.
 - Practical implication: Confessional language must be refurbished so it witnesses to God's act without importing Greek metaphysical categories as literal explanations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts implicitly with Chalcedonian tradition and patristic formulations; contrasts with the ontological readings of classical dogmatics (and certain modern defenders of Chalcedon).
 - Dialogues with contemporaries who insist on doctrinal metaphysics (e.g., Barthian emphases on the person of Christ as unique self-determination of God), while proposing a distinct New Testament-centered hermeneutic.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): nature of the person of Christ, meaning of "Word became flesh", relation of divine revelation to historical Jesus.
 - **Revelation** and kerygma: how God's self-disclosure is proclaimed and appropriated.
 - **Anthropology and soteriology** implicit: human response to the Christ-event.
 - **Trinity and hypostatic language** receive critical attention insofar as church formulas employ them.
- **Closing line**
 - Bultmann centers the confession on the **Christ-event as kerygmatic revelation**, urging that the hypostatic language be read as faith-language about God's act rather than as metaphysical description.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations**
 - Strong insistence that confessional statements are existential proclamations (kerygma), not metaphysical reportage; theology must translate confession into meaningful contemporary existential categories.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects classical dogmatic readings that treat the hypostatic union as a metaphysical ontological fact describable in Hellenistic terms; opposes readings that detach confession from the New Testament proclamation.
 - Contrasts with theologians who reassert Chalcedonian ontology as decisive for contemporary doctrine; proposes methodological reorientation to kerygma.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "incarnation" and "hypostatic union" as confessional categories indexing an event of divine revelation, not technical ontology.
 - Emphasizes "Christ-event" as the central locus of theological reflection rather than "person" in metaphysical sense.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked debate: praised by scholars sympathetic to demythologization and existential hermeneutics; criticized by proponents of robust dogmatic metaphysics (including some in Reformed and Barthian camps) for relativizing classical formulations.
 - Influenced later constructive theologians who sought to articulate confession in historically aware, existentially intelligible terms; also catalyzed ecumenical reflection on how to state common faith in pluralistic contexts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Stimulates careful distinction between confession-as-witness and metaphysical system-building; valuable for teaching the hermeneutical move from New Testament proclamation to dogmatic formulation and for probing limits of doctrinal language in pluralistic modernity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Bultmann: warns against reading it as an ontological metaphysical formula; prefers to treat it as confessional language signifying the unity of God's revelatory act in Jesus.
- **Christ-event**
 - Central token: the historical act (life, death, resurrection) in which God is proclaimed to have acted - primary locus of confession.
- **Kerygma**
 - Proclamation of Jesus as Lord and Christ; the hermeneutical priority for interpreting confessions.
- **Demythologization**
 - Methodological backdrop: stripping mythic elements to reveal existential meaning of proclamation.
- **Incarnation / "Word became flesh"**
 - Read existentially: statement about God's self-communication in Jesus, not immediate metaphysical ontology.
- **Person (hypostasis) vs. Nature (physis)**
 - Bultmann challenges static metaphysical pairing as the first explanatory move for modern theology; wants these terms retained only as faithful confessional pointers.
- **Revelation**
 - Event-centered, kerygmatic, and existentially appropriated rather than philosophically framed.
- **Confession**
 - Faithful witness language that functions to elicit existential response; not primarily a metaphysical description.
- **Historical Jesus**
 - Emphasized insofar as the Christ-event is anchored in the history of Jesus but interpreted as revelatory, not merely historical data.
- **Existential appropriation**
 - The believer's reception and understanding of the Christ-event; central to Bultmann's theological method.
- **Ontological reading**
 - Term of critique: the problematic interpretation that turns confessional language into metaphysical statements.
- **Chalcedonian formula**
 - Treated as a historically weighty confessional expression requiring hermeneutical translation for modern proclamation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for reading confessional formulas existentially (not as canonical metaphysics).
- As a **polemic** against ontological/metaphysical readings of the hypostatic union in modern dogmatics.
- As an **exegetical model** for moving from New Testament kerygma to doctrinal language.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical and methodological debates about how to state common Christological faith in a critical age.
