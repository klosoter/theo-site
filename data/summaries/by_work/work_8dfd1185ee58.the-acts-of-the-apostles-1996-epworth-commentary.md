### TITLE
The Acts of the Apostles (Epworth Commentary, 1996) - James D. G. Dunn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century British New Testament scholarship; Dunn writes as a leading historical-critical scholar engaged with the "Third Quest" for early Christianity and renewed interest in Luke-Acts as theological historiography. Pastoral and ecumenical readership (Epworth) shapes accessible but rigorous tone.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Luke-Acts presents a coherent, Spirit-centered narrative that connects Jesus and the church: the Spirit is the decisive agent who mediates Jesus' ministry, the resurrection, and the expansion of the church into Gentile mission. Dunn aims to explicate Luke's theology while defending the narrative unity and historical plausibility of Acts.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Preface and Luke-Acts intention: continuity between Jesus and the church through the Spirit.
 - Jerusalem beginning: witness, Pentecost, and the inauguration of the Spirit-empowered community.
 - Transition to mission: Peter and the opening to Gentiles; Jerusalem Council as theological pivot.
 - Pauline mission: journeys, Spirit-guided strategy, and theological tensions in practice.
 - Concluding theology: Spirit as author of redemptive history, guiding trials and expansion to Rome.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Luke (as authorial voice and theological architect), Peter and Paul (as principal actors), earliest Jewish-Christian contexts, and contemporaneous scholarship (dialogue with commentators who emphasize discontinuity or over-phenomenological readings of the Spirit).
- **Doctrines treated:** **Pneumatology**, Christology (the resurrection and lordship of Jesus), ecclesiology (witness, mission, baptism), soteriology/salvation history, and implicit Trinitarian schema (Spirit as operative person within the Luke narrative).
- **Three topical citations from Dunn (1996):**
 - **Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection** - Dunn reads Luke as attributing Jesus' ministry and vindication at resurrection to the Spirit's power and presence (Dunn, 1996; on Spirit in Jesus' ministry and resurrection).
 - **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** - Dunn explicates Pentecost and the baptism motif as inauguration of the new covenant community distinct from, yet related to, water baptism (Dunn, 1996; on baptism of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost).
 - **The Spirit in redemptive history** - Dunn treats Luke's sweeping narrative as a salvation-historical account where the Spirit directs the progress of redemption from Jerusalem to Rome (Dunn, 1996; on Spirit in redemptive history).
- **Closing line:** Luke-Acts, as Dunn argues, is a Spirit-driven theological history showing the resurrection-empowered Jesus continuing his mission through the church to the ends of the earth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Places the **Spirit** squarely at the theological and narrative center of Acts rather than as occasional charismatic phenomena.
 - Emphasizes **continuity** between Jesus' Spirit-empowered ministry and the church's mission over sharp discontinuity models.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against readings that minimize Luke's theological coherence or treat Pentecost as merely symbolic; also resists readings that reduce Acts to only later ecclesiastical apologetic.
 - Balances between charismatic exuberance and cessationist reductionism: the Spirit is normative for mission and not merely extraordinary show.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Promotes a programmatic reading of **"Spirit as agent of redemptive history"**-a paradigm for interpreting episodes (baptism, signs, guidance) as unified action rather than isolated miracles.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in academic and church circles for clear exegesis and theological integration; used as a standard reference for pneumatological readings of Luke-Acts.
 - Influential among Mainline and evangelical scholars seeking a balanced pneumatology rooted in Luke's narrative.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an exegetically disciplined, theologically rich model for teaching Acts, for preaching on the Spirit, and for mission theology that links resurrection, Spirit, and witness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** - inaugural act at Pentecost marking entry into the new covenant community; distinct from, but related to, water baptism (Dunn emphasizes theological relation and functional distinction).
- **Pentecost** - decisive locus for Luke's theology of the Spirit and the public birth of the church.
- **Spirit as agent** - recurring motif: Spirit initiates, empowers, guides, and authenticates God's saving purposes throughout Acts.
- **Spirit and resurrection** - Dunn reads Luke as connecting the Spirit's role to Jesus' vindication and ongoing presence (Spirit as power of the resurrection).
- **Salvation history (heilsgeschichte)** - narrative frame: history scripted by God and mediated through Spirit-directed events from Jerusalem to Rome.
- **Kerygma (witness/proclamation)** - apostolic preaching shaped and validated by Spirit-enabled witness to Jesus' lordship and resurrection.
- **Charismata (spiritual gifts)** - functional manifestations in service and mission; Dunn treats them as normal within Luke's ecclesial life but subordinate to the Spirit's sovereign direction.
- **Witness (martyria)** - central ecclesial vocation; Spirit empowers public testimony and mission.
- **Inclusio: to the ends of the earth** - mission motif tied to Spirit-driven expansion and Gentile inclusion.
- **Church (ekklesia) as Spirit-community** - community identity by Spirit-bond rather than ethnic/legal markers.
- **Guidance/leadership of the Spirit** - narrative instances (vision, detention, missionary moves) show Spirit as providential director.
- **Law vs. Gospel tension** - Dunn interprets Acts' episodes as negotiated continuity: law retains role but mission redefines covenant boundaries under Spirit.
- **Trinitarian implication** - Luke's account implies a functioning Trinitarian economy (Father sends Son; Son vindicated and continues by Spirit).

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Definition source:** authoritative concise exposition of Luke's pneumatology for teaching on the Spirit.
 - **Exegetical model:** supplies a narrative-structural approach to Acts used in preaching, commentaries, and mission theology.
 - **Polemic/resource:** deployed against caricatures of either extreme charismatic or strict cessationist positions; useful as a measured, text-grounded pivot in pneumatological debates.
