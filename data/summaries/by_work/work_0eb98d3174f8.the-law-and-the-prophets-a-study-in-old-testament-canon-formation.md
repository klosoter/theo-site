### TITLE
The Law and the Prophets: A Study in Old Testament Canon Formation - Stephen B. Chapman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary academic study located in the fields of Old Testament studies, canon studies, and Second Temple Judaism research. Works at the intersection of historical-critical philology, reception history, and social memory approaches to scripture; engages scholarly interest in how communities define and deploy "scripture" prior to fixity of modern canons.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The phrase **"the Law and the Prophets"** is not merely descriptive but constitutive for how Jewish (and later Christian) communities conceptualized, selected, and authorized their scriptural corpus. Chapman argues that canonical identity emerges through the phrase's usage and reception across social and literary contexts, revealing a fluid, performative process of canon formation rather than a single formal act.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Historical-linguistic tracing of the phrase and its variants across Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and early rabbinic sources. 
 - Case studies in Second Temple contexts (Qumran, Philo, Josephus) and New Testament usage to show functional boundaries of the corpus. 
 - Analysis of interpretive communities: how legal and prophetic texts were paired, cited, and used as normative warrants. 
 - Theological implications for authority, revelation, and community memory: canonical status as an effect of sustained communal use and authority claims.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: Hebrew Bible usages, Qumran literature, Philo, Josephus, New Testament authors, rabbinic texts. 
 - Secondary scholarship: canonical and Second Temple scholars in philology, reception history, and textual criticism (engages recent work in canonical studies and history of interpretation).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Scripture and revelation** (how texts function as revealed/trustworthy). 
 - **Canon and authority** (process and loci of authoritative recognition). 
 - **Covenant theology** implicitly, as law/prophetic corpora structure covenantal identity. 
 - Intersection with Christological reading only insofar as New Testament citations reflect canonical assumptions.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Chapman centers theology in the communal recognition and sustained use of texts: "The Law and the Prophets" functions as a social-theological mechanism that produces and sustains the Old Testament as authoritative scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Treats the phrase itself as the primary historical agent of canon formation rather than treating "canon" as a later static category. 
 - Emphasizes **performative and communal** dimensions of canonicity-authority emerges through citation practices and interpretive communities.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against models that posit a single decisive redactional or institutional act that closed the canon; favors *gradual and dialogical* formation. 
 - Contrasts with strictly text-critical approaches that privilege form and redaction over social use.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Use of terms like **"functional canon"** or **"scriptural performativity"** to capture how texts become authoritative by virtue of use, not only by formal inclusion. 
 - Highlights phrase-as-heuristic for tracking boundary-making across communities.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Adopted in recent canonical and reception-history literature as a useful paradigm for studying pre-rabbinic and early Christian scriptural self-understanding. 
 - Gaining traction in courses on canon formation and in debates over how the New Testament authors presupposed Hebrew scriptures.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Supplies a clear methodology for linking linguistic usage to social processes of authority; valuable for philologists, historians, and theologians exploring the ontology of scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"The Law and the Prophets"** - central phrase studied as an engine of canon recognition; marks a functional corpus rather than a fixed list. 
- **Canon formation** - process-oriented understanding emphasizing social practices, not only institutional decrees. 
- **Functional canon** - canonical status as effect of use and citation within communities. 
- **Scriptural performativity** - the idea that citing and interpreting texts enacts their authority. 
- **Second Temple Judaism** - primary historical horizon in which the phrase's canonical work is traced. 
- **Qumran** - case study for competing scriptural collections and community-defining canons. 
- **Nevi'im / Torah / Ketuvim** - classical Jewish divisions analyzed as evolving categories rather than fixed partitions. 
 - Contrast: Chapman highlights how pairings (Law + Prophets) foreground certain pairwise relations over tripartite schemas. 
- **Reception history (receptionio)** - method used to follow how communities reuse texts and phrases to legitimize authority. 
- **Authority** - social and theological claim enacted through citation and interpretation. 
- **Community of interpretation** - the social body that renders texts canonical by sustained practice. 
- **Testimonia** - genre and practice of citing scripture as theorem for argumentation, evidencing performative authority. 
- **Boundary-making** - processes by which certain writings are included/excluded from the authoritative corpus. 
- **Textual plurality** - recognition of multiple textual corpora circulating prior to fixity.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for courses on canon formation emphasizing process and practice. 
 - As a **polemic** against theories of rapid, formal canon closure; used to argue for community-centered authority. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading New Testament citations and for theological reflection on scriptural authority within church traditions.
