### TITLE
Does God Suffer? (2000) - Thomas G. Weinandy, O.F.M.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Turn-of-the-century Catholic systematic theology responding to late 20th-century Protestant and process trends (notably J. Moltmann, process theology, and some open-theist strains).
 - Part of a wider renewal of classical theism within Catholic and ecumenical discussion emphasizing doctrinal precision.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Weinandy argues **no**, God does not suffer in the sense of being passively subject to change, harm, or diminution. Claims that God "suffers" must be carefully qualified so as not to violate divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility.
 - He seeks to preserve both the transcendence and the genuine personal, relational life of God without collapsing into either an unfeeling absolutism or a God made weak by creaturely conditions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify terms: careful analytic distinctions between suffering as passive change, emotional response, and redemptive participation.
 - Philosophical-theological groundwork: defense of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**; assertion that these attributes make ontological suffering impossible.
 - Account of **divine consciousness** and **Trinitarian personhood**: God is personal and conscious, capable of interpersonal love and response without being subject to alteration in his divine nature.
 - Christological clarification: the Son suffers in his human nature; the divine nature does not undergo suffering. Thus God's solidarity with human suffering is historically real (in the Incarnation) but metaphysically non-defective.
 - Exegetical and pastoral implications: biblical anthropomorphisms and apophasis explained analogically; pastoral language about God's compassion is retained but philosophically disciplined.
 - Polemical engagement: critical rebuttals of Moltmann, process theology, and open theism for making God dependent or ontologically mutable.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Aquinas and the scholastic tradition on simplicity and impassibility.
 - Modern interlocutors: Jürgen Moltmann (The Crucified God), process theologians (Whitehead et al.), proponents of divine passibility and some open theists.
 - Contemporary analytic resources on consciousness and personhood are used to bolster Trinitarian account.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology (two natures), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), providence, theodicy, revelation (anthropomorphic language).

- **Closing line**
 - Weinandy locates the book's theological center in a disciplined classical theism: God is supremely personal and responsive yet ontologically impassible; the Incarnation explains divine solidarity without ontological suffering of the divine nature.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates a robust philosophical account of **consciousness** with classical Trinitarian theology to show how God can be relational and responsive without ontological change.
 - Distinguishes carefully between different senses of "suffering" (ontological/passive vs. relational/voluntary/Christological).

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct, systematic critique of Moltmann and process theology: where they read divine suffering as ontological vulnerability, Weinandy sees theological incoherence and threats to divine perfection and aseity.
 - Pushes classical scholastic categories into contemporary theological debate, resisting the trend to sentimentalize divine vulnerability.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a "personalist" impassibility: maintaining impassibility while affirming genuine divine affectivity and relational life through Trinitarian persons and incarnational action.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Catholic and many evangelical circles as a clear corrective to suffering-God theologies.
 - Criticized by liberationist, existential, and some pastoral theologians who prize divine vulnerability as the basis for pastoral solidarity and hope.
 - Used in debates about open theism and in courses contrasting classical theism with process/passibilist models.

- **Enduring value**
 - A precise, philosophically informed defense of classical attributes that is helpful for doctrinal clarity, Christological integrity, and careful pastoral language about God and suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God is not composite; attributes are identical to divine being - hence God cannot be altered by suffering.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; suffering that implies dependency is theologically inadmissible.
- **Immutability**
 - God does not undergo real change; temporal alteration as a mark of suffering conflicts with divine immutability.
- **Impassibility**
 - God does not experience passive suffering; Weinandy defends impassibility while allowing relational responsiveness.
- **Suffering (qualified)**
 - Distinguishes (1) ontological/passive suffering (denied for God) from (2) relational/voluntary, redemptive participation (affirmed in Christ).
- **Divine Consciousness**
 - Central to Weinandy's account: God is conscious/personal in a way compatible with simplicity and immutability.
- **Trinitarian Personhood**
 - The intra-Trinitarian life explains Divine relationality without ontological vulnerability.
- **Incarnation / Two Natures**
 - The Son's human nature suffers; the divine nature does not - key to reconciling solidarity and impassibility.
- **Passibility vs. Impassibility**
 - Technical contrast: passibility as metaphysical susceptibility to harm; impassibility as classical attribute preserved.
- **Anthropomorphism**
 - Scriptural language of God's emotion is analogical, not literal attribution of ontological change.
- **Kenosis (qualified)**
 - Kenotic language must be Christologically constrained; divine self-limitation occurs in the economy without loss of being.
- **Theodicy**
 - Weinandy's approach protects God from culpability implied by ontological suffering while affirming God's compassionate engagement.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical theistic attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
 - As a **polemic** against Moltmannian, process, and open-theist accounts that posit divine ontological suffering.
 - As an **exegetical/Christological model** showing how the Incarnation secures divine solidarity without metaphysical compromise.
