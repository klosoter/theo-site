### TITLE
Prove All Things: The Sovereignty of God in the Baptism and Filling of the Holy Spirit - Martyn Lloyd-Jones (sermons)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century evangelical expository preaching from Westminster Chapel; Lloyd-Jones writes and preaches within Reformed evangelical milieu reacting to both revivalist/charismatic emphases and nominal Christianity. Sermons collected and widely circulated in evangelical circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Holy Spirit's work in baptism and filling is primarily an act of God's sovereign grace that must be biblically discerned and pastorally applied; Christians must seek Spirit-power while resisting sentimentalism, manipulation, and doctrinal error.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation in Acts, John 14-16, 1 Corinthians and Ephesians to distinguish *what* the Spirit does (regeneration, indwelling, baptism, filling, gifting).
 - Clear distinction between *baptism of the Spirit* (an objective act of God, sometimes associated with initiation/empowerment) and *filling* (a recurring experience enabling holy living and witness).
 - Emphasis on God's sovereignty: Spirit-bestowal is by divine will and timing; yet Christians bear responsibility to pray, obey, and cultivate holiness.
 - Pastoral cautions: critique of seeking signs as ends in themselves, warnings against unregulated emotionalism and claims that bypass biblical tests.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Biblical texts (primary), Reformed theologians and Puritan spirituality for pastoral doctrine, contemporary Pentecostal/charismatic movement and Keswick-style teaching as primary interlocutors to correct or refine.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (baptism, filling, gifts), soteriology (regeneration, assurance), sanctification, ecclesiology (witness and mission), Scripture as normative test for experience, Trinity (Spirit's distinct work under Christ's authority).
- **Closing line:** Lloyd-Jones centers the doctrine of Spirit-baptism and filling on the twin realities of divine sovereignty and disciplined Christian responsibility: seek power from God, but test it by Scripture and holy living.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the Spirit's action is sovereign and not reproducible by technique; experience must be subordinated to doctrine.
 - Practical link of Spirit-filling to everyday holiness and witness rather than only to spectacular phenomena.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects charismatic excess by insisting on biblical tests (fruit, alignment with apostolic teaching, edification).
 - Contrasts with purely rationalistic or pietistic accounts by preserving both sovereign gifting and human responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced pastoral differentiation between *baptism* (an authoritative move of God) and *filling* (recurring empowerment), used as a diagnostic tool in pastoral care.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential among conservative evangelicals and Reformed pastors for balanced pneumatology; often cited in critiques of charismatic irregularities and also in evangelical defenses of seeking Spirit-empowerment.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models careful exegesis applied to pastoral theology; supplies language and categories helpful for teaching on Spirit, holiness, and mission without capitulating to extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit:** An act of God inaugurating believers into new covenant life and often associated with empowerment for witness; treated as primarily sovereign and objective.
- **Filling of the Holy Spirit:** A recurrent, experiential enabling for holiness and service; distinct from baptism and to be sought continually.
- **Sovereignty:** God's determinate control over bestowal and timing of Spirit-graces; limits human manipulation.
- **Regeneration:** Spirit-work effecting new birth; foundational to any subsequent Spirit-experience.
- **Sanctification:** Spirit-enabled progressive holiness; the main pastoral aim of being filled.
- **Gifts / Charismata:** Diverse Spirit-graces for the church's edification; evaluated by apostolic criteria and fruit.
 - Sub-contrast: sign gifts (miraculous) versus enduring gifts (teaching, shepherding).
- **Evidence vs. Assurance:** Distinguishes external signs or emotions from inward assurance produced by the Spirit's witness and fruit.
- **Discernment / Testing:** Scriptural standard for validating Spirit-claims (doctrine, fruit, order).
- **Responsibility:** Human duty to pray, repent, and pursue holiness even while acknowledging divine sovereignty.
- **Witness / Power:** Primary pastoral purpose of Spirit-baptism and filling - effective testimony and missionary boldness.
- **Experience vs. Normativity:** Experience is valid but subordinate to normative Scripture and church order.
- **Pastoral prudence:** Requirement to shepherd experiences, not sensationalize them.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity:** Continuity of Spirit's work across ages; discontinuity in manifestations and apostolic foundations.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for classical evangelical pneumatalogy distinguishing baptism vs filling.
 - As a **polemic tool** against unchecked charismatic claims while also providing pastoral bridges for those seeking Spirit-empowerment.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts and Pauline pneumatology with pastoral application in preaching and discipleship.
