### TITLE
New Testament Theology and Ethics - Ben Witherington III

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical scholarship. Witherington writes as an academically trained New Testament scholar working in a broadly Wesleyan-evangelical milieu, bridging historical-critical, socio-rhetorical, and pastoral concerns at a time when narrative and virtue-ethical approaches to biblical ethics gained traction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament presents an integrated theological vision in which Christ-centered narrative, communal formation, and concrete practices together constitute Christian identity and ethics; ethical demands are best understood within the story of God in Christ and the social matrices of the first-century Mediterranean world.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes the narrative and historical framework of the New Testament writings (Jesus, Paul, Luke-Acts, Johannine literature).
 - Uses socio-rhetorical and social-scientific tools to reconstruct first-century ethical norms and the way NT authors reframe these norms for Christian communities.
 - Argues for a virtue- and practice-oriented ethic: holiness, love, justice, and piety are cultivated in community through liturgy, teaching, and disciplines anchored in Christology and eschatology.
 - Defends continuity with Jewish moral traditions while showing substantive transformation through Christ and the Spirit.
 - Applies exegetical conclusions to contemporary ethical questions, emphasizing ecclesial formation over individualistic moralism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Direct engagement with Second Temple Jewish literature, Greco-Roman moral texts, Pauline corpus, Luke-Acts, and Johannine writings; dialogues with contemporary scholars such as N. T. Wright, E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn (New Perspective figures), socio-rhetorical interpreters, and contemporary virtue-ethicists and theologians (e.g., Stanley Hauerwas at points).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, soteriology (justification and participation), pneumatology, ecclesiology (church as ethical community), eschatology (inaugurated/realized future), law and gospel relations, revelation and Scripture, ethics of household and public life, and aspects of Trinitarian theology as they undergird practice.
- **Closing line:** The New Testament's theology and ethics are inseparable: to know God in Christ is to be formed into a community whose practices manifest the coming kingdom now and the consummation to come.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong integration of narrative theology with socio-rhetorical and social-scientific exegesis - ethics are narrative-driven and socially embedded.
 - Emphasis on communal formation, liturgical/disciplinary practices, and household structures as the locus of moral transformation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on overly individualistic moralism and on approaches that divorce ethics from the overarching biblical story.
 - Offers a temperate critique of extremes in the New Perspective on Paul: affirms some corrective insights about Judaism while insisting on Pauline distinctives regarding Christ, participation, and ethic.
 - Contrasts with purely systematic treatments by privileging exegetical emergence of ethical teaching over abstract ethical theorizing.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Promotes the term "ethical narrative" to describe how theology, story, and practice cohere in NT communities.
 - Uses household codes, honor-shame, and patron-client frames consistently as analytical categories for ethical instruction.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical and mainline classrooms as a model of bridging exegesis and ethics; praised for accessibility and pastoral utility.
 - Criticized by some confessional Reformed scholars for not providing a fully developed systematic account of justification or covenantal law.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary integration of textual exegesis and practical theology; a go-to resource for courses on NT ethics, preaching, and pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ethical narrative:** The idea that Christian ethics emerges from the biblical story and shapes community identity.
- **Socio-rhetorical criticism:** Method used to recover social context, rhetorical aims, and communal implications of NT texts.
- **Household codes (oikos ethics):** Attention to domestic structures as primary arenas for moral formation and regulation.
- **Virtue ethics (Christian formation):** Emphasis on character formation (love, courage, temperance, holiness) cultivated within the church.
- **Participation in Christ:** Soteriological construct linking union with Christ to ethical transformation and corporate identity.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The "already/not yet" motif shaping moral urgency and hope-driven ethics.
- **Honor-shame matrix:** Cultural category used to interpret behaviour, exhortation, and social sanctions in NT communities.
- **Law and grace relation:** Nuanced treatment showing continuity with Jewish moral law reframed by Christ and Spirit.
- **Pneumatic ethics:** The role of the Spirit in enabling and sustaining ethical life in community.
- **Household/patrimonial idioms:** Analytical terms for patron-client and family dynamics that inform instructions and discipline.
- **Wisdom tradition continuity:** Reading Jesus and NT writers through Jewish wisdom ethics as formative for Christian practice.
- **Rhetorical ethos of the church:** How liturgy, teaching, and public behaviour form communal witness and moral identity.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As an exegetical model for connecting textual analysis with ethical implications (casebook for NT ethics).
 - As a pedagogical resource for courses on New Testament theology, preaching, and pastoral formation - especially in evangelical settings.
 - As a conceptual pivot in debates about the New Perspective, ecclesial ethics, and the relation of narrative theology to moral theology.
