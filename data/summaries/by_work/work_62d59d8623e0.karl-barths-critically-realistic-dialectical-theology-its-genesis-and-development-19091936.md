### TITLE
Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology: Its Genesis and Development, 1909-1936 - Bruce L. McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Focuses on Barth's formative period (1909-1936): early pastoral-theological writings through the Romerbrief, Römerbrief reception, and the emergence of the Church Dogmatics project.
 - Milieu: post‑Kantian German/Swiss theology, reaction to liberal theology, rise of dialectical theology, and debates over natural theology after WWI.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - McCormack argues Barth develops a *critically realistic dialectical theology*: a method that affirms an objective divine reality while insisting knowledge of God is strictly conditioned by God's self‑revelation and thus dialectical in its encounteral form.
 - Core doctrinal problem: how to speak truly about God without collapsing into natural theology (analogia entis) or agnosticism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates genealogical development: traces Barth's intellectual debt to Neo‑Kantianism, Lutherian motifs, and Swiss Reformed pastoral concerns, then shows gradual revision toward a robust, Christ‑centered realism.
 - Key moves:
 - Diagnosis of liberal theology's anthropocentrism and the ontologizing of revelation.
 - Rejection of the analogia entis and insistence that only analogia fidei (knowledge shaped by God's revelation) is legitimate.
 - Construction of a "critical realism": the world and God are genuinely distinct realities; knowledge is possible because God reveals Himself as Lord in history, especially in Christ.
 - Systematic consequences: Word, election, revelation, and Christology become hermeneutical pivots for doctrine.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Schleiermacher, Neo‑Kantian philosophers, Lutherian tradition, and contemporary rivals (notably Emil Brunner and the analogia entis debate).
 - Scripture and patristic/medieval analogical traditions are treated in critique and retrieval.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (event and Word), Christology (Christ as decisive revelation and election), doctrine of God (freedom, transcendence), anthropology (knowledge/response), natural theology (rejection), and method of dogmatics.
- **Closing line**
 - McCormack locates Barth's theology at the intersection of realism and radical revelation: a dialectical, Christocentric dogmatics that refuses natural theology while preserving objective divine being and the possibility of true theological knowledge.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Labels Barth's method **"critically realistic dialectical theology"**, synthesizing affirmations of reality with a strict revelatory epistemology.
 - Recasts Barth not as anti‑realist fideist but as a theologian who defends the reality of God while limiting knowledge to revelation.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects portrayals that reduce Barth to mere dialectical negation or theological voluntarism.
 - Sharp corrective to Brunner: Barth's critique of analogia entis is not an epistemic nihilism but a principled refusal of natural theology's pretensions.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates the term **"critical realism"** for Barth studies and shows its explanatory power for Barth's shifts across 1909-1936.
 - Emphasizes the **eventuality** of revelation (revelation as act/event rather than merely propositional content).
- **Reception and influence**
 - McCormack's study is a landmark in Barth scholarship: widely cited for clarifying Barth's method and for reshaping debates about Barth's relation to modern philosophy and natural theology.
 - Influenced subsequent readings that stress continuity and methodological nuance rather than stark ruptures.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a precise, usable framework for teaching Barth's method; valuable for comparative theology, dogmatic method, and debates over analogia entis vs analogia fidei.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Critically realistic dialectical theology** - McCormack's label for Barth's method: affirms external reality and the epistemic primacy of revelation in a dialectical encounter.
- **Analogia entis** - ontological analogy / natural theology; **Barth rejects** its legitimacy as a basis for theological knowledge.
- **Analogia fidei** - analogy grounded in faith and revelation; **Barth affirms** this as the correct hermeneutical posture.
- **Revelation as event** - revelation is an act of God (historical and decisive), not simply human reflection on divine traces.
- **Word of God (threefold sense)** - Barth's emphasis on Christ as the definitive Word, Scripture as witness, and proclamation as presentational event.
- **Christocentric election** - election identified in the person and work of Christ; election grounds all knowledge of God.
- **Dialectic** - tension between God's hiddenness/transcendence and God's self‑manifestation; theology occurs in that encounter.
- **Transcendence vs immanence** - Barth preserves God's transcendence while affirming God's immanent self‑revelation in Christ.
- **Natural theology** - critique target: supplanted by revelation's primacy; cannot establish salvific knowledge of God.
- **Kerygma** - proclamational content central to Barth's theology; theology is oriented to the announced Christ.
- **Neo‑Kantian influence** - intellectual background: shapes early concerns with epistemic limits and prompts Barth's reformulation.
- **Dogmatic method** - Barth's systematic ordering: Word/event → Christology → doctrine of God and other loci.
- **Theological realism** - commitment to objective divine reality as accessible only through revelation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Barth's method (useful in methodological introductions to dogmatics).
- As a **polemic resource** in debates over natural theology (analogia entis vs analogia fidei).
- As an **exegetical/modeling tool** for reading Scripture Christocentrically and situating election and revelation within systematic theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in modern Barth scholarship to reframe his relation to modern philosophy and realism.
