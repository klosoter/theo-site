### TITLE
**Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries** (ed. Mark Kline Taylor) - Selected writings and critical framing of Paul Tillich's theology of limit-situations, correlation, and the frontier between theology, philosophy, and culture.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Protestant liberal theology refracted through existentialist philosophy (Heidegger, Kierkegaard) and modern culture. The edited volume collects Tillich's work and interprets it for later theological debates (post-war hermeneutics, neo-orthodoxy, Catholic renewal).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Theology must attend to the *boundaries* where human existence encounters ultimate questions - the limits of finite being, culture, and rationality - and articulate a faithful theology that both respects divine transcendence and speaks existentially to human anxiety.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Theology as a discipline of **correlation**: correlate the questions of human existence (limit-situations) with Christian symbols and revelations.
 - God is described not as a being among beings but as the **Ground of Being** (the ontological depth that undergirds existence), reconceiving classical theism to avoid both deism and anthropomorphism.
 - Christology as the event in which the New Being breaks into the old - an ontological transformation rather than only juridical satisfaction or metaphysical proof.
 - Symbol and language theory: theological language is symbolic and participatory; it discloses realities without exhaustively representing them.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Dialogues with **Karl Barth** (challenge to liberal accommodation and emphasis on revelation), **Karl Rahner** (questions of immanence and universal grace), existential philosophers (Heidegger, Kierkegaard), G. K. Chesterton, Hegelian motifs.
 - Editor Mark Kline Taylor frames Tillich against both neo-orthodoxy and emerging Catholic theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, God (ontology/theism), Christology, salvation (New Being), anthropology (existential anxiety, estrangement), symbols and theology, church and culture, method of correlation.
- **Closing line:** Tillich advances a theology of boundaries that seeks a middle path: preserving the weight of divine otherness while making doctrine existentially meaningful at the human limits of doubt, despair, and culture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **"Ground of Being"** as Tillich's central redefinition of God, shifting theists away from being-as-thing language.
 - The explicit program of theology at **boundaries** - treating limit-situations (death, guilt, meaninglessness) as the loci where divine revelation becomes existentially significant.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal optimism by insisting on the depth of estrangement and sin, yet resists Barthian exclusivism by insisting theology must be intelligible within cultural and philosophical horizons.
 - Positions itself between **Rahner's** universalizing tendencies (immanence, anonymous grace) and **Barth's** stress on divine transcendence and particular revelation, arguing for a dialectical interplay rather than either/or.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of **symbolic ontology** (religious language as participation).
 - Rearticulation of sin and salvation in ontological (being) categories rather than merely legal or moral metaphors.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Influential among Protestant liberals, mainline theologians, and some ecumenical Catholic thinkers; served as a bridge to existential and cultural readings of theology.
 - Contested by neo-orthodox and conservative critics for perceived demythologizing or abstractions of traditional dogma.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provocative model for teaching theology as interdisciplinary and culturally engaged.
 - Useful corrective to both reductionist secularism and strictly propositional dogmatism; stimulates contemporary work on theology and culture, religious language, and pastoral engagement at life's limits.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ground of Being:** God conceived as the ontological ground, not a being among beings; reframes classical theism.
- **Correlation:** Method linking existential questions to theological answers; central methodological move.
- **Boundary / Limit-situation:** The existential contexts (death, guilt, uncertainty) that disclose the need for theological interpretation.
- **Symbolic language:** Religious statements as participatory, revealing deeper reality without literal exhaustiveness.
- **New Being:** Christ as the ontological event inaugurating transformed existence and overcoming estrangement.
- **Existential estrangement / anxiety:** Anthropological category locating the human condition that theology must address.
- **Revelation (mediated):** Revelation is encounteral and symbolic rather than only propositional; insists on historical and existential reception.
- **Rahner's Rule (heuristic):** The tendency to emphasize divine immanence/universal salvific grace; Tillich negotiates this by preserving divine depth while acknowledging pervasive grace in culture.
- **Barth's reformulation:** Barthian insistence on the priority and particularity of revelation; Tillich dialogues with and reformulates some of Barth's critiques by re-emphasizing cultural intelligibility.
- **Ontological salvation:** Salvation described as a change in the structure of being, not merely juridical status.
- **Demythologizing influence:** Critical engagement with literalist metaphysics while retaining substantive claims; anticipates later theological retrievals.
- **Theology and culture:** Commitment to theological interpretation of cultural artifacts, art, and science as loci of disclosure.
- **Symbol vs. Sign:** Distinction: symbols participate in what they point to, signs merely indicate.
- **Methodological dialectic:** Recurrent move between affirming transcendence and engaging immanence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "theology of boundaries," "Ground of Being," and correlation method.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on theology and culture, existential theology, and philosophical theology.
- As a **polemic/interlocutor** in debates with Barthian neo-orthodoxy and Rahnerian Catholicism; useful for comparative dogmatics and methodological critique.
