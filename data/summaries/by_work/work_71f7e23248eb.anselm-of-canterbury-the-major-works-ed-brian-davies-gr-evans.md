### TITLE

Evans) - Monologion, Proslogion, De veritate, De libertate arbitrii, De casu diaboli, Cur Deus Homo, De conceptu virginali et de peccato originali, De incarnatione Verbi, De processione Spiritus Sancti, De concordia, Prayers and Meditations

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 11th-12th c. Benedictine monastic and early scholastic milieu; Archbishop of Canterbury.
 - Programmatic motto: **fides quaerens intellectum**; Augustinian and Boethian inheritance.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To render Christian doctrine intelligible by reason informed by faith: God's existence and attributes, truth and will, sin and atonement, and the Incarnation's necessity and coherence.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Monologion**: From gradations of goodness and being to a supreme, simple source; divine attributes via participation and causality. [Existence and Knowability of God]
 - **Proslogion**: The TTWNGCBT argument; meditation leading to divine simplicity, necessity, and aseity; replies to Gaunilo. [Existence and Knowability of God]
 - **De veritate; De libertate arbitrii; De casu diaboli**: Truth as rectitude; freedom as power to preserve rectitude for its own sake; account of angelic fall and privation of rectitude.
 - **Cur Deus Homo**: A rational account of why God became man; sin as dishonor-debt; satisfaction by the God-man as necessary and most fitting. [Atonement Necessity, Extent, and Theories]
 - **De incarnatione Verbi; De conceptu virginali**: Defense of the **one person in two natures** and sinless conception; anti-tritheist and anti-nominalist polemic. [Hypostatic Union; Chalcedonian Definition and Two Natures Doctrine]
 - **De processione Spiritus Sancti**: Filioque as doctrinally coherent within divine simplicity.
 - **De concordia**: Harmony of foreknowledge, predestination, grace, and free choice via modal distinctions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture; Augustine, Boethius, Gregory; Councils (esp. **Chalcedon**); interlocutors include **Gaunilo** and **Roscelin**.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology proper, revelation, creation, providence; truth and will; sin and grace; Trinity; Christology; atonement; anthropology; angelology; Mariology.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: the **rectitude of divine goodness** restoring creation through the **fitting necessity** of the Incarnation and satisfaction, apprehended by reason in service of faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - TTWNGCBT and contemplative proof; truth as rectitude; freedom as rectitude-loving; atonement as satisfaction restoring honor and order; pervasive appeal to **convenientia** (fittingness).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against ransom-to-Satan motifs; against tritheism and nominalism (Roscelin); clarifies person-nature distinction consonant with **Chalcedon**; reframes freedom beyond mere alternative possibilities.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Ontological argument; satisfaction theory; rectitudo; esse per se; person-nature logic serving the **Hypostatic Union**; modal reasoning in De concordia.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep imprint on scholastic method; Aquinas adopts and qualifies several lines (e.g., fittingness, satisfaction).
 - Reformed theology appropriates satisfaction (with penal-legal development) and fides quaerens intellectum; used against Socinian denials of atonement necessity.
 - Modern analytic philosophy revisits Proslogion; Barth retrieves the method of faith seeking understanding.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models rational elucidation without rationalism; foundational for debates on **existence and knowability of God**, Christology under **Chalcedon**, and the **necessity** and logic of atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fides quaerens intellectum**: Faith seeking understanding as methodological posture uniting prayer and analysis.
- **That than which nothing greater can be thought (TTWNGCBT)**: Proslogion's core notion grounding necessary existence and maximal perfection. [Existence and Knowability of God]
- **Ontological argument**: From the concept of the greatest conceivable being to existence in re; framed devotionally rather than as bare syllogism.
- **Participation and degrees**: Monologion's ascent from finite goods to the simple, subsistent Good.
- **Rectitudo (rectitude)**: Truth and justice as right order of will and being; linchpin across De veritate and soteriology.
- **Liberum arbitrium**: Power to preserve rectitude for its own sake; distinguishes ability, rectitude, and use.
- **Satisfaction (satisfactio)**: Atonement as honoring God and restoring order; requires a God-man of infinite worth. [Atonement Necessity, Extent, and Theories]
- **Convenientia (fittingness)** vs **absolute necessity**: Anselm calibrates necessity as moral-rational, not coercive of God's will.
- **Hypostatic Union**: One person, two complete natures without confusion or division; grounds the efficacy of satisfaction. [Hypostatic Union]
- **Chalcedonian Definition**: Normative horizon for person-nature distinctions; Anselm offers rational explication and defense. [Chalcedonian Definition and Two Natures Doctrine]
- **Original sin and virgin conception**: Explains propagation of sin and the sinless origin of Christ suitable to his mediatorial office.
- **Filioque**: Spirit's procession from Father and Son within divine simplicity and unity of operation.
- **Divine simplicity and aseity**: Attributes inferred in Proslogion and Monologion, structuring God-world relations.
- **Foreknowledge and freedom (De concordia)**: Compatibility via modal and causal distinctions without collapsing contingency.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a conceptual source for arguments on God's existence and knowability and divine attributes.
 - As a classical model for articulating the necessity and fittingness of the Incarnation and atonement.
 - As Christological scaffolding aligning doctrine with Chalcedon and explicating the two-natures, one-person union.
 - As methodological exemplar of faith seeking understanding across loci and as a polemical resource against anti-atonement and anti-Chalcedonian positions.
