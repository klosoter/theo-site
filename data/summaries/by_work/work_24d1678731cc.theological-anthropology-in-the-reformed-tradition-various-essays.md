### TITLE
**Theological Anthropology in the Reformed Tradition** (various essays) - edited/curated by **John Bolt**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed retrieval and constructive conversation: aimed at recovering classical Reformed resources (Calvin, Kuyper, Bavinck) to address contemporary philosophical and cultural challenges.
 - Situated within covenantal and neo-Calvinist milieus; attentive to systematic, biblical, and cultural-theological concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a coherent Reformed theological anthropology that holds together the goodness of creation (imago Dei), the depth of sin (total depravity), and the restorative work of grace-both common and salvific-so that Christian life, vocation, and cultural engagement are theologically grounded.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of the biblical data on human origins and the imago Dei (structure, relationality, function).
 - Historical retrieval: how key Reformed figures framed anthropology, sin, covenant, and grace.
 - The problem of sin: dynamics of corruption, guilt, and total inability without denying structural goods of human nature.
 - Grace nuanced: careful distinction and interaction between **common grace** (restraining, enabling cultural good) and **preparatory grace** (God's work preparing non-elect for the gospel).
 - Christological and covenantal resolution: Christ as the recapitulation/restorer of the image within the covenantal economy; soteriology and sanctification as restoration of human flourishing.
 - Practical implications: vocation, cultural mandate, ecclesiology, and eschatological hope.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: John Calvin, Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, Charles Hodge/Benjamin Warfield.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: constructive Reformed theologians and critics from liberal, Barthian, and pietistic horizons.
 - Scriptural anchors: Genesis 1-3, Pauline anthropology (Romans, 1 Corinthians), and Christological fulfillment texts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, imago Dei; sin and original sin; common grace and preparatory grace; covenant theology; Christology (eschatological recapitulation); soteriology; sanctification; ecclesiology; cultural mandate/vocation.
- **Closing line**
 - The collection centers on a covenantal, Christocentric anthropology: humans created good in the image of God, concisely corrupted by sin, restrained and enabled by common/preparatory grace, and finally restored in Christ for personal and cultural flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm integration of Kuyperian cultural engagement with Bavinckian doctrinal balance; avoids both cultural triumphalism and private pietism.
 - Systematic insistence that anthropology must move from creation through fall to covenantal redemption-no abstract "natural man" apart from covenantal categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic accounts that privatize sin/grace by emphasizing public, vocational, and cultural dimensions of restoration.
 - Counters overly optimistic humanisms by affirming total depravity without denying genuine natural goods.
 - Distinguishes itself from Barthian reductionism by preserving a robust doctrine of creation and common grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of **preparatory grace** as doctrinally distinct from common grace-emphasized as God's providential work that readies some for the gospel without conflating this with salvific efficacy.
 - Emphasis on functional and relational dimensions of the imago (beyond mere rational-capacity accounts).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminary courses on anthropology, ethics, and cultural theology.
 - Influential among neo-Calvinist and confessional Reformed circles for linking doctrinal precision with public engagement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable corrective to fragmented anthropologies; valuable for teachers wanting a covenantally grounded, culturally responsible view of human nature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - multifaceted: structural (capacities), relational (with God/others), and functional (vocation/mandate).
- **Common grace** - God's non-saving favor that restrains sin and enables cultural goods; does not effect justification.
- **Preparatory grace** - providential work that readies non-elect persons to receive the gospel; carefully distinguished from salvific grace.
- **Total depravity** - pervasive corruption of faculties but not total annihilation of all natural goods.
- **Original sin** - transmitted covenantal and federal corruption affecting human nature and will.
- **Covenant (federal structure)** - primary hermeneutical frame for anthropology: creation covenant, covenant of grace, covenantal obligations.
- **Creation-good** - the persistent moral and structural good retained after the fall, basis for cultural engagement.
- **Recapitulation (Christology)** - Christ as the new Adam who restores the image and destiny of humanity.
- **Vocation / Cultural mandate** - human calling to steward creation; theological grounding for engagement in arts, science, politics.
- **Sanctification** - the ongoing restoration of the image through Spirit-enabled transformation in the covenant community.
- **Ecclesial anthropology** - how church life shapes communal restoration of humanity.
- **Eschatological hope** - final consummation where the image is fully restored and human vocation perfected.
- **Public theology** - application: anthropology as the basis for social ethics and cultural critique.
- **Relational ontology** - emphasis on persons as constituted by relationships (God, others, creation) rather than atomistic individuals.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for articulating and distinguishing common grace and preparatory grace in doctrinal teaching.
 - As a **polemic** resource against theological positions that either denigrate creation (extreme Augustinianism/Barthianism) or overestimate natural human goodness (secular humanism).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-3 and Pauline anthropology within covenantal frameworks.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking systematic doctrines (Trinity, creation, redemption) to ethics, vocation, and public theology.
