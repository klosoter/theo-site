### TITLE
**The Divine Original of the Scriptures** - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritan-Reformed milieu; Owen wrote amid the English Civil War, Interregnum, and Restoration tensions that stressed authority, polity, and doctrine.
 - Addressed Protestant concerns about the nature and trustworthiness of Scripture against Romanist appeals to tradition and rising sceptical and rationalist critiques.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Scriptures are of divine original and self-authenticating; their authority rests ultimately on God as the author, not on human endorsement or external proofs.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scripture is divine in origin: God is the primary author and immediate cause of Scripture's truth.
 - Inspiration entails both veracity and sufficiency: the Scriptures contain what God intended and are adequate for faith and life.
 - Self-attestation: Scripture bears an internal evidence (the testimony of the Holy Spirit) that certifies its divine origin to the believer.
 - Accommodation and analogy: Owen uses an incarnational analogy-God communicating through human language and modes-so Scripture is accommodated to human understanding without losing divine truthfulness.
 - Practical consequences: ecclesial authority, canon, and dispute resolution must submit to Scripture's self-witness and clarity in essentials.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural texts and patristic appeals; polemical engagement with Roman Catholic claims about tradition and clerical magisterium.
 - Indirectly addresses skeptics and rationalists who demand external philosophical proofs for revelation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, authority and sufficiency of Scripture, ecclesiology (as it flows from written Word), Christology via the incarnational analogy, and pneumatology (Spirit as witness).

- **Closing line**
 - Owen anchors ecclesial and personal confidence in Scripture on its divine origination and internal self-attestation, articulated via an incarnational model of accommodation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong stress on the Scripture's self-evidencing quality: internal testimony of the Holy Spirit as the decisive ground of conviction.
 - Persistent use of the incarnational analogy: the Word became flesh and thus God's communication is necessarily accommodated to finite human language and faculties.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against Romanist reliance on ecclesial tradition and external magisterial proofs.
 - Correction to purely rationalist or evidentialist models that make philosophical demonstration the basis of scriptural belief; Owen relocates epistemic weight to Spirit-witness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of inspiration and accommodation under an incarnational paradigm: divine truth conveyed through human idiom without defect.
 - Tight coupling of pneumatology and epistemology - the Spirit is not merely an attester but the means by which Scripture is subjectively known.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in Reformed and Puritan circles; shaped later Reformed doctrines of inspiration and the internal testimony of the Spirit.
 - Read by subsequent proponents of confessional Protestantism and used as a resource against Enlightenment critiques of revelation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust model for defending Scripture's authority that integrates theology (incarnation, Spirit) with apologetics.
 - Useful for teaching on how divine communication can be both fully divine and genuinely human in expression.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine original**
 - The claim that Scripture's first and ultimate author is God; not merely human origin with divine sanction.

- **Inspiration**
 - God's superintendence such that the writings convey truth intended by God; Owen emphasizes both propositional truth and saving efficacy.

- **Self-attestation / self-authenticating**
 - Scripture contains criteria within itself, and by the Spirit's concurrence one perceives its divine origin; not reducible to external proofs.

- **Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
 - Internal, subjective witness that confirms Scripture's divine authorship to the believer; an epistemic work of the Spirit.

- **Accommodation**
 - God's accommodation to human capacities in revelation; language, genre, and cultural forms are adapted without falsifying divine truth.

- **Incarnational analogy**
 - Analogy between the Word incarnate and the Word written: just as Christ communicated in human nature, Scripture communicates divine truth in human words.

- **Sufficiency**
 - Scripture contains all necessary means for salvation and Christian life; Owen ties this to divine origination and intent.

- **Perspicuity (implied)**
 - While not Owen's primary label, he affirms that Scripture is accessible in essentials because of divine accommodation and Spirit-led understanding.

- **Authority**
 - Binding norm for church and conscience grounded in Scripture's divine origin; supersedes human traditions that conflict with it.

- **Canon**
 - The body of books recognized by the church; its authority rooted in divine origination and Spirit confirmation.

- **Pneumatological-epistemology**
 - The doctrine that knowledge of Scripture's divine source is mediated by the Spirit, integrating doctrine of the Spirit with epistemic claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for Reformed doctrines of inspiration and the divine origin of Scripture.
 - As polemic against Romanist and rationalist challenges to Scripture's authority.
 - As an apologetic model emphasizing internal witness and incarnational accommodation when defending revelation to skeptics.
