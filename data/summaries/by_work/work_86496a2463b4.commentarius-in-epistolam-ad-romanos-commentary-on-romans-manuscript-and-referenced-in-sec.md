### TITLE
Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos (manuscript; Commentary on Romans) - Francis Turretin (1623-1687). 
Focus here: Turretin's exposition of Romans 11 and his treatment of Israel's future within a Reformed scholastic framework (manuscript commentary referenced in secondary literature).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late Reformed scholasticism at the Academy of Geneva; Turretin wrote in the mid‑ to late‑17th century as a systematic theologian reacting to Arminianism, Socinianism, and varied covenantal readings of Scripture.
 - The Romans commentary exists primarily in manuscript form and is cited by later exegetical and dogmatic scholars as exemplifying a careful scholastic exegesis of Pauline theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Romans 11 demonstrates both God's irrevocable covenantal faithfulness to Israel and the doctrinal truth that the visible church is the eschatological continuation of God's people. Turretin argues for a future, eschatological turning of the nation of Israel without granting ethnic Israel a distinct, ongoing covenantal status apart from the covenant of grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical opening: close reading of the olive‑tree metaphor (grafting in/out), "hardening" and "remnant" language, and "the fullness/fulness of the Gentiles."
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Distinguishes between God's singular covenant of grace and the temporary historic role of national Israel.
 - Affirms election; explains the "remnant according to election" (Rom. 11:5) as proof of divine fidelity.
 - Interprets "all Israel will be saved" as an eschatological consummation - a corporate turning at the end which does not revoke the doctrine of justification by faith nor reintroduce the law as covenantal ground.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial conclusion: the church and believing Jews share in covenant promises; promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and realized in the church while preserving a future national restoration in God's providential plan.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Paul (textual exegesis), appeals to Augustine and Calvin for interpretive traditions, dialog with contemporary Reformed voices (implicit contrast with Cocceius on typological/covenant chronology), and refutation of Socinian and Roman Catholic distortions on justification and promise.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Election, reprobation, covenant of grace, justification by faith, typology, eschatology (Israel's restoration), providence, corporate identity of God's people.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Turretin reads Romans 11 to affirm God's immutable promises and corporate election while denying any dual covenant scheme: Israel's national future is providentially secured but fulfilled only in Christ within the single covenantal economy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight integration of scholastic precision with historical‑grammatical exegesis: technical categories (remnant, election) are derived directly from Pauline syntax and argument flow.
 - Balances two claims often polarized: (1) God's promises to Israel are irrevocable; (2) the church is the legitimate continuator of those promises under the covenant of grace.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Cocceian or overly typological readings that collapse Christ and Israel into a single typological schema without attention to Paul's eschatological timeline.
 - Opposes both Judaizing tendencies (seeking a return to Mosaic ritual as covenantal) and any version of replacement that erases the future eschatological role of ethnic Israel.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precision in parsing "partial hardening" and "fulness of the Gentiles" as chronological and providential categories: hardness temporally conditioned by "until" and directed toward a consummating salvation for "all Israel."

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles as a sober exegetical complement to Turretin's dogmatics; used in seminarians' training for scriptural theology of Israel and the church.
 - Less cited in broader modern scholarship because the manuscript status limited circulation, but when noted it is appealed to for classical Reformed answers to modern debates over Israel and the church.

- **Enduring value**
 - A model of how to hold covenantal unity and eschatological particularity together: useful for teaching Israel‑church relations, Pauline theology of election, and pastoral application of Romans 11.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Remnant according to election** - small believing portion preserved by sovereign choice; proof of God's faithfulness.
- **Partial hardening** - temporary judicial hardening of Israel until the appointed fullness of the Gentiles.
- **Fullness of the Gentiles** - a chronological marker indicating the Gentile ingathering prior to Israel's corporate turning.
- **All Israel will be saved** - eschatological promise interpreted corporately, not as every ethnic Israelite but as the national redemption at consummation.
- **Olive‑tree metaphor (grafting in/out)** - typological but historically situated image demonstrating inclusion by faith, not ethnic privilege.
- **Covenant of grace** - single covenantal economy under which both believing Jews and Gentiles enjoy promises; Turretin denies a continuing national covenant for Israel apart from this.
- **Election (corporate and individual)** - God's sovereign choice operates both at the corporate (people of God) and individual level (remnant and believers).
- **Justification by faith** - central Pauline doctrine preserved; Israel's future salvation is understood in forensic, faith‑based terms.
- **Eschatological restoration** - future, providential national turning of Israel within redemptive history.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - uses typological patterns but insists on historical fulfillment in Christ.
- **Providential chronology** - ordering of events (hardening -> Gentile fullness -> Israel's salvation) as part of God's plan.
- **Mystery (mysterium)** - Pauline category for how Gentile inclusion and Israel's future both reveal God's wisdom.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Romans 11 within a Reformed, covenantal frame. 
- As a **polemic** against dual‑covenant claims and against any reading that makes national Israel the locus of covenantal restoration apart from Christ. 
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed positions on election, remnant theology, and eschatological hope for Israel.
