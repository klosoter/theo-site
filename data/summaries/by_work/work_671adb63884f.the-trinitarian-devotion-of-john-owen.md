### TITLE
**The Trinitarian Devotion of John Owen** - Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritanism; Owen as principal divine at the Westminster milieu and political-religious tumult of the English Civil Wars.
 - Ferguson (late 20th / early 21st c.) reads Owen from a confessional Reformed perspective, recovering Puritan doctrinal intensity for contemporary Trinitarian and pastoral concerns.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Owen's theology is fundamentally shaped by a *doxological Trinitarianism*: doctrine and devotion are inseparable. Ferguson argues that proper understanding of Owen's theology requires seeing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as relational persons whose mutual life grounds revelation, redemption, and sanctification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Locate Owen in his polemical and pastoral context: innovations and controversies he addresses.
 - Expose the Trinitarian pattern running through Owen's major loci (Christology, covenant, soteriology, and pastoral theology).
 - Emphasize the Spirit's centrality in:
 - **Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination** - the Spirit as author and mediator of saving knowledge.
 - **Person And Deity Of The Holy Spirit** - Owen's robust affirmation of the Spirit's personhood and divinity against reductionist tendencies.
 - **The Spirit In Redemptive History** - the Spirit's active role across the economy: covenant of redemption, application of redemption, and consummation.
 - Conclude by arguing for retrieval: Owen's Trinitarian devotion corrects modern bifurcations of doctrinal orthodoxy and devotional life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Owen (works on Trinity, Communion with God, Spirit, and assurance).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Calvin and Augustinian tradition, Westminster divines, Socinian and antitrinitarian critics, modern evangelical readings that marginalize pneumatology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), pneumatology (personhood, deity, witness, illumination), Christology, covenant theology (including covenant of redemption), revelation, sanctification, assurance, ecclesiology.

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson presents Owen as a model: theology that is simultaneously doctrinally rigorous and liturgically / devotionally Trinitarian, with the Holy Spirit as the indispensable personal agent who reveals, applies, and perpetuates redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats devotion (worship, prayer, assurance) as the hermeneutical key to Owen's theology: doctrine lived out as Trinitarian praise.
 - Integrates pneumatology tightly with Christology - the Spirit's work is never abstract but always directed to union with Christ and communion with the Father.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Owen to a dry scholastic systematist; highlights pastoral and devotional motives.
 - Opposes modern tendencies to reduce the Spirit to "influence" or mere experience; stresses full **personhood and deity** (see Person And Deity Of The Holy Spirit).

- **Conceptual / terminological contributions**
 - Frames Owen's corpus under the rubric "Trinitarian devotion," a methodological lens that balances dogmatics and piety.
 - Reclaims the Spirit's roles across the **economy** rather than isolating the Spirit to later stages of the ordo salutis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed pastoral and academic contexts to rehabilitate Puritan pneumatology and Trinitarian worship.
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking a deeper doctrinally-grounded spirituality.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a reliable interpretive map for Owen's pneumatology and its implications for preaching, pastoral care, and liturgy; valuable for debates on revelation/illumination and the Spirit's personhood.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian devotion** - methodological key: theology practiced as corporate and personal worship of Father, Son, and Spirit.
- **Immanent vs. economic Trinity** - Owen (via Ferguson) insists doctrine must honor both the inner life of God and God's outward actions in salvation.
- **Personhood of the Holy Spirit** - Spirit as a distinct, personal agent (will, mind, witness) not reducible to properties or operations. (see Person And Deity Of The Holy Spirit)
- **Deity of the Holy Spirit** - full divinity affirmed in relation and operation with Father and Son.
- **Illumination / revelation** - Spirit as the immediate and primary agent who opens Scripture and human minds to saving truth. (see Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination)
- **Unction / witness** - the Spirit's internal testimony that effects assurance and discernment of Christ.
- **Indwelling / union with Christ** - Pneumatological basis for believers' mystical and covenantal participation in Christ.
- **Covenant of redemption** - Trinitarian pact in which the Spirit has active, ordered relations to Father and Son in the economy.
- **Redemptive history (economy of salvation)** - mapping of Spirit's activity across promise, fulfillment, application, and consummation. (see The Spirit In Redemptive History)
- **Sanctifying grace** - Spirit's progressive work producing holiness as intrinsic to union with Christ.
- **Assurance** - pastoral fruit of the Spirit's internal testimony and work of application.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Owen's Trinitarian piety and method.
 - As a **polemic** against pneumatological minimalism and unitarian critiques.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical texts about the Spirit (esp. Johannine and Pauline passages) in a Trinitarian framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology: grounding assurance, prayer, and sanctification in Trinitarian relations mediated by the Spirit.
