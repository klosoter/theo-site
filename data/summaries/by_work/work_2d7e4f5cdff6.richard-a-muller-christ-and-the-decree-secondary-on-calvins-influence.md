### TITLE
Richard A. Muller, "Christ and the Decree" - secondary study of John Calvin's doctrine of predestination and Christology (focus: pactum salutis and Christ as covenant head)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century revisionist scholarship on Reformed orthodoxy; Muller writes in the context of reclaiming nuance in Calvin studies against caricatures of monolithic scholasticism.
 - Engages primary sources: Calvin's Institutes, commentaries, sermons, and later Reformed systematicians (late 16th-17th c.) who develop covenantal language more explicitly.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin anchors predestination and the divine decree in a Christ-centered economy: God's eternal decree to save is integrally oriented toward Christ. Muller argues Calvin presupposes a functional equivalent of a pactum salutis (covenant of redemption) without always employing that later technical terminology.
 - Problem addressed: How to reconcile Calvin's doctrine of unconditional election with biblical Christology and the later scholasticized pactum language - did Calvin endorse an intra-Trinitarian agreement or merely an instrumental ordering of the decree?

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrates through exegesis that for Calvin:
 - Christ is the chosen Mediator and the object/measure of election.
 - The decree to elect is not an abstract fiat divorced from Christ's mediatorial work.
 - Predestination is ordered to Christ such that Christ is both the appointed end and instrument of God's saving purpose.
 - Traces how subsequent Reformed theologians (Perkins, the Westminster divines, Dort) made explicit what Calvin often implied, developing the formal language of the pactum salutis.
 - Side-by-side textual comparisons to show Calvin's reluctance to adopt scholastic pactum terminology yet his functional reliance on covenantal, Christocentric categories.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary focus: John Calvin.
 - Secondary interlocutors: Theodore Beza, William Perkins, later Reformed orthodoxy, and critics who impose later formulations back into Calvin.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Predestination and the divine decree.
 - Covenant theology (functional pactum salutis).
 - Christology (Christ as covenant head, mediator).
 - Trinity (insofar as intra-Trinitarian ordering of the decree is argued or denied).
 - Atonement and soteriological causation.

- **Closing line**
 - Muller's study re-centers Calvinic predestination on Christ: even where Calvin eschews formal pactum language, his theological economy privileges Christ as the ordained Mediator and the focal point of God's decree.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes *functional* presence of a covenant-of-redemption logic in Calvin without forcing anachronistic scholastic terms on him.
 - Stresses Christ as both the appointed goal and active cause (instrumental and meritorious aspects) in the decree.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters simplistic portraits of Calvin as purely decretal or as anti-covenantal; challenges both radical supralapsarian caricatures and overly technical claims that Calvin had a fully articulated pactum salutis.
 - Pushes back against readings that separate Calvin's Christology from his doctrine of election.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses nuanced distinction between *terminus* (that-to-which the decree is ordered) and *instrumentum* (the appointed means), showing Calvin assigns Christ both roles.
 - Frames Calvin's silence or avoidance of "pactum salutis" language as methodological rather than theological deficiency.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in the late-20th/early-21st century revival of careful Reformed orthodoxy studies.
 - Encouraged subsequent scholars to parse the development from Calvin to classical orthodoxy rather than to retroject later doctrines onto Calvin.
 - Has become a standard corrective in debates over covenant theology's origins and Calvin's stance on intra-Trinitarian agreements.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological exemplar of close textual exegesis combined with historical-theological sensitivity.
 - Valuable corrective for teaching predestination, showing Christ-centered unity of Calvin's soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum salutis (covenant of redemption)** - Muller: Calvin functionally presupposes the reality of a covenantal ordering of salvation, though he rarely uses the later technical term.
- **Decree of election** - God's eternal will to save; for Calvin, explicitly ordered to Christ as the appointed mediator and end.
- **Christ as covenant head (federal headship)** - Christ is both representative and appointed Mediator; election is worked out in relation to him.
- **Mediator / Instrumentum** - Christ as the means by which the decree is realized; Muller highlights dual role as terminus and instrument.
- **Terminology: terminus vs. instrumentum** - Useful pair: the decree is ordered toward Christ (terminus) and wrought through Christ (instrumentum).
- **Predestination (unconditional)** - Muller's reading: unconditional in cause but ordered to the concrete person and work of Christ.
- **Intra-Trinitarian pact** - Contested concept; Calvin rarely formalizes an intra-Trinitarian pact, but Mull er argues Calvin's theology is compatible with a functional intra-Trinitarian ordering without scholastic formulation.
- **Appropriative / efficient causation** - Distinguishes God's decretive causation and Christ's efficacious mediatorial work.
- **Reformed scholastic development** - Later theologians systematize what Calvin implies; Mull er traces the trajectory.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for understanding Calvin's Christocentric ordering of the decree (exegetical anchor).
- As a **polemic tool** against both caricatures that deny Calvin's covenantal logic and against retrojection of later scholastic terms without nuance.
- As an **exegetical/model** resource: exemplar of reading primary texts to reconstruct doctrinal development rather than imposing later categories.
