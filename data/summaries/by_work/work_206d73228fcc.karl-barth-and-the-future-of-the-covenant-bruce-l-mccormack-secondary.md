### TITLE
Karl Barth and the Future of the Covenant - Bruce L. McCormack (secondary study of Karl Barth)
- Focused reading on Barth's covenant theology, especially the **Covenant of Grace** as Barth develops it in Church Dogmatics and later writings.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Barth scholarship; McCormack writes within renewed interest in Barth after mid-century debates (dialectical theology, neo-orthodoxy), seeking to reinterpret Barth for contemporary Reformed theology and systematic retrieval.
 - Engages Barth's magnum opus (Church Dogmatics), post-WWII theological concerns (God's freedom, revelation as event), and the confessional Reformed tradition's covenantal categories.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - McCormack contends Barth offers a decisive reworking of classical federal (covenant) theology: the **Covenant of Grace** is not merely a legal framework grafted onto Christ but the very form of God's self-revelation and reconciliation in Jesus Christ. This requires rethinking election, promise, and covenantal continuity with Israel and the Church.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Shows how Barth relocates covenant from an abstract legal instrument to the concrete **Christ-event** (God's covenantal action in Christ).
 - Argues Barth collapses or radically transforms the traditional covenant of works/covenant of grace schema by subordinating any creation-covenant talk to the singular covenant revealed in Christ.
 - Tracks implications for election: election understood covenantally (the election of humanity in Christ; Jesus as elected and electing God).
 - Draws consequences for sacraments and ecclesiology: sacramental signicity grounded in covenantal encounter with the risen Christ, not merely juridical promise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics, later essays).
 - Interlocutors: Reformed orthodox and federal theologians (Calvinian legacy), contemporary Barth scholars, and critics who read Barth as covenant-continuity or covenant-discontinuity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (evental, Word-in-flesh), Covenant (central), Election (Christocentric), Christology (incarnation as covenantal center), Soteriology (reconciliation as covenantal act), Ecclesiology and Sacramentology (church as covenant community).
- **Closing line**
 - McCormack situates Barth's covenant theology as a **Christ-centered reconfiguration**: covenant is the form of God's revelatory and reconciling act in Christ, redefining election, promise, and the Church's identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Treats covenant primarily as **God's personal, historical action** rather than a legal-administrative category; covenantality is existential and Christ-shaped.
 - Emphasizes election as bilateral in Barth's thought: election of Jesus as both God's chosen and the one through whom humanity is chosen.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects readings that impose classical two-covenant or purely juridical categories on Barth; contrasts Barth with classical federalism that separates creation-order and redemptive-order covenants.
 - Pushes back against interpreters who reduce Barth to radical discontinuity with Reformed tradition; shows continuity mediated by Christocentric reinterpretation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "covenant" as the theological form of revelation - a relational, event-centered category rather than primarily contractual.
 - Clarifies Barth's use of electing love and reconciliation language as covenantal, bridging soteriology and Trinitarian theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed theologians who seek a Barthian alternative to classical federalism.
 - Sparked renewed debates on covenant theology, election, and the place of natural theology in covenantal discourse.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust methodological model for reading covenant language Christologically and for teaching covenant theology that centers revelation and reconciliation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - For Barth (and McCormack's reading): the singular, Christ-centered covenant in which God reconciles humanity in the person and work of Jesus.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Traditional category challenged; subordinated or recast under Barth as not the definitive form of God's relation to humanity.
- **Election**
 - Christocentric: election is realized in and through the election of Jesus - God elects humanity in Jesus rather than a dualistic decree.
- **Revelation as Event**
 - Covenant is the form through which revelation happens: God's Word becomes covenantal action in history.
- **Promise / Command**
 - Promise (God's covenantal gift) and command (God's lordship) are held together in Barth's covenantal vocabulary; promise without command is non-biblical.
- **Reconciliation**
 - The covenantal effect of Christ's work; not merely juridical pardon but the restoration of a covenantal relationship.
- **Church as Covenant Community**
 - The Church exists where the covenantal Word of God is mediated and received; sacraments function as covenant signs.
- **Sacraments as Covenant Signs**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper signify and seal the covenantal reality of union with Christ.
- **Trinitarian Grounding**
 - Covenant language anchored in Trinitarian relations: the Father elects in the Son by the Spirit.
- **Christology (Covenantal Focus)**
 - Jesus is both covenant mediator and the concrete embodiment of God's covenantal yes.
- **Promise-Fulfillment Hermeneutic**
 - Scriptural interpretation centers on Christ as fulfillment of covenant promises.
- **Freedom of God**
 - God's freedom governs covenantal initiative; covenant is not a contractual limitation on divine sovereignty.
- **Anti-Natural Theology Move**
 - Covenant knowledge depends on revealed Word-event, not human analogies to God.
- **Continuity-Discontinuity**
 - Barthian covenant affirms continuity of God's single redemptive purpose while denying simplistic identity between Israel's covenant form and the Church without Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for a Christocentric covenant theology.
 - As a **polemic** against classic federalist readings that isolate a creation covenant from redemptive covenant.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Scripture through promise-fulfillment and covenant-event categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debates about election, sacraments, and the relation of Israel and the Church.
