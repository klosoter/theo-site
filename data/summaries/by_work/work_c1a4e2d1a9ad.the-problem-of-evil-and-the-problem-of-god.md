### TITLE
The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion; written for both philosophers and Christian apologists.
 - Responds to revived interest in theodicy and atheism driven by analytic treatments (Mackie, Rowe, Draper) and to modern defenses (Plantinga, Hick).
 - Situated within evangelical, classical theism commitments (omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good God) and historic Christian eschatology.

- **Central thesis**
 - The problem of evil, in both its logical and evidential forms, does not successfully undermine theism; reasons exist (or plausibly could exist) why an omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent God may permit significant evil.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Distinguishes the **logical** problem (claims of contradiction) from the **evidential** problem (claims of improbability).
 - Part II: Refutes the logical problem by showing no necessary contradiction between God and evil:
 - Invokes free‑will defenses (Plantingaian moves) for moral evil.
 - Argues theistic plausibility of morally sufficient unknown reasons for permitting evil.
 - Part III: Engages the evidential problem by assessing probabilistic arguments (Rowe, Draper):
 - Presents competing theodical options (free will, soul‑making, providential goods, eschatological compensation).
 - Appeals to epistemic limits on human knowledge about divine reasons (a limited form of skeptical theism) without capitulating to radical skepticism.
 - Argues that the existence of intense suffering is not strong evidence against God given plausible theistic explanations.
 - Part IV: Considers Christian resources - incarnation, atonement, eschatology - as components of a theodicy that can give moral and existential meaning to suffering.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: J.L. Mackie (logical problem), William Rowe and Paul Draper (evidentialists), Alvin Plantinga (free‑will defense), John Hick (soul‑making approach).
 - Historical figures: Augustine and Irenaeus referenced as upstream theodical resources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, creation and creaturely freedom, eschatology (final judgment, compensation), theodicy vs. defense methodology, attributes of God (omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence).
 - Less focus on detailed Trinitarian/Christological dogmatics, but Christ's suffering and atonement are used pastorally and apologetically.

- **Closing line**
 - Craig locates the theological center of gravity in a classical Christian theism that claims plausible moral reasons and eschatological goods can reconcile the reality of profound evil with a perfectly good, omnipotent God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Analytic clarity married to Christian resources**
 - Methodically distinguishes logical/evidential problems and applies analytic tools while importing distinctly Christian eschatological motifs as part of a theodicy.
- **Synthesis of defenses**
 - Combines Plantinga‑style free‑will defenses with soul‑making/eschatological explanations rather than relying on a single model.
- **Moderate skeptical theism**
 - Affirms that unknown divine reasons plausibly exist but resists radical skeptical theism that would undercut moral reasoning or divine knowledge claims.
- **Probabilistic rebuttal**
 - Uses probabilistic considerations to show that evidential arguments do not sufficiently increase the probability of atheism relative to theism.
- **Correctives to rivals**
 - Challenges simplistic presentations of theistic responses (e.g., that God permits evil only for inscrutable reasons) and criticizes evidentialists for ignoring plausible theistic goods and eschatological compensation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in evangelical and analytic philosophy-of-religion circles as a standard contemporary defense of theism against the problem of evil.
 - Used widely in apologetics, seminary courses, and advanced undergraduate/graduate seminars.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of careful, charitable engagement with opponents and of integrating philosophical rigor with Christian theological resources; valuable for students learning how to defend theism responsibly.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Logical problem of evil**
 - Claim that God's attributes are logically incompatible with the existence of evil; Craig argues this claim fails.
- **Evidential problem of evil**
 - Claim that observed evil makes God's existence unlikely; handled via probabilistic rebuttal and possible theodicies.
- **Moral evil**
 - Evils resulting from free agents; addressed primarily by free‑will defenses.
- **Natural evil**
 - Non‑agentive suffering (disease, disasters); addressed by soul‑making, providence, and eschatological compensations.
- **Free‑will defense**
 - Plantinga‑inspired move: genuine libertarian freedom can justify permitting moral evil for greater goods.
- **Soul‑making theodicy (Irenaean)**
 - Suffering as instrumentally valuable for moral/spiritual development; integrated into Craig's multi‑pronged response.
- **Skeptical theism (moderate)**
 - Claim that finite creatures cannot expect to know all of God's reasons; Craig accepts limited epistemic humility while avoiding radical skepticism.
- **Theodicy vs defense distinction**
 - Defense: shows consistency; Theodicy: attempts to show God had actual morally sufficient reasons. Craig uses both strategically.
- **Probabilistic reasoning / evidential calculus**
 - Used to assess whether evil raises the probability of atheism; Craig argues it does not decisively.
- **Eschatological theodicy**
 - Final judgment, compensation, and the transformative future are used to provide meaning and justice regarding present evils.
- **Moral sufficient reasons / hidden reasons**
 - Central explanatory category: God may permit evil for greater goods unknown to us.
- **Transworld depravity (contextual)**
 - Plantinga's notion appears as part of the free‑will toolkit that Craig employs.
- **Divine attributes (omni- prefix)**
 - Definitions and interaction with evil are central to the book's argumentative moves.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a definition source and methodological exemplar for defending classical theism in philosophy of religion.
- As a polemic against evidential atheism and a model for integrating philosophical defenses with Christian eschatology.
- As a conceptual pivot in teaching theodicy: demonstrates how analytic precision and theological resources can jointly address the problem of evil.
