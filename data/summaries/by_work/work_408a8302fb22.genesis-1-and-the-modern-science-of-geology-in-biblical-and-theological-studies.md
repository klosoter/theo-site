### TITLE
Genesis 1 and the Modern Science of Geology - B. B. Warfield (Biblical and Theological Studies)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton context; amid the rise of modern geology (Lyellian uniformitarianism) and Darwinian biology.
 - Warfield writing as a Reformed conservative theologian engaged in the broader fundamentalist-modernist controversies; seeks to mediate between blind literalism and capitulation to scientism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1 addresses theological truth about God as Creator rather than delivering a scientific treatise on geological processes; proper interpretation resists both naïve concordism and doctrinal revisionism prompted by modern geology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture's primary concern is revelation of God and covenantal/creational truth, not technical natural history.
 - The interpreter must employ grammatical-historical exegesis: determine the literal sense intended by the inspired author, recognizing phenomenological and accommodative elements where present.
 - Modern geology claims about earth antiquity and processes are scientific hypotheses that do not automatically overturn biblical doctrine; where they conflict, theological method should distinguish core doctrinal commitments (e.g., creation, providence, goodness of creation) from secondary descriptive detail.
 - Warfield criticizes extremes:
 - Against concordism that forces biblical language to match current scientific theories.
 - Against liberalizing reinterpretations that treat Genesis as myth or mere poetry to accommodate secular science.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages with contemporary geologists and naturalists (the scientific milieu shaped by Lyell, Darwinian thought, and early uniformitarians).
 - Dialogues implicitly with conservative predecessors (e.g., Charles Hodge) and popular contemporary proposals such as gap theory, day-age interpretations, and other attempts to harmonize Scripture mechanically with geology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (plenary/authority of Scripture).
 - Creation (including creation ex nihilo, divine providence).
 - Biblical hermeneutics (literal sense, accommodation).
 - Indirectly touches on anthropology and teleology in creation doctrine.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center: Genesis 1 must be read as authoritative revelation about God's creative act and purpose, with a hermeneutic that refuses both capitulation to scientism and mechanical concordism, allowing rigorous engagement with geology while preserving biblical doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the theological aim of Genesis rather than a scientific description; clarifies the role of accommodation in divine revelation.
 - Balanced conservatism: fidelity to Scripture's authority while taking contemporary science seriously as a cultural-scientific discipline.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects literalist concordism that forces Scripture into the shape of transient scientific theories.
 - Opposes liberalizing moves that demote Genesis to myth, thereby protecting core doctrines of creation and providence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines use of "accommodation" for Genesis language: Scripture may describe phenomena in human terms without forfeiting doctrinal truth.
 - Clarifies methodological priority: theological and exegetical norms govern claims about what Scripture teaches, even when addressing natural history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a model for engaging science without abandoning inerrancy.
 - Influential in shaping 20th-century conservative hermeneutics on Genesis; functioned as a foil for later more literalist movements and for those advocating theistic evolution.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable hermeneutical framework for pastors and scholars navigating Scripture-science tensions.
 - Serves as an exemplar of rigorous theological engagement with contemporary science that resists both fear-driven capitulation and scrap-the-text literalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Yom (day)** - Warfield stresses exegetical caution: Hebrew "yom" must be interpreted in context; he resists simplistic geological harmonizations while not dogmatically excluding non-literal possibilities where warranted.
- **Accommodation** - Key lens: biblical language may present phenomena in human terms without conveying scientific detail; secures divine intent while allowing phenomenological description.
- **Concordism** - Critiqued; the practice of forcing Scripture to conform to current scientific theories is rejected.
- **Literal sense / grammatical-historical method** - Affirmed as normative for determining what Genesis intends to teach the reader.
- **Phenomenal language** - Recognition that Scripture sometimes addresses appearances as perceived by humans, not scientific minutiae.
- **Plenary inspiration / authority of Scripture** - Underwrites Warfield's refusal to subordinate doctrinal teaching to scientific speculation.
- **Uniformitarianism / Geology** - Scientific framework Warfield interacts with; treated as substantive scientific claim but not automatically decisive against biblical revelation.
- **Gap theory / Day-age positions** - Representative reconciliation attempts Warfield critiques; he analyzes their hermeneutical and theological costs.
- **Creation ex nihilo** - Affirmed as doctrinal backbone that theology must protect.
- **Theological teleology of Genesis** - Emphasizes purpose (sabbath, order, imago Dei) over raw chronology.
- **Scientific authority vs. theological authority** - Distinct spheres: science explains processes; theology interprets purposive meaning from revelation.
- **Hermeneutical priority** - Principle that theological and exegetical norms shape how scientific claims are received.
- **Phenomenal order vs. ontological order** - Distinction used to explain why biblical sequence may read differently from geological sequence.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for conservative hermeneutical method regarding Genesis.
 - As a **polemic** against both fideistic literalism and liberalizing accommodation to science.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1 as theological narrative with real historical claims, but without naive concordism.
