### TITLE
**Karl Barth: A Theological Legacy - Eberhard Jüngel**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Protestant dogmatics; postwar German theology seeking to recover and re-evaluate Karl Barth for contemporary systematic use. Jüngel writes as a leading Barthian engaging both historical Barth scholarship and ongoing doctrinal debates (esp. natural theology vs. revelation).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jüngel reads Barth as decisively relocating Christian theological predication on God from any ontological continuity with creation (analogia entis) to an analogy constituted by **God's self-revelation in Christ** (analogia fidei). The problem addressed: how language about God can be both true and humble without collapsing into natural theology or agnosticism.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirm Barth's critique of natural theology and any uncritical appeal to a metaphysical continuity (analogia entis).
 - Reconstruct analogical predication as theologically possible only because God **acts and speaks** in history - the Word-event grounds predication.
 - Develop doctrinal consequences for doctrine of God, Christology, revelation, and ecclesial theology; show how God's freedom and self-determination secure true knowledge of God while guarding divine transcendence.
 - Conclude that theology hence becomes a discipline of responsive hearing and confession anchored in the crucified and risen Word.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth (primary), Emil Brunner (historical foil around natural theology), Thomas Aquinas (for analogia entis tradition), Luther and Calvin (Reformation background for Word-centred theology), later 20th-century Protestant and Catholic theologians.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, doctrine of God (divine freedom and hiddenness), Christology (Jesus as decisive revelation), analogy of language (analogia fidei vs analogia entis), election, grace, the Word of God, ecclesiology as receptive community.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Theology must confess God only on the basis of God's own self-disclosure in Christ; analogical speech about God is legitimate only insofar as it is governed by that revealed Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **analogical predication grounded in historical divine speech** rather than in metaphysical affinity; analogy is an epistemic effect of revelation.
 - Emphasizes theology as **obedient listening** to the Word-event rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contra Thomas Aquinas and classical proponents of analogia entis: rejects any claim that creatures bear sufficient ontological similarity to God to ground theological knowledge apart from revelation.
 - Builds on Barth's decisive rejection of Brunner's version of natural theology, but seeks to clarify how positive theological language can nonetheless be retained without lapsing into naturalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting **analogia fidei** as a doctrine about the epistemic origin of analogy (rooted in faith that responds to revelation) rather than merely a hermeneutical rule.
 - Clarifies relation of **divine freedom** to the possibility of true divine predication: God chooses self-revelation, thereby authorizing analogical knowledge.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential among post-Barthian continental Protestants; provided a model for theology that is both confessionally faithful and philosophically sensitive.
 - Used as a bridge between Barthian dogmatics and constructive systematic theology, informing debates on natural theology, religious epistemology, and ecumenical dialogues.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact, rigorous interpretation of Barth that is pedagogically useful for teaching doctrine of revelation and analogy.
 - Serves as a corrective to both naive natural theology and radical fideism, modeling a middle path that preserves both divine transcendence and propositional content of revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia fidei** - Analogy grounded in the event of God's revealed Word; predication about God is legitimate because God has acted and spoken.
- **Analogia entis** - Analogy of being; the classical claim of ontological affinity between God and creature that Jüngel (via Barth) rejects.
- **Revelation (Offenbarung)** - God's self-disclosure in Jesus Christ; the epistemic foundation for theology.
- **Word of God (Wort Gottes)** - Central category: the historical and active speech-event that authorizes theological language.
- **Divine freedom** - Emphasized to show that God elects to reveal, securing both transcendence and authentic knowledge.
- **Christocentricism** - The ruling hermeneutic: Christ as the final and determinative revelation of God.
- **Natural theology** - Criticized where it presumes knowledge of God apart from revelation; contrasted with the analogia fidei approach.
- **Predication about God** - Understood as analogical, not univocal nor purely equivocal; grounded in faith's response to revelation.
- **Dialectical theology** - Historical context: Jüngel situates Barth within dialectical moves but reframes them for constructive dogmatics.
- **Theology as obedience/hearing** - Methodological stance: theology is responsive, self-limiting, and confessionally bound.
- **Election** - Used to illustrate God's free determination of revelation and relationship to humanity.
- **Transcendence/Immanence tension** - Managed by rooting immanent knowledge in the transcendent Word-event.
- **Analogy as epistemic relation** - Jüngel reframes analogy primarily as about how knowledge is possible, not metaphysical resemblance.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Barthian rejection of analogia entis and reconstruction of analogia fidei.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates over natural theology and the legitimacy of creaturely grounds for speaking of God.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Barth's doctrine of revelation and Christology in systematic theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary doctrines of God that seek to marry transcendence with propositional revelation.
