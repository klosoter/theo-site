### TITLE
The Shadow of Calvary: Gethsemane and the Cross - Hugh Martin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 19th-century Scottish Presbyterian milieu; devotional-theological writing aimed at pastors and reflective Christians within the Reformed tradition. Combines pietistic devotion with doctrinal clarity characteristic of Victorian evangelicalism in Scotland.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Gethsemane is the ethical, emotional and soteriological hinge of the Passion: Christ's agony there both anticipates and realizes the substitutionary work accomplished on the Cross, revealing the inner dynamics of obedience, suffering, and communion with the Father.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical meditation on Gospel accounts of Gethsemane (the cup, the prayer, the yielding).
 - Theologically situates Gethsemane within the larger economy of redemption: how Christ's inward combat relates to outward sacrifice.
 - Pastoral application: how believers participate in the shadow of Calvary through dependence, penitence, and trust.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary engagement with the Gospels and standard Reformed/evangelical resources; implicitly dialogues with Puritan pastoral spirituality and the classical Reformed formulations of Christ's obedience and atonement (without extended systematic polemics).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and offices), soteriology (substitutionary atonement; active and passive obedience), priesthood of Christ (Munus Triplex emphasis on priestly suffering), providence and divine will, prayer, temptation, and sanctification.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Gethsemane is presented as the inner, decisive obedience of the incarnate Son - the spiritual locus where vicarious suffering and willing submission unite to cast the saving shadow that falls fully on Calvary.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats the Gethsemane scene as not merely prelude but as theological condensation of the atonement - a locus where inner obedience and external sacrifice cohere.
 - Strong pastoral-psychological sensitivity to Christ's agony: sympathy without sentimentalism; doctrinal clarity without abstraction.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters moral-exemplar readings that reduce the Passion to an ethical model; presses the necessity of substitution and imputed obedience.
 - Distinguishes from Roman sacrificial ritualism by anchoring priestly suffering in substitutionary efficacy, not liturgical repetition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The "shadow" motif-Gethsemane as the shadow-cause of Calvary - helps readers conceptualize inward suffering as causally and theologically prior to the public crucifixion.
 - Nuanced ordering of active/passive obedience in relation to the threefold office (Munus Triplex) as enacted in Gethsemane.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in Reformed devotional circles; valued by pastors for preaching on passion and prayer.
 - Less central in contemporary academic debate but retained as a touchstone for pastoral Christology and devotional exegesis.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to marry exegesis, doctrinal precision, and pastoral application.
 - Useful for courses on Christology, pastoral theology, and devotional preaching on the Passion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gethsemane:** The garden scene as theological focal point - inward agony that grounds outward atonement.
- **Cup:** Symbol of suffering/wrath; Martin uses it to express both divine judgment borne and filial submission.
- **Shadow (of Calvary):** Metaphor for Gethsemane's anticipatory and formative relation to the Cross.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's positive fulfillment of the law; emphasized as integral to the saving work begun in Gethsemane.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's endurance of suffering and death; presented as consummated at Calvary yet rooted in the Gethsemane will.
- **Substitutionary atonement:** Central soteriological claim - Christ suffers in our stead; Martin defends substitution against mere exemplarism.
- **Munus Triplex (threefold office):**
 - **Prophet:** Foretelling and revealing redemptive truth; Gethsemane as filial enactment of prophetic obedience.
 - **Priest:** The soul-bearing, mediatorial suffering highlighted in Gethsemane.
 - **King:** The paradoxical kingship realized through willing defeat and vindication.
- **Imputation:** Imputed righteousness/obedience rooted in Christ's willing submission; theological mechanism connecting his inner obedience to believers' justification.
- **Prayer of abandonment:** "Not my will" as the model of redemptive obedience; central motif in Martin's pastoral application.
- **Cup of wrath vs. cup of blessing:** Distinction used to explain penal aspects and redemptive overturning.
- **Temptation/agon:** Christ's struggle as real and representative - grounds pastoral comfort for believers in their trials.
- **Vicarious suffering:** Emphasized as earnest, purposeful, and covenantal.
- **Pastoral meditation:** Methodological hallmark - theological exposition directed toward sanctification and consolation.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the affective dynamics of Christ's obedience in pastoral Christology.
 - As a **polemic** resource against moral-exemplar or non-substitutionary readings of the Passion.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching the Passion narratives with doctrinal and devotional interplay.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Munus Triplex to the inward/outer economy of atonement (Gethsemane-to-Calvary trajectory).
