### TITLE
A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus (Vol. 2: Mentor, Message, and Miracles) - John P. Meier (1994)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published mid-1990s within the late-20th-century historical-Jesus renewal; author a Catholic biblical scholar (John P. Meier) writing from an academically conservative-critical stance.
 - Responds to rival reconstructions (liberal skepticism, form-critical dismantling, radical Jesus-of-Nazareth reconstructions such as Crossan) and to recovery projects emphasizing Jesus within Judaism (e.g., E. P. Sanders, Geza Vermes).
- **Central thesis**
 - Reconstruct a historically probable portrait of Jesus by strict use of historical-criteria methodology; in vol. 2 Meier argues Jesus functioned as a distinctive Jewish *mentor* whose core message and reported miracles can be critically evaluated for varying degrees of historicity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Jesus as *mentor* - analysis of teaching episodes, parables, rabbinic context; argues Jesus is not a conventional rabbi but a marginal, charismatic teacher.
 - Part II: Jesus' *message* - sustained treatment of the kingdom of God, eschatology, ethics, and how sayings relate to Jewish expectation.
 - Part III: *Miracles* - systematic historical-critical analysis of healings, exorcisms, nature miracles and the methodological thresholds for attributing deeds to the historical Jesus.
 - Each section proceeds case-by-case, weighing criteria (multiple attestation, embarrassment, dissimilarity, coherence, Aramaic substratum, etc.) and assigning likelihood qualifiers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: canonical Synoptics, Q-hypothesis, Gospel of Thomas, supporting use of Josephus, rabbinic literature, Greco-Roman parallels.
 - Interlocutors and critics engaged: Bultmann, Crossan, Jeremias, Sanders, Vermes, liberal and conservative historians of Jesus.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (historical low christology; Jesus' self-understanding as prophet/eschatological preacher), revelation (limits of historical access to divine claims), soteriology indirectly via message and deeds, limited treatment of resurrection material (miracles chapter frames expectations).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Through rigorous, probabilistic criteria, Meier presents Jesus as an itinerant Jewish mentor-prophet: a socially marginal, charismatic figure who proclaimed the kingdom, taught ethically pointed parables, and whose healings and exorcisms are historically plausible in varying degrees.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Methodological sobriety and transparency**
 - Distinctive for systematic, explicit application of historical-criteria and frequent use of likelihood language; Meier treats historical judgment as probabilistic, not binary.
- **"Marginal Jew" and "mentor" formulations**
 - Recasts Jesus not as mainstream rabbi nor simply as theological construct but as a marginal, charismatic teacher whose social location explains distinctive ministry.
- **Granular, pericope-level inquiry**
 - Rather than grand synthesis alone, Meier offers micro-analyses of individual traditions with cumulative theological implications.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back on radical skepticism that reduces Jesus to myth; also critiques overly confident reconstructions that ignore methodological constraints (both radical liberal and conservative tendences).
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Operationalizes a multi-criteria approach with consistent likelihood qualifiers; stresses interplay of Jewish context and distinctive innovation in Jesus' teaching.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in academic historical-Jesus studies for method and tone; adopted as a model of careful reconstruction; criticized by some for excess caution and by others for continuing reliance on contested criteria.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a methodological exemplar and a dense repository of argumentation for teaching historical-critical methods and for grounding theological claims in probabilistic historiography.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Marginal Jew**
 - Jesus portrayed as socially and religiously marginal within 1st‑century Judaism; explains nonconformity and prophetic edge.
- **Mentor**
 - Term for Jesus' role as teacher/guide distinct from classical rabbinic model; emphasizes personal authority and ethical formation.
- **Criterion(s) of authenticity**
 - Ensemble of heuristics (multiple attestation, embarrassment, dissimilarity, coherence, Aramaic substratum, historical plausibility).
 - Meier applies these consistently and weighs them probabilistically.
- **Multiple attestation**
 - Independent occurrence of a tradition across sources strengthens historicity.
- **Dissimilarity**
 - Traditions likely to be authentic when they diverge from both early Christian confession and Jewish expectation.
- **Aramaic substratum**
 - Linguistic indicators (Semitisms) used to judge authenticity and original form of sayings.
- **Likelihood qualifiers**
 - Meier's cautious verbal scale (e.g., "almost certain," "probable," "possible") to express historical judgment rather than absolute claims.
- **Kingdom of God (message)**
 - Central motif analyzed for eschatological content, ethical demands, and continuity/discontinuity with Judaism.
- **Miracles / signs**
 - Categorized (healings, exorcisms, nature miracles); each category evaluated separately for historical credibility.
- **Exorcism**
 - Among the most historically plausible miracle traditions in Meier's judgment.
- **Form- and tradition-history**
 - Methodological backbone; traces transmission stages and social settings for pericopes.
- **Q source / Synoptic problem**
 - Used as working hypothesis for isolating sayings and independent traditions.
- **Jesus' self-understanding**
 - Treated as historically investigable: prophet, eschatological herald, charismatic healer - not anachronistically theological.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for rigorous application of criteria in historical-Jesus studies.
- As an **exegetical model** for careful, pericope-level reconstruction before doctrinal inference.
- As a **polemic resource** against mythicism and against oversimple portraits of Jesus that disregard Jewish context.
