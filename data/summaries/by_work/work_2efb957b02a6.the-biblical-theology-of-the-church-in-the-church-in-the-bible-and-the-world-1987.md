### TITLE
**Edmund P. Clowney - "The Biblical Theology of the Church"** (chapter in The Church in the Bible and the World, 1987)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical context; part of a multi-author project to present a biblical theology of the church for churchmen and theologians.
 - Engages post-war biblical-theological renewal (Vosian and Geerhardus Vos influences) and contemporary ecclesial debates about identity, mission, and sacrament.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church is the covenant people instituted and shaped by Christ as the eschatological fulfillment and continuation of Israel; biblical theology supplies the coherent shape (kingdom, temple, covenant, sacraments, ministry) that grounds a robust, Reformed ecclesiology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Traces redemptive-historical motifs that constitute the church:
 - Israel as pattern: election, covenant, temple, monarchy, prophetic witness.
 - Christ as fulfillment: Davidic king, true temple, high priest, inaugurator of the kingdom.
 - Church as the new covenant community: gathered by the Word, sustained by sacraments, ordered by ministry, destined toward eschatological consummation.
 - Moves from biblical typology and covenant continuity to practical ecclesial shapes: marks of the church (Word, sacraments, discipline), visible/invisible distinction, apostolicity and catholicity.
 - Emphasizes corporate and covenantal categories over individualistic models.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Scripture as primary source; interprets through Reformed biblical-theological lenses (implicit dialogue with Vos, classic covenant theologians).
 - Corrects liberal and pietistic reductions of the church; contrasts Roman Catholic claims with a Protestant, covenantal account.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, Christology (king/priest/temple), ecclesiology (unity, holiness, catholicity, apostolicity), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), ministry and authority, eschatology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The church is the covenantal, corporate embodiment of Christ's inaugurated kingdom-formed by Word and sacrament, ordered by apostolic faith, and oriented toward eschatological consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **redemptive-historical continuity**: Israel and church are successive administrations of the one covenantal promise mediated in Christ.
 - Prioritizes **corporate identity** (people of God) over individualistic or purely institutional models.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Liberal ecclesiologies that reduce church to social organization or ethical movement.
 - Roman Catholic overemphasis on sacramental ontology and institutional authority without Reformed covenantal checks.
 - Radical pietism/congregationalism that severs visible marks (Word, sacraments, discipline) from covenantal continuity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates classic marks of the church within a redemptive-historical framework rather than merely confessional or juridical categories.
 - Reframes catholicity as **the universal manifestation of the one covenant people**, rather than merely institutional breadth.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminary courses as a clear, biblical-theological model of ecclesiology.
 - Influenced pastoral theology, preaching, and sacramental pastoral practice within conservative Reformed circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, theologically coherent bridge between biblical narrative and practical church order; enduring as a teaching text for pastors and students wanting a historically rooted, Scripture-centered ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant**
 - Primary category for understanding continuity between Israel and church; church as the covenant people under Christ.
- **Kingdom**
 - Christ's kingship frames the church's mission and identity: inaugurated but not yet consummated.
- **Temple**
 - Church as the new temple (presence of God dwelling in the gathered people and Spirit).
- **Davidic King / Christology**
 - Jesus as fulfillment of Davidic monarchy; grounds ecclesial authority and messianic rule.
- **Word**
 - The principal means by which the church is gathered and sustained; one of the marks.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper)**
 - Covenant signs/seals that constitute and nurture covenant membership; corrective against both sacramental minimalism and excess.
- **Visible / Invisible Church**
 - Distinction preserved: visible church defined by external marks; invisible church known only to God - but both necessary in ecclesial theology and practice.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Faithfulness to apostolic teaching as criterion for being the true church; anchors doctrine and mission.
- **Catholicity**
 - Universal scope of the one church across time and space, grounded in covenant continuity.
- **Holiness**
 - The church's sanctified status derives from union with Christ and is worked out through Word, sacraments, and discipline.
- **Discipline**
 - Necessary practice to preserve covenant purity and witness; ecclesial boundary marker.
- **Eschatological consummation**
 - The church's hope and telos: final realization of kingdom and gathered people before God.
- **Typology / Redemptive-history**
 - Methodological terms: OT figures/events prefigure NT church reality.
- **Marks of the Church**
 - Word, sacraments, discipline reframed within covenantal-historical narrative.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed ecclesiology (covenantal, redemptive-historical model).
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Israel typology to NT church identity and practices.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both sacramental excess and reductionist privatized Christianity.
