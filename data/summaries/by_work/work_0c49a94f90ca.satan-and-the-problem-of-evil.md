### TITLE
Satan and the Problem of Evil - Gregory A. Boyd (study notes)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the late 20th century amid renewed evangelical interest in demonology, biblical-theological readings of cosmic conflict, and analytic philosophy of religion. Responds to both historical theodical options and contemporary philosophical defenses of divine goodness.
 - Part of a broader evangelical revival of Christus Victor motifs and a literalist resurgence regarding Satan and demons.

- **Central thesis**
 - The primary source of evil is the free, sinful revolt of personal creatures-most notably Satan and the fallen angels-not God or impersonal metaphysical necessity. God permits creaturely rebellion but is not its author; divine providence works against this revolt and will finally defeat it in Christ and the eschaton.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegesis first: surveys biblical texts (e.g., Genesis 3, Job, Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28, New Testament Gospel and Revelation passages) to argue for a biblical portrayal of real, personal satanic agency and cosmic conflict.
 - Reconstructs the historical-theological options: rejects simple Augustinian/privation accounts that make God the proximate source of evil and also critiques purely metaphorical treatments that demythologize Satan.
 - Proposes a libertarian free-will theodicy centered on an ontological and historical fall of angelic beings; explains moral and many natural evils as effects of demonic activity and the disordered reign of rebels.
 - Foundations for pastoral and soteriological hope: Christ's death and resurrection inaugurate the defeat of demonic powers (Christus Victor), assuring eschatological rectification.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages the patristic and medieval tradition indirectly (Irenaeus, Augustine themes), modern analytic theodicy (e.g., Alvin Plantinga on free will), and contemporary interpreters who reduce Satan to metaphor or psychological function.
 - Draws primarily on biblical literature as interpretive authority; interacts with systematic categories (sin, providence, eschatology).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Angelology and demonology (central)
 - Theodicy (problem of evil)
 - Providence and permissive will
 - Creation and the Fall (creaturely freedom)
 - Christology and soteriology (Christus Victor emphasis)
 - Eschatology (final defeat of evil)

- **Closing line**
 - Boyd's theological center of gravity: God is sovereign and good but not the originator of evil; evil is principally a real, personal, creaturely rebellion-chiefly satanic-and God's victory over that rebellion is accomplished in Christ and consummated at the end.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on literal, personal satanic agency as a central explanatory category for both moral and many forms of natural evil.
 - Priority given to biblical narrative and cosmic-conflict imagery over abstract metaphysical accounts of evil as mere privation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Augustinian privation theories that risk making God the proximate ground of evil.
 - Opposes reductionist readings that treat Satan as symbolic, psychological, or purely literary; claims such readings undermine biblical explanatory resources for suffering.
 - Distinguishes his position from naive "blame Satan for everything" views by retaining human moral responsibility and divine permissive ordering.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates the language of a historical "satanic revolt" as a theodical category.
 - Frames certain natural evils as secondary effects of demonic rebellion rather than unavoidable byproducts of creation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals and pastors interested in demonic agency and pastoral theodicy; contributed to renewed interest in Christus Victor and cosmic warfare motifs.
 - Contested in analytic philosophy of religion and among theologians who worry about over-explaining natural evils via demonic agency or underplaying structural/creation-order causes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable corrective to theological accounts that either depersonalize evil or place the burden of its ultimate origin on God.
 - Provokes necessary dialogue between biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and philosophical theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Satanic revolt**
 - The historical rebellion of Satan and certain angels that introduces moral and (in part) natural evil into the created order.

- **Cosmic conflict / cosmic warfare**
 - Biblical motif framing the world as a battleground between God and rebellious spiritual powers; central hermeneutical key.

- **Libertarian free-will theodicy**
 - Theodical move attributing evil primarily to genuinely free creaturely choices; Boyd adapts this to include angelic freedom.

- **Privation theory (Augustinian)**
 - Classical doctrine that evil is lack or privation of good; Boyd critiques its practical implications for responsibility.

- **Demons / demonic agency**
 - Personal evil agents who can influence natural processes and human choices; used explanatorily for many evils in Boyd's scheme.

- **Permissive providence**
 - Distinction between God's sovereign allowance of creaturely freedom and active causation of evil; key to absolving God of culpability.

- **Christus Victor**
 - Soteriological model emphasizing Christ's defeat of demonic powers; used as the theological hope and resolution in Boyd's argument.

- **Eschatological consummation**
 - Final rectification in which satanic rebellion is decisively ended; the goal of divine providential action.

- **Moral responsibility**
 - Emphasized for human agents even within a framework attributing many evils to demonic influence.

- **Natural evil (reinterpreted)**
 - Some natural disasters and disorders are interpreted as consequences of demonic agency or the disordered rule of fallen powers, not directly created by God as evil.

- **Theodical pivot**
 - Uses the satanic-revolt construct as a pivot between exegesis and systematic theodicy.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a biblical-theological, personal-agent account of the origin of evil (satanic revolt).
- As a **polemic** against purely privation-based or metaphorical treatments of Satan and evil.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading OT and NT texts through cosmic-conflict categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theodicy and in discussions connecting demonology, providence, and Christology.
