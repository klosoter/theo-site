### TITLE
**Active and Passive Obedience of Christ** - John M. Frame (Collected Shorter Theological Writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th century Reformed theological milieu; Frame writing as a conservative Reformed theologian addressing soteriological and covenantal concerns within Protestant orthodoxy.
 - Engages contemporary debates about justification, imputation, and the Federal Vision controversies that re-appeared in later Reformed discourse.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine that Christ's righteousness is both actively and passively obedience - his positive law-keeping (active) and his suffering/death bearing the penalty (passive) - is essential to classical Reformed justification and assurance; denial or diminution of either undermines forensic justification and covenant theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define terms: active obedience (Christ's lifelong fulfillment of the law), passive obedience (Christ's endurance of penalty and death).
 - Argue for the necessity of both for full justification: passive obedience pays the penalty; active obedience supplies the righteousness required by the law and merited for believers.
 - Situate this within federal headship: Christ as federal representative fulfills covenant obligations owed by humanity.
 - Address objections: nominalizing active obedience as merely exemplary or conflating sanctification with justification fails to account for biblical forensic language and covenantal ordering.
 - Connect to assurance and perseverance: imputed active and passive obedience undergird confident assurance and the believer's standing before God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Roots in Reformation and Westminster theology (Calvin, Westminster Confession, Puritan writers like Owen).
 - Responds to modern critics: those who minimize imputation of active obedience (certain streams within Federal Vision debates, some contemporary revisionists), and to views that reduce Christ's work to moral example or solely penal substitution.
 - Appeals to Pauline and covenantal exegesis (Romans, Galatians, Hebrews) and to forensic/nomian categories in Reformed systematic theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, penal substitution), Covenant Theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace, federal headship), Christology (office and work of Christ), Assurance and Perseverance, Doctrines of law and imputation.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: authentic Reformed justification requires both Christ's passive suffering and his active fulfillment of the law as the imputed grounds of sinners' right standing before God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Clear insistence that **both** active and passive obedience are forensic goods imputed to believers - not merely moral example or internal sanctifying benefits.
 - Integration of covenant-of-works categories with New Testament forensic language to explain why active obedience is necessary for justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against positions that collapse active obedience into sanctification or that see Christ's active life as unnecessary for justification.
 - Contrasts with tendencies in some contemporary Reformed circles (and Federal Vision proponents) who either downplay imputation or reframe justification in covenantal participation terms exclusive of forensic imputation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes precise forensic vocabulary (imputation, merit, satisfaction) while tying these to covenantal headship language to prevent abstraction.
 - Frames assurance as grounded structurally in the twofold obedience rather than merely experiential signs.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed teaching and pastoral literature as a concise corrective on doctrine of obedience and justification.
 - Used in debates over Federal Vision and justification controversies as a standard restatement of classical Reformed commitments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching systematic theology and pastoral assurance; functions as a clear, compact resource linking biblical exegesis, covenant theology, and forensic categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's lifelong perfect fulfillment of the law; the positive righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death as the bearing of penalty; penal substitution.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer: Christ's obedience and suffering counted to believers' account.
- **Forensic justification**
 - The legal declaration of righteousness based on Christ's obedience (both kinds).
- **Federal headship**
 - Christ as representative of humanity in covenantal standing; key to understanding transfer of merit and penalty.
- **Covenant of works**
 - The pre-Fall covenant framework that explains why perfect obedience (active) was required and meritorious.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - The post-Fall covenant fulfilled by Christ's twofold obedience; the medium of salvation and imputation.
- **Penalty / satisfaction**
 - Passive obedience satisfies divine justice; penal substitution is central here.
- **Merit / alien righteousness**
 - Positive righteousness of Christ that is alien to the believer but imputed.
- **Assurance**
 - Confidence grounded in the imputed active and passive obedience of Christ, not merely subjective experience.
- **Sanctification vs. justification**
 - Distinct loci: sanctification is participatory transformation; justification is forensic imputation grounded in Christ's obedience.
- **Representative obedience**
 - The way Christ's obedience functions on behalf of the elect as their covenant head.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed teaching on imputation and the twofold obedience.
- As **polemic** against non-imputation and reductionist views (e.g., some Federal Vision or exemplarist accounts).
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline forensic language through covenantal categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pedagogy linking covenant theology, Christology, soteriology, and pastoral assurance.
