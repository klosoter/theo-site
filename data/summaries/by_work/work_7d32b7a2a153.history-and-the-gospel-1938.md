### TITLE
History and the Gospel (1938) - C. H. Dodd

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1938 in the interwar period amid renewed quests for the historical Jesus and debates over early Christian eschatology.
 - Situated in the Cambridge Anglican scholarly milieu; engages continental critics (Schweitzer, Bultmann) and British New Testament scholarship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Gospel is primarily the apostolic *kerygma*: a historical proclamation that interprets Jesus as the realization of God's eschatological purpose. The early church transformed expectation in light of the **delay of the Parousia** by reinterpreting Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as present, not merely future, eschatological fulfillment.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - The evangelists and apostolic preaching are rooted in real historical events (the life and resurrection of Jesus) but shaped by a theological interpretation that makes those events the locus of eschatological reality.
 - Major moves:
 - Clarify what the early church meant by "gospel" as proclamation, not modern biography.
 - Demonstrate how kerygma presupposes historical acts of Jesus while reading them as inaugurating the kingdom.
 - Explain the theological and pastoral responses to the non-arrival (delay) of the Parousia: reinterpretation of eschatological sayings, present experience of the kingdom, sacramental and ethical continuities.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Direct engagement with Albert Schweitzer (consistent eschatology / imminent Parousia), Rudolf Bultmann (form criticism and existential interpretation), and earlier Ritschlian and liberal historical-critical traditions.
 - Uses Pauline and Synoptic materials to reconstruct kerygma and its historical base.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology** (inaugurated vs. imminent), **Christology** (kerygmatic Christ and historical Jesus), **revelation** (God's saving action as historically located), and the nature of apostolic tradition and Scripture.
- **Closing line**
 - Dodd situates the gospel as the apostolic proclamation that the reign of God has broken into history in Jesus - a reinterpretation of expectation forced by the delay of the Parousia, giving rise to an *inaugurated* eschatology rooted in historical event and present experience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that the gospel is both historical and kerygmatic: not mere biography nor abstract theology, but proclamation grounded in historical acts.
 - Early church response to delay is constructive theology, not simply disappointment: the kingdom is experienced as present in Christ.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges Schweitzer's thesis that early Christianity was simply misguided expectation of an imminent end; argues for theological reinterpretation rather than collapse.
 - Unlike radical form critics, maintains a substantive link between historical Jesus and early proclamation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and refined the language of **realized / inaugurated eschatology** as an interpretive category for Gospel theology.
 - Reframes "gospel" primarily as apostolic *kerygma* with historical referent plus theological claim.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in mid-20th century New Testament scholarship and Anglican theology; shaped later treatments of eschatology and the historical Jesus.
 - Provoked debate: praised for balancing history and theology; criticized by those who see him downplaying future consummation or over-emphasizing present realization.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a disciplined model for relating historical inquiry to theological proclamation; remains a pivot for debates on the Parousia, the resurrection's function, and the nature of the Gospel.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma**
 - Apostolic proclamation; Dodd's central descriptor of what "gospel" primarily is.
- **Realized / Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The kingdom is already present in Jesus' ministry, death, resurrection; future consummation remains expected but is no longer the sole frame.
- **Delay of the Parousia**
 - Problem addressed: how the church theologically coped when the imminent return did not occur.
- **Historical Jesus**
 - The real events that ground the kerygma; Dodd insists on historical referent without collapsing into mere biography.
- **Gospel as history**
 - Not a modern biography but a retelling that interprets history as salvific.
- **Form criticism engagement**
 - Uses form-critical insights while resisting reduction of proclamation to non-historical forms.
- **Fulfillment language**
 - Use of OT fulfillment motifs to reinterpret past promises as enacted in Jesus.
- **Resurrection**
 - Central historical event that validates the kerygma and reorients eschatological expectation.
- **Parousia**
 - Future coming reinterpreted in light of present kingdom realities.
- **Apostolic tradition**
 - Transmission of kerygma shaped by liturgy, preaching, and interpretive retelling.
- **Typology / midrashic reinterpretation**
 - How OT texts and prophecy were re-applied to Jesus in apostolic proclamation.
- **Present experience**
 - The church's liturgical and ethical life as proof of the kingdom's present reality.
- **Christological proclamation**
 - The early church's confession of Jesus as Lord and eschatological agent.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source for **kerygma** and **inaugurated eschatology** in systematic and historical theology.
 - Polemic against *consistent eschatology* (Schweitzer) and as corrective to readings that sever history from proclamation.
 - Exegetical model for Gospel formation studies: balancing historical events and theological shaping.
