### TITLE
**Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship** (2010), Kevin J. Vanhoozer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Late-modern evangelical retrieval after the linguistic turn; postliberal influences; response to demythologizing, process/panentheism, open theism, and worries about classical impassibility.
 - Continuation of Vanhoozer's theodramatic project (Drama of Doctrine), focused on God's being and agency as **triune communicator**.

- **Central thesis**
 - To remythologize is to put the biblical mythos (plot) back into theology: speak of God by attending to the canonical discourse in which God speaks and acts. Result: a chastened metaphysics of **triune communicative agency** that renders God impassibly passionate, sovereign, and personally interactive.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: **canonical-linguistic** and **speech-act** approach; Scripture as divine discourse that authorizes doctrine and shapes metaphysics.
 - Against extremes:
 - Demythologizing (Bultmann): dissolves divine action into existential self-understanding.
 - Mythologizing (process/panentheism): collapses Creator-creature distinction by positing ontological mutuality.
 - Onto-theology/univocity: speaks of God within a flat metaphysical grid.
 - Proposal: a **theodramatic metaphysic** where God is **Author**, the world is the drama, Scripture is the canonical script, and the Spirit directs fitting performance.
 - Doctrinal developments:
 - **Revelation & Scripture**: self-attesting, Spirit-authenticated authority; divine speech acts (locution-illocution-perlocution).
 - **God and providence**: promissory, covenantal governance that honors creaturely freedom under authorship.
 - **Impassibility & passion**: God's love is impassible (not subject to compulsive change) yet truly passionate in covenantal engagement.
 - **Trinity**: the Father authors, the Son is the Word, the Spirit perfects/appropriates as director and illocutionary force.
 - **Anthropology**: human agents as psychosomatic, dialogical actors addressed and enlisted by God's word.
 - Epistemology: knowledge of God is participatory, obedient hearing within the economy of communication.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Bultmann, Barth, Aquinas, Calvin, Pannenberg, Moltmann, Jenson, Lindbeck; uses Austin/Searle (speech acts), Ricoeur (narrative), Wolterstorff (divine discourse), analytic theism; converses with open theism and process thought.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), Scripture and authority, Trinity, divine attributes (impassibility, simplicity rearticulated), providence, Christology (kenosis as communicative condescension), anthropology, method.

- **Center of gravity**
 - The **triune Author** covenantally speaks in Scripture to communicate, covenant, and command, drawing creatures into the holy theodrama.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as performance of a canonical script; **speech-act** account of divine authority; **Author-character** analogy; **impassible passion** as the grammar of divine love.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects demythologizing reductionism and process/open theism's metaphysical mutualism; resists hard classical impassibility that mutes biblical pathos; avoids onto-theology by a christologically schooled analogical reasoning.
- **Innovations**
 - Terms: **remythologizing**, **theodrama**, **analogia dramatis**, **triune communicative agency**, **theodramatic metaphysic**; retrieval of Reformed **principia** through a linguistic turn.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among Reformed and evangelical theologians to defend classical yet relational theism; appreciated for integrating exegesis, metaphysics, and doctrine; critiqued by some Thomists for literary emphasis and by some Barthians for renewed metaphysics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a canonical method for divine action; a stable grammar for Scripture's self-attesting authority; a mediating path between classical theism and modern concerns about relationship and suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Remythologizing**: Re-centering theological discourse on Scripture's mythos (plot) so that talk of God is shaped by canonical testimonies to divine speech and action.
- **Theodrama**: The world-encompassing drama authored by God; Scripture is the script, church the company, Spirit the director.
- **Triune communicative agency**: God's being-in-act as speaker, promise-maker, and covenant Lord; Father authors, Son is Word, Spirit perfects.
- **Speech-act theory**:
 - **Locution** (what is said), **illocution** (what is done in saying), **perlocution** (effects achieved). Scripture as divine illocution that binds and blesses.
- **Canonical-linguistic method**: Doctrine arises from attending to the canon's literary forms and directive force, not merely to propositions abstracted from it.
- **Author-character analogy**: God-world relation conceived as Author to characters, preserving sovereignty and creaturely agency without competition.
- **Impassible passion**: God's love is immutable in purpose yet genuinely engaged; resists both stoic apathy and passibilist vulnerability.
- **Analogia dramatis**:
 - Analogical God-talk grounded in God's communicative acts and our fitting participation, over against univocity/equivocity and the bare **analogia entis**.
- **Principia of theology**:
 - **Essendi**: Triune God; **cognoscendi externum**: Scripture; **internum**: Spirit's illumination.
- **General and special revelation**:
 - Creation as theater of glory; canon supplies the plot that rightly interprets general revelation.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture**: The Bible functions as divine discourse that authorizes itself by the Spirit through its illocutionary claims.
- **Providence as promissory agency**: Governance by covenant promises and commands rather than causal determinism.
- **Kenosis as communicative condescension**: The Son's self-giving framed as fitting action within the economy, not divestment of divinity.
- **Human psychosomatic unity**: Persons as embodied, dialogical actors capable of receiving and enacting divine address.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Bibliology**: Framework for Scripture as divine speech acts and self-attesting authority.
 - **Theology Proper/Trinity**: Conceptual grammar for divine action, impassibility, and triune roles.
 - **Providence/Anthropology**: Author-character model for freedom under sovereignty and embodied agency.
 - **Method**: Canonical-linguistic, analogia dramatis as a bridge between biblical and systematic theology.
