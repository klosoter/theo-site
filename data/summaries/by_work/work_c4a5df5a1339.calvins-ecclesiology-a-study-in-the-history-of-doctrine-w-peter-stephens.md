### TITLE
Calvin's Ecclesiology: A Study in the History of Doctrine - W. Peter Stephens (on the ecclesiology of **John Calvin**) 
Focus: the **visible/invisible church** distinction and its pastoral, sacramental, and disciplinary consequences.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century historical‑theological study examining Calvin within the Reformation and post‑Reformation doctrinal tradition.
 - Situated against debates about confessional identity, ecclesial marks, and 20th‑century renewed interest in classical Reformed ecclesiology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Stephens contends that Calvin preserved a formal distinction between the **visible** and **invisible** church yet reconceived the visible church as the concrete locus of God's means of grace; this reworking balances assurance of election with concrete pastoral and disciplinary responsibility.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Traces Calvin's sources (Augustine, medieval canon, Reformers) and readings in the Institutes, sermons, and correspondence.
 - Shows how Calvin:
 - Maintains the theological reality of the invisible church (elect known to God alone).
 - Reinterprets the visible church not as a mere aggregate of outward profession but as the community where the **Word**, **sacraments**, and **discipline** operate efficaciously.
 - Grounds eucharistic and baptismal theology in covenantal/means‑of‑grace terms, resisting both Catholic sacramentalism and radical symbolic reduction.
 - Envisions discipline and pastoral oversight as necessary markers that preserve the church's fidelity to the Word.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine (on church and election), Luther (on Word and sacrament), Zwingli (on the Lord's Supper), Roman Catholic theologians (on validity/visible unity), and Reformed colleagues (Bucer, Farel).
 - Uses Institutes as central source; supplements with sermons and Genevan practice to show lived ecclesiology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (visible/invisible), sacramentology (baptism, Lord's Supper), Word as instrument, church discipline, ministry/pastoral office, covenant and election, marks of the true church, church‑state relations.
- **Closing line**
 - Stephens locates Calvin's theological center of gravity in a **Word‑governed visible church** that serves as the ordinary scene of salvation, always judged by-and inseparable from-the invisible reality of election.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Calvin's visible/invisible distinction is practical: the visible church is the arena of God's ordinary means; visibility is not merely formal but mediated by Word, sacraments, and discipline.
 - Stress on **pastoral office** and communal responsibility rather than purely individual assurance or purely institutional continuity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Moderates Augustinian/medieval absolutism about institutional visible unity by refusing to equate outward membership with salvation.
 - Distinguishes from Zwinglian symbolicism and Roman sacramental ontology by insisting on real spiritual benefit in the sacraments as covenantal seals.
 - Corrects any antinomian reading of the invisible church by tying visible practice to doctrinal fidelity and discipline.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the "marks" of the church around the **efficacy of the Word** and the proper administration of the sacraments rather than juridical or purely numerical measures.
 - Emphasizes covenantal terminology to explain membership and sacramental participation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in shaping Reformed confessional standards (e.g., Westminster, Belgic) and Presbyterian polity emphasizing discipline and pastoral oversight.
 - Influenced later debates on ecclesial identity, sacramental theology, and the relation between church and state.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a pragmatic yet doctrinally robust middle way: preserves assurance of divine election while insisting on accountable, Word‑shaped church life-valuable for teaching ecclesiology, pastoral theology, and sacramental practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible Church** - the concrete community of worship, sacraments, ministry, and discipline; the ordinary locus of God's means of grace.
- **Invisible Church** - the church as known to God alone, the elect; the ultimate reality behind visible signs.
 - Relation: visible church is the arena where the invisible church is ordinarily manifested and tested.
- **Marks of the Church** - preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, exercise of discipline.
- **Means of Grace** - Word and sacraments as God's ordinary instruments effecting faith and nourishing the covenant people.
- **Sacraments as Seals** - sacraments confirm/promise what the Word declares; they are covenant signs with real spiritual effect.
- **Word as Instrument (verbum efficax)** - the preached Word functions not merely informatively but performatively as God's effective means of calling and judging.
- **Church Discipline** - pastoral and communal correction that preserves purity and credibility of the visible church.
- **Pastoral Office / Ministry** - ordained oversight necessary to maintain the marks and administer means of grace.
- **Covenant** - framework for understanding church membership, sacraments, and familial ecclesial relations.
- **Election & Assurance** - the invisible foundation for comfort, but assurance is mediated through visible signs and pastoral testimony.
- **Communion of Saints** - concrete fellowship in the visible church shaped by spiritual communion and mutual care.
- **Regenerate Membership** - Calvin resists a presumption that all visible members are regenerate; calls for vigilance and discipline.
- **Church‑State Relation** - civil authorities may support the church's external peace but do not replace ecclesial discipline and ministry.
- **Eucharistic Presence** - spiritual real presence mediated by the Holy Spirit, rejecting corporeal presence and mere symbolism.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed understandings of the visible/invisible distinction and the marks of the church.
 - As a **polemic** tool against both Roman Catholic sacramental ontology and Anabaptist ecclesial separatism.
 - As an **exegetical/practical model** for connecting biblical text (Word) to ecclesial practice (sacraments, discipline).
