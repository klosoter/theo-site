### TITLE
The Resurrection of Jesus - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century North American Protestantism; reaction to liberal theology and historical-critical skepticism about miracles.
 - Machen (Princeton-trained New Testament scholar; later founder of Westminster Theological Seminary) wrote as part of a wider conservative apologetic movement defending supernatural Christianity against naturalistic reduction.
- **Central thesis**
 - The resurrection of Jesus is a historically well-attested, bodily, divine act that is the essential and decisive foundation of Christian faith; naturalistic or purely "spiritual" explanations fail to account for the facts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of the primary data: empty tomb, post-mortem appearances, transformation of the disciples, early proclamation.
 - Critical testing of alternative hypotheses:
 - Swoon or apparent death theories are implausible on medical and circumstantial grounds.
 - Theft-of-the-body explanations fail to explain appearances and disciples' convictions.
 - Hallucination accounts do not account for group and varied appearances or bodily interactions (eating, touch).
 - Myth or late-legend theories do not fit the early, creedal, and public character of the testimony.
 - Epistemological framing: historical reasoning and probability versus philosophical naturalism; proper weight to ancient testimony when internal coherence and multiple attestation exist.
 - Concludes that the best historical explanation of the combined facts is a real bodily resurrection by divine agency.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Targets: the modernist/liberal scholarship of his day (broadly represented by scholars who naturalize miracle accounts), and older skeptical theories (Strauss, Renan, various rationalist critics).
 - Sources: the New Testament witness (Gospels, Pauline letters), creedal formulations, and historical-method arguments rather than speculative theology alone.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (vindication of Jesus' Messiahship and deity), soteriology (resurrection as guarantee of justification and new life), eschatology (firstfruits of general resurrection), revelation and authority (resurrection as decisive revelation confirming Christ's claims).
- **Closing line**
 - For Machen the resurrection is not a pious symbol but the central historical, theological hinge: Christianity stands or falls on the reality of Jesus' bodily rising.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm insistence on the *bodily* and historical character of the resurrection against sentimental or merely spiritualized readings.
 - Careful use of historical-cum-apologetic reasoning: not merely fideistic assertion but argument by elimination and probability.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal tendency to reframe resurrection as ethical inspiration or subjective experience.
 - Challenges mythicist and naturalist reductions by insistence on contemporaneous, multiple, and public elements of testimony.
- **Conceptual/terminological notes**
 - Treats resurrection as an event that functions both historically and doctrinally: an empirical occurrence that grounds theological claims (vindication, justification, eschatological hope).
 - Emphasizes "best explanation" methodology rather than exhaustive positivist proof.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among conservative and Reformed circles as a model of apologetic clarity; contributed to Machen's stature in conservative theological resistance to modernism.
 - Less decisive for critical-liberal scholarship, which often persists in adopting non-supernatural readings; later evangelical apologists have built on Machen's method.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, disciplined demonstration of how theological conviction and historical argument can be integrated.
 - Serves pedagogically as a template for conservative responses to skepticism about miracle claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection** - central event: bodily rising of Jesus; historical and theological nexus.
- **Bodily resurrection** - Machen insists on physicality (touch, eating, empty tomb) to distinguish it from mere visionary experiences.
- **Historicity** - claim that the resurrection can and should be treated as a matter of historical investigation and probable inference.
- **Empty tomb** - treated as a core datum that, combined with appearances, makes alternative explanations difficult.
- **Appearances / post-mortem visions** - viewed as evidence that must be explained en masse (group and individual appearances).
- **Swoon theory** - presented and rebutted as medically and circumstantially implausible.
- **Hallucination theory** - critiqued for inability to account for communal and corporeal features of the appearances.
- **Myth/legend theory** - rejected on grounds of early creedal evidence and public proclamation close to the events.
- **Naturalism vs supernaturalism** - methodological contrast: whether one rules out miracles a priori or treats them as possible explanations.
- **Vindication** - theological term for resurrection as divine vindication of Jesus' claims and person.
- **Apostolic witness** - authoritative, public testimony that anchors the apostolic preaching.
- **Historical apologetics** - Machen's method: weigh competing historical hypotheses and prefer the best explanation.
- **Firstfruits / eschatological guarantee** - resurrection as the inaugural event pointing to general resurrection and final judgment.
- **Authority of Scripture** - implicit: the resurrection establishes Christ's revelation and thus grounds Scripture's authority.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitional source for conservative confessions concerning the corporeal resurrection and its soteriological import.
 - As polemic against modernist and naturalistic readings of Christian origins.
 - As an exemplar of concise historical-apologetic method used in preaching, introductory theology, and evangelical scholarship.
