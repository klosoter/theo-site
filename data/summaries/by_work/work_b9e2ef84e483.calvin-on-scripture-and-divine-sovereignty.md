### TITLE
Calvin on Scripture and Divine Sovereignty - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed scholarship (John Murray, 1898-1975). Murray writes as a confessional Presbyterian theologian engaging Calvin within the Reformed tradition; dialogue with scholastic and modern critiques of divine sovereignty and biblical authority.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Murray argues that Calvin presents a coherent theological system in which **Scripture's authority** and **divine sovereignty** are mutually reinforcing: Scripture is the instrument and witness of God's sovereign self-revelation, and God's sovereign decree is the theological ground for the reliability and effectiveness of revelation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of Calvin's doctrine of Scripture: inspiration, perspicuity, necessity of the Spirit's internal witness, sufficiency for faith and life.
 - Examination of Calvin's doctrine of revelation: relation of general revelation (creation/conscience) to special revelation (Scripture/Christ), and the limits of natural theology.
 - Analysis of Calvin's doctrine of God: knowability (through works and Word) vs. incomprehensibility of God's essence; how this bears on human knowledge and worship.
 - Treatment of providence and foreknowledge: Calvin's determinative decree, compatibilist account of human responsibility, and theodicy-how God permits sin yet remains sovereign and holy.
 - Synthesis: Scripture functions as the normative disclosure of the sovereign God whose decrees undergird history and revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, Commentaries). Secondary interlocutors: Augustine (as Calvin's patrimony), medieval scholasticism (contrast), Luther (points of agreement and divergence), and modern critics who see Calvin as fatalistic or anti-intellectual.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (general/special), Scripture (inspiration, perspicuity, sufficiency), God (existence, knowability, incomprehensibility), providence, predestination/foreknowledge, the problem of evil.
- **Closing line:** Murray locates Calvin's center of gravity in the conviction that **God's sovereign decree and God's self-disclosing Word form a single theological axis**: Scripture is trustworthy because God sovereignly wills and accomplishes the salvation it announces.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Calvin's insistence that the Spirit's inner testimony is necessary to make Scripture efficacious - not merely propositional assent but spiritual illumination enabling true knowledge of God.
 - Strong conflation of God's decree with historical causality without reducing human responsibility.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against scholastic tendencies to separate natural theology from redemptive revelation, Murray shows Calvin integrates general revelation as true but insufficient - a remedialist critique of autonomous natural theology.
 - Against caricatures of Calvin as fatalist, Murray stresses Calvin's compatibilist nuance: divine causality and human culpability both affirmed.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Calvin's practical epistemology: knowledge of God is both propositional (Scripture) and existential (Spirit-wrought). Murray highlights Calvin's language of "illumination" as epistemic and soteriological.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Murray's presentation reinforced a mid-20th-century Reformed retrieval of Calvin as systematic theologian rather than merely exegete; shaped conservative Reformed teaching on Scripture and providence.
 - Influential among confessional Presbyterians for defending Calvin's coherence on foreknowledge and theodicy.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies how a high view of Scripture coheres with rigorous doctrines of divine sovereignty and providence.
 - Provides pedagogical resource for explaining compatibilist solutions to the problem of evil without dismissing moral responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Special Revelation:** Scripture and Christ as the decisive, saving disclosure of God; Scripture's authority derives from being the Spirit-witnessed Word.
- **General Revelation:** Knowledge of God from creation and conscience - true but insufficient for salvation; prepares the mind for special revelation.
- **Perspicuity of Scripture:** The Bible's essential clarity in matters necessary for salvation, yet requiring the Spirit for saving understanding.
- **Internal Witness of the Spirit:** The Spirit's work to convince and illuminate sinners so that Scripture becomes living and effective.
- **Divine Sovereignty (Decree):** God's eternal will by which all things come to pass; for Calvin (as Murray presents), the basis of providential order and biblical reliability.
- **Foreknowledge:** Not merely divine foresight but encompassed within God's eternal decree; knowledge is comprehensive and causally sovereign.
- **Providence:** God's active governance of creation - including preservation, concurrence, and permissive will regarding evil.
 - Concurrence: God concurs with secondary causes to bring about effects without being the author of sin.
- **Problem of Evil / Theodicy:** Calvinian response: God permits sin for his wise ends while remaining just and holy; human sin is culpable though included in the scope of divine governance.
- **Knowability of God:** God is knowable in works and Word but remains inscrutable in essence; revelation mediates true knowledge without exhaustively defining the divine essence.
- **Illumination (Epistemic):** The Spirit-enabled appropriation of revealed truth - epistemology fused with soteriology.
- **Responsibility vs. Sovereignty (Compatibilism):** Human moral agency operates within divine ordination; Murray stresses Calvin's maintenance of both without contradiction.
- **Scripture as Instrumental Cause:** Scripture is the means ordained by God to effect salvation and knowledge.
- **Christocentric Canon:** Calvin's primacy of Christ as the focal point of Scripture's witness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed affirmations linking Scripture's authority with divine decree (systematic theology).
- As a **polemic resource** against views that separate God's sovereignty from human responsibility or that elevate natural theology above redemptive revelation.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Calvin: attend to his intertwining of biblical exegesis, pastoral concern, and doctrinal system.
