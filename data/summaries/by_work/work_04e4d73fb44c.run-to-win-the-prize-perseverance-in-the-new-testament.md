### TITLE
Run to Win the Prize: Perseverance in the New Testament - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-20th century evangelical/Reformed milieu addressing heightened debate over "eternal security" vs. conditional security.
 - Reaction to both loose assurances ("once saved, always saved") and radical warnings that imply no lasting assurance; aligns with scholarly turn to rigorous NT exegesis of warning passages.

- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament presents perseverance as both God-ordained and demanded: true believers are kept by God and yet called to continue in faith and obedience; warning passages are real and must be taken seriously as indicators that apostasy is possible for those who abandon faith.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of key NT corpora (Pauline letters, Hebrews, Johannine epistles, Pastoral Epistles, Revelation) analyzing:
 - The language and function of warnings and exhortations.
 - The relationship between faith, works, and final salvation as portrayed in texts.
 - The evidential role of perseverance for genuine faith.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Perseverance is a gift of God's sustaining grace.
 - Human responsibility (continued faith, repentance, obedience) is genuine and necessary.
 - Apostasy is possible for those who fall away, often presented as abandoning faith rather than mere antecedent ethical failure.
 - Pastoral implications regarding assurance, church discipline, and evangelistic urgency.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interaction with both Arminian and Calvinist interlocutors in the modern debate over security.
 - Dialogues with contemporary NT scholars on the interpretation of warning passages (e.g., those who minimize vs. emphasize their force).
 - Implicit engagement with classical Reformed emphases on perseverance (Calvin/Owen) and Wesleyan emphases on conditional perseverance.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (esp. perseverance of the saints, assurance)
 - Sanctification and the ethic of discipleship
 - Ecclesiology (discipline, communal perseverance)
 - Biblical theology of apostasy and final judgment

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner's theological center: perseverance is simultaneously God's preserving work and the believer's calling to steadfast faith - the NT's warnings are not rhetorical only but pastoral-theological means to preserve the elect in faith and obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful, text-driven balancing of divine preservation and human responsibility rather than either extreme of unconditional security or purely conditional salvation.
 - Treats warning passages as pastorally intended, soteriologically significant instruments rather than peripheral admonitions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects "cheap assurance" models that ignore warning texts.
 - Contrasts with some Arminian readings that treat all warnings as hypothetical tests only; Schreiner reads many warnings as addressing real concern about genuine falling away.
 - Distinguishes from hyper-Calvinist positions by affirming authentic human agency and the normative necessity of perseverance.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Emphasizes "perseverance" as a relational, covenantal continuity (faith sustained) rather than a merely forensic once-for-all status.
 - Frames apostasy primarily as repudiation/abandonment of faith, clarifying categories for pastoral diagnosis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries as a standard, balanced treatment of NT perseverance.
 - Influential in pastoral and academic contexts for training in how to handle assurance and warning texts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined exegesis tied to pastoral theology.
 - Serves as a constructive mediating position in the security debate useful for preaching, counseling, and classroom debate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Perseverance**
 - Continued faith and obedience expected of believers; both a divine gift and a human duty.

- **Apostasy**
 - Actual falling away or repudiation of faith; not mere lapses in morality but abandonment of covenantal trust.

- **Warning passages**
 - NT exhortations (Hebrews, Paul, John, Pastoral Epistles) that function as real checks against apostasy and therefore carry soteriological weight.

- **Assurance**
 - Confident hope of final salvation grounded in present faith and evidenced by perseverance; not a license for complacency.

- **Divine preservation**
 - God's sustaining, keeping work that secures final salvation for those who persevere in faith.

- **Human responsibility**
 - The believer's obligation to continue in faith, guarded by means of grace (Word, sacraments, discipline, prayer).

- **Evidence of true faith**
 - Perseverance and moral/communal faithfulness as indices that faith is genuine and not merely nominal.

- **Final salvation**
 - The consummated state contingent on persevering trust; Schreiner avoids purely forensic or purely moral definitions.

- **Exhortation as pastoral instrument**
 - Warnings framed as purposes to preserve and restore, not merely to test.

- **Covenantal continuity**
 - Emphasis on relational continuity with Christ rather than a one-time transactional certification.

- **Soteriological balance**
 - Integration of God's sovereignty and human responsibility without reducing one to the other.

- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: Offers a working definition of perseverance for soteriology courses.
 - Polemic: Employed against both "once-saved-always-saved" and radical conditional-security extremes.
 - Exegetical model: Serves as a methodological exemplar for handling NT warning passages in biblical theology and pastoral studies.
