### TITLE
The Current Reformed Debate Concerning the Mosaic Covenant (Westminster Theological Journal, 1980) - O. Palmer Robertson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed covenant-theological debate (1970s-1980s). Responds to a surge of interest in covenant typology and the status of Sinai within Reformed orthodoxy, notably the proposals of Meredith Kline and other neo-federalists.
 - Conversation occurs against Westminster Confession tradition and revived federal theology (Vos, Murray), with renewed attention to exegetical and redemptive-historical method.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Robertson challenges readings that construe the Mosaic covenant as a bona fide *Covenant of Works* (or a republication thereof). He insists the Mosaic covenant must be located within the continuity of the *Covenant of Grace* while acknowledging its unique legal and national features.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of the debate: describes Kline's "works principle at Sinai" and other republican readings that treat Sinai as a works-based legal covenant.
 - Exegetical assessment: reads key Sinai texts (Exodus 19-24, Deuteronomy formulations) to show presence of promissory-gracious dimensions alongside law and sanctions.
 - Theological synthesis: argues Mosaic covenant functions as a distinctive administration of the covenant of grace - legal and covenantal without collapsing into a pure covenant of works.
 - Practical implication: warns against bifurcating biblical covenants in ways that undercut Christ-centered continuity and the pedagogical role of law.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Meredith G. Kline and the neo-federalists advocating a Sinai works-structure.
 - Traditions appealed to: Westminster/confessional Reformed theology, Vosian federalism, John Murray's covenantal continuity.
 - Scriptural focus: Pentateuchal covenant texts, especially Sinai/Deuteronomic formulations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Covenant of Works vs Covenant of Grace)
 - Law and gospel relation; typology and pedagogy of the Mosaic law
 - Soteriology (implications for Christ's fulfillment of law)
 - Ecclesiology / national election and corporate covenantal status of Israel
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Robertson centers the argument on continuity: Sinai must be viewed as a legal and disciplinary administration within the covenant of grace rather than a restored covenant of works, thereby preserving Christ-centered redemption and covenantal unity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on preserving the Covenant of Grace as the hermeneutical axis for understanding Mosaic stipulations.
 - Careful balance: affirms the legal, national and sanction-bearing character of Sinai without recasting it as salvific works-demand.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to Meredith Kline and similar readings that posit a genuine covenant of works at Sinai or a republication of the Adamic covenant.
 - Reaffirms classical Westminster and Vosian emphases on continuity and redemptive-historical unity.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and refines language distinguishing *administration* of the covenant of grace from *new* covenants (works/republication), offering tighter categories for legal versus promissory elements.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among those seeking to moderate neo-federalist extremes; often cited in subsequent evaluations of Sinai in Reformed systematic and biblical theology.
 - Provided a measured alternative that shaped seminary teaching and later syntheses that maintain covenantal continuity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students to see disciplined exegetical theology applied to covenantal taxonomy.
 - Endures as a corrective resource against over-reading "works" language at Sinai and for preserving Christological interpretation of law.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - The covenant given at Sinai; Robertson reads it as an administration within the Covenant of Grace, with distinct legal and national features.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The Adamic paradigm of obedience-for-life; Robertson resists locating a true repeat of this at Sinai.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The overarching redemptive covenant centered in Christ; the hermeneutical lens for interpreting Mosaic law in Robertson's argument.
- **Republication (of the Covenant of Works)**
 - The claim that Sinai republishes Adamic works-conditions; Robertson critiques this as hermeneutically and theologically problematic.
- **Works Principle at Sinai**
 - Kline's phrase for Sinai's supposed works-basis; Robertson disputes that this principle defines the Mosaic covenant.
- **Law and Gospel**
 - Relationship emphasized: Mosaic law has a covenantal/legal role but must be read in light of the gospel and Christ's fulfillment.
- **Administration (of the covenant)**
 - Key term: Mosaic covenant as an *administration* - a distinct economy within the covenant of grace rather than an independent covenant of salvation by works.
- **Sanctions / Curses**
 - The punitive elements in Sinai; Robertson acknowledges them but argues they function within covenantal discipline, typology, and pedagogical redemptive history.
- **Typology / Pedagogy of Law**
 - Law's role to instruct, condemn, and point forward to Christ rather than to establish a salvific works-rhythm.
- **National Election / Corporate Covenant**
 - Emphasizes Israel's corporate, national covenantal status and the socio-political character of Mosaic stipulations.
- **Redemptive-Historical Reading**
 - Robertson's method: reading Sinai within salvation-history to preserve continuity toward Christ.
- **Westminster / Confessional Anchor**
 - Uses confessional categories to guard against radical reclassifications of Sinai.
- **Exegetical model**
 - Close textual reading of Exodus/Deuteronomy as primary evidence.
- **Christological Fulfillment**
 - Implicit and explicit: Mosaic law's goal is fulfilled in Christ, sustaining covenantal continuity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing "administration of the covenant of grace" from a true "covenant of works."
 - As a **polemic** resource against neo-federalist/republication claims (notably Kline).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Sinai texts within redemptive history while preserving confessional continuity.
