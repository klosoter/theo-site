### TITLE
On the Nature of Good (De Natura Boni) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 4th century (shortly after Augustine's conversion, before episcopacy). Written within the anti-Manichaean polemical milieu and deeply shaped by Christian appropriation of Neoplatonic metaphysics; addresses a pressing pastoral and intellectual problem in Latin Christianity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Evil is not a positive substance but a privation or lack of good (privatio boni); therefore God, as supreme Good and Being, cannot be the author of evil. This is offered as a theodical response to Manichaean dualism and to questions about divine justice.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Premise: Goodness correlates with being; whatever has being participates in the good.
 - Consequence: Evil cannot be a kind of being; it is a deficiency, a corruption, or privation of rightly ordered being.
 - Moral evil: arises when rational creatures misuse free will and turn away from higher goods (disordered will/love).
 - Physical or natural evils: are not created evils but consequences of the mutable, finite order of creation (defects, privations within created being) and permitted within providence for greater goods or the maintenance of cosmic order.
 - Conclusion: God remains supremely good and just; evils are contingent privations within creatures, explained by will, finitude, and divine permitting rather than by divine causation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Principal interlocutor is Manichaean dualism; Augustine reworks Neoplatonic categories (Plotinus, Porphyry indirectly) and Christian Scripture/theology to displace a dualist ontology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, providence, free will, evil (moral and natural), metaphysics of being and goodness (ontological correlation), implicitly informs later treatments of sin, grace, and divine justice - Trinity and Christology are not primary here.
- **Closing line:** A concise theodical move: by identifying evil as privation within created beings and grounding goodness in being itself, Augustine secures divine goodness and justice while accounting for moral and natural evils via creaturely will and finitude.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The famous formulation that evil is non-entity (privatio boni) rather than a positive substance.
 - Tightly links ontology and ethics: "to be" = "to be good" (participation of creatures in the Good).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct correction of Manichaean and other dualisms that posit two coequal substances (Good and Evil).
 - Moves beyond purely ethical accounts of evil by grounding the argument in metaphysics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic Christian appropriation of Neoplatonic participation language to make a moral-metaphysical case about evil.
 - Distinction between privation (ontological defect) and positive being that anticipates medieval scholastic categories.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Deeply formative for Latin Christian and medieval theologies (Augustine -> Anselm -> Aquinas).
 - Influenced Reformation discussions about sin, depravity, and divine sovereignty (Calvin and later Protestant theodicy inherit the privation frame even when emphasizing total depravity and divine causality).
 - Continues to anchor orthodox responses to theodicy across traditions as a first-order analytic move.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear, portable conceptual apparatus for the problem of evil.
 - Serves as a paradigmatic example of theological synthesis: scriptural fidelity, pastoral urgency, and metaphysical reasoning.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Privatio boni (privation of good):** Core claim: evil is a lack or corruption of good, not a created positive thing.
- **Bonum = being:** Goodness is ontologically linked to being; to have being is to participate in the good.
- **Malum:** Understood as privation rather than substance; applied to moral and natural defects.
- **Deus as summum bonum / ipsum esse:** God conceived as the supreme Good and the source/ground of being.
- **Libera voluntas (free will):** Source of moral evil when will turns from higher goods; central to moral responsibility.
- **Disordered love / ordo amoris:** Ethical diagnosis of sin: loves misordered, leading to privation of rightly ordered goodness.
- **Providentia (providence) vs. causa:** Distinguishes divine permission from direct causation; God permits privations within created order for greater goods.
- **Created finitude / mutability:** Explains natural evils as consequences of creaturely limitation, not divine malevolence.
- **Participation (participatio):** Creatures derive being/goodness by participation in God, following Neoplatonic vocabulary.
- **Moral vs. natural evil:** Moral evil located in will/disordered agency; natural evil as structural privation in creation.
- **Ontological priority:** Being/goodness has priority over privation; shapes subsequent metaphysical theology.
- **Polemic function:** Used to refute Manichaean dualism and to defend divine justice.
- **Analytic model for theodicy:** Provides a conceptual pivot used across loci - definition source for "evil as privation"; polemic against dualism; and an exegetical-metaphysical model for integrating creation, will, and providence.
