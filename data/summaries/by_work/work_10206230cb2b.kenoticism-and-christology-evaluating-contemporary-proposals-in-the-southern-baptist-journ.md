### TITLE
Kenoticism and Christology: Evaluating Contemporary Proposals - Stephen J. Wellum, The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology (2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early-21st-century conservative evangelical debate about how to interpret Philippians 2:6-8 and the kenosis motif amid renewed scholarly proposals that press a stronger sense of divine self-emptying.
 - Published in an SBC journal addressing pastors, students, and conservative theologians concerned with confessional orthodoxy and biblical fidelity.

- **Central thesis**
 - Contemporary kenotic proposals that posit an ontological relinquishing of divine attributes in the incarnation are theologically defective; a properly Reformed/Chalcedonian Christology must preserve the integrity of both natures without implying divine change or loss.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchor: a close reading of Philippians 2:6-8 is used to delimit what "emptied himself" can and cannot mean.
 - Distinguishes types of kenosis:
 - **Ontological kenosis** (the Son ceases to possess certain divine attributes) - rejected as incompatible with divine immutability and classical Christology.
 - **Voluntary/self-limiting/functionalist kenosis** (the Son refrains from exercising attributes in the incarnate state) - given constrained allowance if formulated carefully.
 - Appeals to historical doctrinal benchmarks:
 - Chalcedonian dyophysite formulation (two natures, one person).
 - Classical attributes of God (immutability, omniscience, omnipotence) and how they relate to the incarnate Son.
 - Practical soteriological and Trinitarian implications: shows how ontological kenosis jeopardizes the atonement, the communicatio idiomatum, and personal unity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with modern kenotists (contemporary proponents of stronger kenotic models), historic critics of kenosis (e.g., B. B. Warfield), and the Chalcedonian tradition.
 - Scriptural locus: Philippians 2, John 1, Hebrews, synoptics for Christ's humiliation and exaltation.
 - Theological resources: classical Christological formulations, Reformed systematic categories, historical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (two natures, person of Christ, communicatio idiomatum)
 - Trinity (implications for divine immutability and aseity)
 - Soteriology (sufficiency and efficacy of atonement)
 - Revelation (Christ as definitive self-disclosure of God)

- **Closing line**
 - Wellum locates the theological center of gravity in defending a Chalcedonian, non-kenotic ontology of the Son while allowing only a disciplined notion of voluntary, economical self-limitation as the legitimate sense of Philippians 2:6-8.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear methodological distinction between ontological and functional kenosis, with sustained appeal to both biblical exegesis and classical dogma.
 - Prioritizes the communicatio idiomatum and personal unity as non-negotiable safeguards against theological error.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern kenotic proposals that read Philippians as implying attribute-loss; contrasts them with both classical orthodoxy and nuanced evangelical alternatives that hold to divine immutability.
 - Reclaims a robust soteriological rationale: Christ must retain full divine identity to accomplish and present an efficacious atonement.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Refines the functional/voluntary kenosis category as a viable but limited explanatory move, avoiding older wholesale "emptying" readings that imply metaphysical change.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars as a careful corrective to recent kenotic resurgence.
 - Used in confessional circles to reaffirm Chalcedonian bounds in contemporary Christological construction.

- **Enduring value**
 - Furnishes a concise, disciplined template for students and pastors to evaluate kenotic claims theologically and exegetically.
 - Functions as a hermeneutical guardrail for integrating Philippians 2 with systematic doctrines of God and Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis** - the "emptying" of the Son (Phil 2:7); treated with precise typology (ontological vs. functional).
- **Ontological kenosis** - claim that the Son ceased to possess some divine attributes; rejected as incompatible with immutability and Chalcedon.
- **Functional (voluntary) kenosis** - the Son refrains from exercising divine prerogatives in the incarnation; provisionally affirmed within strict limits.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - the communication of properties between Christ's two natures; a central hermeneutical principle for Wellum.
- **Chalcedonian definition** - historic norm (two natures, one person) used as the decisive doctrinal boundary.
- **Divine immutability** - God's unchanging nature; invoked to oppose any doctrine implying loss or change in the Son.
- **Impassibility / aseity** - related attributes appealed to in arguing against ontological change.
- **Philippians 2:6-8** - exegetical fulcrum; "emptied himself" interpreted as humiliation/self-limitation, not attribute-loss.
- **Person vs. nature distinction** - keeps the unity of the Son's person while distinguishing operations and properties of the two natures.
- **Soteriological sufficiency** - argument that Christ must retain divine identity to achieve objective atonement.
- **Economic Trinity** - permitted language for discussing the Son's self-limitation in redemptive history (without altering immanent Trinity).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** resource against ontological kenotic models in systematic theology courses.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Philippians 2 in Christological contexts that respect classical dogma.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Trinitarian and soteriological discussions to distinguish voluntary self-limitation from metaphysical loss.
