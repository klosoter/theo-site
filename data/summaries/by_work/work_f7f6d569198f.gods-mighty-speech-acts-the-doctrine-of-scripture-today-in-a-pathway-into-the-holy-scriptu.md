### TITLE
God's Mighty Speech-Acts: The Doctrine of Scripture Today (in A Pathway into the Holy Scripture, 1999) - Kevin J. Vanhoozer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical and academic theology grappling with postmodern hermeneutics, renewed interest in linguistic philosophy, and intra-evangelical debates (inerrancy, inspiration, open theism).
 - Vanhoozer situates himself within Reformed-conservative evangelicalism but engages analytic philosophy of language (Austin, Searle) and contemporary theological critics (Barthians, postmodern hermeneuts, open theists).
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture should be understood primarily as **divine speech-acts**: when Scripture speaks, God acts communicatively - authoritative, performative, and covenant-constitutive - rather than as merely a repository of encoded propositions or merely human texts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Problem posed: competing models (propositional/inerrantist statements about God, literary/postmodern reader-centered views, and open-theist emphases on divine temporality and responsiveness) inadequately account for biblical authority and divine condescension.
 - Proposal: import speech-act theory to theology of Scripture.
 - Distinguish locutionary content (propositions), illocutionary force (what the divine utterance does), and perlocutionary effects (response in hearers).
 - Emphasize **illocutionary sovereignty**: God's word has constitutive power (e.g., promises, curses, covenants) and thus grounds Scripture's normative authority.
 - Explain accommodation: God adapts communicative acts to human finitude while remaining genuinely divine in communicative agency.
 - Application: defends a model of inspiration and authority that preserves divine transcendence, authorial intent, and the communicative efficacy of Scripture without reducing Scripture to mere propositions or only human discourse.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Philosophers of language: J.L. Austin, John Searle (speech-act theory).
 - Theologians/critics: Barthian emphases on divine initiative; evangelical propositionalists and inerrantists; proponents of open theism (e.g., Pinnock, Boyd - as representative interlocutors on divine temporality and responsiveness).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, authority of Scripture, divine condescension/accommodation, covenant, divine action (communication), and implications for hermeneutics and ecclesial proclamation.
- **Closing line**
 - Scriptures are best construed not merely as texts asserting theological facts but as **divine communicative acts** - authoritative speech that both reveals and effects covenantal reality through accommodation to human language.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes biblical authority around **illocutionary force**: Scripture's normativity derives from God's speech-act agency, not only from propositional content or ecclesial fiat.
 - Treats divine condescension positively: accommodation is communicative and performative rather than a merely epistemic concession.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against propositionalism: avoids reducing Scripture to a set of atomic true/false propositions detached from speech-act force.
 - Against radical reader-response/postmodernism: insists on authorial (divine and human) communicative intention and the binding power of illocutions.
 - In dialogue with Open Theism: clarifies that seeing God speak as performative need not collapse into anthropomorphic unpredictability; speech-acts show God's reliable covenantal agency while allowing genuine contingencies in reception and human response.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Theological appropriation of speech-act theory as a hermeneutical-practical model for doctrine of Scripture.
 - Phrase and concept: **"God's mighty speech-acts"** - a theological reframing that echoes OT "mighty acts" but relocates emphasis to communicative action.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical hermeneutics, Reformed theological method, and constructive dialogues with analytic philosophy of language.
 - Adopted as corrective in debates over inspiration, authority, and the role of authorial intention; referenced frequently in critiques of both propositionalist and purely socio-linguistic accounts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust, pastorally useful model linking doctrine of Scripture to worship, proclamation, and covenant life; continues to serve as a bridge between analytic philosophy and constructive theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Speech-act** - General category: any utterance that does something (not merely describes).
- **Locutionary act** - The propositional content or meaning of an utterance (what is said).
- **Illocutionary act / force** - What the utterance does (commands, promises, declares) - central to Scripture's authority.
- **Perlocutionary effect** - The effect produced in hearers (repentance, faith, obedience); contingent, not the source of authority.
- **Mighty acts (of God)** - OT motif reinterpreted: God's mighty deeds include **performative speech** that creates and sustains covenant reality.
- **Accommodation** - God's condescending adaptation of speech to human finitude; communicative, not diminutive of divine agency.
- **Illocutionary sovereignty** - Vanhoozer's inference: God's utterances carry constitutive power in covenantal relations.
- **Performative utterance** - Utterances that bring about what they state (e.g., "I forgive you") - model for certain biblical texts.
- **Authorial intention** - Emphasized as theological and hermeneutical anchor: divine-human communicative intent governs authoritative reading.
- **Inspiration / authority** - Recast: inspiration as enabling divine speech-act via human authors; authority derives from God's communicative action.
- **Divine condescension** - Positive theological category: God genuinely enters human language through speech-acts while remaining transcendent.
- **Open Theism (contrast)** - Vanhoozer engages open-theist claims about divine temporality and responsiveness; his model preserves divine communicative reliability without flattening God into human-like conversationality.
- **Covenantal speech** - Emphasis on speech that constitutes covenant relations (promises, law, blessing, curse).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a performative/communicative doctrine of Scripture and inspiration.
- As a **polemic** against reductive propositionalism and against readings of open theism that undermine Scripture's illocutionary authority.
- As an **exegetical hermeneutical model** for reading biblical performatives (e.g., promises, inaugurations, blessings) and for preaching/proclamation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking analytic speech-act theory to classical doctrines of revelation and divine condescension.
