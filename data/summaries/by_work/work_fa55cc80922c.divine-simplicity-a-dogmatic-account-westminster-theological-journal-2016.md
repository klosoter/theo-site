### TITLE
**Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account** - James E. Dolezal (Westminster Theological Journal, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed dogmatics; engagement with classical theism amid late 20th-21st century analytic and historical critiques of divine simplicity.
 - Positioned as a systematic (dogmatic) defense rather than purely analytic metaphysics; aims to integrate biblical, creedal, and metaphysical considerations within a confessionally Reformed horizon.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of **divine simplicity** is indispensable to orthodox dogmatics: God is metaphysically simple (no real composition), and this simplicity must be preserved and articulated coherently against modern objections.
 - Primary doctrinal problem: how to account for divine relationality, attributes, and Trinitarian persons without sacrificing simplicity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Re-state classical simplicity as identity of God's essence and his attributes (no real composition in God).
 - Distinguish **absolute** and **relative** attributes to show how relational predicates do not entail metaphysical composition.
 - Absolute attributes (e.g., omnipotence, omniscience) reflect properties identical with the divine essence.
 - Relative attributes (e.g., Father, Lover) express God's relations but can be understood compatibly with simplicity when properly construed.
 - Address principal objections (modal collapse, incoherence of relations, impassibility, personalness) and propose theological-metaphysical responses.
 - Apply simplicitarian commitments to key loci: doctrine of God, Trinity (relations of origin), and implications for revelation and Christology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on classical patristic and scholastic sources (Augustine, Aquinas) and Reformed confessional tradition.
 - Engages contemporary critics of simplicity from analytic philosophy and modern theology, deploying both metaphysical argumentation and doctrinal resources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (absolute vs relative), Trinity (persons and relations), creation-relation, aseity, immutability, and implications for revelation and Christology.

- **Closing line**
 - Simplicity, rightly construed with a careful absolute/relative attribute distinction, remains the doctrinal hinge for a robust orthodox dogmatics that secures divine transcendence, unity, and personal relation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a dogmatic (normative theological) articulation of simplicity rather than reducing it to an analytic abstraction; integrates biblical, creedal, and metaphysical claims.
 - Promotes the **absolute/relative attribute** taxonomy as the hermeneutic-locutional key to reconcile simplicity with God's relational life.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects modern revisions that either jettison simplicity (favoring divine complex properties) or collapse relational language into mere analogical talk.
 - Contrasts with purely analytic defenses that neglect confessional and exegetical commitments; likewise distances from Thomistic readings that treat relations as accidental in ways incompatible with Reformed dogmatics.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes the use of **relative attributes** (relations as legitimately predicated without implying composition) within a simplicitarian metaphysic; this calibrated use serves as a terminological pivot.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Taken up within contemporary Reformed and evangelical circles as a rigorous resource for teaching classical theism; cited in debates over the viability of simplicity for Trinitarian theology.
 - Provoked further analytic-theological exchanges about the coherence of relations in God and the best metaphysical framework for attributes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating confessional commitments with contemporary metaphysical discussion; useful for advanced seminars on divine attributes and Trinitarian dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity** - doctrine that God has no metaphysical composition; attributes are identical with divine essence.
- **Absolute Attributes** - predicates that denote features of God identical to his essence (e.g., aseity, immutability, eternality).
- **Relative Attributes** - predicates expressing God's relations (e.g., Father, Lord, Redeemer); treated so as not to compromise simplicity.
 - Relation to persons/Trinity: relative attributes point to relations of origin that are consistent with essence-attribute identity.
- **Essence-Attribute Identity** - the claim that God's properties are not distinct constituents but are identical with his singular divine essence.
- **Relations of Origin** - the intra-divine relations (e.g., Father-Son procession) accounted for without introducing composition.
- **Modal Collapse** - potential objection that simplicity collapses creaturely contingency into necessity; Dolezal offers theological and metaphysical responses.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; under simplicity this is an absolute attribute intrinsic to the divine essence.
- **Immutability / Impassibility** - divine unchangeability and freedom from passible alteration defended as coherent with relational predicates.
- **Analogy of Being (analogia entis)** - implicit methodological assumption for predication about God while maintaining qualitative distinction.
- **Dogmatic Method** - integration of Scripture, creeds, and metaphysical principles in articulating simplicity.
- **Personal Relation (in God)** - treated as genuine and compatible with simplicity when understood as identity-preserving relations.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - authoritative articulation of classical simplicity for systematic theology courses.
- **Polemic and defense** - deployed against modern critics who deny simplicity or claim it undermines Trinitarian personalism.
- **Conceptual pivot** - serves as a hermeneutical bridge between attribute theology and Trinitarian doctrine, especially via the absolute/relative distinction.
