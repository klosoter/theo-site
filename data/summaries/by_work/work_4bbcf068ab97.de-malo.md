### TITLE
De Malo - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-13th century scholasticism (Dominican milieu). De Malo is a specialized treatise on evil composed alongside Aquinas's larger works (especially the Summa Theologiae); it synthesizes Augustinian tradition with Aristotelian metaphysics in the context of medieval debates on sin, providence, and original guilt.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Explain the ontological and moral status of evil so as to defend divine goodness, providence, and justice while accounting for human freedom, original sin, and retribution.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Metaphysical premise: **evil is a privation of good** (privatio boni), not a positive substance; follows Boethius/Augustine and Aristotle's influence.
 - Causal ordering: God is first cause of being; evil arises from the limited, contingent activity of finite creatures (privation inhering in a good subject).
 - Moral psychology: sin is a disorder of the will - a privation of the good of the will - arising from inordinate attachment (concupiscence) and defective deliberation.
 - Providence and foreknowledge: God permits but does not positively cause moral evil; divine foreknowledge and predestination are compatible with culpable human freedom through an account of primary/secondary causality.
 - Original sin and consequences: original sin transmits a corrupted nature (loss of original justice, inclination to concupiscence) and thus grounds guilt, death, and the need for redemption.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine (dominant theological source), Aristotle (metaphysics and moral psychology), Boethius (definition of evil), Peter Lombard, and various medieval anti-Manichaean and anti-Pelagian interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Doctrine of sin (personal and original), divine omnipotence and goodness, providence and foreknowledge, freedom and moral responsibility, merit and punishment, eschatological consequences.
- **Closing line:** De Malo centers on a metaphysical account of evil as privation integrated with a moral theology of will and responsibility, preserving God's goodness and providence while giving a robust account of sin, guilt, and the need for redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Systematic use of *privation theory* across moral, physical, and metaphysical evil with precise causal distinctions (first cause vs. secondary causes).
 - A finely textured account of will: evil as an ontological privation of the will's good, grounded in cognitive and appetitive disorder.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Rebuttal of Manichaean/dualistic accounts that posit evil as a substantive principle.
 - Pushback on Pelagian minimization of original guilt; insists on transmitted corruption without making God the author of sin.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Synthesis of Augustinian moral insight with Aristotelian causal language (actus, potentia, privatio) to treat sin both metaphysically and morally.
 - Clear distinctions among forms of evil (malum metaphysicum, malum morale, malum physicum) as different manifestations of privation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central in later scholastic commentaries and Catholic teaching on sin, providence, and theodicy; provided a primary Thomistic model for seminaries and manuals.
 - Engaged critically by Reformation theologians - accepted in part (privation theory) but debated on original sin, grace, and freedom.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a model for integrating metaphysics, moral psychology, and soteriology; indispensable for courses on theodicy, anthropology, and classical doctrines of sin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Malum (evil):** treated primarily as privation (privatio boni), not positive being.
- **Privatio boni (privation of good):** core metaphysical definition that undergirds moral and natural evil.
- **Peccatum (sin):** moral privation of the will - concrete voluntary disorder.
- **Culpability / culpa:** moral blameworthiness that presupposes voluntary choice; distinguished from merely natural defects.
- **Concupiscentia (concupiscence):** disordered inclination flowing from original sin; explains propensity to actual sin.
- **Original sin (peccatum originans):** transmitted corruption and loss of original justice, grounding solidarity in guilt and death.
- **Providence (divina providentia):** divine ordering of ends; God permits evil as part of secondary causality while remaining the sovereign first cause.
- **Foreknowledge & predestination:** God's knowledge and ordering of events do not negate human moral responsibility due to distinction of causality.
- **Privative categories:** malum metaphysicum (privation in being), malum physicum (suffering, disorder in nature), malum morale (sin).
- **Secondary causality:** creatures as genuine causes of evil insofar as privations arise within their actions; God as permissive cause.
- **Punishment & justice:** punitive ordering is a rectifying response to moral privation consonant with divine justice and mercy.
- **Hypothetical "If Adam had not sinned":** used to probe contingency vs. providential ordering; Aquinas argues sin does not add to goodness but its existence is compatible with God's ordered ends and need for redemption.
- **Merit & retribution:** moral acts' value depends on orientation toward God and restoration of order; pertinent to soteriology and eschatology.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the privation theory of evil in metaphysics and moral theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against Manichaean/dualistic and Pelagian positions on evil and sin.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for arguments about original sin, culpability, providence, and theodicy in systematic theology.
