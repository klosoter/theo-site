### TITLE
We Become What We Worship: A Biblical Theology of Idolatry - Gregory K. Beale

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published within contemporary evangelical-Reformed scholarship (2008). Beale writes as a New Testament scholar with strong canonical and typological commitments, reacting against reductionist sociological or purely archaeological treatments of idolatry and offering a biblically grounded theological account for church teaching and cultural critique.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Bible presents idolatry not merely as false belief or illegal cultic practice but as a formative, covenantal process: the human will and nature are shaped into the image of what is worshiped. True worship conforms humanity to God; idolatry deforms and recasts humans after created things (we become what we worship).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of Old Testament material: image theology, temple, prophets, covenantal accusations of "treason" against Yahweh.
 - Canonical and intertextual method: tracing motifs (image, presence, enthronement, covenant loyalty) across OT and into the NT.
 - New Testament application: Paul, Colossians, Romans, Revelation reframe idol-worship as allegiance to rival "lords" and cosmic powers; Christ as the true image and eschatological repair of idol-formed persons.
 - Theological synthesis: idolatry as ontological and moral transformation, tied to soteriology and eschatology - worship shapes final destiny.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive use of OT prophets and wisdom literature, Pauline corpus, Johannine and Apocalypse literature. Engages modern interpreters across evangelical, critical, and historical-critical lines (canonical critics, some patristic and Reformation footholds), and dialogues with sociological/anthropological studies when critiquing them.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, image of God (anthropology), sin and free will (moral agency shaped by worship), covenant, temple/eschatology, Christology (Christ as true image), sanctification and deification themes.
- **Closing line:** Worship is formative; idolatry is covenantal treason that remakes human identity - Christ as the true image is the biblical remedy and eschatological telos.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Canonical-intertextual method:** Beale reads the Bible as an interconnected canon, showing how later texts reinterpret earlier ones to build an integrated theology of idolatry.
- **Formative account of idolatry:** Moves beyond cognitive or ritual definitions to emphasize ontological transformation - worship changes what a person becomes.
- **Christ-centered resolution:** Idolatry is overcome not merely by cognitive correction but by reintegration into the true image in Christ and participation in the restored temple-community.
- **Contrast to sociological reductionism:** Argues against accounts that reduce idolatry to social power or economic function, insisting on spiritual/metaphysical consequences and agency (relevant to Sin and Free Will).
- **Typological and eschatological density:** Uses typology (images, stones, temple motifs) to show anti-type/fulfillment in Christ and the eschatological undoing of idols.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a substantial theological and pastoral resource on idolatry; cited in discussions of worship, cultural critique, spiritual formation, and preaching.
- **Enduring value:** Supplies a richly textured exegetical foundation for pastoral teaching on sin (esp. voluntary allegiance), Christian formation, and cultural engagement; valuable as both scholarly synthesis and practical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Idolatry:** More than image-worship; a formative allegiance that remakes human being and community.
- **Worship (leiturgia/latreia):** The decisive human activity that configures identity and destiny.
- **Image (tselem/imago):** Central motif - humans are formed after an image; idols make humans after false images; Christ is the true image.
- **Covenant treason:** Idolatry framed as covenantal betrayal rather than merely error.
- **Temple/Presence:** Temple symbolism maps God's presence and rival claims; idolatry is relocation of presence.
- **Cosmic powers:** Idols aligned with spiritual forces that exert formative influence; Paul and Revelation language are key.
- **Typology/intertextuality:** Methodological terms: Old Testament types re-read in light of New Testament fulfillment.
- **Deformation vs. re-formation:** Idolatry as deformation of the imago Dei; Christ and the Spirit as agents of re-formation.
- **Apotheosis/deification (negative and positive):** Idolatry offers false elevation of human/divine, while Christian deification is restorative and Christ-centered.
- **Presence/absence (ontological status of idols):** Idols are "nothing" in ultimate being but effective in shaping worshipers.
- **Volitional agency (Sin and Free Will):** Idolatry as a willful turning; freedom exercised toward rival goods with moral consequences.
- **Liturgical anthropology:** The idea that liturgy/worship practices cultivate human desires and identity.
- **Eschatological telos:** Final resolution-humans conformed to true image and restored worship.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a definitional and exegetical source for preaching and teaching on idolatry/worship.
 - As a polemical resource against reductionist sociologies and cultural idolatries (consumerism, nationalism).
 - As a conceptual pivot in moral theology and spiritual formation: locates sin and free will within the shaping power of worship practices.
