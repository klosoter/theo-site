### TITLE
Grace and the Will According to Thomas Aquinas - Bernard Lonergan (study of Thomas Aquinas)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Thomistic renewal and Lonergan's early work (first edition 1943); emerges amid neo-scholastic debates and renewed interest in Aquinas' psychology and soteriology.
 - Lonergan reads Aquinas through his developing transcendental and conversional concerns; responds to semi-Pelagian, Molinist, and mechanistic readings of grace.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To recover and systematize Aquinas' account of divine grace and human will so that God's causal sovereignty and genuine human freedom/cooperation are both preserved.
 - Specific focus on how **common grace** and **preparatory (prevenient) grace** operate within Aquinas' framework to render free will responsive without undermining divine efficacious causality.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Thomistic categories: habitual vs actual grace; operative (gratia operans) vs cooperative grace (gratia cooperans); sufficient vs efficacious influence.
 - Analysis of the will's natural capacities after the Fall (concupiscence, disorder) and the necessity of gratuitous divine assistance to restore directed willing.
 - Reconstruction of Aquinas' causal schema: primary causality of God under which secondary human causality remains genuinely free.
 - Special treatment of **common grace** (general goods and natural aids given to all) and **preparatory grace** (divine influences that dispose the soul toward supernatural openness) showing their distinct roles in the economy of salvation.
 - Concludes by arguing that Aquinas provides a model where grace is not merely external assistance but a transformative causality that respects personhood and meritorious cooperation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, Summa Contra Gentiles, Scriptum super Sententiis).
 - Secondary/contextual: Augustine (on prevenient grace), classical scholastics, contemporary neo-scholastics, and Lonergan's own methodological engagements.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (habitual/actual; operative/cooperative; sufficient/efficacious), free will, original sin and concupiscence, merit, divine causality vs secondary causality, conversion (implicit in Lonergan's reading).

- **Closing line**
 - Lonergan reads Aquinas as offering a coherent synthesis: divine grace is both the ground of supernatural reorientation and the condition that preserves authentic human freedom and moral responsibility.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the dynamics between **preparatory** and **common** grace: preparatory grace as specific dispositional aid toward supernatural receptivity; common grace as broader goods sustaining human life and natural virtues.
 - Highlights the transformational character of grace (not merely additive assistance) that restructures intentionality of the will.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges neo-scholastic mechanical readings that render grace as external push; insists on a relational, subject-centered account compatible with Thomistic causality.
 - Distinguishes Aquinas from simplistic Augustinian determinism and from semi-Pelagian accounts that over-emphasize human initiative.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates operative/cooperative and sufficient/efficacious distinctions with attention to human subjectivity and conversion psychology.
 - Integrates Thomistic metaphysical categories with Lonergan's nascent transcendental method (attention, understanding, judgment, decision).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among Lonergan scholars and many 20th-century Thomists seeking a recovery of Aquinas that attends to subjectivity and historical psychology.
 - Served as a resource for Catholic systematic theology; less traction in Reformed circles but used in comparative debates on prevenient grace.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies Thomistic categories for modern theological method; supplies a nuanced model for balancing divine causality and human freedom useful in pastoral and doctrinal contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Operative grace (gratia operans)** - grace that moves the will from without, initiating the act.
- **Cooperative grace (gratia cooperans)** - grace that enables and perfects human cooperation with divine movement.
- **Efficacious grace** - grace that infallibly produces the intended supernatural effect (in Thomistic account).
- **Sufficient grace** - grace that makes the act possible but not inevitably achieved without human consent.
- **Habitual grace (gratia habitualis)** - sanctifying gift that disposes the soul to supernatural acts.
- **Actual grace (gratia actualis)** - transient divine helps prompting specific acts.
- **Preparatory / prevenient grace** - divine dispositions that prepare the will for openness to supernatural grace; central in Lonergan's emphasis on gradual dispositional work.
- **Common grace (gratia communis)** - general provision of goods and natural aids available to all, not necessarily for salvation but sustaining moral order and natural virtue.
 - Relation to preparatory grace: common grace sustains life and natural virtues; preparatory grace specifically inclines toward supernatural receptivity.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - genuine secondary causality preserved by Aquinas; freedom defined as rational appetite ordered by reason but wounded by concupiscence.
- **Concupiscence** - disorder of appetite after Fall; explains need for preparatory and operative grace.
- **Merit (condign vs congruous)** - how human acts relate to divine reward under reconstituted will by grace.
- **Primary vs secondary causality** - God as first cause who does not obliterate secondary (human) causality.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Thomistic distinctions (operative/cooperative; habitual/actual; common/preparatory grace).
- As a **polemic tool** against both deterministic readings of grace and semi-Pelagian minimizations of prevenient/dispositional divine aid.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Aquinas in conversation with modern questions about subjectivity, conversion, and moral responsibility.
