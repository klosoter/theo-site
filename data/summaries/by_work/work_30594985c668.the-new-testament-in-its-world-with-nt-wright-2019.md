### TITLE
The New Testament in Its World (N. T. Wright & Michael F. Bird, 2019)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - A 2019 comprehensive introductory textbook situating New Testament writings in their first‑century Jewish, Greco‑Roman, and early Christian contexts. Associated with the wider movement around the New Perspective on Paul (N. T. Wright prominent), intended for seminary and advanced undergraduate use.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The New Testament must be read as historically embedded: its theology arises from Second Temple Judaism and early Christian reinterpretation of Israel's covenantal story. Paul's letters (notably Romans) address the relationship of Israel and the Gentile mission without collapsing Jewish continuity or making ethnic Israel obsolete.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Overview of historical, social, and literary contexts of NT writings.
 - Book‑by‑book introduction combining historical background, authorship, date, occasion, genre, major themes, and theological significance.
 - Thematic treatment of major theological loci (Christology, salvation, covenant, Israel, eschatology), integrating exegesis and history.
 - Specific treatment of Romans 9-11:
 - Paul's olive‑tree metaphor (Rom 11) framed as corporate/ covenantal argument: Gentile inclusion does not negate God's ongoing purposes for ethnic Israel.
 - "All Israel will be saved" read as eschatological corporate ingathering rather than simple ethnonationalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - N. T. Wright's work and the wider New Perspective on Paul; classical Pauline interpreters; Second Temple Jewish literature (e.g., Psalms of Solomon, Dead Sea Scrolls); patristic interpreters; modern supersessionist and dispensational critiques.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Covenant and election, Pauline soteriology, ecclesiology, Israel and the church, eschatology, Christology, revelation and Scripture as story, and the boundary markers of first‑century Judaism ("works of the law").
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Read the New Testament as the story of God's covenant faithfulness to Israel fulfilled in Jesus and extended to the nations - a framework that preserves Jewish continuity while explaining Gentile incorporation without simple replacement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on historical narrative and covenantal continuity: the church is not a wholesale replacement of Israel but the people of God formed through Christ's fulfillment of Israel's story.
 - Romans 11 is read eschatologically: Paul anticipates a final, corporate restoration of Israel that coheres with the inclusion of Gentiles.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushback against classic supersessionism that erases Israel's future; corrective to dispensationalism by denying rigid ethnic separation and dual-covenant systems.
 - Alignment with the New Perspective on Paul against anachronistic individualistic readings of justification and "works of the law."
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Consistent use of narrative/covenantal categories over abstract doctrinal binaries; emphasis on boundary markers rather than merit‑based "works."
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely adopted as an introductory text; influential in Reformed and evangelical circles for steering conversation toward covenantal continuity and historical context. Provokes interlocution from classic dispensational and replacement theologians.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Durable as a teaching tool - balances accessible exposition with current scholarship; models how Romans 9-11 can be read in continuity with Second Temple Judaism and eschatological hope for Israel.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** God's binding promises to Israel as the controlling frame for New Testament theology.
- **Election:** Corporate and covenantal rather than narrowly ethnic or merely individualistic.
- **Works of the law:** Boundary markers (e.g., circumcision, food laws) identifying Jewish identity; not meritorious works for salvation.
- **New Perspective on Paul:** Interpretive lens privileging first‑century Jewish frames and covenantal nomism; Wright/Bird adopt and adapt this approach.
- **Olive‑tree metaphor (Romans 11):** Image of corporate inclusion/grafting: Gentiles grafted in, Israel's branches temporarily broken, future ingrafting anticipated.
- **All Israel will be saved:** Read eschatologically as a corporate, covenant‑fulfillment promise rather than immediate ethnic restoration.
- **Remnant:** Paul's motif for faithful Israel within broader national disobedience; tied to God's faithful preservation and future restoration.
- **Eschatological ingathering:** The future, decisive turning of Israel in the last days as part of God's plan.
- **Second Temple Judaism:** Historical context that shapes Pauline argumentation and NT theology.
- **Covenantal nomism:** Descriptor for Jewish soteriological self‑understanding (law as covenant boundary), used to counter older Protestant caricatures.
- **Corporate election vs. individual salvation:** Emphasis on people‑group and redemptive history rather than atomized soteriology.
- **Supersessionism (critique):** The text resists simplistic replacement models, urging nuance and future hope for Israel.
- **Grafting (metaphor use):** Employed to explain Gentile participation without nullifying God's promises to Israel.
- **Narrative theology:** Approach privileging story/plot (Israel -> Jesus -> church -> eschaton) over isolated doctrinal propositions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise exegetical model for reading Romans 9-11 within first‑century Jewish context.
 - As a definition source and teaching text for the New Perspective on Paul and covenantal readings in systematic theology.
 - As a polemical resource against crude supersessionism and against rigid dispensational bifurcation of Israel and church.
