### TITLE
John Murray, "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith" (Collected Writings, vol. 2) - exposition and systematic defense of the Westminster Standards' theological architecture.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed revival; Murray (Westminster Theological Seminary circle) reads the 17th-century Westminster Confession as a living systematic theology for modern church and academy.
 - The Confession emerges from English/Scottish Reformed context (1640s), shaped by Calvin, Reformed scholastic method, Puritan piety, and controversies with Arminians, Socinians, and Erastians.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Confession is a coherent, biblically grounded *systematic* articulation of Reformed theology centered on covenantal structure and the lordship of God; it is not mere propositional codification but theological method and pastoral instrument.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Murray reads the Confession as internally unified around the doctrines of:
 - **God (essence, attributes, Trinity)** and decree;
 - **Creation, providence, and the fall** leading to covenant economy;
 - **Covenant theology** (covenant of works, covenant of grace) as organizing principle;
 - **Christology and atonement**, union with Christ, justification by faith;
 - **Sanctification, sacraments, ecclesiology, and eschatology.**
 - Major moves:
 - Demonstrates coherence between divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
 - Shows the Confession's use of biblical categories rather than speculative metaphysics.
 - Applies confessional categories to pastoral and ecclesial life (sacraments, discipline).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Calvin and the Reformation corpus; examines Reformed scholastics; counters Arminian, Socinian, Roman Catholic positions; dialogue with modern critics who separate doctrinal precision from pastoral theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, God and attributes (absolute/relative), Trinity, creation, providence, fall, sin, covenant (works/grace), Christology, atonement, justification, sanctification, sacraments, church and state, last things.

- **Closing line**
 - The Confession, as Murray portrays it, is a covenantal, Christ-centered systematic theology that weds doctrinal precision to pastoral formation under the sovereignty of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Covenant as structural principle**: all loci read through covenantal relations (works/grace) rather than isolated propositions.
 - **Pastoral orientation**: doctrine is for worship, discipline, preaching, sacraments - not abstract metaphysics.
 - **Balance of transcendence and accommodation**: strong stress on God's absolute attributes while affirming relational (relative) attributes as how God is revealed to creatures.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both caricatures of Westminster as rigid scholasticism and modern reductions that secularize or privatize doctrine.
 - Opposes analogia entis (ontological analogy) tendencies that infer creaturely participation in divine being; insists on analogia fidei (analogy of faith, revelation-centered analogy).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes the **absolute vs relative attributes** distinction within a confessional framework: absolute attributes belong to God's essence; relative attributes describe God in relation to creatures and redemptive economy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in 20th-century confessional Reformed renewal (seminaries, denominational identity in PCA, OPC, RPCNA).
 - Influential in conservative theological education as a model of confessional exegesis and systematic coherence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise map for teaching doctrine, defending confessional orthodoxy, and integrating scholarly precision with pastoral ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession** - the document as systematic theology: covenantal, doctrinal, and ecclesial blueprint.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace** - organizing redemptive structure: law and promise as successive administrations of God's covenantal dealings.
- **Divine decree / predestination** - God's eternal purpose as compatible with human responsibility; treated with theological rigor and pastoral sensitivity.
- **Providence** - God's preservation and governance; connects sovereignty with secondary causality.
- **Accommodation** - God condescension in revelation; essential for the Confession's treatment of Scripture and Christ.
- **Law and Gospel distinction** - normative for soteriology and sanctification; law exposes, gospel justifies and sanctifies.
- **Sacraments (visible signs/institutions)** - means of grace, covenant seals; emphasis on efficacy tied to Christ and covenant.
- **Church and civil magistrate** - ecclesiology includes discipline and worship; Westminster's distinctives about confessional polity and limited civil coercion.
- **Absolute attributes** - those properties that belong to God intrinsically (e.g., aseity, immutability) and are not essentially defined by creaturely relations.
 - Used to assert divine transcendence and sovereignty.
- **Relative attributes** - properties describing God's relation to creation or redemptive acts (e.g., Fatherhood, Redeemer) and how God is known in covenant.
 - Used to articulate revelation and redemptive-historical roles.
- **Analogia fidei (analogy of faith)** - theological method: interpret creaturely language about God by reference to Scripture's revelation of Christ; primary hermeneutic in Murray's reading.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)** - ontological inference from creature to God; Murray and Westminster resist this as a primary theological principle.
 - Contrast: Murray uses analogia fidei to restrain speculative metaphysics and to preserve God's otherness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source**: authoritative explication of confessional formulations (esp. covenantal categories).
 - **Polemic**: resource against analogia entis, Arminianism, and doctrinal minimalism.
 - **Exegetical model / conceptual pivot**: model for reading Scripture systematically under the analogia fidei and for applying absolute/relative attributes distinctions in doctrinal construction.
