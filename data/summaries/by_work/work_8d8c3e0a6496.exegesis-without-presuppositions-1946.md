### TITLE
**"Exegesis Without Presuppositions?" (1946) - Rudolf Bultmann**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post‑World War II Germany (1946). Work appears amid Bultmann's mature program of form criticism, demythologizing, and existential hermeneutics; theological milieu shaped by dialectical theology, Heideggerian existentialism, and the later phase of historical‑critical scholarship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The claim that one can practice neutral, presuppositionless exegesis is untenable. Exegesis always rests on presuppositions (methodological, philosophical, theological); the task is not to eliminate presuppositions but to make them explicit and critically warranted.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of the ideal of neutrality: shows philosophical naivete in asserting a value‑free historical reconstruction.
 - Taxonomy of presuppositions: distinguishes historiographical, philosophical, and confessional/theological presuppositions and how they shape results.
 - Hermeneutical proposal: advocate for a self‑critical exegesis that recognizes the interpreter's existential situation and the kerygmatic character of NT proclamation.
 - Methodological consequences: prioritize the proclamation (kerygma) as the theological locus; treat mythic language historically but interpret its existential meaning for faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages the legacy of historical Jesus research (Wrede, Schweitzer), modern philosophy (notably Heideggerian existentialism), and contemporaries in German Protestantism (critique and conversation with both liberal historicists and confessional reactionaries).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as event vs. propositional content), Scripture and hermeneutics, Christology (Christ of faith vs. historical Jesus), eschatology (mythic language and existential meaning), and the nature of theological method.
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically: an insistence that honest theology admits its interpretive stance and seeks a critical, existentially responsible exegesis that lets proclamation, not naive historiography, govern theological claims.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes methodological self‑awareness normative: exegesis must disclose and defend its own presuppositions.
 - Moves theological significance away from reconstructive historiography to existential encounter with the proclaimed Christ.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Counters the claim of objective, presuppositionless history; also opposes uncritical confessional exegesis that masks its presuppositions.
 - Differs from Schweitzer's historical pessimism by focusing on the kerygma's present existential demand rather than purely historical critique.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the rhetorical contrast "historical Jesus vs. Christ of faith" as methodological problem.
 - Advanced the vocabulary of "demythologizing" (in allied works) and "existential interpretation" as theological method.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in mid‑20th century Protestant scholarship and hermeneutics; provoked sustained critique from conservatives (for reducing objective revelation) and from some historical theologians (for subordinating historical questions).
 - Engaged by later New Testament scholars (Käsemann, others) who both adopted and revised elements of Bultmann's program.
- **Enduring value**
 - Enduring as a corrective to naïve objectivism and for insistence on methodological transparency; invaluable for teaching hermeneutics even where one rejects his existentialist reductions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositions** - implicit commitments (philosophical, methodological, theological) that shape interpretation; must be made explicit and justified.
- **Exegesis without presuppositions** - the criticized ideal; Bultmann argues it is impossible.
- **Demythologizing** - removing mythological cosmology while retaining existential proclamation; interprets mythic language existentially.
- **Kerygma** - the apostolic proclamation; privileged as the theological starting point over neutral historical reconstruction.
- **Existential interpretation** - reading texts for their call to decision and existential disclosure of human existence before God (Heideggerian influence).
- **Historical Jesus vs. Christ of faith** - distinction that separates reconstructive historical inquiry from confessional proclamation; central to method.
- **Form criticism** - method for identifying literary forms and their Sitz im Leben; used to show how proclamation shaped traditions.
- **Hermeneutical circle / self‑reflection** - interpreter's preunderstanding interacts with text; must be critiqued, not denied.
- **Myth / mythic language** - treated as symbolic existential speech rather than factual cosmology.
- **Revelation as event** - revelation grasped existentially in encounter, not merely as propositional data.
- **Eschatology (present/future tension)** - interprets apocalyptic texts as existential proclamation of Gods ultimacy rather than timetable prophecy.
- **Israel (in Pauline thought)** - read functionally: election and Israel's narrative serve theological significance in proclamation, not necessarily as a blueprint for ethno‑national future.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Christ in OT and NT** - used as an exegetical model to explain how the NT reads the OT kerygmatically (typology and proclamation) rather than as straightforward historical proof of Christ; recommends reading OT texts for their existential summons in Christ (application: interpretations of messianic texts).
 - **Revelation 20 and the Millennium** - employed polemically against literalist millenarian readings: treats the millennium as apocalyptic mythic language with existential eschatological meaning, not a strict future chronology.
 - **Romans 11 and Israel's future** - used as a critical tool against ethnic‑national readings of Romans 11: emphasizes Paul's theological use of Israel to make existential claims about election, judgment, and mercy rather than guaranteeing a political restoration.
