### TITLE
Eschatology - John Webster, in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology (2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** early 21st-century systematic theology within British Reformed-Anglican scholarship; contribution to a wide-ranging Oxford Handbook consolidating contemporary methodological and doctrinal options in systematic theology.
- **Central thesis:** Eschatology must be conceived Christologically and ecclesially: the future of God is not an abstract future-state but the promised, enacted destiny of humanity in and through Christ; eschatological truth shapes theological anthropology and all loci of doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modern treatments either secularize eschatology (immanentist progress narratives) or reduce it to private immortality.
 - Retrieval: classical biblical and patristic categories (kingdom, resurrection, new creation) as theologically authoritative.
 - Christological reorientation: the parousia, resurrection and consummation are known in the person and work of the risen Christ - the future has been inaugurated.
 - Anthropological implication: human identity and destiny are defined by participation in Christ; eschatology becomes the hermeneutical key for anthropology.
 - Practical consequence: ethics, ecclesiology and sacramental life are ordered by the promised future, not merely by present rational projects.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** sustained appeal to Scripture and patristic tradition; critical dialogue with modern continental theologians (e.g., Barth, Moltmann, Pannenberg, Jüngel) and with modern secularizing narratives; implicit recovery of Reformation emphases on promise and covenant.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (relation of Father's future to Son's sending), Christology (incarnation/resurrection as eschatological event), revelation (promise-fulfillment), covenant and promise, ecclesiology (church as eschatological community), sacrament (participation in future life), theological anthropology (eschatological constitution of human person).
- **Closing line:** Eschatology is not a peripheral doctrine about "what will happen" but the interpretive center that defines human being, church life and theological speech in virtue of the promised, inaugurated consummation in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that eschatology is fundamentally Christological: the future is present in the risen and reigning Christ, and thus is known theologically, not merely anticipated.
 - Eschatological anthropology: human persons are constituted by participation in the future life promised in Christ - identity is promise-shaped.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects immanentist or progressivist accounts that assimilate eschatology to history or human projects.
 - Nuances other "inaugurated eschatologies" by underscoring sacramental and ecclesial participation rather than merely ethical or sociopolitical realization.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes "inauguration" language toward a jurisprudential/promise idiom: the future as divine promise realized in Christ's acts rather than primarily as historical process.
 - Emphasizes "participation" language for anthropology and sacrament rather than abstract immortality or existential futurity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and Anglican circles for integrating rigorous Christology with practical ecclesiology.
 - Cited among those resisting secularizing or politicized eschatologies and among scholars recuperating promise-oriented systematic theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact corrective to fragmented modern eschatologies and a model for grounding anthropology and ethics in eschatological promise.
 - Useful as a Christ-centered template for integrating eschatology with other doctrinal loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological anthropology:** human identity constituted by future-directed participation in Christ; anthropology read through the promise of consummation.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** the future has been begun in Christ's resurrection and reign; Webster stresses its ecclesial and sacramental actualization.
- **Consummation:** final completion of God's purposes in new creation; not abstract end but redemption fulfilled in Christ.
- **Parousia:** the Lord's coming as the decisive revelatory and transforming event; present in Christ's lordship and awaited as consummation.
- **Resurrection:** pivot of eschatological reality; ontological transformation that grounds hope for persons and creation.
- **New creation:** the eschatological horizon that redefines covenantal life, not merely moral improvement of society.
- **Promise / covenant:** theological modality for eschatology - future secured by divine oath and act in Christ; shapes ecclesial identity.
- **Participation (koinonia):** key anthropological and sacramental term - believers partake now in the life of the age to come.
- **Kingdom of God:** understood as present reality and future consummation mediated by Christ and the church.
- **Judgment:** eschatological judgment as divine disclosure and rectification grounded in Christ, not a mere forensic addendum.
- **Sacramental realism:** sacraments instantiate participation in the eschatological life; sign and thing signified overlap in promise-fulfillment.
- **Telos:** doctrinal orientation of all Christian talk - telos is personal (Christ) and communal (church), not merely cosmic process.
- **Revelation as promise-fulfillment:** eschatology reframes revelation as God's promise realized in redemptive history culminating in Christ.
- **Providence and history:** history is providentially ordered toward Christ's consummating act rather than an autonomous human trajectory.
- **Ecclesial eschatology:** the church as the locus where future life is anticipated and realized.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Christ-centered, promise-grounded eschatology.
- As a **polemic** against immanentist, secular, or purely individualistic eschatologies.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for reading NT witness and shaping theological anthropology, ecclesiology and sacramental theology.
