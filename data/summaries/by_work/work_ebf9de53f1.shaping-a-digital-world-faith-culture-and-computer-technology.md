### TITLE
Shaping a Digital World: Faith, Culture, and Computer Technology - Derek C. Schuurman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st century context of ubiquitous computing, internet, mobile devices, and emergent debates about privacy, AI, surveillance, and labor displacement.
 - Situated within a broadly **Reformed/Kuyperian** concern for Christian vocational engagement and cultural transformation; written by an engineering professor with theological training, aiming to bridge technical practice and theological reflection.
- **Central thesis**
 - Technology-and specifically computer technology-is not neutral; it shapes persons and societies. Christians must intentionally **shape digital artifacts, institutions, and policies** in light of theology (creation, fall, redemption, vocation) to promote human flourishing and justice.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary views (technological determinism, neutrality, utopian/dystopian extremes) are inadequate.
 - Theological lens: develop a **creation-fall-redemption** framework to locate technology as a cultural, created good subject to sin and grace.
 - Moral ontology of design: design decisions embed values; therefore, engineers bear ethical responsibility.
 - Practical outworking: proposals for education, professional formation, institutional governance, policy engagement, and Christian witness in tech professions.
 - Ends with resources for integrating theology into computing curricula and professional practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages philosophers/scholars of technology: Jacques Ellul, Langdon Winner, Andrew Feenberg, Don Ihde, Bruno Latour (social-technical perspectives).
 - Dialogues with Reformed thinkers (Kuyperian emphases on vocation and cultural mandate) and contemporary Christian ethicists.
 - Draws on engineering practice literature and case studies in software, privacy, and organizational design.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (technology as culture-work within created order)
 - **Imago Dei and vocation** (human work in design and stewardship)
 - **Sin and corruption** (technologies as sites of idolatry, unintended harm, and structural injustices)
 - **Common grace and redemption** (redeeming practices, faithful presence, reform)
 - **Eschatology** (limits of technological salvation; hope grounds responsible engagement)
 - Also touches on ecclesiology (role of church in formation), social ethics, and public theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Technology is a created cultural means that must be consciously **shaped by redeemed human practices under God's sovereignty** so that computing promotes flourishing, justice, and neighbor love rather than domination or idolatry.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Interdisciplinary praxis orientation**
 - Written by an engineer-theologian; prioritizes concrete practices of software and systems design rather than abstract polemics.
- **Design as moral and theological locus**
 - Moves ethical focus to the artifact and design process-decisions in code, architecture, and institutions carry normative weight.
- **Balanced critique**
 - Rebuffs both techno-utopianism (technology as salvation) and simplistic Luddism; insists on critical appropriation and positive shaping.
- **Theological framing anchored in Reformed public engagement**
 - Uses Kuyperian emphases (cultural mandate, vocation, common grace) but applies them specifically to computing professions.
- **Contrast with predecessors**
 - More praxis- and profession-centered than Ellul (polemical against technology) and more explicitly theological than many STS (science & technology studies) accounts; complements critical theory (Feenberg) with theology-informed constructive proposals.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Increasingly used in Christian engineering and computer science programs as a foundational text for ethics and vocational formation.
 - Cited in Reformed academic circles as a model for theology-technology integration; influential for curricula, professional codes, and institutional policy conversations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable framework for teaching, curriculum design, and institutional ethics that is accessible to practitioners; remains a go-to resource for integrating Christian doctrine with computing practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technological neutrality**
 - The thesis Schuurman rejects: artifacts are value-laden and mediate behaviors and social structures.
- **Technological determinism**
 - Critiqued as insufficient; technology shapes but does not inevitability determine human ends.
- **Affordances**
 - Practical possibilities embedded in artifacts that enable or constrain action; used to analyze moral impact of design choices.
- **Mediation**
 - How technologies mediate human experience, relationships, and moral perception.
- **Design as moral practice**
 - Central term: engineering choices instantiate values and carry ethical responsibility.
- **Vocation / Cultural mandate**
 - Work as a God-ordained calling to steward creation; grounds professional formation for technologists.
- **Common grace**
 - Explains positive technological benefits even in a fallen world; grounds engagement rather than withdrawal.
- **Sin and corrupting effects**
 - Technologies can become idols, enable domination, or entrench injustice; requires diagnosis and reform.
- **Public theology of technology**
 - Framework for policy, institutional, and civic engagement informed by theological norms.
- **Sociotechnical systems**
 - Emphasizes that computing systems are embedded in social, economic, and institutional contexts.
- **Embodiment**
 - Attention to bodily, relational, and communal impacts of digital practices (vs. abstract information models).
- **Institutional design / governance**
 - Proposes structures for accountability, professional standards, and curriculum to shape tech practice.
- **Human flourishing / neighbor love**
 - Ultimate normative criteria for evaluating technologies.
- **Accountability structures**
 - Mechanisms (codes, oversight, community) needed to ensure ethical design and deployment.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source:** concise theological definitions for terms like technological neutrality, vocation, and design ethics in syllabi and handbooks.
 - **Polemic / corrective:** a constructive counter to techno-utopian or deterministic narratives in church and academy.
 - **Conceptual pivot for professional formation:** model for engineering curricula, internship formation, and institutional ethics policies.
