### TITLE
Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "The Image of God" in Created in His Image: The Divine Image in the Human Person (ed. Anthony Hoekema)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed/Biblical-theological milieu; contribution to a multi-author volume addressing the imago Dei from evangelical and Reformed perspectives.
 - Engages post-war Reformed scholarship that seeks to recover biblical exegesis and Christological theology against reductionist anthropologies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The imago Dei is fundamentally Christological and covenantal: the Son is the definitive image of God, and human image-bearing is located in relation to Christ as representative/head.
 - Problem addressed: how to define the imago Dei without collapsing into purely "substantive" (capacity-based) or "functional" (task-based) accounts, and how to account for damage by sin and its restoration.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegesis of key biblical texts (Genesis 1:26-27; New Testament Christological texts such as Colossians 1 and related passages) to ground theology of the image.
 - Two-tier move:
 - The Son as the ontological archetype: Christ is the perfect Image of the invisible God; the divine-human relation clarifies what it means for creatures to bear God's image.
 - Human image-bearing is derivative and relational: humans bear the image by vocation and representation, realized most fully in union with Christ and progressively restored in sanctification.
 - Diagnoses prevailing alternatives and defends a Reformed, covenantal anthropology that holds together creation, fall, and redemption.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit dialogue with classical Reformed writers (Calvinic emphases on Christ as image and federal head), modern evangelical and Protestant essays on imago Dei, and broader theological options (substantive vs functional models).
 - Uses biblical exegesis as primary source; draws on doctrinal categories from covenant theology and Christology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (Christ as image and archetype)
 - Anthropology (nature, vocation, and corruption of the human person)
 - Covenant theology and federal headship
 - Soteriology / sanctification (restoration of the image)
 - Implicit Trinitarian considerations (Son as image of Father)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The image of God is best understood Christocentrically: the Son is the definitive image, and human image-bearing is derivative, vocational, and restored in union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong Christ-centered framing: the imago Dei is not merely an abstract property of humanity but is anchored in the person and work of the Son.
 - Treats image-bearing as primarily relational and representative rather than merely an intrinsic set of faculties.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely substantive accounts that equate the image with capacities (reason, will) detached from Christ.
 - Also corrects minimalist functional accounts (image = task alone) by insisting on a personal, ontological reference in Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes derivative/participatory language: humans "bear" the image by participation in and representation of the archetypal Image (Christ) rather than possessing an autonomous ontic status of likeness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles seeking a biblically integrated anthropology; often cited in treatments that link imago Dei to union with Christ and federal headship.
 - Served as a corrective within debates over the locus of definition (biblical-theological vs philosophical accounts).

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how Christology reshapes anthropology.
 - Offers a concise model useful for preaching, ethics, and theological education that resists reductionism and preserves pastoral implications (sin, dignity, restoration).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**: The biblical designation for human relation to God; for Gaffin, intrinsically Christ-centered and derivative.
- **Christ as Image / Archetype**: The Son is the definitive image of God; human image-bearing participates in this archetypal reality.
- **Derivative / Participatory**: Humans bear the image by participation in Christ's representative status, not by independent ontological parity with God.
- **Representative / Vocation**: Image-bearing involves representative duties (rulership, stewardship) grounded in covenantal vocation.
- **Substantive view (criticized)**: Locates image in specific capacities (reason, morality); Gaffin critiques this when severed from Christology.
- **Functional view (qualified)**: Understands image as task-oriented; Gaffin affirms functional elements but insists on their grounding in the person of Christ.
- **Federal headship**: Christ as head/second Adam clarifies how humans bear and lose the image and how it is restored.
- **Union with Christ**: Theologically central mechanism for restoration and true image-bearing in redemption and sanctification.
- **Corruption / Damage of the image**: Sin distorts but does not utterly annihilate the image; restoration is both definitive (in Christ) and progressive (sanctification).
- **Sanctification / Restoration**: The recovery of true likeness to God as moral and relational conformity to Christ.
- **Covenantal anthropology**: Emphasizes relational status before God (creaturehood, covenantal vocation) as constitutive for understanding the image.
- **Christological exegesis**: Method: read Genesis and imago language through New Testament witness to the Son.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Christocentric, derivative model of imago Dei in systematic theology and ethics.
 - As a **polemic** against purely substantive or purely functional accounts of the image.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how New Testament Christology informs Old Testament anthropology.
