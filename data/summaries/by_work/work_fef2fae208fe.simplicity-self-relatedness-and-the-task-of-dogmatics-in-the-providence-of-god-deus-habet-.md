### TITLE
Simplicity, Self-Relatedness and the Task of Dogmatics - John Webster (essay in The Providence of God: Deus Habet Consilium)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st century Anglo-Reformed theological renewal; Wesleyan/evangelical and continental conversation about classical theism, influenced by renewed Trinitarian and Barthian retrievals. Essay appears in a collected volume addressing divine providence and attributes.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Webster seeks to defend and reformulate classical divine simplicity so that it coheres with God's **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, while accounting for the revealed Trinitarian and incarnational God who is genuinely self-related and relational without becoming creaturely.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Begins by diagnosing the modern problem: classical simplicity is often read as a metaphysical monadism that undermines relationality and the biblical picture of God.
 - Proposes reframing simplicity in terms of **self-relatedness** - God's unity is not a static absence of relation but an internal, Trinitarian life in which the divine persons are genuinely related without composition.
 - Argues that **aseity** (God's self-existence), **immutability**, and **impassibility** should be reinterpreted theologically (not merely philosophically) so they serve dogmatics: they safeguard God's otherness, reliability, and freedom rather than precluding responsive action.
 - Shows how Trinitarian doctrine (and the doctrine of the Incarnation) mediates concerns about divine susceptibility: God can respond, suffer in a redemptive sense, and be petitioned without undergoing an ontological change.
 - Concludes that dogmatics must hold the tension between classical attributes and biblical portrayal, using theological categories rather than purely metaphysical ones.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and classical patristic sources; Aquinas and the medieval formulations of simplicity; Calvin and Reformed systematicians; twentieth-century interlocutors such as Karl Barth (positive interlocutor), J. Moltmann and process theologians (critical interlocutors), and analytic critiques of divine simplicity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity, Christology (incarnation and suffering), method of dogmatics (theological retrieval vs. metaphysical reduction).
- **Closing line:** Webster reclaims classical simplicity not as a negation of relationality but as the theological grammar for a self-related, triune God whose aseity and immutability ground trustworthy, decisive action in history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Recasts simplicity through the language of **self-relatedness** to preserve both divine unity and intra-divine relations.
 - Stresses that attributes are theological predicates serving the church's confession, not neutral metaphysical descriptions.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against readings that make simplicity metaphysically reductionist (e.g., some analytic theist critiques).
 - Counters Moltmannian and process-theological claims that impassibility entails irresponsiveness; instead, Webster reframes impassibility as freedom from creaturely determinism, not absence of relational life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of "self-relatedness" as a mediating concept connecting simplicity with Trinitarian relationality.
 - A theological (rather than merely ontological) account of immutability and impassibility emphasizing covenantal and redemptive action.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in contemporary Reformed and Anglican circles interested in reclaiming classical theism with Trinitarian nuance.
 - Cited in debates over divine simplicity in both analytic theology and systematic/continental contexts as a model of theological reappropriation.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact exemplar for how dogmatics can rescue classical categories from dehistoricized metaphysical misuse while remaining faithful to scriptural and confessional commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God's unity of being; Webster insists it must be read theologically so as not to efface Trinitarian distinction.
- **Self-Relatedness:** Central mediating term - the internal relationality of God that preserves unity without composition.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence; grounds God's freedom and reliability in Webster's account.
- **Immutability:** Not mere changelessness of modes but stability of God's being and faithfulness in relation to creation.
- **Impassibility:** Reinterpreted to deny passive susceptibility to creaturely causation while allowing responsive, voluntary suffering in the economy (e.g., Cross).
- **Trinity:** The locus where simplicity and relationality are reconciled; intra-divine relations are real without compromising unity.
- **Incarnation / Christology:** Shows how God's relationality reaches creaturely life without ontological loss; a test-case for Webster's reappropriation.
- **Dogmatics:** Treated as theological, confessionally rooted reflection - uses doctrine to order understanding, not to supply alien metaphysics.
- **Theological Predication:** Attributes named as ways the church speaks of God's being and action, with normative ecclesial function.
- **Metaphysical vs. Theological Language:** Webster favors the latter for preserving scriptural nuance.
- **Covenant/Providence (contextual):** Practical arenas where immutability and aseity are theologically operative.
- **Response to Process Theology:** Polemical reorientation that defends divine transcendence while acknowledging divine relational responsiveness.
- **Barthian influence:** Methodological emphasis on revelation and Christocentric primacy in attributing properties to God.
- **Analytic critiques of simplicity:** Engaged and partially accommodated by recasting the task for dogmatics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** reconceiving divine simplicity in theological (not merely metaphysical) terms.
- As a **polemic** against process and certain modern critiques that pit simplicity against relationality.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Trinitarian and Christological treatments of divine attributes in systematic theology.
- As an **exegetical/dogmatic model** for teaching how doctrinal language is to be governed by revelation and ecclesial practice.
