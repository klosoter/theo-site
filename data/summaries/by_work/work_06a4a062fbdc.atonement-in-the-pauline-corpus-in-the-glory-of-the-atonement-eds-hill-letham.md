### TITLE
Atonement in the Pauline Corpus - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (in The Glory of the Atonement, eds. Hill & Letham)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical scholarship addressing contemporary debates on Pauline soteriology.
 - Situated against both liberal reductions of penal themes and the rising "New Perspective" on Paul; aims to recover classical Reformed readings with careful exegesis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's account of the atonement is fundamentally covenantal, representative, and forensic: Christ's death is a divinely ordained, substitutionary act that accomplishes expiation, propitiation, redemption, and justification within God's decretive will, and is realized in believers by union with Christ.
 - The relation of atonement to **divine decrees, election, and reprobation**: the atoning act is ordered by God's elective purpose and must be read in that framework without collapsing into abstract metaphysics or moralism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical tour of key Pauline texts (e.g., Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians) demonstrating recurring motifs:
 - **Substitutionary language** (died for, died for sins) interpreted in judicial/representative terms.
 - **Expiatory/propitiatory functions** (sin, wrath, reconciliation) showing objective accomplishment.
 - **Redemptive/justificatory vocabulary** tied to forensic imputation and covenantal status change.
 - **Union with Christ** as the central theological category that explains application (participation, imputation, new life).
 - Argues for an integrated soteriology: decretive determination -> Christ's representative obedience and death -> objective accomplishment -> applied in union with Christ to the elect.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (textual exegesis).
 - Engages modern critics who downplay forensic motifs (e.g., some New Perspective proponents) and moral-influence or Christus Victor-only readings.
 - Dialogues implicitly with classical Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin, Warfield) while updating exegetical argumentation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, Christology (representative obedience), soteriology (atonement theories, justification, imputation), divine decrees (election and reprobation), sacramental/union theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin locates the heart of Pauline atonement in Christ's decreed, representative death that objectively secures salvation for the elect and is applied through union with Christ - a covenantal-forensic center of gravity that resists reduction to mere moral influence or socioreligious boundary markers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **union with Christ** as the hermeneutical key to Paul: atonement is both accomplished objectively and appropriated personally through participation in Christ.
 - Strong integration of **decretive election** with the intentionality and scope of the atonement as presented in Paul.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against New Perspective readings that relativize forensic language or treat atonement primarily as covenantal boundary maintenance; preserves forensic and penal categories without divorcing them from covenant context.
 - Opposes moral-influence and Christus Victor-only models by insisting on biblical convergence of expiation, propitiation, and judicial substitution.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames atonement primarily as a covenantal action ordained in the divine decree and realized in union, rather than as isolated metaphysical transactions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a robust exegetical defense of substitution and imputation.
 - Serves as a reliable corrective in academic debates on Paul, frequently referenced in discussions on election and the scope of the atonement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies close exegesis married to systematic concern; valuable for students needing an integrated model that respects both Pauline theology and classical Reformed commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement** - The Covenantal-forensic accomplishment by Christ's death; objective and effectual for those in union with him.
- **Penal substitution** - Christ bears the penalty of sin as the representative; presented as a key aspect of Paul's vocabulary (not the whole story, but central).
- **Expiation** - Removal of sin's defilement; textual basis in Pauline language of forgiveness and sin-bearing.
- **Propitiation** - Turning away divine wrath; tied to God's decretive intention and satisfied in Christ's sacrifice.
- **Redemption** - Ransom/satisfaction imagery that denotes deliverance achieved by Christ's death; economically linked to justification.
- **Imputation** - Forensic transfer: sin to Christ; righteousness to believers - explained via representative union.
- **Justification** - Declarative, forensic verdict effected by Christ's work and received through union with him and faith.
- **Union with Christ** - Central explanatory category for both accomplishment and application of atonement.
- **Decretive will / Divine decrees** - God's ordaining purpose that determines the scope and efficacy of the atonement; safeguards providential intentionality.
- **Election** - God's sovereign choosing that grounds the application of atoning benefits to the elect.
- **Reprobation** - Negatively correlated aspect of divine decree; appears in discussion of scope and divine justice.
- **Covenant** - The structural context for Pauline soteriology; atonement as covenantal fulfillment.
- **Forensic language** - Emphasized as legitimate and normative in Paul's soteriological vocabulary.
- **Scope of atonement (particularity/extent)** - Treated as bound up with election and covenantal representation rather than neutral universalism.
- **Christ's representative obedience** - Includes active obedience and penal suffering as components of the one priestly/kingly work.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline atonement through union with Christ and forensic vocabulary.
- As a **polemic resource** against moral-influence and certain New Perspective readings.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in integrating election/reprobation with the scope and intent of the atonement in Reformed systematic theology.
