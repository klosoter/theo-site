### TITLE
Calvin and the Reformation - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology; Warfield writes as a conservative Reformed apologist and historian seeking to recover Calvin's place in the trajectory of the Reformation against both romanticized hagiography and hostile modern critique.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Warfield argues that Calvin exemplifies the Reformation's theological method and content - a biblically grounded, Christocentric, and grace-centered theology - and that Calvin's treatment of human nature resists speculative metaphysical bifurcations (e.g., strict trichotomy) in favor of a biblical, ethical, and pastoral anthropology.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical recovery: situates Calvin within late medieval scholasticism, Augustinian tradition, and the reforming context; emphasizes continuity with biblical exegesis rather than with speculative philosophy.
 - Exegetical demonstration: reads key biblical texts (Genesis, Pauline anthropology) as Calvin did, showing Calvin's tendency to treat "soul" and "spirit" as overlapping or functionally distinct, not as two self-sufficient ontological substances.
 - Theological consequences: connects Calvin's anthropology to his doctrines of sin, grace, regeneration, and union with Christ - the human person is psychosomatic and morally accountable; redemption is whole-personal.
 - Polemical move: opposes both scholastic dualism and mystical trichotomy; defends a balanced Reformed view that preserves the biblical witness and pastoral concerns.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine (primary patristic influence), medieval scholastics (Aquinas), Luther, contemporaneous Reformation figures, and modern theologians raising anthropological questions; Warfield appeals heavily to Calvin's commentaries and Institutes.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (psyche/pneuma; body-soul unity), sin (total depravity), grace and regeneration, union with Christ, sanctification, imago Dei, and implications for soteriology and pastoral ministry.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is Calvin's biblically anchored, Christ-focused anthropology: the human person is a psychosomatic unity marred by sin and wholly dependent on redemptive union with Christ - a view that resists speculative tripartition and secures pastoral, soteriological coherence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emphasizes Calvin's methodological fidelity to Scripture over metaphysical systems; interprets soul/spirit language functionally, not as warranting a threefold ontology.
 - Stresses the pastoral and soteriological priority in Calvin's anthropology: doctrinal formulations always serve the proclamation of grace and the life of the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects scholastic tendencies to reify philosophical categories into theological dogma.
 - Opposes trichotomist readings (body, soul, spirit as three separate substances) by underscoring Calvin's interpretive restraint and Augustinian inheritance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** While not inventing new technical vocabulary, Warfield clarifies and rehabilitates the label **psychosomatic unity** as central to Reformed anthropology and differentiates **functional distinction** (soul vs spirit) from **ontological partition**.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly influential among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars; Warfield's historical-analytic style became a standard reference for defending classic Reformed positions against modern anthropological speculations.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Offers a concise, historically grounded corrective to speculative anthropologies; serves as both historical recovery of Calvin and a model for linking biblical exegesis to doctrinal formulation and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dichotomy:** The view that humans are composed of two principal constituents (body + immaterial principle); Warfield reads Calvin as effectively dichotomous in resisting a threefold ontological division.
- **Trichotomy:** The view that humans are body, soul, and spirit as three distinct substances; Warfield treats this as a speculative system inconsistent with Calvin's Biblical exegesis.
 - Warfield distinguishes trichotomy as a philosophical imposition rather than a necessary reading of biblical vocabulary.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** The Reformed emphasis (highlighted by Warfield) that the human person is an integrated body-soul whole; redemption addresses the whole person.
- **Soul (psyche) / Spirit (pneuma):** Treated as overlapping or functionally distinct terms in biblical usage rather than markers of separate ontological parts.
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** For Warfield via Calvin, a relational and functional reality marred by sin and restored in Christ - anchors ethical and soteriological claims about human worth.
- **Total depravity:** Human corruption affecting whole personhood; Warfield shows Calvin's anthropology furnishes this doctrine with a holistic, not merely spiritualistic, ground.
- **Regeneration / union with Christ:** Central soteriological categories that Warfield reads as the solution to the human problem - healing the psychosomatic person through mystical union.
- **Exegesis over metaphysics:** Warfield's methodological catchword: biblical exegesis governs theological anthropology; philosophical categories must be subordinate.
- **Pastoral priority:** Theology must serve the cure of souls; Calvin's anthropological statements are judged by their pastoral efficacy.
- **Functional distinction:** A category Warfield uses to explain how Calvin can speak of soul and spirit distinctly without committing to trichotomy.
- **Anthropological consequence for sanctification:** Sanctification is whole-personal, involving body and moral faculties united in renewed life.
- **Historical-theological grounding:** Warfield insists on reading Calvin in his historical matrix (Augustinian-Reformation) to avoid modern misreadings.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed anthropology (psychosomatic unity, functional rather than ontological distinctions).
- As a **polemic** against trichotomy and metaphysical scholasticism in both historical and contemporary debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline anthropology and for integrating exegesis with doctrinal and pastoral theology.
