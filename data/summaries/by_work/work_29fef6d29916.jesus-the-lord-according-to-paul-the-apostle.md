### TITLE
Jesus the Lord according to Paul the Apostle - Gordon D. Fee

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Pauline scholarship (1980s). Fee writes from an evangelical but critical-historical standpoint, engaging both mainline academic exegesis and charismatic concerns about the Spirit. Responds to trends that fragment Christology and pneumatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's confession that "Jesus is Lord" is the organizing center of his theology; the risen, exalted Lord is vindicated and enthroned through the Spirit, and the Spirit is the means by which believers are united with and participate in the resurrected Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes the creedal, confessional shape of Paul's Christology (Jesus as Lord, Son, Savior).
 - Demonstrates how Pauline passages consistently connect resurrection, exaltation, and lordship (e.g., Rom 1:4; 1 Cor 15; Phil 2).
 - Shows the Spirit's integral role: the Spirit as agent in Jesus' ministry, in his vindication/raising, and as the present agent effecting union with the risen Lord in believers (Romans 8; 1 Cor 12; Galatians).
 - Concludes that true comprehension of Paul requires an integrated Christo‑pneumatic reading: one cannot separate Christology from pneumatology without distorting Paul.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Pauline corpus as primary source; engages contemporary Pauline scholars and exegetes of the 20th century (scholars interested in creedal origins, pneumatology, and early Christian confession). Dialogues implicitly with scholars who minimize the Spirit's role or who read Paul in overly individualistic ethical terms.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (lordship, incarnation, resurrection, exaltation), Pneumatology (Spirit's role in ministry, resurrection, and believers' life), Union with Christ, Soteriology (vindication, justification by faith insofar as it relates to resurrection), Ecclesiology (Spirit-formed community).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** For Paul, Jesus' lordship is an enacted, Spirit‑mediated reality: the Spirit raised and vindicated the crucified Jesus and now makes that risen Lord present and effective in believers and the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the *Spirit as the agent both of Jesus' resurrection/vindication and of believers' participation* in the risen Lord - a tight Christo‑pneumatic nexus.
 - Treats creedal confession ("Jesus is Lord") as historically prior and formative for Paul's theology rather than merely theological extrapolation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects readings that treat resurrection solely as a forensic or future event by underlining the Spirit's present, constitutive activity (not merely future hope).
 - Counters approaches that dichotomize Christology and pneumatology or marginalize the Spirit in Pauline theology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the language of *vindication/exaltation through the Spirit* (reading Romans 1:4 and Romans 8 together as a theological unit).
 - Uses "participation" language to show how the Spirit effects real union with the risen Lord rather than merely moral imitation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential among evangelical and charismatic scholars for integrating pneumatology into mainstream Pauline Christology.
 - Adopted in scholarly teaching as a corrective to atomistic readings of Paul; seen as a staple in courses on Paul, Christology, and the Spirit.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to exegete Paul with theological coherence across letters.
 - Supplies a compact, defensible argument for reading resurrection, lordship, and Spirit together - useful for both classroom and advanced research.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kyrios (Lord):** Central confessional title for Jesus; signals enthronement, authority, and the early creedal formula that organizes Paul's thought.
- **Pneuma (Spirit):** Agent of vindication (raising/exaltation) and present empowerment; the means by which believers are united to the risen Lord.
- **Resurrection (anastasis):** Divine act that vindicates Jesus as Son and Lord; is both retrospective vindication and present enthronement.
- **Exaltation/Vindication:** Pauline move from crucified Jesus to exalted Lord, interpreted as effected by God through the Spirit.
- **Union with Christ (koinonia / participation):** The Spirit constitutes believers' real, mystical-social participation in the risen Lord.
- **Adoption:** Spirit-wrought status change for believers tied to the resurrection and lordship of Christ.
- **Pneumatic empowerment:** The Spirit's enabling presence in Jesus' ministry and the church's mission (signs, gifts, witness).
- **Creedal confession:** Early formulated statements (e.g., "Jesus is Lord") that frame Paul's theology as rooted in communal proclamation.
- **Lordship as theological center:** Lordship is not merely title but the reality enacted by resurrection and maintained by the Spirit.
- **Christo‑pneumatic integration:** Terminology pointing to Fee's insistence on inseparability of Christology and pneumatology.
- **Present eschatology:** The resurrection inaugurates present reality (not only future consummation) via the Spirit's activity.
- **Vindication-as-declaration (Rom 1:4):** Fee reads "declared Son" as declaration through power (resurrection) effected by the Spirit.
- **Soteriological continuity:** Salvation is corporate, Spirit-enabled, and anchored in Jesus' exaltation.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for the thesis that Paul's Christology is centrally Trinitarian by way of Spirit-mediated Lordship.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts in an integrated Christo‑pneumatic framework (esp. Romans 8, 1 Corinthians 15, Phil 2).
 - As a **polemic resource** against readings that marginalize the Spirit or treat resurrection as only future/forensic.
