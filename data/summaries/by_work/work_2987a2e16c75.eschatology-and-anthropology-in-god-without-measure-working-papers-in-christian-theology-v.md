### TITLE
Eschatology and Anthropology - John Webster, in God Without Measure: Working Papers in Christian Theology, Vol. 2 (2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-career work by John Webster (1955-2016), written from within contemporary Reformed-Anglican systematic theology; responds to late modern theology, secularized anthropology, and intra-ecclesial worries about doctrinal coherence. Part of a volume that pursues theology under the banner of God's "immeasurability" and charity of doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Anthropology must be read and reconstituted eschatologically: the true account of what it is to be human is integrally shaped by the decisive future (Christ's resurrection, consummation) that is already present in Christ and the church. Anthropology divorced from eschatology yields distorted, autonomous accounts of human nature.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Begins from theological method: doctrine of God and revelation govern any account of humanity; theology must not presuppose secular notions of autonomy.
 - Reorients anthropology around Christ and the resurrection - human being is creaturely, finite, and yet destined for participation in the life of God.
 - Develops the notion of eschatological presence: the future consummation is not merely futurity but a present shaping reality by promise and gift (incarnation, Spirit, sacraments, church).
 - Shows implications: sin, death, freedom, vocation, and sanctification are intelligible only in light of eschatological fulfilment and the already/not-yet dynamic.
 - Concludes with pastoral and ecclesial ramifications: formation, prayer, and sacramental life are constitutive for a proper eschatological anthropology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Biblical witness (Paul, Gospel eschatology), Augustine and Calvin (reformational and patristic resources), Karl Barth (Christ-centered dogmatics), interlocution with modern secular anthropology and liberal theological anthropology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Trinity (as ground for participation), Christology (incarnation/resurrection central), creation and creaturehood, sin and death, redemption/justification, sanctification, eschatology proper, ecclesiology and sacramentality.
- **Closing line:** Human nature is rightly understood only as creaturely life shaped and healed toward consummation in Christ - an anthropology that is eschatological at root, ecclesial in form, and revelatory in its horizon.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Places eschatology not at the terminus but at the formative center of anthropology.
 - Insists on the ontological primacy of divine action (promise/gift) over anthropological self-interpretation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Enlightenment and modernist anthropologies that begin from autonomy, agency, or immanent experience.
 - Develops more explicitly Christocentric and sacramental lines than some liberal or existential accounts which privatize eschatological hope.
 - Dialogues with Barthian Christocentrism while retaining stronger retrieval of classical and Reformation categories (creaturehood, participation).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses "eschatological anthropology" as a programmatic phrase; emphasizes "eschatological presence" as a theological category (future consummation bearing present ontological weight).
 - Re-articulates "creaturehood" and "measure" in light of God's immeasurable gift - human measure is derivative, not autonomous.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Received as a compelling corrective in Reformed and Anglican circles; influential in recent ecclesial theological curricula and in debates over theological anthropology.
 - Cited by subsequent scholars who seek to integrate doctrine of God, Christology, and practical theology by way of eschatology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of doctrinally integrated theology: shows method for reading loci in relation to eschatology.
 - Useful corrective against secularizing tendencies in pastoral formation and moral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological anthropology:** The program that defines human nature primarily by its destiny and present participation in the consummation inaugurated in Christ.
- **Eschatological presence:** The idea that the future consummation has present, constitutive reality in Christ, Spirit, sacraments, and church.
- **Creaturehood:** Human finitude and contingency; dependence upon God as the necessary starting point for anthropology.
- **Participation:** Human sharing in divine life through Christ - ontological union, not mere moral improvement.
- **Incarnation/Resurrection:** Christological events that ground the eschatological reconstitution of humanity; decisive for anthropology.
- **Revelation as formative:** Revelation from God (not human reflection) provides the categories to speak of humanity rightly.
- **Already/not-yet (dialectic):** Temporal structure by which present human life is marked by inaugurated consummation and awaited fulfilment.
- **Gift/Favor (grace):** Salvation and human destiny are gifts, resisting any account that makes human flourishing a human achievement.
- **Sin and Death (eschatologically read):** Not merely privative conditions but realities judged and transformed by the eschatological act of God.
- **Ecclesial/sacramental constitution:** Church life and sacraments are means of present participation in the eschatological reality.
- **Measure/Immeasurability:** Human "measure" derives from a God who is without measure; anthropology must keep this asymmetry.
- **Freedom (creaturely):** Freedom reconceived as vocation and responsibility within creaturely dependence and eschatological promise.
- **Sanctification:** Process understood under eschatological horizon - formation toward consummation, not merely ethical improvement.
- **Trinitarian grounding:** The doctrine of the Trinity supplies the relational and communal matrix for human participation in divine life.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definition source for an eschatologically centered theological anthropology.
 - As a polemic against secular/autonomous conceptions of human nature.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking doctrine of God, Christology, and ecclesiology for ethics, pastoral theology, and sacramental theology.
