### TITLE
Willem J. van Asselt, The Federal Theology of Johannes Cocceius (1603-1669) - a systematic-historical reconstruction of Cocceius's covenant theology and its theological architecture, with special attention to the **pactum salutis** and Christ as **covenant head**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century Dutch Reformed milieu; the rise of the Cocceian school in Leiden against the backdrop of **Voetian** scholasticism and broader confessional controversies.
 - Van Asselt writes as a modern historian-theologian reconstructing Cocceius's thought from sermons, exegetical works, and polemical writings.

- **Central thesis**
 - Cocceius articulated a coherent, Christ-centered federal theology in which the **pactum salutis** and the representation of Christ as covenant head are central. Van Asselt shows Cocceius combined a redemptive-historical method with a robust federal (covenantal) soteriology that differs in style and emphasis from contemporaneous scholastic formulations.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-methodological reconstruction: situates writings in pastorate, university, and polemical contexts.
 - Thematic exposition:
 - (1) Cocceius's use of covenant language as the primary regulative grid for Scripture (historia salutis as unfolding covenant).
 - (2) Elaboration of covenant schema: covenant of works, covenant of grace as a **progressive series** (administrations) rather than static legal categories.
 - (3) Doctrine of the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption) and Christ's pre-temporal role.
 - (4) Christology and federal headship: representation, imputation, and union with Christ grounded covenantally.
 - Comparative critique: contrasts Cocceius with Voetian scholasticism and other Reformed positions to highlight distinctives.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Johannes Cocceius (works and lectures).
 - Interlocutors: Voetian critics in the Dutch Republic, broader Reformed scholastic tradition, and later interpreters of covenant theology.
 - Scriptural and Patristic sources as used by Cocceius; van Asselt situates Cocceius in the trajectory of post-Reformation federal thought.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (redemptive-historical reading), covenant theology (formal structure and administrations), Trinity (whence intra-Trinitarian aspects of the pactum), Christology (pre-existence, mediation, headship), soteriology (representation, imputation, union), typology and promise-fulfillment.

- **Closing line**
 - Van Asselt presents Cocceius as a formative federal theologian whose **redemptive-historical, Christocentric covenantism** reconfigures Reformed soteriology around a historical unfolding of covenantal promise and the person of Christ as covenant head.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes **historia salutis**: Scripture is read as a progressive covenant-history rather than a set of static scholastic loci.
 - Treats the **pactum salutis** not merely as legal contract language but as the divine plan worked out in covenantal history - an integrated intra-Trinitarian and redemptive pact.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Moves away from rigid scholastic abstractions (Voetian method) toward a dynamic, historically rooted covenant schema.
 - While affirming classical federal categories (works/grace), Cocceius frames them as successive administrations emphasizing promise and fulfillment rather than primarily forensic transactions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Strong deployment of treaty/pact imagery adapted to biblical covenants; emphasis on covenantal **series** (multiple administrations culminating in the New Covenant).
 - An early articulation linking Christ's pre-existent election and mediatorial role explicitly to covenantal headship and the pactum.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked sustained controversy in the Dutch Republic (Cocceian vs. Voetian disputes).
 - Became the nucleus of the Cocceian school influencing later Dutch and German covenant theologians; resurged in modern scholarship and in redemptive-historical hermeneutics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how covenant structure can serve both exegetical and systematic ends.
 - Provides a historically grounded alternative to scholastic formulations of pact theology, valuable for students tracing the development of federal theology and Christological representation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis (covenant of redemption)**
 - The pre-temporal/divine agreement to redeem the elect; for Cocceius a real organizing plan tying election, Christ's work, and covenantal administration.

- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-fall covenant with Adam; for Cocceius part of the covenantal story that sets up promise/necessity for the covenant of grace.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The overarching redemptive covenant across administrations (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New), centered on Christ's person and work.

- **Christ as Covenant Head (federal headship)**
 - Christ functions as the representative of the elect; his obedience/atonement are imputed and effectuate union with believers.

- **Historia Salutis (redemptive history)**
 - Reading Scripture as progressive promise-fulfillment; history is the principal hermeneutical key.

- **Federal Union / Representation**
 - The theological account of how believers are united to Christ and how his merits become theirs through covenantal representation.

- **Typology and Promise-Fulfillment**
 - Typological reading anchors Old Testament institutions as anticipatory covenantal administrations fulfilled in Christ.

- **Progressive Series of Covenants**
 - A developmental model of covenants emphasizing continuity and fulfillment rather than discrete juridical contracts.

- **Intra-Trinitarian Dimensions**
 - The pactum implicates the persons of the Trinity: plan and execution are covenantally ordered within the Godhead.

- **Covenant Administration / Sacramental Economy**
 - How covenantal promises are mediated historically (law, sacraments, offices).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Cocceius's specific brand of federal theology and the theological use of pact language.
- As a **polemic-historical resource** illuminating Cocceian/Voetian controversies and terminological differences.
- As an **exegetical model** for redemptive-historical hermeneutics linking typology and covenant structure.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in historiography of covenant theology, showing alternatives to scholastic accounts of the pactum salutis and Christ's headship.
