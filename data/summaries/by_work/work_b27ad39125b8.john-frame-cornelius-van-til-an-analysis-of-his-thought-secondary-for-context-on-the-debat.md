### TITLE
John Frame, Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought - notes by John Murray (secondary, contextual analysis of the One-Person Language debate)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed apologetics and systematic theology; debate centered in Westminster/Westminster-influenced circles (Princeton legacy, Reformed seminary debates).
 - Reaction to Cornelius Van Til's presuppositional apologetics and his radical stress on God's epistemic priority; John Frame and others produced analytical treatments; Murray records and critiques these debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The locus is whether Van Til's rhetorical and epistemological habit of speaking of divine knowing and revelation in ways that collapse interpersonal distinctions leads to a de facto **one-person** (or modalistic) conception of God - and whether that undercuts orthodox Trinitarian doctrine and Christology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition: Frame's sympathetic reconstruction of Van Til's method - presuppositionalism, anti-analogical stance, God's exhaustive knowledge as the constitutive ground of human knowing.
 - Critical move: Murray (via Frame) isolates instances of Van Til's **one-person language** (language which emphasizes God's undivided knowing or presents revelation almost solely in terms of divine subjectivity).
 - Theological diagnosis: such language risks blurring the economic and immanent Trinity, or conflating the persons in the act of knowing and revelation.
 - Proposal: defend Van Til's theological intent (to stress divine sovereignty and epistemic priority) while correcting or cautioning against expressions that could be read as modalistic.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Cornelius Van Til (subject), John Frame (analyst), John Murray (review/critical note-taker).
 - Secondary interlocutors: broader Reformed interlocutors concerned with Trinitarian orthodoxy (critics from classical apologetics and systematic theology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs. general), epistemology (presuppositional method), Trinity (persons and relations), divine simplicity, Christology (implications for incarnation and revelation), analogia entis (rejection/critique).
- **Closing line**
 - Murray's reading of Frame presents Van Til as a trenchant defender of divine priority in knowledge, but one whose **one-person** idiom requires careful theological correction lest a robust epistemology undermine Trinitarian distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the epistemic primacy of God as the precondition of all human knowledge - more radical than many classical apologetic models.
 - Employs rhetorical force to show that all thought is accountable to God's self-revelation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Murray insists on clearer terminological boundaries to preserve orthodox Trinitarian doctrine: affirm Van Til's theological instincts but reject expressions that collapse the persons.
 - Contrasts Van Til's anti-analogical posture with more moderate Reformed uses of analogy (e.g., Kuyperian or traditional Reformed analogia entis).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularization and sharpening of the phrase **one-person language** as a diagnostic term in debates over Trinitarian speech and apologetic method.
 - Reframing presuppositionalism in explicitly Trinitarian and Christological keys to avoid modalistic readings.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed sharper attention within Reformed circles to the need for Trinitarian precision in apologetic formulations.
 - Influenced subsequent defenders of Van Til (who refined formulations) and critics who pressed for clearer person-relational language.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a teaching exemplar: how methodological zeal (epistemic priority of God) can produce theological ambiguities; important for students balancing apologetics and orthodox dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One-Person Language**
 - Describes rhetorical habits that present divine action or knowledge in undifferentiated, non-personal terms that risk collapsing Trinitarian persons.
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Apologetic method asserting that Christian truth-claims are the necessary presupposition for rational thought; Van Til's hallmark.
- **Epistemic Priority**
 - The claim that God's knowledge and self-revelation ontologically/epistemically precede and ground human knowing.
- **Analogia Entis**
 - Traditional doctrine of analogy between God and creation; often rejected or limited by Van Til.
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - Doctrine that God is not composition; used by Van Til to stress unity but can intersect problematically with personhood language.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity**
 - Distinction between God's actions in history (economic) and inner life (immanent); key in diagnosing modalistic tendencies.
- **Modalism (risk)**
 - The heretical tendency to reduce divine persons to modes; used diagnostically against ambiguous one-person formulations.
- **Special Revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure in Scripture and Christ - Van Til emphasizes its primacy for epistemology.
- **Immanence / Transcendence**
 - Balancing God's nearness in revelation with divine otherness; Van Til stresses transcendence strongly.
- **Antithesis**
 - Reformed theme of radical contrast between regenerate and unregenerate thought - invoked in apologetic method critiques.
- **Incorruptible Revelation (Christological focus)**
 - Emphasizes that true knowledge of God is incarnational and personal; used to correct depersonalized formulations.
- **Presuppositional Critique**
 - The practice of showing the internal incoherence of non-Christian systems without Van Tilian collapse into one-person speech.
- **Orthodox Trinitarian Precision**
 - Murray's corrective demand: doctrinal formulations must preserve personhood while upholding divine unity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic**: to challenge Van Tilian formulations that verge on modalism and to press for terminological correction.
- As a **methodological definition source**: clarifies what presuppositionalism intends and where it can be theologically vulnerable.
- As a **didactic exemplar**: shows how to read a leading Reformed apologist sympathetically while enforcing doctrinal boundaries.
