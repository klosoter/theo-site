### TITLE
The Christian Doctrine of Man - B. B. Warfield (Studies in Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton theology; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed systematician reacting to German higher criticism, naturalistic evolutionism, and speculative psychology.
 - Situated within the Princeton method: rigorous exegetical theology supported by historical dogmatic resources (Reformation and Reformed orthodoxy) and polemic against modernism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a biblically faithful anthropology that preserves **the unity and dignity of the human person**, the reality of sin, and the hope of redemption, while rejecting both Platonic dualism and crude materialism.
 - Problem addressed: what is the human constitution (soul/body relation), how does sin affect human nature, and how does the imago Dei persist amid corruption?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of **psychosomatic (psychophysical) unity**: man is a single creature constituted by a spiritual principle and a material body, not two independent substances in continual conflict.
 - Treatment of the **soul/spirit** as the real subject of life and personality - immaterial in its properties but never to be isolated from the embodied human.
 - Doctrine of **imago Dei**: intrinsic value grounded in personal, relational, and moral capacities; image is real, communal and moral rather than merely functional or accidental.
 - Analysis of **original righteousness and the Fall**: sin is a pervasive corruption of the whole person (will, conscience, affections, reason) and affects human nature structurally.
 - Soteriological and eschatological consequences: true human destiny is restoration in Christ - not merely immortal disembodied existence but resurrection and renewal of the whole person.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture, Reformation and Reformed dogmatics (Calvin, Reformed orthodoxy), and Princeton predecessors (Charles/Archibald A. Hodge).
 - Polemically interacts with Greek dualism (Platonism), mechanistic materialism, and certain modern psychological theories; critiques naturalistic evolutionism where it undermines theological anthropology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropological loci: human nature, image of God, sin (original and actual), personhood, soul/body relation, immortality, resurrection, and implications for Christology and soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers anthropology on a biblically grounded **psychosomatic personalism**: humans are unified, embodied persons created in God's image, fallen in every faculty, and redeemable only by the incarnate and resurrected Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **unity of the person**: rejects any treatment that turns the soul into an isolated, autonomous entity.
 - Balances the immaterial reality of the soul with the **primacy of embodied existence** - avoids Platonic contempt for the body.
 - Emphasizes the **legal and federal** dimensions of original sin and its pervasive effects upon human nature.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects classical Greek dualism by insisting the Bible presents persons as psychosomatic unities rather than souls temporarily trapped in bodies.
 - Opposes simplistic materialist reductionism by defending genuine immaterial aspects (will, conscience, personality) that resist naturalistic explanation.
 - Revises some historical formulations by recentering the image of God in personal and relational terms rather than merely intellectual capacities.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the term **psychosomatic unity** in systematic argumentation to bridge patristic/medieval substance-language and modern empirical psychology.
 - Clarifies distinctions between **soul** (psuche) and **spirit** (pneuma) in Biblical usage while avoiding speculative metaphysical taxonomies.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical anthropology; used as a corrective to both liberal spiritualisms and materialist trends.
 - Served Princeton and subsequent conservative theologians as a model for integrating biblical exegesis, historical dogmatics, and contemporary critique.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically strong for teaching a balanced, historically informed, and biblically rooted doctrine of man.
 - Continues to function as a conceptual pivot in debates about personhood, bioethics, and the theological significance of embodiment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Human being as one integrated person composed of body and spiritual principle; key corrective to dualism and reductionism.

- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - The relational/moral-personal aspect of human dignity; informs ethics, vocation, and soteriology.

- **Soul / Spirit (psuche / pneuma)**
 - Distinction retained in usage and function; both point to immaterial aspects of personal life without ontologizing an independent ghostly substance.

- **Person / personality**
 - Real, sui generis subjectivity - capacity for moral agency, self-awareness, and relation to God and others.

- **Original righteousness**
 - The created state of humanity: moral rectitude and right relation with God prior to the Fall.

- **Fall / total corruption**
 - Sin as pervasive, affecting all faculties (mind, will, affections) and the whole human nature.

- **Federal headship / imputation**
 - Corporate representation in Adam as decisive for the human condition; legal and covenantal dimensions emphasized.

- **Immortality vs. resurrection**
 - Warfield stresses resurrection and the eschatological renewal of the whole person rather than a Platonic immortal soul surviving independently.

- **Biblical personalism**
 - Methodological stance: exegesis of Scripture drives the theological anthropology; resists speculative metaphysics.

- **Anti-materialism / anti-Dualism**
 - Dual polemic: opposes both materialist reduction and Platonic denigration of the body.

- **Nature and grace**
 - Human nature is good in origin but corrupted; grace restores the whole person, not merely an inner soul.

- **Conscience / moral sense**
 - Treated as an essential faculty indicating moral accountability and God-related constitution.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed anthropology (psychosomatic unity, imago Dei, corruption).
- As a **polemic** against both Platonic dualism and materialist naturalism in theological and philosophical anthropology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis, Pauline anthropology, and the biblical portrait of personhood.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology to soteriology and eschatology (implications for atonement, sanctification, and resurrection).
