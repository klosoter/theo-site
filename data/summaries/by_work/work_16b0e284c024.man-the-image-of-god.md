### TITLE
Man: The Image of God - G. C. Berkouwer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Dutch Reformed theology (Studies in Dogmatics series). Written in a post-war theological milieu shaped by dialogue with Neo‑Orthodoxy (Barth), classical Reformed witnesses (Calvin, Augustine, Kuyper), and ongoing debates about modern anthropology and common grace. English translation broadened reception in Anglo‑American seminaries.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** What does it mean for human beings to be created in the image of God, and how is that image affected by the Fall and restored in Christ? Berkouwer aims to define the imago Dei biblically and systemically while accounting for sin, guilt, corruption, and eschatological restoration.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical grounding in Genesis and biblical anthropology: identifies structural (ontological), functional (vocation), and relational (creature-in-relation-to-God-and-neighbor) dimensions of the image.
 - Historical‑theological survey: traces patristic, medieval, and Reformed treatments; highlights tensions between Augustinian and Pelagian readings.
 - Diagnosis of the Fall: affirms pervasive corruption - **total depravity/total inability** - but argues the image is harmed, not utterly destroyed; distinguishes between guilt, pollution, and spiritual death.
 - Christological and soteriological resolution: Christ as the true and restored image; redemption reconstitutes the image in believers now and fully in eschaton.
 - Practical and ethical implications: human worth, responsibility, and vocation under sin and grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Calvin, Kuyper, Barth, representative medieval theologians, contemporary Dutch Reformed thinkers; engages Pelagianism, semi‑Pelagianism, and modern anthropologies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology, doctrine of sin (original sin, guilt, corruption), covenant theology (federal headship), Christology (Christ as image), soteriology (restoration of the image), eschatological anthropology, and aspects of common/preparatory grace.
- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** The imago Dei is the relational-functional pattern of human creaturehood wounded by sin but re‑established in Christ and consummated eschatologically - a theological nexus linking creation, fall, redemption, and final restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Nuanced affirmation of both ruin and persistence:** Berkouwer insists on the **pervasiveness of sin** (total inability) while refusing the language that the image is utterly annihilated; retains human responsibility and moral capacity in a qualified way.
- **Relational and functional emphasis:** Moves beyond strictly ontological readings to stress vocation, neighbor‑relation, and covenantal placement as intrinsic to the image.
- **Christological hermeneutic for anthropology:** Read the imago Dei through Christ as normative exemplar and ontological restoration - the image is not an abstract property but fulfilled in the incarnate Son.
- **Moderating between Augustinian rigor and modern optimism:** Critiques both Pelagian/modern humanism and overly deterministic readings of Augustinianism; aims for a balanced Reformed anthropology that safeguards grace and guilt.
- **Methodological care:** Strong exegetical emphasis, historical sensitivity, and pastoral concern combine to make the treatment usable both academically and pastorally.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly regarded in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a clear, moderate, and theologically rich account; influenced subsequent treatments of imago Dei, particularly where scholars seek a Christ‑centered, ethically engaged anthropology.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a robust bridge between Scripture, Reformation heritage, and contemporary questions about human nature, sin, and redemption - valuable for systematicians, ethicists, and pastors.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** Multidimensional - ontological, functional, relational; baseline for human dignity and vocation.
- **Original righteousness:** The state of created rightness and communion with God prior to the Fall; a normative referent.
- **Original sin:** Universal corruption inherited after Adam; Berkouwer treats its reality and effects without reductive metaphysics.
- **Total depravity / Total inability:** Affirms pervasive incapacity to restore oneself to God; preserves human moral agency in a contradicted form.
- **Guilt, pollution, and death:** Threefold effects of the Fall distinguished analytically - forensic guilt, existential defilement, and mortal consequences.
- **Federal headship of Adam:** Treated as historically and theologically significant; Berkouwer defends federal or covenantal readings while attending to exegetical questions about historicity.
- **Christ as the true image:** Christological fulfillment and restoration of the imago Dei; soteriological center.
- **Common grace / Preparatory grace:** Discussed as part of human cultural and moral capacity under sin; aids in explaining retained human goods.
- **Pelagianism / Semi‑Pelagianism:** Antitheses to his account; Berkouwer critiques their optimism about unaided human will.
- **Eschatological anthropology:** The image is fully realized only in the eschaton - present restoration is anticipatory and incomplete.
- **Imputation (guilt and righteousness):** Engages debates over forensic imputation of Adam's sin and Christ's righteousness; nuanced rather than polemical.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for imago Dei that balances ontological, functional, and Christological elements.
- As a **polemic** against both Pelagian humanism and overly deterministic readings of original sin.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis and Pauline anthropology through Christological and covenantal lenses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine of God, anthropology, sin, and soteriology in systematic theology.
