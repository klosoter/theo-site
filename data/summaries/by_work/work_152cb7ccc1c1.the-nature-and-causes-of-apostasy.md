### TITLE
The Nature and Causes of Apostasy - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th-century Reformed/Puritan milieu; Owen (1616-1683) writing amid post-Restoration controversies over assurance, assurance of saints, and debates with Arminians and professing Protestants. Work functions as pastoral-theological response to visible defections and doctrinal laxity in the churches.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To analyze what apostasy is, why it occurs, and how to distinguish between genuine believers and those whose profession proves false - while defending the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints against misunderstandings and abuses.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition and varieties of apostasy: plain falling away, gradual declension, and "apparent" apostasy (false profession).
 - Causal analysis: internal corruption (remaining sin), external occasions (temptation, persecution), defective use of means, and judicial hardening.
 - Criteria for discerning true faith: habitual obedience, repentance, perseverance in means, and evidences of sanctification.
 - Pastoral implications: church discipline, care for backsliders, and the proper use of assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical Reformed authorities (Augustine, Calvin), contemporary Puritans, and opponents represented by Arminian and Socinian positions; implicitly aimed at those who used apostasy to deny perseverance or to encourage lax assurance.
- **Doctrines treated:** conversion (effectual calling), faith and repentance, total depravity and human inability, sanctification, assurance and perseverance, church discipline, and the nature/role of spiritual gifts.
- **Site usage (three targeted loci):**
 - **Faith and Repentance:** Owen treats faith and repentance as inseparable gifts and marks of grace (see Owen on the inseparable connection between faith, repentance, and perseverance).
 - **Total Depravity and Total Inability:** He analyzes the will's impotence apart from grace as a primary cause of apostasy, stressing need for effectual grace.
 - **Spiritual Gifts and Sanctification:** Owen warns that spiritual gifts or external manifestations do not guarantee perseverance without sanctification and persevering fruit.
- **Closing line:** Owen centers apostasy theologically as a test-case for distinguishing saving grace from mere profession, arguing that perseverance is both a divine promise and a pastoral criterion to be judged by fruitful sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Nuanced taxonomy of apostasy (temporary vs final; internal vs external) rather than an all-or-nothing label.
 - Emphasis on the conjunction of forensic justification and progressive sanctification as the test of reality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against Arminian uses of apostasy to deny any genuine perseverance; equally opposes a naïve assurance that ignores observable fruit.
 - More pastorally diagnostic than a purely dogmatic defense of perseverance; insists on careful pastoral inquiry.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinguishes "apparent sanctification" (outward signs/gifts) from "confirming sanctification" (persevering inward mortification of sin).
 - Uses psychological/experiential categories to supplement classic forensic categories (will, inclination, habituation).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Reformed pastoral theology and later Calvinist debates about assurance, perseverance, and ecclesial discipline.
 - Used by later Puritan and evangelical traditions as a model for balancing doctrinal certainty with pastoral caution.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of rigorous pastoral theology: doctrinally Reformed yet diagnostically sensitive.
 - Valuable for courses on assurance, church discipline, and the interplay of justification and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Apostasy:** voluntary renunciation or falling away from Christian profession; treated in types (temporary, final, apparent).
- **Perseverance of the saints:** divine preservation of true believers; Owen defends while qualifying visible tests.
- **Apparent profession / apparent grace:** outward signs (profession, gifts) lacking inward confirming sanctification.
- **Faith:** effectual, living trust; inseparable from repentance and fruit.
- **Repentance:** evangelical turning, described as a gift and essential evidence of true conversion.
- **Total depravity / total inability:** radical corruption of will; explains human inability to persist without effectual grace.
- **Effectual calling / irresistible grace:** operative divine act that secures conversion and grounds perseverance.
- **Sanctification:** progressive mortification and vivification; the decisive arena for testing genuineness.
- **Spiritual gifts (charismata):** abilities and manifestations which can be present without true sanctification; therefore not decisive for assurance.
- **Judicial hardening:** divine judicial response that sometimes follows persistent refusal, contributing to final apostasy.
- **Assurance:** rightly grounded in signs/fruit and promises; must be tempered by self-examination and pastoral oversight.
- **Means of grace:** Scripture, sacraments, prayer - proper use is vital to prevent apostasy.
- **Backsliding:** temporary declension which may be remedied by repentance and means.
- **External profession:** public confession that requires verification by fruit and perseverance.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Definition source: standard Reformed definition and typology of apostasy in systematic theology and pastoral manuals.
 - Polemic: deployed against Arminian and semi-Pelagian accounts that either overstate human ability or misuse apostasy to deny perseverance.
 - Exegetical/pastoral model: used as a practical rubric for discerning assurance, exercising church discipline, and teaching sanctification.
