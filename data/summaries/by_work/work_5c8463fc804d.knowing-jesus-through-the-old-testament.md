### TITLE
Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament - Christopher J. H. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Anglo-evangelical scholarship (late 20th-early 21st century). Wright writes from an Old Testament scholar-practitioner frame allied to evangelical and Anglican contexts with pastoral and missionary concerns; part of a wider movement to recover canonical and Christocentric hermeneutics in evangelicalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Old Testament is inherently Christocentric: Jesus is the key to understanding the OT's narrative, institutions, promises, and law. Proper Christian reading must interpret the OT as pointing forward to Christ without collapsing historical particularity or reducing the OT to mere proof-texts.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Demonstrates how major OT structures (law, covenant, temple, sacrifice, kingship, wisdom, prophecy) find their fullest meaning in Jesus.
 - Argues for a canonical, Christotelic hermeneutic that reads each OT genre in relation to the Christ-event rather than isolating texts as independent moral or national manuals.
 - Develops typology as a normative theological method: persons, institutions and events in Israel function as God-ordained types whose eschatological antitype is Christ.
 - Applies this reading to pastoral, ecclesial and missional concerns: the risen Jesus reorients Christian life and mission in continuity with God's covenant purpose for Israel and the nations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** The Hebrew Scriptures as canonical whole; patristic and Reformation typological traditions implicitly appealed to; contemporary scholars advocating canonical and theological readings of the OT (broad engagement rather than technical debate with single rival).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant theology, Christology (fulfillment/antitype), typology, hermeneutics (canonical/Christocentric), mission, ecclesiology, continuity/fulfillment of Israel and church.
- **Closing line:** Read the Old Testament through Jesus: he is the interpretive center and eschatological fulfillment that unifies law, temple, kingship, prophecy and wisdom into God's one story of redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong advocacy of a **Christotelic (Christ-centered) and canonical** hermeneutic - not proof-texting but reading each OT element as built to culminate in Christ.
 - Careful integration of **typology** as theological and canonical, governed by covenantal faithfulness rather than speculative allegory.
 - Explicit linking of exegesis with **mission**: the OT's story of God for Israel is also God's mission for the nations, realized in Jesus.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against both dismissive modern critical readings that strip prophetic/typological meaning and against crude allegorical approaches that ignore historical particularity.
 - Contrasts with dispensational isolation of OT and NT; promotes continuity and fulfillment without collapsing distinct covenants.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes the term **Christotelic** in accessible evangelical circles as a guiding hermeneutical principle.
 - Treats institutional OT realities (temple, sacrifice, monarchy) systematically as **types whose theological function is anticipatory** rather than merely typographical curiosities.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical seminaries and churches as a bridge between scholarly OT study and preaching: influential among those teaching Christ-centered canonical reading.
 - Appreciated for pastoral clarity and usable typological method; sometimes critiqued by specialists for breadth over technical novelty.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a concise, pastoral-theological model for integrating OT study with New Testament Christology and church mission.
 - Valuable for preachers, students and mission-minded theologians seeking a robust, non-allegorical Christ-centered reading of the OT.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christotelic reading:** Reading the OT with Jesus as the interpretive and eschatological center.
- **Typology:** Theological method where OT persons/institutions/events are God-ordained foreshadows (types) fulfilled in Christ (antitype).
 - Emphasizes covenantal grounding and canonical restraint to avoid arbitrary allegory.
- **Fulfillment:** Concept that OT promises, patterns and institutions find completed meaning in Christ's person and work.
- **Covenant:** Framework for continuity - promises to Israel become the ordaining ground for Christ's work and the church's mission.
- **Messiah / Kingship:** Jesus as the Davidic fulfillment who embodies Israel's kingly hopes and inaugurates God's reign.
- **Temple & Sacrifice:** OT cultus functions as a type whose true meaning is realized in Christ's person, worship and atoning work.
- **Law & Wisdom:** Law's covenantal purpose and wisdom's true end are shown in Christ's teaching, obedience and righteousness.
- **Prophecy & Promise:** Prophetic expectation converges in Jesus as fulfilment of divine promises and eschatological hope.
- **Canonical hermeneutic:** Emphasis on reading Scripture as an ordered canon where meaning arises from the whole narrative.
- **Mission of God (missio Dei):** The OT story is inherently missionary - God's purpose for Israel extends to nations and finds expression in Christ.
- **Representative head / Israel typology:** Jesus as the faithful Israel and true human representative fulfilling Israel's vocation.
- **Continuity-with-fulfillment:** Avoids absolute replacement or unqualified continuity; reads fulfillment as completion and expansion of covenant promises.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As an **exegetical model**: a practical model for preaching and teaching OT passages Christocentrically.
 - As a **theological syntheses/pivot**: to connect OT institutions and narrative to New Testament Christology and mission.
 - As a **polemic resource**: against dispensational bifurcation of OT and NT and against non-typological modern reductions of OT meaning.
