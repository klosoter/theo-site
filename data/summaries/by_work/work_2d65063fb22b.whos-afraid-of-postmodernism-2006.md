### TITLE
Who's Afraid of Postmodernism? (2006) - James K. A. Smith

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2000s evangelical academy responding to the "postmodern turn" in philosophy, cultural theory, and continental thought.
 - Smith writes as a Reformed Christian philosopher-theologian seeking to mediate between mainstream postmodern theory and anxious evangelical responses.
 - Moves amid debates over apologetics, epistemology, and cultural engagement (evangelicals wary of relativism; continental theorists critiquing modernist certainties).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelicals should not simply fear or reject postmodernism; instead, Christians can appropriate postmodern critiques of modern epistemic pretensions while resisting nihilism and relativism by re-grounding knowledge in the Christian confession.
 - The Fall produces epistemic and cultural fractures that make modernist confidence suspect; postmodernism exposes those fractures and thus can be a theological corrective.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modernity's epistemological foundationalism and triumphalist narrative mask idolatrous self-sufficiency.
 - Engagement: careful reading of postmodern theorists (critical unpacking of their skeptical and anti-foundational moves).
 - Retrieval: claim that postmodern critiques align in part with premodern and biblical warnings about sin, finitude, and dependence-so Christians can adopt the critique but re-anchor truth claims in revealed, creational, and redemptive narratives.
 - Application: reframing apologetics, ecclesial witness, and cultural critique to be nonfoundationalist, humble, and narratively shaped.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Representative postmodern thinkers (e.g., Lyotard, Rorty, Derrida as figures of the "turn") and analytic/pragmatist interlocutors.
 - Evangelical critics and defenders of modern epistemology (broadly drawn - foundationalist apologeticians).
 - Theological resources drawn from Reformed and broader Christian traditions to propose a corrective grounding.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - The Fall and its consequences (epistemic disorder, cultural distortion).
 - Revelation and knowledge (how Christians know and testify).
 - Anthropology and sin (finitude, idolatry of reason).
 - Indirectly: ecclesiology and apologetics (models of witness), hermeneutics.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Postmodernism, properly read, humbles modern pretensions and can be harnessed to theological confession: the gospel supplies the narrative and grace by which epistemic fractures are diagnosed and healed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames postmodern critique as a theological opportunity rather than an enemy: a corrective to modernist hubris rooted in the doctrine of the Fall.
 - Moves the debate from defensive apologetics toward hermeneutical humility and narrative-centered witness.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects evangelical tendencies to dismiss postmodernism wholesale as mere relativism; contrasts with apologetical projects that insist on modern foundational epistemology.
 - Contrasts with secular postmodernists by insisting that critique must be re-anchored in creational and redemptive claims rather than collapse into nihilism.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes **epistemic consequences of the Fall** - sin as not merely moral but cognitive/social, producing forms of knowledge and culture that need theological diagnosis.
 - Uses "postmodernism" as both critique and theological lever: not adopted wholesale, but appropriated strategically.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in evangelical and Reformed circles as a constructive way to engage continental thought.
 - Credited with opening space for nonfoundationalist apologetics and for further work on worship/practices (anticipates Smith's later focus on cultural formation).
 - Criticized by some for underplaying genuine relativist dangers or for over-sympathizing with continental skepticism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a tempering corrective to naive modernist epistemology in theological education.
 - Useful bridge text for pastors and students to learn to engage postmodern thinkers without capitulating to relativism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Postmodernism**
 - Broad label for late-20th-century critiques of metanarratives, foundational reason, and Enlightenment certainties; here treated as diagnostic rather than purely destructive.

- **Modernity / Modernism**
 - The cultural-intellectual project centered on autonomy, foundational epistemology, and progress; Smith diagnoses its idolatrous tendencies.

- **Foundationalism**
 - The idea that knowledge must rest on indubitable foundations; primary target of both postmodern critique and Smith's reappraisal.

- **Metanarrative**
 - Grand explanatory stories (e.g., progress, rationality); postmodernism suspends confidence in them - Smith argues theology supplies a true and necessary metanarrative.

- **Epistemic humility / Epistemic consequences of the Fall**
 - Sin produces cognitive and communal distortion; humility acknowledges limits, contingencies, and need for redemption.

- **Idolatry of reason**
 - The elevation of human rational autonomy to ultimate status; modernity's hidden theology that postmodernism exposes.

- **Narrativity**
 - Emphasis on the role of storied identities and communities in shaping belief and knowing; theological narrative rescues truth from subjectivism.

- **Retrieval / Appropriation**
 - Strategy of taking postmodern insights and re-grounding them in Christian doctrine rather than rejecting or capitulating to them.

- **Hermeneutical humility**
 - A posture of interpretive openness and dependence on covenantal revelation and community.

- **Apologetics (nonfoundationalist)**
 - Moves away from attempting to prove Christianity on neutral foundations; argues for witness shaped by narrative, practice, and theological claims.

- **Cultural formation**
 - How practices, liturgies, and institutions shape beliefs - anticipatory theme of Smith's later work.

- **Relativism / Nihilism (as risks)**
 - Dangers Smith acknowledges: postmodern critique can lead to these if not anchored in Christian confession.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: clarifying what "postmodernism" means for theological audiences and distinguishing useful critiques from destructive skepticism.
- As a **polemic**: used against evangelical foundationalism and triumphalist apologetics, advocating nonfoundationalist alternatives.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: supplies a theological reading of the Fall that links sin to epistemic and cultural disorders, framing subsequent work in formation, worship, and apologetics.
