### TITLE
Faith in Democracy - Jonathan Chaplin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Anglican/Reformed public theology situated in late 20th-early 21st century debates about secularism, pluralism, and the role of religion in liberal democratic societies. Responds to both secularist impulses that privatize religion and confessional projects that seek ecclesial control of politics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians must sustain a robust, publicly engaged faith that both affirms democratic institutions and critiques liberal individualism from distinctly theological resources. Faith should inform but not coerce political life; democracy requires virtues cultivated by Christian practice.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modern secular liberalism has narrowed the public role of religion while fostering a privatized conscience and atomized citizenship.
 - Theological resources: biblical doctrines of creation, vocation, sin, and the common good provide norms for public life without collapsing church and state.
 - Moral-epistemic claim: Christian conviction grounds reasons for political judgement that are persuasive in public discourse rather than dispositive by ecclesial fiat.
 - Institutional emphasis: healthy democracy depends on virtue-formed citizens, intermediary institutions, and prudential judgment (practical reason) rather than legislative theology or sectarian withdrawal.
 - Practical engagement: Christians should bring distinctive motives-hope, love, humility, stewardship-to democratic debate and policy formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** broadly dialogues with liberal political theory (Rawlsian secular public reason), secularization critiques, communitarian critics (e.g., MacIntyre-style concerns about moral formation), and classical Christian sources (Augustine, reformational insights about vocation and common grace). Also engages modern political theology debates about church/state boundaries.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (public witness and vocation), anthropology (sin and social embeddedness), doctrine of creation (common good and stewardship), providence and eschatological hope (political humility), and ethics/virtue (formation of democratic virtues).
- **Closing line:** Theologically grounded and pragmatically attuned, Chaplin argues for a Christian public faith that cultivates civic virtues and offers persuasive, non-coercive resources for sustaining democratic flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes *formation* over proclamation as the primary way faith shapes politics: liturgical and moral formation produces citizens capable of sustaining democracy.
 - Advocates a posture of *persuasive witness*-public theological reason that seeks conversion of minds and hearts, not legal imposition.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects secular liberalism by recovering religiously rooted conceptions of the common good and virtue without endorsing confessional coercion.
 - Contrasts with theocratic or confessional projects that seek ecclesial supremacy, and with privatizing models that consign faith to the interior life.
 - Offers an alternative to radical communitarianism by upholding individual dignity within strong mediating institutions and civic practices.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the vocabulary of *vocation* and *stewardship* as civic categories applicable to lay political engagement.
 - Reframes "public reason" in theological keys-public theology as both apologetic and formative.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and Anglican circles for integrating covenantal/creation theology with democratic theory.
 - Influences public theology curricula, debates on church-state relations, and discussions about Christian civic formation in plural societies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a balanced model for faithful political engagement that resists both withdrawal and domination.
 - Useful pedagogically for training ministers and lay leaders in responsible civic participation rooted in Christian ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Public theology:** theological reflection aimed at shaping public discourse and policy by persuasive, non-coercive argument.
- **Christian citizenship:** vocationally informed participation in civic life that integrates discipleship and civic responsibility.
- **Common good:** social goods that theology helps to articulate and defend against atomistic individualism.
- **Vocation:** theological ground for civic roles; everyday callings as sites for public responsibility and stewardship.
- **Persuasive witness:** the modality by which faith addresses plural publics-argument, example, and formation rather than legal imposition.
- **Democratic virtues:** character traits (humility, hope, love, prudence) cultivated by Christian practice and necessary for democratic flourishing.
- **Institutional prudence:** practical wisdom applied to political institutions; attention to intermediary bodies that mediate between individual and state.
- **Pluralism:** acknowledged social reality; theology must learn to argue convincingly within plural contexts without renouncing truth-claims.
- **Secularization critique:** diagnosis of modernity's privatizing pressures and loss of communal moral formation.
- **Prophetic critique:** religious critique of injustice and sin directed toward public structures, styled as moral persuasion.
- **Stewardship:** theological basis for policies attentive to creation, welfare, and intergenerational responsibility.
- **Eschatological humility:** hope-informed restraint recognizing the provisionality of political arrangements.
- **Civic friendship:** social bonds enabling cooperation across difference-cultivated through Christian hospitality and practices.
- **Legitimacy (political theologies):** theological resources used to judge when political authority is just and accountable.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definition source for contemporary public theology and Christian civic engagement.
 - As a polemical resource against both privatizing secularism and coercive confessional politics.
 - As a pedagogical model for integrating doctrinal teaching (vocation, common good) with practical political ethics.
