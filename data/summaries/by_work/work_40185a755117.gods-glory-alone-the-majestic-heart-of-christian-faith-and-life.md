### TITLE
God's Glory Alone: The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life - David VanDrunen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed renewal context; written by a confessional Reformed systematician addressing 21st-century theology and practice.
 - Situated against prevalent anthropocentric and pietistic strains in evangelicalism; dialogical with classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster) and modern interlocutors across evangelicalism.
- **Central thesis**
 - The ultimate end (telos) of all things and the organizing principle for doctrine, worship, ethics, and public life is the **glory of God**; theology and Christian life must be re-centered on God's glory rather than creaturely flourishing or private piety.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and biblical construal of "glory": both intrinsic worth and manifested honor; God as the one whose glory is the aim of creation and redemption.
 - The glory of God governs key loci: doctrine of God, creation, providence, covenant, Christology, redemption, sanctification, worship, law, and eschatology.
 - Exposition of how glory functions as normative teleology: moral, ecclesial, and political implications follow when Christian life is ordered to God's glory.
 - Practical applications: worship shaped to display God's worth; Christian ethics as responding to and promoting God's glory; social and political engagement as subservient to divine glory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Employs classical Reformed theologians (Calvin, Westminster divines), patristic and biblical sources; engages contemporary evangelical emphases (implicit critique of anthropocentric theologies and certain pietistic trajectories).
 - Converses with broader modern concerns about secularization, public theology, and Christian witness.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology proper (attributes and being of God), Trinity (glory as intra-Trinitarian and missional), creation, providence, covenant theology, Christology (incarnation and atonement as means of glorifying God), soteriology, sanctification, ecclesiology (worship), law and ethics, and eschatology (consummation of glory).
- **Closing line**
 - The book argues that orienting all doctrine and life to **God's glory alone** recovers a unifying theological vision that corrects fragmented, human-centered practice and restores worshipful, public, and moral coherence to Christian faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats glory as both the central telos of cosmic history and the immediate norm for everyday Christian life - not merely a theological ornament but a practical ordering principle.
 - Integrates systematic theology with pastoral and public theology consistently under the rubric of divine glory.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects modern anthropocentrism (where human flourishing or experience becomes primary) by insisting that genuine human good is derivative and ordered to divine glory.
 - Pushes back on forms of pietism that privatize faith, arguing worship and public ethics must aim at displaying God's worth.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic mapping of "glory" across every theological locus, showing how the term functions as both motive and end without collapsing God's transcendence into creaturely utility.
 - Clarifies distinctions between intrinsic divine worth and the extrinsic display of that worth in redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a corrective work; adopted in seminary courses on doctrine and worship.
 - Stimulated renewed interest in glory-centered preaching, worship renewal, and public theology that resists privatizing the faith.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, coherent framework for reorienting theology and ethics; valuable for sermon formation, curriculum on doctrine of God, and for pastors shaping congregational worship and civic engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Glory (doxa)** - central term: intrinsic worth of God and the visible manifestation of that worth; both ontological and revelatory.
 - Intrinsic vs. extrinsic/displayed glory distinction.
- **Telos / ultimate end** - God's glory as the final purpose of creation and redemption.
- **Theocentric teleology** - the methodological principle ordering all loci to God's glory.
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's lordship as the means by which glory is realized in providence and covenant.
- **Covenant** - framework by which God orders human life toward his glory; covenantal obligations aim to manifest divine worth.
- **Christological glorification** - incarnation, atonement, resurrection as the primary historical means of displaying and securing God's glory.
- **Sanctification (participation in glory)** - moral and spiritual life as being shaped to reflect and display God's glory in vocation and worship.
- **Worship (doctrinal-liturgical nexus)** - corporate worship as the principal human activity designed to display God's glory.
- **Law and ethics** - divine law understood as instrument for ordering creaturely life to the glory of God; public duties included.
- **Eschatology (consummation of glory)** - new creation as the culminating public display of God's glory.
- **Public theology / common good** - civic engagement rooted in glory-driven norms, not secular or private agendas.
- **Anthropocentrism (contrast)** - critiqued posture that privileges human flourishing apart from divine-centered telos.
- **Glorification (final state)** - the goal of redemption where believers partake in and reflect the perfected glory of God.
- **Manifestation / revelation** - how God's attributes and saving works are made known as glory.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definitional source** for "glory" in theology curricula - concise mapping across doctrines.
- As a **polemic** against anthropocentric and privatizing tendencies in contemporary evangelicalism.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for preaching and worship formation centered on doxological aims.
