### TITLE
Heaven and Hell - John Gerstner (chapter), Baker's Dictionary of Christian Ethics (1973)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Entry in an evangelical, Reformed-oriented reference work (Baker's Dictionary of Christian Ethics, 1973). Written in the postwar conservative Protestant milieu that sought to restate traditional doctrines against rising liberal and revisionist trends.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defends the classical Christian teaching of heaven and hell as real, eternal states grounded in divine justice and Christ's atoning work; rejects annihilationism and universalism as inconsistent with biblical witness and orthodox theology.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Definition and distinction of terms: heaven as blessed communion with God; hell as just retribution and exclusion from God.
 - Scriptural survey: appeals to biblical texts affirming resurrection, final judgment, eternal life and eternal punishment.
 - Theological grounding: links eternal destinies to Christology and soteriology - Christ's atonement secures entrance to heaven; rejection of Christ results in just condemnation.
 - Objections considered: moral objections to eternal punishment; alternative readings (conditional immortality, universal reconciliation) are critiqued on exegetical and doctrinal grounds.
 - Pastoral and ethical implications: calls for evangelistic urgency, holy living, and pastoral realism about final accountability.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit appeal to classical sources (Scripture, Augustine, Calvin, Edwards by tradition) and explicit engagement with modern critics represented by advocates of annihilationism and universalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (resurrection, final judgment), Christology (atonement as basis for judgment and salvation), soteriology (justification, imputed righteousness), anthropology (personal identity and immortality), and divine attributes (justice, holiness, mercy).
- **Closing line:** Asserts that the reality of heaven and hell coherently expresses God's righteousness and grace, with eternal destinies determined by Christ's work and human response.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong Reformed insistence that eternal destiny is inseparable from Christ's penal substitutionary atonement and imputation.
 - Stress on the continuity of personal identity (bodily resurrection) rather than mere disembodied immortality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit correction of **annihilationism** (conditional immortality) as inconsistent with plain readings of key texts; rejects **universalism** as undermining divine justice and Gospel urgency.
 - Contrasts with liberal symbolic readings by insisting on substantial reality of eternal states.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical neologisms; notable for concise synthesis that integrates ethical urgency with doctrinal precision within a dictionary-format entry.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in conservative and Reformed circles as a clear, compact summary of orthodox eschatological doctrine.
 - Served as a handy polemical and teaching reference against mid-20th-century revisionist views.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable model of how to marshal biblical, doctrinal, and pastoral arguments concisely.
 - Durable as a pedagogical skeleton for courses on eschatology and pastoral ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Heaven:** Blessed fellowship with God; consummate eschatological reward grounded in union with Christ.
- **Hell:** Just, punitive state of exclusion from God; described as eternal punishment and loss.
- **Eternal conscious punishment:** Term applied to classical view of hell; denies cessation or annihilation of the condemned.
- **Annihilationism (conditional immortality):** Alternative view rejected here; the doctrine that the wicked ultimately cease to exist rather than suffer eternally.
- **Universalism:** View that all will be finally saved; critiqued as incompatible with divine justice and biblical warnings.
- **Final judgment:** The consummating divine verdict at the resurrection; determinant of eternal states.
- **Resurrection of the dead:** Affirmed as bodily and continuous with personal identity; the ground for final vindication or condemnation.
- **Penal substitutionary atonement:** The theological basis for both heaven (imputed righteousness) and hell (just condemnation of sin).
- **Imputed righteousness:** Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers - key to entrance into heaven.
- **Eternal life vs. eternal death:** Positive and negative eschatological terms; one is fellowship with God, the other is everlasting separation.
- **Biblical literality (in eschatological claims):** Preference for straightforward reading of texts describing eternal states.
- **Pastoral urgency:** Ethical consequence - evangelism and holiness flow from the reality of eternal destinies.
- **Divine justice and mercy:** Balancing attributes used to justify both punishment and the availability of salvation.
- **Particular vs. final judgment:** Implicit distinction - individual accountability and the ultimate public verdict.
- **Use across loci:**
 - Serves as a **clear definitional source** for orthodox terms in eschatology and Christian ethics.
 - Functions as a **polemic** against annihilationism and universalism, and as an **exegetical model** favoring a literal/Christocentric hermeneutic linking soteriology and final judgment.
