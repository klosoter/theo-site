### TITLE
The Trinity-Yesterday, Today and the Future (Westminster Theological Journal, 2003) - Robert Letham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed academic context; engagement with renewed trinitarian interest across ecumenical theology and systematic theology.
 - Responds to late 20th-century debates (social Trinitarianism, Barthian and Rahnerian emphases, renewed patristic retrieval).
- **Central thesis**
 - The classical, historic doctrine of the Trinity must be affirmed and deployed: the economic Trinity (God revealed in redemptive history) properly grounds talk of the ontological/immanent Trinity (God in himself); recent trends that divorce or reshape this relation are theologically damaging.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of the historical development of Trinitarian doctrine (patristic formulations, Augustine, Reformation receptions).
 - Exposition of the **proper relation between economic and ontological Trinity**: revelation is normative for speaking about God; what God does in history discloses who God is.
 - Critique of contemporary alternatives:
 - Social Trinitarian emphases that risk fragmenting divine unity or turning persons into separate centers of consciousness.
 - Approaches that make the immanent Trinity a speculative realm cut off from Scripture.
 - Constructive proposal: recover classical categories (persons, essence, relations of origin, perichoresis) and apply them pastorally and doxologically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic witnesses (Athanasius, Cappadocians), Augustine, Reformers (Calvin), and modern theologians (Barth, Moltmann, Torrance, Rahner, Gunton) are engaged as both resources and contrasts.
 - Scripture is treated as primary locus for economic revelation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation (economic/ontological relation), Christology (incarnation as decisive revelation), pneumatology (Spirit's procession/mission), implications for ecclesiology and worship.
- **Closing line**
 - The article insists that faithful Trinitarian theology honors Scripture and the church's classic formulations: the economic revelation of God in Christ and Spirit is the necessary hermeneutic for speaking rightly about the God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the *normativity of the economic Trinity* for any ontological claims - not by collapsing immanent and economic, but by tethering theological reflection to revelation.
 - Recovery of classical metaphysical terms (relations of origin, perichoresis) within a Reformed theological framework.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges social-Trinitarian models that read intra-divine relations as sociality modeled on human community, arguing they can inadvertently produce tritheism or an anthropomorphic pluralism.
 - Pushes back on purely speculative accounts of the immanent Trinity (that treat the immanent life as the primary datum independent of Scripture).
- **Conceptual/terminological clarifications**
 - Distinguishes carefully between *persons* (hypostases) and *essence* (ousia), and clarifies how eternal relations do not divide the divine substance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among conservative and confessional Reformed scholars as a reliable synthesis and pastoral corrective.
 - Used as a concise articulation of how to integrate patristic, Reformation, and modern resources for contemporary trinitarian retrieval.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching; supplies a compact, historically informed corrective to both speculative ontology and populist "social" readings of the Trinity, while offering a usable constructive alternative for preaching, liturgy, and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed in history (Father sending Son and Spirit); normative for theological language about God.
- **Ontological / Immanent Trinity**
 - God as God is in himself; Letham ties proper talk of this realm to what Scripture reveals.
- **Persons (hypostases)**
 - Father, Son, Spirit as real personal subsistences within the one divine essence.
- **Essence (ousia)**
 - Divine unity and simplicity that grounds the three persons.
- **Relations of origin**
 - Eternal relations (begetting, procession) that distinguish persons without dividing essence.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling)**
 - The language Letham affirms to capture interpenetration and unity-in-difference among the persons.
- **Social Trinitarianism**
 - Contemporary movement emphasizing sociality of persons; Letham critiques its tendencies toward tritheism or anthropomorphism.
- **Revelation (Scriptural grounding)**
 - The economic acts in Scripture are the primary warrant for claims about the immanent Trinity.
- **Analogy and language**
 - Letham defends guarded analogical speech about God, rejecting literalistic or purely anthropomorphic analogies.
- **Doxology / Worship**
 - Trinitarian doctrine is not merely speculative but central to worship and ecclesial life; theology must serve praise.
- **Christology & Pneumatology**
 - Incarnation and Spirit's mission are the decisive economic events revealing intra-divine relations.
- **Classical categories**
 - Use of patristic terms as indispensable for doctrinal clarity and ecumenical fidelity.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the proper relation of economic and ontological Trinity.
 - As a **polemic** against both social-Trinitarian excesses and speculative immanent-Trinity isolation.
 - As an **exegetical-model** exemplar: Scripture-first trinitarian theological method.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for applying Trinitarian doctrine to worship, pastoral theology, and ecclesiology.
