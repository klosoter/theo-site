### TITLE
The Spirit and Christ in the New Testament (co-edited by I. Howard Marshall and Max Turner)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical/academic milieu marked by renewed interest in New Testament pneumatology, post‑Dunnian debate over Spirit/Christ relations, and the aftermath of charismatic renewal.
 - Aimed at bridging rigorous exegesis with systematic and historical theological reflection; positioned as both scholarly and church‑useful.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To clarify how the New Testament portrays the relation between the Spirit and Christ within redemptive history: whether the Spirit functions as distinct divine agent, as the presence/activity of the exalted Christ, or in a more complex, interpenetrating (economic) relation with Christ and the Father.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Collection of essays that move from close exegesis to theological synthesis:
 - Synoptic and Lukan materials: Spirit at Jesus' baptism, Spirit-filled ministry, Luke‑Acts pneumatology and mission.
 - Pauline corpus: "Spirit of Christ", believer indwelling, Spirit and justification, Spirit and eschatological life.
 - Johannine strand: Paraclete, mutual indwelling (I/Thou language), Spirit as witness to the Son.
 - Early church/historical theology reflections tying NT data to Trinitarian formulations.
 - The overall move reads NT texts in a redemptive‑historical frame: the Spirit is both the agent who brings about Christ's mission and the continuing agent of Christ in the church and believer.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary sources: canonical New Testament texts (especially Luke‑Acts, Paul, John).
 - Secondary interlocutors: contemporary scholars in pneumatology (e.g., James D. G. Dunn, though not necessarily polemically named in every essay), historical patristic witnesses, and systematic theologians addressing Trinitarian economy.
 - Editors' backgrounds (Marshall: New Testament exegesis; Turner: pneumatology) shape editorial emphasis on careful philology and theological integration.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology, Christology, Trinity (economic relations), soteriology (Spirit's role in justification and sanctification), eschatology (Spirit as firstfruit/new creation), ecclesiology (Spirit and mission), revelation and inspiration.

- **Closing line**
 - The collection insists that a robust New Testament theology locates the Spirit not merely as a subordinate helper but as the divine agent who both enables Christ's messianic work and continues that work in the church, thereby demanding a tightly integrated Christo‑pneumatic theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic attention to the **redemptive‑historical** trajectory: Spirit in Jesus' ministry → Spirit at resurrection/exaltation → Spirit in the church.
 - Balanced insistence on both **distinct personhood** and **conjoined action** of Spirit and Son - avoiding simplistic subordination or conflation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that pit a "Spirit‑only" account of power and experience against a strictly Christocentric soteriology by showing their mutual dependence in NT portrayal.
 - Nuances certain readings from earlier pneumatology debates (e.g., some readings of Dunn) by foregrounding motifs of **anointing**, **indwelling**, and **witness** as relational categories rather than only chronological or functional ones.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Productive use of phrases like **"Spirit‑as‑agent‑of‑Christ"** and **"Christ‑Spirit reciprocity"** to capture operative dynamics without collapsing distinctions.
 - Recasts traditional "paraclete" theology into a redemptive‑historical role: Paraclete as the ongoing presence that secures Christ's mission and presence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in academic pneumatology courses as a corrective to both over‑systematized Trinitarian models and experientialist pneumatologies.
 - Influential in evangelical circles seeking to integrate charismatic experience with orthodox Christology and in Luke‑Acts and Pauline studies that foreground the experiential and ecclesial implications of Spirit texts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined interplay between exegesis and dogmatics.
 - Remains a touchstone for teaching how NT texts shape a Christ‑centred but pneumatologically rich theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneuma / Spirit** - NT linguistic range; agent of creation, new creation, sanctification, and mission.
- **Spirit of Christ / Spirit of Jesus** - theological label emphasizing continuity between the risen Christ and Spirit's activity in believers.
- **Anointing** - motif tying Messiahship to Spirit empowerment (baptism, mission).
- **Paraclete** - Johannine term for the ongoing presence and witness‑function of the Spirit in the community.
- **Baptism in/with the Spirit** - initiation into eschatological community; debated relation to water baptism and Christ's work.
- **Indwelling / Mutual indwelling** - theological category (economic perichoresis) used to describe Christ/Spirit presence in believers without ontological conflation.
- **Spirit as agent of new creation** - eschatological function that links resurrection and Christian life.
- **Witness and Testimony** - Spirit's role in making Christ present and known (inner testimony, preaching empowerment).
- **Economy of the Trinity** - framework for reading distinct but ordered roles of Father, Son, Spirit across redemptive history.
- **Pneumatic Christology** - the conceptual space where Christological identity and Spirit activity are read as mutually constitutive.
- **Spirit and Scripture** - discussions of inspiration, proclamation, and the Spirit's role in the formation/authority of the church's witness.
- **Mission and Ecclesiology** - Spirit as catalyst for mission, charismatic gifts, and church identity.
- **Redemptive History** - hermeneutical lens prioritizing narrative movement from promise to fulfillment via Spirit and Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an **exegetical model**: close readings of key texts (Luke‑Acts, Paul, John) that integrate linguistic and theological data.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pneumatology and Christology courses: to teach interdependence of Spirit and Christ without reductionism.
 - As a **polemic resource**: to critique readings that separate charismatic experience from orthodox Christology or that marginalize the Spirit in soteriology.
