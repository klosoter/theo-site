### TITLE
De Natura Dei (1577) - Jerome (Girolamo) Zanchi

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1577 in the late Reformation / Reformed scholastic period. Zanchi a leading Italian Reformed theologian active in Strasbourg and later Zurich/Emden contexts; writes within post-Calvinian, scholastic method responding to Roman Catholic scholasticism and emerging Jesuit/Molinist objections.
 - Site usage here: single focused reference to **Divine Decrees: Election and Reprobation**.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To explicate the nature of God (attributes, simplicity, immutability) and to show how the doctrine of divine decrees-especially election and reprobation-flows coherently and justly from God's nature and sovereignty without implicating God as the author of sin.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with metaphysical-theological premises: divine simplicity, eternity, immutability, omniscience as grounds for discussing divine will and decree.
 - Distinguishes types of divine will (antecedent/efficacious, preceptive/permissive) and clarifies foreknowledge versus determining decree.
 - Argues for an **eternal decretive will**: God eternally and sovereignly ordains the ends (electing some, passing over others) and the means in a manner fitting to his wisdom.
 - Treats **election** as an unconditional gracious act grounded in God's good pleasure and not in foreseen merit; treats **reprobation** as the complementary decree, not the cause of sin but a just passing-over that permits human sin and executes just condemnation.
 - Reconciles divine sovereignty with human responsibility by appeal to God's concurrence and permission of secondary causes and to compatibilist notions of freedom.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Calvin and the Reformed tradition (Beza, Vermigli), counters scholastic Thomists and Jesuit/Molinist defenses of free will and "middle knowledge," and uses Scripture (Romans, Ephesians, John) as primary warrant.
 - Draws on Aristotelian and Thomist categories where methodologically useful but reinterprets them within a Reformed framework.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, omniscience), divine will, eternal decrees, predestination (election and reprobation), providence, freedom and moral responsibility, grace (efficacious vs. common), origin of sin (permitted vs. caused).

- **Closing line**
 - Zanchi centers a Reformed, scholastic account: God's immutable nature warrants an eternal, sovereign decree of election and reprobation, which preserves divine justice and human culpability while excluding any causal responsibility of God for sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous linking of metaphysical attributes (simplicity, eternity) to practical doctrines of decree; stress that the form of God's being determines the form of his decree.
 - Careful technical distinctions within the will (decretive vs. preceptive; permissive vs. efficacious) used to defuse apparent contradictions (e.g., how God wills all to be saved in a preceptive sense yet elects some in decretive sense).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic/Molinist accounts that ground election on foreseen faith or middle knowledge; insists on election as unconditional and rooted in God's sovereign will.
 - Pushes back against any doctrine that would make God the proximate cause of sin; emphasizes permission and secondary causality.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of scholastic distinctions (decretum absolutum/conditionale, antecedent/consequent will) within a Reformed soteriology with precision and pastoral concern.
 - Consistent use of providential concurrence language to preserve both divine sovereignty and creaturely causality.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed scholastic circles as a compact, metaphysically rigorous defense of predestination; used by later orthodoxy for clarifying the coherence of double predestination.
 - Cited in polemics against Jesuit/Molinist systems; valued in Protestant academies for its systematic clarity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact model for relating doctrine of God to soteriology; valuable for teaching the logical linkage between attributes and decrees and for training students in the technical language needed in debates over election and reprobation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **De Natura Dei** - title and project: theological inquiry into God's nature as the foundation for doctrinal claims.
- **Divine simplicity** - foundation for understanding God's will as unified and not composite; grounds the immutability of the decree.
- **Immutability / Eternity** - God's eternal decree is not temporal accommodation but a timeless ordination of ends and means.
- **Decretum aeternum (eternal decree)** - God's unchangeable, eternal decision concerning all that comes to pass, including election and reprobation.
- **Election** - unconditional, gracious decree by which God chooses some to salvation; grounded in God's good pleasure, not foreseen virtue.
- **Reprobation / Preterition** - complementary decree of passing over some; distinguished as permissive (allows sin) and judicial (condemnation), not causative of sin.
- **Foreknowledge** - understood as God's knowledge in relation to his decree, not the efficient ground of election.
- **Efficacious vs. ineffectual grace** - Zanchi distinguishes ordinary/common calls from particular efficacious grace that accomplishes salvation for the elect.
- **Permissive will / concurrence** - God permits and concurs with secondary causes; concurrence preserves human agency and culpability.
- **Preceptive vs. decretive will** - theological distinction used to reconcile divine commands (all to repent) with decretive election (only some effectually saved).
- **Compatibilist freedom** - freedom that is compatible with determinative divine causation; grounds moral responsibility in Zanchi's account.
- **Decretum absolutum / conditionale** - scholastic categories employed to analyze whether decrees are unconditional or involve ordained means.
- **Providence** - God's governance that includes ordaining, sustaining, and permitting; grounds historical outworking of decrees.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for technical distinctions in Reformed theology (decretive vs. preceptive will; election vs. preterition).
- As **polemic material** against Jesuit/Molinist accounts and Roman Catholic attempts to make foreknowledge the ground of election.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans and Ephesians through a metaphysical-theological grid linking attributes to doctrine.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed scholastic instruction: exemplifies how doctrine of God informs soteriology and moral responsibility.
