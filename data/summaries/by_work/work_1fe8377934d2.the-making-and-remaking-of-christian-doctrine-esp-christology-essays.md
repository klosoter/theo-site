### TITLE
The Making and Remaking of Christian Doctrine (eds. Sarah Coakley, David Pailin) - emphasis on Christology essays

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Anglican and ecumenical academic theology; renewed interest in doctrinal retrieval, interdisciplinary method, and integration of spirituality and systematic theology.
 - Situated amid conversations between patristic retrieval, analytic theology, feminist/constructive theology, and renewed interest in Trinitarian and Christological formulations.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Doctrine is neither static nor purely propositional: it must be understood as historically constituted, liturgically embedded, and continually remade in response to pastoral, exegetical, and philosophical challenges. Christology functions as a test-case for how doctrine is rearticulated across contexts.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Collection of essays that map how doctrines (with special focus on Christology) are made, critiqued, and reformed.
 - Major moves (typical of Coakley and congenial contributors):
 - Recover patristic and creedal resources to resist reductive modern accounts.
 - Reframe Christological questions in relational, kenotic, and ascetical registers rather than exclusively metaphysical ones.
 - Show how prayer, liturgy, and spiritual disciplines inform doctrinal knowing (doctrine as doxological practice).
 - Offer constructive proposals that bring analytic clarity to theological claims while keeping theological depth and ecclesial sensitivity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy engagement with patristic authors (Athanasius, Cyril, Augustine) and the ecumenical creeds.
 - Modern interlocutors include Karl Barth, Rahner, recent feminist theologians, and analytic theologians - the essays negotiate between historical theology and contemporary philosophical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): incarnation, personhood, kenosis, union and distinction of natures, soteriology derived from Christ's person.
 - Trinity (social and relational emphases), revelation, ecclesiology, spirituality/prayer, anthropology (human/divine relation), and doctrinal method (retrieval vs. innovation).

- **Closing line**
 - The volume reconceives Christology and doctrine as dynamic, relational, and practice-shaped: theology must be simultaneously historically faithful, spiritually formative, and philosophically disciplined.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of **spiritual practice** (prayer, asceticism) with doctrinal formation - theology as shaped by the life of prayer.
 - Emphasis on **kenosis** and relationality: the Son's self-giving and the interpersonal life of the Trinity as central lenses for rereading Christological claims.
 - Methodological pluralism: historical retrieval, analytic clarity, and constructive theological imagination are brought into productive tension.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely propositional or metaphysical accounts of doctrine that neglect liturgical and spiritual dimensions.
 - Challenges some modernist and liberationist reductions by retrieving patristic categories reframed for contemporary concerns.
 - Contrasts with strictly systematic or confessional treatments by foregrounding doctrine as ongoing practice rather than finished product.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of terms like **"prayer-as-epistemology"**, **doctrinal remaking**, and a renewed insistence on **participation** as epistemic and soteriological categories.
 - Rearticulates "social Trinity" language in service of Christological concerns without collapsing distinctiveness of persons.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among scholars interested in bridging historical theology, systematic theology, and spirituality.
 - Cited in feminist and constructive theology for its pastoral sensitivity and in analytic theology for its careful argumentation.
 - Used in postgraduate teaching on Christology, Trinitarian theology, and theological method.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for how to do doctrinal theology that is historically informed, spiritually grounded, and philosophically attentive; valuable as a methodological exemplar and substantive resource for Christological reconstruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis / Kenotic Christology** - emphasis on divine self-emptying as central to understanding incarnation and salvation.
- **Social Trinity / relational ontology** - doctrine of God read through interpersonality and mutual indwelling, applied to Christological questions.
- **Prayer-as-epistemology** - claim that disciplined prayer and ascetical practice shape doctrinal knowing and theological cognition.
- **Doctrinal retrieval** - process of reappropriating patristic and creedal resources for contemporary theological reformulation.
- **Remaking (doctrine as dynamic)** - doctrine is continually rearticulated in new contexts, not merely fixed propositions.
- **Participation (theological anthropology)** - human participation in divine life as both soteriological and epistemic category.
- **Creedal-linguistic practice** - doctrines as embedded in liturgical and confessional language that shapes communal identity.
- **Methodological pluralism** - combining historical, philosophical, and spiritual methods in theological construction.
- **Ascetic/disciplinary lens** - theological claims tested and informed by practices of formation (fasting, prayer, worship).
- **Analytic engagement** - use of conceptual clarity and argumentative rigor alongside historical and pastoral concerns.
- **Patristic retrieval** - centering patristic insights (Athanasius, Cyril) in contemporary Christological debates.
- **Relational Christology** - reading Christ's person and work through interpersonal and kenotic categories.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for contemporary, practice-informed Christology and for the claim that doctrine is remade by spiritual practice.
- As a **polemic** against reductionist metaphysical or purely propositional understandings of doctrine.
- As an **exegetical-model and methodological pivot** linking patristic retrieval, analytic clarity, and constructive theological reformulation.
