### TITLE
Jesus the Spirit Baptizer: Christology in Light of Pentecost - Frank D. Macchia

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Pentecostal scholarship (late 20th-early 21st c.), responding to perceived lacunae between classical Christology and robust Pentecostal pneumatology. Works within systematic theology that seeks to reconfigure Christological loci in light of Acts and Johannine pneumatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jesus must be understood not only as the incarnate Son and inaugurator of salvation but as the one who baptizes, sends, and bestows the Holy Spirit; therefore Christology and pneumatology are mutually interpretive and Pentecost is integral to who Jesus is.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of Gospel and Acts materials (Jesus' promise of the Spirit, the baptism of the Spirit at Pentecost, Johannine Paraclete passages) to show continuity between Jesus' saving work and the Spirit's gift.
 - Theological claim: the predicate "Spirit-baptizer" is a Christological category - Jesus' identity includes his role in the Spirit's gift and presence for the church.
 - Systematic implication: reorders loci so that pneumatology is not subsidiary but constitutive for Christology, ecclesiology, soteriology, and eschatology.
 - Practical/ecclesial implications: worship, mission, sacraments, and pastoral theology must attend to the Spirit-bestowing action of Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** canonical New Testament witnesses (Gospels, Acts, Johannine letters); engagement with classical Christological categories (e.g., Chalcedon) and contemporary theologians across Pentecostal, evangelical, and mainline traditions. Dialogues implicitly challenge Christologies that marginalize the Spirit.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Christology, Pneumatology, Trinity, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, Revelation, Eschatology.**
- **Closing line:** Pentecost is not an addendum to the story of Jesus but a decisive christological revelation: the risen, ascended Christ is the Spirit-baptizer, and any adequate account of who Jesus is must reckon with his definitive gift of the Spirit to the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats "Spirit-baptizer" as a canonical Christological predicate - explicit theological naming rather than mere pastoral rhetoric.
 - Places Pentecost as the revelatory center for discerning Christ's identity and mission.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Christologies that treat the Spirit as merely attendant or derivative; opposes Christomonies that isolate the Son from the Spirit's active gift.
 - Challenges approaches that arrange pneumatology as an appendix to Christology rather than a constitutive element.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting baptism in/with the Spirit language into a structural theological category for Christology.
 - Use of "Spirit-bestowing" and "Spirit-sending" as Christological verbs.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Significant uptake in Pentecostal and charismatic theological circles as a model for integrating pneumatology and Christology.
 - Stimulates conversation in ecumenical and evangelical theology about re-prioritizing the Spirit in canonical and dogmatic formulations; mixed reception in traditions wary of Pentecostal hermeneutics but acknowledged as a corrective on underdeveloped pneumatologies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear, teachable model for reintegrating pneumatology into core Christological formulations.
 - Rich exegetical moves make it useful as a bridge text for pastoral, biblical, and systematic courses concerned with the Spirit, mission, and ecclesial identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit-baptizer:** Christological title indicating Jesus' role in inaugurating and mediating the Spirit's gift to the church.
- **Baptism in/with the Spirit:** Sacramental/eschatological motif reframed as the concrete event that reveals Christ's identity and mission.
- **Pentecost christology:** The claim that Pentecost is constitutive for discerning who Jesus is - the event interprets the person.
- **Pneumatological Christology:** An integrated discipline treating Christology and pneumatology as reciprocally informing doctrines of person and work.
- **Sending motif (pneuma as gift):** Emphasis on economic relations - Father sends Son, Son sends Spirit - to articulate salvific ordering without subordinating persons.
- **Paraclete/Spirit promise:** Johannine terminology employed to trace continuity between Jesus' promise-language and Acts' fulfillment.
- **Ascension-session dynamic:** Theological link between exaltation of the Son and the outpouring of the Spirit; Christ's enthronement grounds Spirit-bestowal.
- **Eschatological gift:** The Spirit as the present foretaste and advance-guarantee of the consummation accomplished by Christ.
- **Mediator of the Spirit:** Christ as the one through whom the Spirit is given, sustaining a mediatorial economy that affirms both unity and distinction in the Trinity.
- **Ecclesial implications (charismatic identity):** Church defined by reception and mission of the Spirit-baptized people of God.
- **Reordering of loci:** Methodological move to put pneumatology alongside, not beneath, Christology in systematic construction.
- **Theological anthropology (Spirit-receivership):** Human participation and new-creation life framed as reception of the Spirit from Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for integrating pneumatology into Christological formulations and curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against Christologies that marginalize the Spirit and against pneumatologies that divorce the Spirit from Christ's mediatorial work.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts and Johannine texts that link Jesus' promises to Pentecostal fulfillment.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and mission studies emphasizing Spirit-gifted community.
