### TITLE
Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology And Less From Each Other - Sherry Turkle (2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in early 2010s amid rapid diffusion of smartphones, social media, and consumer robotics. Sits at the intersection of media studies, psychology, and ethics; responds to dominant techno-optimism of the 1990s-2000s.
 - Methodologically ethnographic and qualitative: interviews, participant observation, design-studio visits at MIT and Silicon Valley.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** Technology promises companionship and connection while often diminishing capacities for solitude, sustained conversation, and empathy; people increasingly turn to machines and mediated selves, thereby expecting more from technology and less from fellow humans.
 - Theological corollary: technology reshapes human sociality and moral formation, challenging doctrines of human relationality, image-bearing, and vocation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: **Robots and Companionship** - examines social robots and pet-like machines; people attribute agency and feel companionship, sometimes preferring predictable nonjudgmental machines to messy human relationships.
 - Part II: **Online Life and the Curated Self** - analyzes social media, texting, and constant connectivity; users craft safer, more polished identities and practice "continuous partial attention."
 - Part III: **Consequences for Conversation and Solitude** - argues erosion of face-to-face conversation, loss of solitude required for reflection and empathy, and rise of "pseudo-conversations."
 - Throughout: empirical vignettes support claims; Turkle juxtaposes designers' intentions with users' lived experiences.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Ethnographic subjects: children, teenagers, adults, roboticists, social media users, parents.
 - Interlocutors implicitly include techno-utopians/optimists (designers, Silicon Valley narratives) and critics in media studies and psychology.
- **Doctrines treated (implicitly)**
 - **Anthropology:** notions of selfhood (curated, project-oriented selves), formation of personhood through relations.
 - **Ethics/Moral Formation:** empathy, virtue of attention, Sabbath-like rhythms (rest, solitude).
 - **Ecclesiology / Community:** practices of mutuality, conversation, congregational life under digital pressures.
 - **Revelation & Spirituality (indirect):** mediated experience of presence and the temptation to replace embodied neighbor-love with technology-mediated substitutes.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Technology is not neutral: it is a formative moral agent that reconfigures human relationality, calling for theological attention to how mediated habits shape discipleship, community, and the image of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Ethnographic, first-person testimony gives an intimate account of how people emotionally invest in machines and mediated selves.
 - Focus on **solitude and conversation** as moral practices at risk - not merely instrumental critiques of efficiency or productivity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against techno-utopian narratives that presume digital connectivity equals flourishing; contrasts with deterministic media-theory that sees technology as merely amplifying existing tendencies.
 - Nuanced critique: not Luddite rejection but a call for reflective practices and design-conscious engagement.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - **"Alone together"** - being physically co-present yet emotionally separate because of screens and curated selves.
 - **"Evocative objects"** - devices that elicit human attachment and projective needs.
 - **"Continuous partial attention"** - fragmentary focus as a habitual mode of being.
 - **"Simulation of companionship"** - machines that mimic social cues and thereby reshape expectations for human relationships.
- **Reception and influence in theology**
 - Adopted in Christian ethical reflection on technology, pastoral theology, and spiritual formation as empirical grounding for concerns about attention, Sabbath, and community.
 - Cited by those arguing for digital asceticism, intentionally cultivated silence, and formation of conversational virtues.
- **Enduring value**
 - Empirical depth complements normative theological reflection; useful for case studies in moral theology courses and for practical theology on pastoral care, youth ministry, and congregational formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Alone together** - paradox of increased mediated connection paired with decreased interpersonal depth.
- **Evocative objects** - artifacts that invite projection, intimacy, and emotional attachment.
- **Social robots / companion robots** - machines designed to simulate relational cues; serve as tests for human expectations of relationship and moral responsibility.
- **Continuous partial attention** - habitual, fragmented attention spread over many inputs; undermines sustained conversation and contemplation.
- **Curated self / managed identity** - online self as project; selective disclosure shapes authenticity and vulnerability.
- **Simulation of companionship** - machine-generated companionship that may reduce impetus to engage real persons.
- **Solitude (as practice)** - capacity for being alone that fosters self-reflection, moral imagination, and readiness for genuine relation.
- **Conversation (as moral practice)** - dialogical engagement requiring attention, risk, and mutual recognition; contrasted with pseudo-conversation mediated by devices.
- **Empathy vs. sympathy** - Turkle highlights erosion of empathetic skills when interactions are shallow or mediated.
- **Pseudorelationships / pseudo-conversations** - superficial exchanges that mimic but do not substitute for deep relational bonds.
- **Attention economy** - cultural/economic forces that monetize distraction and fragment moral formation.
- **Authenticity** - challenged by curated identities and performance-driven digital life.
- **Attachment to devices** - habitual dependency shaping daily rhythms and vocational commitments.
- **Design ethics / human-centered design** - implicit call for design that fosters rather than fragments community.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for theological reflection on digital loneliness, attention, and mediated personhood.
- **Polemic resource** against uncritical technological adoption in pastoral and ecclesial contexts (supports arguments for Sabbath, digital fasts).
- **Conceptual pivot** in theological anthropology and ethics: provides empirical grounding for claims about formation, virtue, and communal practices.
