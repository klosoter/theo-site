### TITLE
The Reformation Study Bible - Notes on the Three Forms of Unity (Belgic Confession; Heidelberg Catechism; Canons of Dort)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid 16th to early 17th century Reformation in the Low Countries and the Palatinate; product of Reformed - Calvinist pastoral and polemical needs. The Three Forms of Unity functioned as doctrinal standards for Dutch Reformed churches and informed later Reformation Study Bible notes that explicate them for Scripture reading.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To summarize and defend a coherent Reformed theological system-Scripture as sole rule, Christ-centred covenant theology, justification by faith, and corporate election-against Roman Catholic doctrine, Anabaptism, and later Arminianism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Three complementary documents with distinct functions:
 - **Belgic Confession**: systematic statement of doctrine (God, Christ, church, sacraments, civil order).
 - **Heidelberg Catechism**: pastoral and devotional teaching in Q&A form (comfort in life and death; application of doctrine).
 - **Canons of Dort**: precise dogmatic replies to Remonstrant (Arminian) assertions, especially on predestination and perseverance.
 - Major theological moves: Scripture-centred hermeneutic; covenant of grace as interpretive key; Christ as centre of all doctrine and sacraments; delineation of orthodoxy vs. heterodoxy (marks of the true church; nature of Antichrist).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Authors and framers: Guido de Brès (Belgic), Zacharias Ursinus & Caspar Olevianus (Heidelberg), Synod of Dort delegates (Canons). Interlocutors: Roman Catholic scholasticism, Lutheran nuances, Arminian/Remonstrant theology. Scriptural loci repeatedly appealed to: 2 Thess 2:3-4 (Antichrist/man of lawlessness), 2 Peter 3:3-9 (delay of the Parousia), Hebrews 1; Luke 24; Isaiah 53 (Christ in OT and NT).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture; Trinity; Christology (incarnation, offices); justification by faith; covenant theology (covenant of works vs. covenant of grace); election and reprobation; sacraments as means and seals; ecclesiology and marks of the true church; eschatology (including Antichrist, Parousia, final judgment).
- **Closing line**
 - Christ-centred, covenantal Reformed orthodoxy: Scripture interpreted as a unified witness to Christ, guarded by doctrinal confessions and catechesis for ecclesial identity and pastoral formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong covenantal grammar: the covenant of grace organizes soteriology, sacraments, and covenantal community life.
 - Catechetical consolation: doctrine is requested and delivered as comfort for believers (Heidelberg's pastoral tone).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects Roman sacramentalism and merits-based salvation; differs from Lutheran sacramental realism by defining sacraments as signs and seals; counters Remonstrant conditionalism with Canons of Dort's detailed predestination schema.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of "marks" of the true church; frequent canonical Christological typology (OT persons/events as Christ-figures) tied to covenant fulfillment.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Normative in Dutch Reformed churches; formative influence on Presbyterian and Reformed bodies globally; central in confessional revival movements and in study Bibles that pair Scripture with concise confessional notes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, teachable doctrinal backbone; excels as a bridge between exegesis and ecclesial formation; continues to shape Reformed preaching, catechesis, and polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Belgic Confession** - systematic provincial confession outlining core Reformed doctrines.
- **Heidelberg Catechism** - pastoral Q&A emphasizing comfort in Christ and application of doctrine to life.
- **Canons of Dort** - synodal judgments on election, grace, and perseverance (response to Remonstrants).
- **Covenant of grace** - the organizing principle for soteriology, sacraments, and ecclesial life.
- **Sola Scriptura** - Scripture as the only infallible rule; confessions function as subordinate summaries.
- **Justification by faith alone** - forensic declaration centered on Christ's obedience and atonement.
- **Predestination / election** - unconditional election and reprobation as articulated against Arminian conditionalism (Canons).
- **Marks of the church** - preaching of the Word and right administration of the sacraments as identifiers of the true church.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals** - baptism and Lord's Supper as means of grace that confirm God's promises.
- **Antichrist / man of lawlessness** - eschatological and ecclesial warning; historically applied polemically to papal claims; grounded in 2 Thess 2:3-4 and 1 John 2:18 in confessional reading.
- **Delay of the Parousia** - handled pastorally: apparent delay is used to call for holy living and patient hope (2 Peter 3:3-9).
- **Christ in OT and NT** - typological reading: OT promises and types find fulfillment in Christ (Hebrews 1; Luke 24; Isaiah 53).
- **Union with Christ** - central relational doctrine tying justification, sanctification, and perseverance.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for systematic loci (soteriology, covenant, ecclesiology).
 - As **polemic** against Roman Catholic sacramentalism and later Arminianism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for typological Christ-centered reading of the OT and NT and for pastoral application (catechesis, preaching).
