### TITLE
**Trinity and Creation** - John Webster, International Journal of Systematic Theology (2005)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century systematic theology within contemporary Reformed and ecumenical debate; conversation with Barthian, Augustinian, Thomistic and recent "social" trinitarian readings.
 - Webster writes as a constructive Reformed theologian seeking to reassert classical dogmatics while addressing modern criticisms.

- **Central thesis**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity is the theological ground and lens for any coherent doctrine of creation: the world is created by the triune God and must be understood in relation to God's inner life and attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), not apart from them.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary move: insistence that talk of God's attributes cannot be abstracted from Trinitarian reality; attributes are intelligible only in relation to the Father, Son and Spirit.
 - Main move: show how classical attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) are preserved and reinterpreted in light of Trinitarian relationality so that God can be the Creator without being ontologically affected by creation.
 - **Simplicity**: divine simplicity does not collapse the distinctions of Person; relations of origin are internal to the divine being.
 - **Aseity**: God's self-existence grounds creation's contingency; creation does not supply being to God.
 - **Immutability / Impassibility**: these attributes guarantee God's faithfulness and the reliability of creation's covenantal ordering while allowing for personal, relational responsiveness within the economy.
 - Concluding move: to secure a doctrine of creation that is distinct from creaturely causation and yet personal and loving, one must affirm both the ontological Trinity and the economic relations without subordinating one to the other.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages classical sources (Augustine, Aquinas), Barthian theology, and contemporary trinitarianists (including critics from social trinitarian and process traditions).
 - Converses critically with proposals that either privatize the Trinity from creation or make creation constitutive of God's being.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (ontological and economical), creation (creator-creature distinction, creatio ex nihilo implied), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), divine agency and love.

- **Closing line**
 - Webster's theological center of gravity: authentic doctrine of creation issues from a Trinitarian ontology that secures both God's transcendence and personal, revelatory causality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes the **ontological Trinity** as determinative for all talk about creation rather than treating the Trinity as merely an economic pattern.
 - Re-frames classical attributes so they cohere with Trinitarian relationality rather than being presented as abstract metaphysical add-ons.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against social-trinitarian readings that risk making relations the primary ontological ground at the expense of simplicity.
 - Critiques process and immanent critique approaches that make God's being dependent on creation or temporal becoming.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Reads **immutability** and **impassibility** not as cold abstraction but as indicators of divine reliability and persistent covenantal faithfulness in personal relation.
 - Treats relations of origin (Father, Son, Spirit) as compatible with a robust doctrine of simplicity, avoiding both modalism and an atomistic personhood.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in contemporary Reformed and evangelical systematic theology for re-centering the Trinity in doctrine of creation.
 - Cited in debates over attributes and relational ontologies; respected by those wanting a classical but relationally sensitive trinitarianism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact corrective to theological fashions that either secularize creation or domesticate God; valuable for teaching the integration of metaphysics and biblical Trinitarianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity (ontological / economic)** - Ontological Trinity grounds being; economic Trinity grounds revelation and creative deed; Webster insists both are integral.
- **Creation (creatio)** - Act of triune God; creaturely contingency maintained alongside God's personal causality.
- **Divine Simplicity** - Affirmed; understood relationally so internal relations do not compromise unity of divine being.
 - Contrast: not equated with absence of real relations (opposed to some social-trinitarian misreadings).
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; secures creator-creature distinction and prevents creation from determining God's being.
- **Immutability** - God's faithfulness and constancy; indicates reliability of divine promises without denying personal action.
- **Impassibility** - Denial that God is passively subject to creaturely change; reinterpreted as preservative of divine freedom and loving constancy.
- **Relations of origin** - Internal personal relations (Father begets Son; Spirit proceeds) that structure divine life without fragmenting simplicity.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling** - Implicitly invoked to describe interpersonal unity without loss of personal distinction.
- **Freedom / Will** - Divine freedom is personal and creative, not arbitrary; creation flows from triune love.
- **Revelation / Economy** - The Son and Spirit are the means by which the triune Creator is disclosed and acts in creation.
- **Creator-creature distinction** - Maintained as foundational for orthodox doctrine; prevents idolatrous projection of creaturely categories onto God.
- **Theological method** - Dogmatic retrieval: classical categories reharnessed for contemporary clarity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the integration of classical attributes with Trinitarian relationality.
 - As a **polemic** against theological models (process, some social trinitarianism) that relativize divine simplicity or aseity.
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot** for readings of Scripture that connect Trinitarian revelation with creatio ex nihilo and covenantal faithfulness.
