### TITLE
**Worship in Spirit and Truth - John M. Frame**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the late 20th century within Reformed evangelical circles; responds to liturgical renewal, charismatic renewal, and continuing debates over worship practice and sacramental theology.
 - Frame writes as a Reformed systematic theologian/pastor seeking a theologically rigorous yet pastoral guide to corporate worship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - True Christian worship must be both governed by biblical truth and energized by the Holy Spirit: worship is regulated by Scripture and constituted by Spirit-wrought encounter with Christ, principally through Word and sacraments.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: widespread disordered worship - either empty ritualism or unchecked emotionalism/charismatic excess.
 - Positive thesis: the proper shape of worship is the interplay of Word, sacrament, prayer, and Spirit - the Spirit makes Christ present through appointed means.
 - Practical application: liturgical order, preaching, sacraments as means of grace, discipline, and pastoral guidelines for charismatic gifts.
 - Pastoral prescriptions on fencing the table, admission to the Lord's Supper, and corporate prayer.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary appeal to Scripture; engages Reformation authorities (Calvin, Westminster standards), 19th-20th-century Reformed writers, and the contemporary charismatic movement.
 - Dialogues implicitly with both Roman Catholic sacramentalism and revivalist/Pentecostal practices.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Word (sermon as central instrument)
 - Sacramentology (baptism and Lord's Supper as signs and seals; means of grace)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit's role in enabling true worship and in sustaining gifts)
 - Christology (Christ present in worship by the Spirit)
 - Ecclesiology and covenant (visible church, discipline, fencing)
 - Worship theology (principles for order and freedom)

- **Closing line**
 - Worship must be God-centered and biblical in form, Spirit-enabled in effect, and chiefly mediated by Word and sacraments as the God-appointed means of encountering Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced regulative-pneumatic model**
 - Insists on biblical regulation of worship while refusing a purely formal or mechanical view; gives robust place to the Spirit in making worship efficacious.
- **Sacraments as Spirit-mediated means of grace**
 - Affirms a "real spiritual presence" of Christ in the Lord's Supper via the Spirit - neither purely memorial nor corporeal presence.
- **Pastoral insistence on order and discipline**
 - Strong defense of fencing the table and admission standards rooted in covenantal ecclesiology and pastoral care.
- **Measured engagement with charismatic phenomena**
 - Critical but sympathetic: allows continuation of charismatic gifts but insists on discernment, biblical test, and liturgical order.
- **Correction to both predecessors**
 - Against ritualism: rescues worship from empty ceremony by re-centering Word and Spirit.
 - Against charismatic excess: reins in spontaneity where it violates Scripture or ecclesial order.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and Presbyterian contexts as a practical-theological manual; influential for pastors seeking a conservative but pastoral worship theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating sacramentology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology; useful in training, worship design, and polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regulative Principle**
 - Worship practices must have clear biblical warrant; Frame nuances this with a strong pneumatological dimension.
- **Means of Grace**
 - Preaching, sacraments, and prayer as God-appointed instruments whereby the Spirit applies redemption.
- **Word and Sacrament**
 - Primary loci of Christ's presence and the congregation's encounter with God.
- **Spiritual Presence**
 - Christ is truly present at the Lord's Supper by the Holy Spirit; presence is real yet non-physical.
- **Fencing the Table**
 - Admission to communion should be restricted by baptismal and covenantal criteria plus pastoral discipline.
- **Continuationism (qualified)**
 - Accepts ongoing charismatic gifts but requires biblical testing and orderly practice.
- **Order and Freedom**
 - Dual principle: liturgical/formal order protects truth; pastoral freedom allows Spirit-led expression within biblical bounds.
- **Covenantal Ecclesiology**
 - Emphasizes visible church membership, sacraments as covenant signs/seals, and corporate responsibility.
- **Preaching as Means of Grace**
 - Homiletic proclamation is sacramental in effect - primary vehicle of Word-mediated encounter.
- **Baptism as Sign and Seal**
 - Entrance into covenant community; grounds for Christian identity and communion participation.
- **Discernment and Discipline**
 - Gifts and worship expressions require ecclesial oversight and doctrinal conformity.
- **Worship as Encounter**
 - Combines objective truth with subjective (Spirit-wrought) appropriation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for Reformed worship theology and sacrament practice.
 - As a polemic resource aimed both at ritualistic liturgies and at unchecked charismatic worship.
 - As an exegetical-practical model for Lord's Supper presence, fencing, and the role of preaching as means of grace.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking pneumatology to sacramentology and ecclesiology in pastoral worship planning.
