### TITLE
Contributions by Peter A. Lillback to Reformed Forum and Westminster Theological Seminary symposia on Open Theism - focus on **Open Theism and Divine Condescension**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th-early 21st century Reformed response to the resurgence of Open Theism; contributions placed within symposia hosted by Reformed Forum and Westminster Theological Seminary as part of confessional Reformed institutions' engagement with contemporary analytic and pastoral debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Open Theism is judged to mischaracterize divine knowledge, providence, and condescension; Lillback argues that preserving classical Reformed doctrines of omniscience, immutability, and covenantal sovereignty is essential to biblical faithfulness and the doctrine of God.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnoses Open Theism as arising from an overreaction to deterministic readings of providence and a desire to protect human freedom and theodicy.
 - Reasserts classical theistic attributes: God's exhaustive foreknowledge, eternal presentness (God is not temporally successive), and unchanging will.
 - Defends divine condescension as a genuine accommodation that does not imply temporality or ignorance in God; biblical anthropomorphisms are rhetorical, not metaphysical indicators of divine limitation.
 - Shows pastoral and covenantal stakes: undermining divine certitude threatens trust in promises, prayer, and Christ's finished work.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Contemporary proponents of Open Theism (e.g., Clark Pinnock, Gregory Boyd, John Sanders) as primary interlocutors.
 - Classical and Reformed authorities (Scripture, Augustine, Calvin, Westminster standards) used to ground counter-claims.
 - Philosophical resources: treatments of time, omniscience, and modal logic invoked to rebut open-theist claims.
- **Doctrines treated:** attributes of God (omniscience, immutability, simplicity), providence and sovereignty, divine condescension/accommodation, revelation and anthropomorphic language, covenant theology, implications for prayer and pastoral assurance; secondary attention to Christology insofar as divine immutability and condescension intersect Christ's person and work.
- **Closing line:** The contributions insist that faithful Reformed theology must maintain a robust classical theism-especially divine omniscience and condescension-because only then do Scripture, covenantal promise, and pastoral trust coherently cohere.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on **divine condescension** as the key category for reading anthropomorphic and temporal language in Scripture without surrendering divine immutability.
 - Articulation of pastoral consequences (prayer, assurance) as primary validators of doctrinal correctness, not merely abstract metaphysics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Open Theism by distinguishing between God's relational responsiveness (biblical dialogue and covenantal give-and-take) and metaphysical contingency or ignorance.
 - Contrasts with more philosophical defenses (e.g., Molinism) by rooting critique in confessional and scriptural tradition rather than only analytic modalities.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes a calibrated use of "condescension" - not as mere condescension to imagery, but as ontologically consistent divine accommodation that preserves perfection.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Resonated in confessional Reformed and evangelical circles as a compact, pastorally-oriented rebuttal to Open Theism.
 - Cited in seminary classrooms and polemical literature; less persuasive to committed open-theists but influential in shaping denominational responses and curricular treatments.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to combine theological tradition, biblical exegesis, and pastoral concerns in doctrinal critique.
 - Serves as a concise exemplar for teaching on divine attributes, especially in courses on theology proper, providence, and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism:** theological position asserting that God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free acts; the future is partly open.
- **Divine Condescension:** God's accommodating self-revelation to finite creatures; Lillback emphasizes this as preserving divine immutability while explaining anthropomorphic biblical language.
- **Omniscience:** divine exhaustive knowledge of all truths; defended against open-theist restrictions.
- **Immutability:** God's unchanging nature; used to argue that God cannot be ontologically ignorant or subject to temporal becoming.
- **Providence:** God's governance of the world; central to the critique-Open Theism is said to weaken providential certainty and covenantal promises.
- **Accommodation (biblical):** rhetorical/relational adjustments in revelation; distinguished from actual limitations in God's knowledge or being.
- **Anthropomorphism:** human language applied to God; treated as pedagogical, not metaphysical proof of divine temporality.
- **Covenantal Faithfulness:** the assurance that God will fulfill covenant promises; used to show practical dangers of denying divine exhaustive foreknowledge.
- **Divine Temporality / Eternity:** debate over God's relation to time; Lillback favors classical eternal present understanding against temporally dynamic depictions.
- **Prayer and Assurance:** pastoral loci showing the effects of theological positions; used as tests for doctrinal coherence.
- **Classical Theism:** theological framework affirming simplicity, immutability, and omniscience; presented as the orthodox baseline.
- **Scripture-centered Apologetic:** employing exegetical work to ground theological claims rather than relying solely on philosophical models.
- **Polemical Use:** frequently used to rebut Open Theism in denominational and academic debates.
- **Exegetical Model:** supplies a reading strategy for anthropomorphic passages that preserves divine attributes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and concise summary of Reformed objections to Open Theism.
- As a **polemic** in denominational and seminary debates to defend classical theism and covenantal assurance.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading anthropomorphism and divine condescension without capitulating to temporalism.
