### TITLE
**John M. Frame, The Doctrine of God** (2002). Volume 2 in the Theology of Lordship series. Reformed, presuppositional, Scripture-driven account of theology proper in covenantal and triperspectival terms.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 2000s evangelical-Reformed milieu; intense debates on **Open Theism**, inerrancy, and divine timelessness/impassibility.
 - Continuation of Frame's Van Tilian project (after The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God), anticipating later volumes on ethics and Scripture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - God is **Lord**, and the doctrine of God should be organized by the Lord's covenantal **control, authority, and presence**; theological method should be **triperspectival** (normative, situational, existential) and rigorously biblical.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scripture first: the **names of God** and God's self-identification as Lord set the agenda.
 - **Lordship attributes**: unifies the divine perfections under control-authority-presence.
 - **Trinity**: each person fully God, mutually indwelling; lordship fully trinitarian.
 - **Decree, providence, and sovereignty**: exhaustive divine control with compatibilist freedom.
 - **Knowledge and language**: analogical, covenantal, personal; critique of speculative metaphysics detached from exegesis.
 - **Time and change**: God sovereign over time; affirms immutability and impassibility rightly defined while acknowledging rich biblical depictions of divine relationality.
 - **Rivals engaged**: rejects Process and Open Theism; evaluates Thomist simplicity and timelessness; critiques Molinist middle knowledge.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture; Reformed orthodoxy (Calvin, Turretin, Bavinck), Augustine, Aquinas.
 - Van Til and presuppositional apologetics; interaction with Barth and modern theologies (Process, Open Theism: Pinnock, Sanders, Boyd).
 - Philosophical engagement with possible worlds, freedom, necessity (Plantinga et al., critically).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**, **attributes**, **Trinity**, **decree/providence**, **creation**, **foreknowledge and freedom**, **impassibility/immutability/simplicity**, **worship and prayer** (as expressions of covenant presence).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: the **Triune Lord** personally present in covenant, exercising sovereign control and normative authority, known analogically through his self-attesting Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Lordship triad** (control-authority-presence) as organizing principle for attributes.
 - **Triperspectivalism**: normative (Word), situational (world), existential (self) perspectives coinhering.
 - **Covenantal personalism**: God's perfections interpreted via his covenant relations, not abstract essence-speculation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Affirms classical doctrines yet **qualifies simplicity, immutability, impassibility** to avoid rendering God inert or impersonal.
 - Rejects **libertarian freedom**, **Molinism**, **Process**, and **Open Theism**; argues for compatibilism and exhaustive divine foreordination.
 - Cautions against **autonomous natural theology**; receives theistic arguments when subordinated to biblical norms.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Lordship attributes**, **covenant presence**, **perspectival knowledge**, and the mapping of attributes to the triad.
 - Frequent stress on **analogical** language and Scripture's priority over metaphysical system-building.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and churches; a go-to contemporary text on theology proper.
 - Praised for biblical integration and pastoral clarity; critiqued by some classical theists for qualified simplicity/impassibility and for allowing a temporal aspect to God's relation to history.
- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically powerful framework that connects theology proper to ethics, apologetics, and pastoral ministry.
 - Robust polemical resource against Open Theism while maintaining a warmly personal doctrine of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lordship**: Covenant headship of God over his people and all creation; frames authority, control, presence.
- **Control-Authority-Presence**:
 - Control: sovereignty, omnipotence, decree, providence.
 - Authority: lordship through Word, normativity, inerrancy.
 - Presence: omnipresence as relational, covenantal nearness.
- **Triperspectivalism**:
 - Normative (God's Word), situational (world/history), existential (self/heart) perspectives coinhere.
- **Covenant**: The structured relation of the Lord with his people; key to reading attributes and acts.
- **Analogical language**: True, creaturely, non-univocal speech about God guided by Scripture.
- **Simplicity (qualified)**: God is not composed, yet attributes are meaningfully distinguishable in revelation without implying parts.
- **Immutability/Impassibility (reframed)**: God is faithful, unchangeable in being and purpose; not subject to involuntary passions, yet truly loves and responds covenantally.
- **Aseity**: God's self-existence and independence; grounds sovereignty and grace.
- **Providence and Decree**: Exhaustive ordination of all events; meticulous sovereignty compatible with human responsibility.
- **Foreknowledge and Compatibilism**: God's exhaustive knowledge and control with human willing defined by strongest desire under God's decree.
- **Middle Knowledge (critiqued)**: Rejected as compromising divine independence and biblical providence.
- **Covenant Presence**: Explication of omnipresence as redemptive nearness, climaxing in Christ and the Spirit.
- **Creator-creature distinction**: Foundational boundary for epistemology and worship.
- **Perichoresis**: Mutual indwelling of the divine persons; undergirds trinitarian unity without modalism.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source** for attributes, decree, and trinitarian terms with a biblical-covenantal orientation.
 - **Polemic reference** against Open Theism, Process, and Molinism; for compatibilist freedom.
 - **Methodological template** (triperspectival) linking bibliology, ethics, and theology proper.
 - **Exegetical-conceptual pivot**: reading doctrines through Scripture's lordship and covenant themes.
