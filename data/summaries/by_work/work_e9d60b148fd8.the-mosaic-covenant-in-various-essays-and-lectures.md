### TITLE
The Mosaic Covenant (essays and lectures) - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton biblical-theological milieu; Vos as a formative figure in Reformed redemptive-historical theology. Works emerge in lectures and essays clarifying covenant relationships within Scripture against contemporaneous debates in Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Mosaic covenant is juridically a covenant of works **"as to substance"** (it binds by law and demands obedience) while remaining within the economy of redemptive history connected to the covenant of grace. Vos seeks to settle whether the Mosaic is properly salvific grace, purely legal, or a mixed form.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define the covenant of works and covenant of grace historically and biblically.
 - Exegete Old Testament texts (Torah formulations of law, blessings/curses, covenant ratifications) to show the Mosaic administration contains a works-demand structure.
 - Distinguish **substance** (demand/merit structure) from **administration** (the Mosaic role within redemptive history).
 - Argue continuity: Mosaic law functions as tutor/discipline toward Christ, exposing sin and preparing the elect, without overturning Abrahamic promises.
 - Draw doctrinal consequences for soteriology, typology, and the relation between law and gospel.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed confessional language (Westminster/Heidelberg formulations) and contemporary Princeton/Dutch Reformed scholars. Dialogues implicitly with those denying a works-character to Mosaic law and with advocates of a sharp break between law and promise.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (structure and typology), law and gospel, revelation, soteriology (merit vs. imputation), Christology (mediatorial fulfillment), typology/antitype, ecclesiology in practical implication.
- **Closing line**
 - Vos centers the Mosaic covenant as a juridical, pedagogical administration that preserves a works-demand in substance while remaining subordinate and preparatory to the covenant of grace centered in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The clear and disciplined **substance vs. administration** distinction: Mosaic covenant has a works-structure in substance but must be read within redemptive history as an administration that points to Christ.
 - Emphasis on the Mosaic law as *pedagogical* - not merely punitive but formative and typological.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects simple either/or positions: neither a pure covenant of grace nor a wholly antithetical legal system; he resists treating Mosaic as a rupture with Abrahamic promise.
 - Counters readings that collapse moral, civil, and ceremonial law into a single category without recognizing their differing functions relative to covenant substance.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of redemptive-historical method applied to covenant typology: law as a temporary covenantal administration with Christ as the eschatological fulfillment.
 - Terminological precision in speaking of "covenant of works as to substance" - a phrase that clarifies mixed character without confusion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential within Princeton and later Reformed scholarship; shaped 20th-century treatments of law/grace relations and typological exegesis.
 - Adopted and debated by subsequent covenant theologians; used to refine confessional readings of Westminster and related standards.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a tightly argued model for reading Mosaic law within the canon: useful for preaching, systematic theology, and confessional defense where nuance between law and gospel is required.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic covenant**
 - The covenant constituted at Sinai, comprising statutes, ordinances, ratification ceremonies, blessings and cursings.
- **Covenant of works (as to substance)**
 - The idea that the Mosaic dispensation contains a legal demand and merit structure akin to the Adamic covenant - not identical in administration, but similar in juridical substance.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - The ongoing promise-centered economy culminating in Christ; Vos insists Mosaic administration does not annul this covenant.
- **Substance vs. administration**
 - Key analytic distinction: what the covenant requires (substance) vs. how God arranged and applied it historically (administration).
- **Law (moral, civil, ceremonial)**
 - Treated as differentiated functions: moral reflects eternal norms; civil orders national life; ceremonial types Christ and cultic realities.
- **Tutor / pedagogue**
 - Pauline category Vos applies: law serves to convict, instruct, and point to Christ.
- **Blessings and cursings (sanctions)**
 - The forensic mechanism demonstrating the works-structure: obedience = blessing; disobedience = curse.
- **Typology / antitype**
 - Rituals and institutions under Moses foreshadow Christ's person and work; their fulfillment is eschatological and soteriological.
- **Works principle**
 - The theological problem of merit and legal obligation contrasted with justification by faith.
- **Confessional formulations of covenant**
 - Vos uses and refines confessional language (e.g., Westminster) to show continuity between confessions and his redemptive-historical reading.
- **Redemptive-historical exegesis**
 - Methodological posture: canonical, diachronic reading that locates Mosaic law within the story of redemption.
- **Mediator / mediatorial role**
 - Christ as the goal and fulfillment of both law and promise; Mosaic institutions anticipate his mediatorial work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the phrase "covenant of works as to substance" in discussions of Mosaic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against readings that either absolutize Mosaic law as purely salvific or deny any works-structure.
 - As an **exegetical model** for redemptive-historical readings of Torah texts and typology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in confessional debates about the relation of law/grace and the continuity between Old and New Covenants.
