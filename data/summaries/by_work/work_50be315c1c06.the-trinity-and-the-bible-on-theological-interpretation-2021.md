### TITLE
**Scott R. Swain, The Trinity and the Bible: On Theological Interpretation** (2021)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-2000 retrieval of classical theism within evangelical and Reformed theology; engagement with Theological Interpretation of Scripture (TIS); conversation partners include patristic, medieval, and Reformed orthodox sources as refracted through recent figures like John Webster and Kevin Vanhoozer.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How the Bible, as triune discourse, normatively yields and governs trinitarian doctrine, and how trinitarian dogmatics in turn disciplines biblical interpretation without eclipsing the literal sense.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Nature and task of theology:** Theology is a science ordered to wisdom, undertaken by the church under God, receiving its object from revelation and its end in doxology; Scripture is the triune God s communicative act that grounds theological knowing.
 - **Theological method (principia):** Retrieval of principium essendi (the triune God) and principium cognoscendi (Holy Scripture), with the Spirit as internal principle enabling right judgment; dogmatics specifies rules for reading (e.g., inseparable operations, appropriations).
 - **Rahner s Rule and Barth s reformulation:** Affirms the truth-bearing identity between the economic and immanent Trinity while resisting a collapse of processions into history; the divine missions reveal, not constitute, the eternal processions; Barth s reformulation is appreciated for christological focus but corrected by classical taxis and simplicity.
 - **Biblical reasoning and canon:** Exegesis proceeds by following the canonical form and divine names, reading missions as the scriptural presentation of processions, and employing the rule of faith to coordinate parts and whole.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Turretin, Owen, Bavinck; modern dialogue with Barth and Rahner; conversation with Childs, Vanhoozer, Webster; use of patristic exegesis as heuristic rather than proof-text.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; divine simplicity and attributes; processions and missions; inseparable operations and appropriations; Trinity and Christology; pneumatology; canon and ecclesial reading.
- **Closing line:** The triune God speaks in Scripture so that the church may know, worship, and confess Him; trinitarian dogmatics and biblical exegesis belong together as mutually clarifying acts of faithful hearing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Scripture as **divine triune discourse** with authorial unity and canonical form determining interpretation.
 - The **missions/processions** grammar as the primary bridge from Bible to Trinity.
 - **Inseparable operations with ordered taxis** as a hermeneutical rule, not a speculative add-on.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - To some TIS strategies: resists aesthetic or ecclesial readings that bypass dogmatic grammar and literal sense.
 - To **Rahner s Rule** misuses: secures the rule by classical doctrines of simplicity and eternal relations to avoid historicist collapse.
 - To **Barth s reformulation:** receives his insistence on revelation s identity with God while qualifying it with classical distinctions of persons and relations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Biblical reasoning** as a disciplined, canonically governed mode of dogmatic exegesis.
 - Reformed-scholastic **principia** retrieval to ground theology as science under revelation and Spirit.
 - **Triune authorship** and **canonical discourse** as organizing ideas for Scripture doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:** Read within Reformed and wider evangelical circles as a constructive manual for trinitarian exegesis; complements Websterian accounts of theology s sanctification; a touchstone in courses on Trinity, Scripture, and method.
- **Enduring value:** A crisp grammar for moving from text to Trinity; a stable account of theology s nature; a reliable corrective to both proof-texting and speculative projection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immanent vs. Economic Trinity:** Eternal life of God in Himself versus God s works in history; identity in truth, distinction in mode of presentation.
- **Rahner s Rule (qualified):** The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa; secured by simplicity and processions so that missions reveal rather than constitute God.
 - **Barth s reformulation:** God is who He is in His act of revelation; affirmed in principle, bounded by classical taxis to avoid modal flattening.
- **Processions and Missions:** Eternal begetting and spiration; temporal sending of Son and Spirit that manifest these relations in history.
- **Inseparable Operations (opera ad extra indivisa):** All external works are common to the Godhead; read with personal **taxis** and **appropriations** to honor distinct hypostases.
- **Appropriation:** Attributing common works fittingly to one person according to personal property (e.g., wisdom to the Son) as an exegetical aid.
- **Divine Simplicity:** God is not composed; underwrites the unity of operations and the reliability of revelation.
- **Taxis (order):** The order of persons, from the Father through the Son in the Spirit, regulating how we read Scripture s divine actions.
- **Biblical Reasoning:** Canonically constrained, rule-governed movement from text to doctrine and back, under the church s confession.
- **Principia of Theology:** Principium essendi (God) and principium cognoscendi (Scripture), with the Spirit as internal principle; frames theology as a **science** receiving its first truths from revelation.
- **Rule of Faith:** Ecclesial summary that guides interpretation toward the triune sense of Scripture.
- **Triune Authorship:** One divine author speaking through human authors; grounds unity-in-diversity of the canon.
- **Canonical Discourse:** The final form of Scripture as the normative site of God s communicative action.
- **Analogy and Divine Names:** Analogical predication safeguards truth about God while denying creaturely modes.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for theology s nature and principia.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for deploying Rahner s Rule with classical grammar.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading missions/processions and inseparable operations across Scripture.
