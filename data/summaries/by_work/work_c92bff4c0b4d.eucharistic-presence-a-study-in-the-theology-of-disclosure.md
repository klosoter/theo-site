### TITLE
Eucharistic Presence: A Study in the Theology of Disclosure - Robert Sokolowski

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Catholic theology; Sokolowski writes as a phenomenologically informed philosopher-theologian aiming to bring analytic clarity to sacramental doctrine in the wake of Vatican II, renewed liturgical debate, and ongoing dialogue with Protestant critiques (notably Barthian reticence about analogia entis).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Eucharist should be understood as a *disclosure* of Christ's personal presence rather than reducible either to mere sign/symbol or to an opaque metaphysical formula. Sokolowski seeks a robust account of real presence that preserves both the reality of divine-human distinction and the immediate encounter the sacrament effects.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes phenomenological resources: the notion of *disclosure* (how things show themselves) as appropriate to theological description of sacramental manifestation.
 - Analyses classical metaphysical categories (substance, accident, causality) and shows their limits for capturing sacramental presence when treated in abstraction.
 - Argues for a *personalist realism*: Eucharistic signs genuinely disclose the personal presence of Christ; presence is neither merely symbolic nor merely propositional.
 - Defends a mediated realism that preserves difference between Creator and creature while allowing true participation - hence a place for *analogia entis* understood carefully.
 - Contrasts his model with rivals (strict memorialism, nominalist reductions, and some Barthian rejections of analogia entis).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** St. Thomas Aquinas and Scholastic sacramental formulations (e.g., transubstantiation), Husserlian phenomenology (method of description), Barth (as critical interlocutor via analogia fidei), Rahner and modern Catholic sacramentalists, conciliar liturgical theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sacramentology, revelation, Eucharistic Christology, ecclesiology (the Church as locus of sacramental encounter), epistemology (how God is known in signs), underlying metaphysics (analogy of being).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The Eucharist is a genuine, personal disclosure of the risen Christ whose reality requires a disciplined realism that holds Creator/creature distinction while affirming that the sacraments make divine presence accessible in a mediated, sacramental way.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Centers *disclosure* (not mere symbol or bare ontology) as the primary explanatory category for Eucharistic presence.
 - Emphasizes *personal presence* - the Eucharist reveals Christ the person, not merely an abstract divine being or set of effects.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on reductive memorialism and purely symbolic readings (e.g., some Reformed and liberal trends).
 - Critiques Barthian priority of *analogia fidei* when it leads to denying any positive analogy between God and creature; insists such denial undermines the possibility of genuine sacramental revelation.
 - Refines Thomistic language by subjecting metaphysical terms to phenomenological scrutiny so as not to reify categories divorced from lived ecclesial encounter.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Deploys the technical notion of *disclosure* consistently as theological method and doctrine: the sacrament is an event of showing, not only a change of underlying substance.
 - Adopts a *phenomenological realism* that affirms the givenness of sacramental presence.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in contemporary Catholic sacramental and liturgical theology as a rigorous alternative to both scholasticism and symbolicism.
 - Influences ecumenical discussions by offering a language intelligible to both metaphysical realists and phenomenologically minded theologians.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies conceptual confusions surrounding "presence" and helps students navigate between metaphysical jargon and lived liturgical phenomenon.
 - Serves as a bridge text for courses on sacramentology, philosophical theology, and ecumenical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Disclosure:** The primary category - how Christ shows himself in the Eucharist; emphasizes event and manifestation.
- **Presence:** Personal, immediate presence as opposed to mere signification or symbolic representation.
- **Real Presence:** Affirmed, but reinterpreted in terms of disclosure and personal encounter rather than only scholastic metaphysical specification.
- **Phenomenological Realism:** Methodological stance: descriptions of how presence is given in experience while insisting on objective reality.
- **Analogia Entis:** Permitted and used carefully - supports a positive (though analogical) relation between creaturely being and divine being enabling sacramental disclosure.
 - Contrasted with ...
- **Analogia Fidei:** Represented as Barthian corrective when necessary, but Sokolowski warns that exclusive priority of this principle can render sacramental discourse unintelligible.
- **Transubstantiation:** Recognized as a valid theological formula historically, but explicated via disclosure rather than reduction to metaphysical schemata.
- **Sacramental Sign:** A genuine mediator that discloses the person of Christ; not a mere pointer or external symbol.
- **Personal Presence:** Emphasis that what is disclosed is the person of Christ, not an impersonal property or effect.
- **Manifestation / Showing:** Verbal variants of disclosure used to describe the event-character of the Eucharist.
- **Ontology vs. Epistemology (in sacrament):** Sokolowski stresses their interaction: how Christ is present (ontological claim) and how he is known in the sacrament (epistemic disclosure).
- **Eucharistic Event:** The liturgical act as the occasion of disclosure, situated in ecclesial communal context.
- **Mediation:** The role of material signs and priestly action as authentic channels of revelation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "presence" that balances realism and phenomenology.
- As a **polemic resource** against both symbolic/memorialist accounts and anti-analogical (strict Barthian) denials of analogia entis.
- As an **exegetical-conceptual model** in sacramental theology courses to link liturgical practice with philosophical description.
