### TITLE
Christology and Symbolism (essays and lectures) - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century Protestant theology; Tillich's work moves between German Protestant liberalism, existentialist philosophy, and neo-orthodox reaction. These essays/lectures articulate Christological concerns during the period in which Tillich developed his Systematic Theology and the method of correlation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Rearticulate classical Christological affirmations (Incarnation, Sonship, hypostatic union, Chalcedonian language, union with Christ) within a symbolic-existential framework so that they speak meaningfully to modern existential estrangement and the question of ultimate meaning.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Theology must mediate between human existential questions and the Christian disclosure of ultimate reality; Christology is the central disclosure.
 - Symbols (not mere signs) participate in the reality to which they point; classical Christological terms function as symbolic languages that disclose the event of God's presence in Jesus.
 - Traditional metaphysical formulations (substance-language, ontic categories) are reinterpreted: the Incarnation is not a static metaphysical composite but the event of God's presence in a historical person that abolishes estrangement and creates the New Being.
 - Doctrinal formulations (Chalcedon, Sonship, hypostatic union) must be rescued from literalist metaphysics and rearticulated existentially so they retain theological power.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Chalcedonian and patristic formulations (Athanasius, Augustine), Reformers (Luther, Calvin), moderns and contemporaries (Kierkegaard, Hegel, Bultmann, Barth), and philosophical sources (existentialism, phenomenology, ontology).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Trinity, Incarnation, hypostatic union, two natures doctrine, eternal Sonship, salvation as union with Christ (the New Being), eschatology insofar as it affects present existential transformation.
- **Closing line:** Tillich centers Christology as the existential-symbolic disclosure of the New Being - the event in which the Ground of Being unites with human existence thereby overcoming estrangement and granting participation in ultimate reality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Theology as "method of correlation": correlate existential questions with the Christian answer; Christology is interpretive disclosure, not only metaphysical description.
 - Symbols as participatory realities: Christological terms are efficacious languages that open humans to the divine reality rather than mere propositional assertions.
 - Salvation framed ontologically as "New Being" and participation, not merely juridical/forensic.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against metaphysical literalism: Tillich critiques readings of Chalcedon and hypostatic union that fix Christology in static substance metaphysics.
 - Against reductive demythologizing (e.g., Bultmann): he defends the necessity of symbolic language while insisting on their existential import.
 - In partial dialogue with Barth: appreciates Barth's Christocentrism but emphasizes existential correlation and philosophical ontology (Ground of Being) where Barth resisted metaphysical categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting "Hypostatic Union" as the event of uniting ground-of-being with historical existence (personhood as existential participation).
 - Emphasizing "New Being" as the central soteriological concept that redefines union with Christ.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential in liberal and mainline Protestant theology, shaping pastoral and existential readings of Christ.
 - Cautiously received in some Reformed and conservative circles for perceived de-emphasis of metaphysical particulars (e.g., concerns about weakening classical ontological claims like eternal Sonship).
 - Fertile interlocutor for theologians seeking to synthesize modern philosophy and traditional dogma.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Offers a robust model for reinterpreting classical dogma so that it speaks to modern existential concerns without abandoning creedal continuity; indispensable for courses on modern Christology, theology and culture, and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Symbol:** Language that participates in and opens up the reality it names; not reducible to signification. Central to Tillich's method.
- **Method of Correlation:** Theological method pairing existential questions with Christian answers; Christology is the primary correlate.
- **Ground of Being (Being-itself):** God described existentially/ontologically; the source that becomes present in the Incarnation.
- **New Being:** Salvation as ontological transformation - participation in the renewed mode of existence effected by Christ.
- **Incarnation:** The event in which the Ground of Being becomes present in the historical person of Jesus; emphasized as existentially transformative rather than metaphysical agglomeration.
- **Hypostatic Union (reinterpreted):** Unity of God's presence and the historical person as an existential event; resists substance-metaphysics while preserving unity/distinction language.
- **Chalcedonian Definition & Two Natures Doctrine:** Treated as symbolic formulations that must be translated into existential-ontological vocabulary to retain relevance; Chalcedon's distinctions preserved as expressive, not as rigid metaphysical schemata.
- **Eternal Sonship:** Reinterpreted relationally and existentially; Tillich resists crude temporal or ontic readings and emphasizes the Son as the eternal relational manifestation of the Ground of Being.
- **Union with Christ:** Participation in the New Being; existential incorporation rather than purely forensic imputation.
- **Person / Personhood:** Understood dynamically as event/participation, not merely substance; personhood is the existential mode in which being participates.
- **Participation:** Key soteriological vocabulary: humans enter into the divine life through Christ's presence; theological alternative to purely juridical or purely metaphysical accounts.
- **Existential estrangement:** Anthropological diagnosis motivating the need for Christological disclosure.
- **Correlation vocabulary (question/answer):** Tool for relating modern existential categories and classical doctrines.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for symbolic and existential readings of Chalcedon, hypostatic union, and Incarnation.
 - As a polemic against literalist metaphysics and reductive demythologizing, useful in methodological debates.
 - As an exegetical-model resource for preaching and pastoral theology that aims to make Christology existentially relevant.
 - As a conceptual pivot in systematic theology courses to bridge classical dogma and modern philosophical concerns.
