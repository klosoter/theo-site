### TITLE
Declaration of Sentiments (1608) - Jacobus Arminius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 17th-century Dutch Reformation (1608), amid rising dispute between the followers of Arminius and strict Calvinists (notably Franciscus Gomarus).
 - Written as a measured public statement of Arminius's positions shortly before his death; anticipatory of the Remonstrant controversy (Remonstrance, 1610) and the Synod of Dort (1618-19).
 - Theological milieu: Reformed scholasticism negotiating predestination, grace, human inability, and forensic imputation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To define the nature and consequences of **original sin** and the manner in which Adam's sin relates to the guilt and corruption of his descendants - while preserving divine justice and human moral responsibility.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines original sin primarily as a hereditary corruption transmitted by natural generation that renders human nature morally disabled and liable to divine judgment.
 - Distinguishes between different dimensions of sin:
 - **Corruption** (inclination/concupiscence, inability to do saving good),
 - **Guilt** (the legal liability to punishment).
 - Argues that condemnation of humanity flows from both the corruption received by nature and the juridical reckoning (imputation) connected to Adam's headship - but insists this does not obliterate personal culpability for actual sins.
 - Maintains God's righteousness in condemnation and in the provision of Christ's satisfaction and grace.
 - Affirms that the remedy for original sin lies in Christ's work and in grace, preserving both the need for divine initiative and the real moral accountability of persons.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Calvinist orthodox of Leyden (Gomarus), Augustinian tradition; scriptural exegesis especially Romans 5 and Pauline anthropology.
 - Uses Reformed theological categories (federal headship, imputation) but with critical qualifications.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Original sin** (nature, transmission, effects)
 - **Imputation** (of Adam's sin; juridical aspects)
 - **Providence, Grace, Predestination** (contextualized)
 - **Soteriology** (necessity of Christ's atonement; forensic justification)
 - Human freedom and responsibility in relation to depravity.

- **Closing line**
 - Arminius's Declaration insists that human nature is truly corrupted and justly liable to condemnation, yet frames imputation and salvation so as to protect human moral responsibility and the justice of divine grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful analytic separation of *inherited corruption* from *forensic guilt*; avoids collapsing moral impotence into the sole ground of condemnation.
 - Insistence that imputation is a juridical reckoning compatible with genuine moral responsibility - not an arbitrary metaphysical transfer that negates personal agency.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushback against a rigidly deterministic reading of Calvinist predestination and any account that makes Adam's liability the only ground of each person's condemnation.
 - More nuance than some contemporary Reformed writers on how original sin operates physiologically, legally, and morally.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise triadic schema: corruption, inability, liability - used to clarify pastoral and polemical claims.
 - Emphasis on forensic categories (condemnation, imputation, satisfaction) while preserving empirical accounts of inherited depravity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Served as a key source for the later Remonstrant formulations and for the debate leading to the Synod of Dort; read as conciliatory by some, heterodox by others.
 - Influenced later Arminian exegesis of Romans 5 and pastoral treatments of original sin and guilt.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of method: careful exegetical-theological balancing of Scripture, juridical categories, and pastoral sensibility.
 - Useful for teaching the interplay of federal theology, original sin, and human responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - hereditary corruption transmitted in human nature; the root cause of moral inability.
- **Corruption** - the contaminating inclination (concupiscence) that distorts human will and affections.
- **Natural inability** - incapacity to perform saving righteousness by unassisted nature; not absolute annihilation of freedom.
- **Guilt (culpa)** - juridical liability to divine judgment that accompanies the corrupt nature.
- **Imputation** - forensic reckoning by which Adam's headship grounds universal liability; Arminius qualifies its scope so personal moral responsibility remains intact.
 - Contrast: Imputation of Adam's sin versus imputation of Christ's righteousness in justification.
- **Federal headship (caput)** - the representative union of Adam with his posterity used to account for how Adam's act bears upon descendants.
- **Forensic / juridical language** - emphasis on condemnation, justification, reckoning, and satisfaction as legal categories.
- **Prevenient / enabling grace (incipient in Arminius)** - divine initiative that does not coerce but restores moral responsiveness (more explicit in later Remonstrant formulations).
- **Condemnation (damnatio)** - the deserved sentence arising from corruption and imputed liability.
- **Satisfaction / atonement** - Christ's work as the remedy that addresses both guilt and alienation.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the Arminian nuance on original sin and imputation (clarifies terms and distinctions).
 - As a **polemic** against deterministic emphases in contemporaneous Calvinism and as apologetic for preserving human responsibility.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5 that balances corporate federal language with individual culpability.
