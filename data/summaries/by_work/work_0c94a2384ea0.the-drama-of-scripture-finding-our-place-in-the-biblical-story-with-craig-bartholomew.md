### TITLE
The Drama of Scripture: Finding Our Place in the Biblical Story (Michael W. Goheen; with Craig Bartholomew)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the early 21st century (2004) amid an evangelical/Reformed interest in canonical and narrative readings of Scripture, renewed emphases on mission (Missio Dei), and debates over faith's role in culture and vocation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture is a single, coherent drama (a five-act biblical metanarrative) in which God calls and sends a people to participate in his kingdom work; Christians discover identity and calling only by locating themselves within that story.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Prologue: **Creation** - God establishes good rule; human vocation is stewardship and dominion.
 - Act I: **The Fall** - Human rebellion distorts vocation and culture.
 - Act II: **Israel** - God forms a covenant people to mediate blessing and restore creation.
 - Act III: **Jesus** - Christ fulfills the story: inaugurates kingdom, inaugurates new covenant.
 - Act IV: **Church** - The church is the sent community, an embodied sign/agent of God's rule in culture.
 - Epilogue: **New Creation** - Eschatological consummation where mission and vocation find final fulfillment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Canonical biblical witness as primary source; dialog with narrative theology, Bultmannian/critical historiography implicitly, and contemporary figures like N. T. Wright, Walter Brueggemann, Lesslie Newbigin; rooted in Reformed covenantal concerns and mission theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, providence, sin, covenant, Christology (fulfillment), soteriology (mission-shaped salvation), ecclesiology (church as agent), eschatology, vocation/dominion, and the theology of mission (Missio Dei).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The Bible is an integrated drama in which God restores creation through a covenant people sent into the world; Christian identity and cultural vocation are defined by participation in that divine story.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uses a **dramatic five-act framework** as a hermeneutical and pedagogical device to unify Scripture and orient Christian life.
 - Stresses **vocation** as communal, story-shaped participation in God's rule rather than merely private piety or individual calling.
 - Locates **culture and dominion** within the divine mission: cultural work is theological and redemptive when ordered to God's kingdom purposes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Counters both pietistic privatization (faith as inward only) and secular/gnostic bifurcation (spiritual vs. cultural spheres).
 - Pushes back against triumphalist "kingdom-now" readings by retaining an eschatological future (new creation) while affirming present responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rehabilitation of the **cultural (dominion) mandate** within a missional covenantal framework-vocational work becomes means of witness and stewardship.
 - Popularization of canonical narrative reading for congregational formation and mission strategy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and broader evangelical seminaries and churches for teaching biblical theology, mission, and vocation.
 - Influential in missional church movements and curricula that aim to integrate doctrine, ethics, and cultural engagement.
 - Critiques: some scholars note simplification of canonical diversity and limited engagement with critical-historical complexities and socio-political implications of dominion language.
- **Enduring value:** A clear, teachable framework that reconnects doctrine, mission, and everyday vocation-useful for preaching, discipleship, and contextual theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Drama of Scripture:** The Bible conceived as a unified, unfolding story with acts that orient Christian identity and practice.
- **Five-act structure:** Prologue (Creation), Act I (Fall), Act II (Israel), Act III (Jesus), Act IV (Church), Epilogue (New Creation) - pedagogical scaffold for theology and mission.
- **Vocation:** The ordinary callings of life (work, family, civic life) reinterpreted as participation in God's redeeming rule.
- **Dominion / Cultural Mandate:** The mandate from Genesis repositioned as stewardship and creative engagement under God's lordship, now reoriented by Christ's redemption.
- **Missio Dei (Mission of God):** God's initiative sending the covenant people into the world; mission is constitutive of church identity.
- **Covenant people:** Israel and the church as chosen communities shaped to mediate God's blessing and rule.
- **Kingdom of God:** The motif that frames history and vocation-already inaugurated in Christ, not yet consummated.
- **Narrative hermeneutic:** Reading Scripture as canonical story to derive identity, ethics, and mission, rather than isolated proof-texting.
- **New Creation / Eschatology:** The telos that gives final shape to vocation and cultural engagement; hope that limits present power claims.
- **Church as sent community:** Ecclesiology that emphasizes witness, sacramentality, and cultural presence in service of God's mission.
- **Common grace:** Implicit theological resource to justify cultural engagement and shared goods in a fallen world.
- **Fulfillment (Christology):** Jesus as the hinge who fulfills creation, covenant promises, and vocation.
- **Story-shaped discipleship:** Formation model where Scripture's drama forms ethics, worship, and practice.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for integrating vocation and the cultural mandate into Reformed theological curricula.
 - As a **hermeneutical/exegetical model** for preaching and biblical theology that emphasizes canonical unity.
 - As a **pedagogical tool** in mission formation and congregational discipleship to connect doctrine and daily life.
 - As a **polemic** against privatized faith and a corrective to overly individualistic or purely spiritualized conceptions of Christian calling.
