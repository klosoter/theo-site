### TITLE
A New Testament Biblical Theology (sections on Adam) - Gregory K. Beale

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Redeemed Reformed milieu; part of Beale's larger canonical, intertextual approach to NT theology that reads NT use of the OT as theological argument.
 - Engages historical-critical scholarship while arguing for continuity between OT canonical patterns and NT fulfillment in Christ.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The figure of **Adam** functions in the New Testament as the archetypal human, covenantal head, and typological foil whose vocation, failure, and consequences are fulfilled and reversed in Christ - the **New Adam** - with implications for Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and cosmic renewal.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Trace NT citations and allusions to Adam (esp. Paul: Romans 5; 1 Cor 15; Luke and Hebrews motifs; Johannine echoes) and reconstruct the chain of OT meanings (Genesis 1-3, Eden, creation mandate, image-bearing).
 - Identify recurring theological motifs tied to Adam:
 - **Headship/federal representation** (Adam as corporate head whose act affects the many).
 - **Typology/recapitulation** (Christ as the true, obedient representative who reverses Adamic failure).
 - **Cosmic/temple orientation** (Adam's role as cultic/kingly steward of Eden interpreted as proto-temple function; Christ as inaugurated true temple and rest).
 - **Life/death and judgment/justification dualities** (Paulic contrast: death through Adam, life through Christ).
 - Read Paul's Adam-Christ parallels as canonical exegesis that reinterprets Genesis within the redemptive-historical arc.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interacts with Paul's pneumatology and soteriology; dialogues with classic Reformed federal theologians and modern scholars (e.g., G. F. Hawthorne, James Dunn, N. T. Wright), but emphasizes canonical/typological readings over strictly forensic or existential readings.
 - Uses LXX patterns, Second Temple echoes, and NT rhetorical contexts to reconstruct meaning.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (Christ as New Adam; recapitulation).
 - **Soteriology** (sin, substitution, imputation; life/death in Adam/Christ).
 - **Covenant theology** (creation-covenant background, Adam as covenant head).
 - **Ecclesiology and eschatology** (church as community of the New Adam; inaugurated new creation).
 - **Anthropology** (image of God, vocation of humanity).
 - **Temple theology** (Eden as prototype temple, Adam as priest/king).

- **Closing line**
 - Beale's treatment centers on **Adam as canonical archetype whose failed stewardship is the hinge of redemptive history, reversed and fulfilled in Christ the true, final Adam who restores creation and humanity's vocational image-bearing**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **canonical intertextuality**: NT authors read Genesis typologically and the figure of Adam must be understood in the light of both Edenic/temple motifs and Paul's theological patterns.
 - Emphasizes **cosmic/temple dimensions** of Adam's role more than many treatments that focus narrowly on federal headship or individual guilt.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that treat Adam chiefly as a moral exemplar or only as a biological ancestor; argues for corporate, typological, and cultic categories.
 - Differs from purely forensic imputation models by combining forensic language with covenantal/representative and recapitulation frameworks.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of **"Adam as archetypal temple-head"** language and more systematic linking of Eden/temple/Sabbath motifs to Adamic vocation.
 - Canonical chains: reading Adam not in isolation but as node within OT-NT typological networks.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical scholarship as a robust exegetical model for Paul's Adam-Christ typology.
 - Influential for preachers and theologians seeking to integrate creation, covenant, and Christology; some critical interlocutors question over-typologizing or canonical leaps.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a cohesive model connecting **Genesis, Pauline theology, temple imagery, and eschatological renewal**; valuable for teaching Christ's cosmic lordship and for theological constructions that aim to integrate creation and redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam (archetype)** - First human as representative head whose act establishes corporate consequences.
- **New Adam / Last Adam** - Christ as the obedient counterpart who reverses Adam's effects (central Pauline motif).
- **Federal headship / representative solidarity** - Adam's agency implicates the many; key to understanding imputation.
- **Typology / recapitulation** - Redemptive-historical pattern where Christ sums up and corrects Adam's role.
- **Cosmic temple / Eden-as-temple** - Eden recast as proto-temple; Adam as priest-king steward.
- **Creation covenant / Adamic mandate** - The original covenantal vocation to rule and keep creation that Adam failed to uphold.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - Human vocation and status expressed in covenantal stewardship; renewed in Christ.
- **Life/death motif** - Death introduced through Adam; life imparted through Christ (Rom 5; 1 Cor 15 schema).
- **Canonical intertextuality** - Method: tracing OT texts and themes as they are reworked in NT authors' theology.
- **Eschatological renewal** - Adam/Christ contrast tied to inaugurated and consummated new creation.
- **Sabbath motif / rest** - Linked to Adam's original rest and Christ's fulfillment as true rest and temple.
- **Pauline parallels (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15)** - Beale highlights structural and theological contrasts Paul exploits.
- **Corporate sin / corporate salvation** - Communal dimensions of sin and salvation anchored in headship.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for Adam as covenantal/typological archetype in systematic and biblical theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Pauline Adam-Christ texts within canonical and temple motifs.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in integrating creation theology with Christology and eschatology in Reformed and evangelical curricula.
 - As a **polemic resource** against readings that isolate Adam from cultic, covenantal, or canonical frameworks.
