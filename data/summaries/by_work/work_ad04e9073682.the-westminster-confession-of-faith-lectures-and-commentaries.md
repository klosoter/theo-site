### TITLE
**B.B. Warfield - Lectures and Commentaries on the Westminster Confession of Faith**

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Princeton; Warfield writing as defender of confessional Reformed orthodoxy amid rising historical-critical scholarship and theological liberalism.
 - Context: renewed Anglo‑American interest in Westminster Standards as theological and ecclesiastical norm for Presbyterianism; reaction to modernist revisions and to Roman Catholic claims.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Confession is a faithful, Scripture‑rooted systematic formulation of Reformed doctrine; its articulations - especially Christ's offices (munus triplex) - must be exegetically defended against reductionist readings from both liberalism and Romanism.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical defense of key Confessional loci by appeal to Scripture, patristic precedent, and Reformed scholastic precision.
 - Affirmation of Christ's two natures and mediatorial work as the hinge of the Confession.
 - Detailed exposition of Christ's threefold office - Prophet, Priest, King - showing unity in person but distinctness in function.
 - Integration of office‑theory into covenant theology, soteriology (active/passive obedience), ecclesiology, and sacramental practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: the Westminster divines (17th c.), Reformed scholastic authors (e.g., Turretin), Princeton theologians (Hodge), and contemporary critics - biblical higher critics and theological liberals.
 - Methodological resources: Scripture, Westminster texts, Puritan commentaries, systematic theology tradition.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; Christology (two natures, obedience); Munus triplex (prophet, priest, king); covenant theology (covenant of works/ grace); soteriology (justification, sanctification); sacraments; church and polity; decree/predestination.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield frames the Westminster Confession as the faithful, exegetically grounded articulation of Reformed orthodoxy in which the threefold mediatorial office of Christ organizes doctrine and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the Confession's theological precision combined with rigorous biblical exegesis; neither mere historical artifact nor blind creedalism.
 - Emphasizes the unity of Christ's person while maintaining functional distinctions of the munus triplex.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrective to liberal readings that strip the Confession of supernatural claims or reduce Christ to ethical exemplar.
 - Polemic against Roman Catholic sacramental/priestly claims by reiterating Christ's once-for-all priesthood and Reformed sacramental theology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of Reformed scholastic categories (e.g., active/passive obedience) in clarifying Confessional statements for modern controversies.
 - Uses the munus triplex as an organizing rubric for systematic linkages: revelation (prophet) grounds Scripture and preaching; atonement/intercession (priest) grounds soteriology; rule/kingdom (king) grounds ecclesiology and eschatology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles; used to defend confessional subscription and to shape Princeton‑style systematic theology.
 - Cited by later confessionalists and neo‑Calvinist scholars as a model of marrying historical fidelity with contemporary apologetic needs.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies how to read confessions as theological tools: historically situated, exegetically responsible, pastorally and polemically fruitful.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith** - Warfield treats it as subordinate standard: authoritative for doctrine but normative only as a faithful exposition of Scripture.
- **Munus Triplex (Prophet, Priest, King)** - Central organizing motif for Christology and the Confession's practical theology.
 - **Prophet**: Christ as revealer and fulfillment of prophecy; foundation for preaching and Scripture.
 - **Priest**: Christ's mediatorial atonement, once-for-all sacrifice and intercession; refutation of sacerdotalism.
 - **King**: Christ's sovereign rule over church and conscience; basis for ecclesial authority and eschatological hope.
- **Subordinate Standards** - Confessions as secondary rules; Warfield insists on fidelity to Scripture as ultimate criterion.
- **Active and Passive Obedience** - Christ's full obedience (active) and suffering/death (passive) as necessary to justification.
- **Covenant Theology** - Framework connecting Christ's offices to covenant of works/grace; continuity of God's saving purpose.
- **Mediatorial Office** - Warfield's term for the concrete work of Christ in history as mediated by his threefold office.
- **Sacraments** - Means of grace rightly administered under the kingly office; sacramental efficacy denied as sacerdotal merit.
- **Ecclesiology/Polity** - Confessional prescriptions for church order derived from Christ's kingly rule.
- **Reformation and Scholastic Sources** - Warfield's method: combine Puritan/Westminster exegesis with scholastic precision.
- **Scriptural Exegesis** - Primary locus of doctrinal validation; Warfield repeatedly points to Scripture as the norm.
- **Polemic against Liberalism** - Defense of supernatural revelation and substitutionary atonement.
- **Pastoral Application** - Uses munus triplex to inform preaching, pastoral care, and the sacraments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed Christology and the threefold office in systematic theology.
- As **polemic** against modernist and Roman Catholic distortions of office, sacrament, and authority.
- As an **exegetical model** linking confessional formulations to Scripture and historical theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for deriving ecclesial practice (preaching, sacraments, governance) from Christ's mediatorial offices.
