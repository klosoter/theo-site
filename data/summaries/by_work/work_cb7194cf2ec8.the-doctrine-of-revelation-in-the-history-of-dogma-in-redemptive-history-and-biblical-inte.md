### TITLE
The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of Dogma (essay in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation) - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton/Reformed milieu; Vos (1862-1949) writing from a confessional Reformed perspective while engaging modern German historicism and liberal theology.
 - Part of Vos's broader project to ground biblical theology in redemptive history and to retrieve the historical development of doctrine without surrendering Scriptural normativity.
 - Site usage: two topical references engaged here - **Canon And Tradition**; **Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God**.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Revelation must be understood primarily as God's historical, covenantal self-disclosure (an event) that yields knowledge of God only as it is objectively given and subjectively appropriated; the history of dogma records manners of reception, distortion, and development of that revelation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern and medieval tendencies either to subjectivize revelation (romantic/experiential models) or to rationalize it (scholastic/rationalist systems).
 - Positive proposal:
 - Revelation is an objective historical act centered in Christ and recorded in Scripture.
 - Doctrine is the historical articulation and systematization of that act; dogmatic development is legitimate insofar as it remains faithful to the revelatory event.
 - The canon and ecclesial tradition are instruments for preserving and interpreting revelation, but they are subordinate to the revelatory norm (see Canon And Tradition).
 - Methodological move: integrate historical study of dogma with redemptive-historical exegesis to judge developments by their fidelity to the saving acts.
 - Epistemological claim: knowledge of God arises from mediated, covenantal revelation that requires both the external Word and the Spirit's internal witness (see Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with Augustine, medieval Scholastics, the Reformers (notably Calvin), Schleiermacher and the 19th-century liberal theologians, and contemporary dogmaticians.
 - Uses patristic and medieval exemplars to show both correct and deviant receptions of revelation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (nature, act vs. content), Scripture (canon, authority), tradition (reception, role), doctrine/dogma (development and fidelity), knowledge of God (epistemology), covenant theology as the context for revelation.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Revelation is essentially God's historical self-disclosure in redemptive acts; dogma is serviceable when it faithfully interprets and secures that event for the church, resisting both privatizing subjectivism and abstract rationalization.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on revelation as *historical act* (not merely a set of propositions nor a subjective religious feeling).
 - Integration of biblical-theological (redemptive-history) method with the history of doctrine: dogma is judged by its fidelity to salvific events.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Polemic against Schleiermacherian subjectivism that makes revelation a function of religious consciousness.
 - Correction of scholastic tendencies that abstract revelation into purely speculative metaphysical systems divorced from covenant-historical content.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Use of redemptive-history as the hermeneutical key for reading doctrinal development.
 - Clear distinction between the act of revelation (event) and the organic growth of its doctrinal expression.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential within Reformed biblical theology and the Vosian school; foundational for later redemptive-historical hermeneutics and for evangelical appeals to historical-continuous revelation.
 - Provided a corrective to both liberal and neo-scholastic tendencies in 20th-century dogmatics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a disciplined way to mediate between Scripture, tradition, and historical-critical scholarship.
 - Serves teachers and students as a model for evaluating doctrinal development by reference to Scripture's covenant-historical center.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (act/event)** - God's concrete self-disclosure in history (central Vosian category).
- **Revelation (content/Word)** - The propositional and narrative content that issues from the revelatory act and is codified in Scripture.
- **Redemptive History** - The unfolding sequence of salvific acts that constitute the concrete content of revelation.
- **Canon** - The corpus of Scripture as the normative record of revelation; instrument of judgment over tradition (see Canon And Tradition).
- **Tradition** - Ecclesial reception and interpretation of revelation; valuable but subordinate and evaluable by Scripture.
- **Dogma / Doctrinal Development** - Historical formulations and systematizations that must be tested against revelatory events.
- **Objective vs. Subjective Revelation** - Distinction between revelation as external historic act and its internal appropriation by faith (ties to Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God).
- **Inspiration / Authority** - Scripture's divine origin and normative authority as the faithful witness to the revelatory act.
- **Covenant** - The relational framework that governs how God reveals and how people know Him.
- **Illumination / Witness of the Spirit** - The necessary internal appropriation enabling knowledge of God from revealed Word.
- **Historical-Critical Method (cautious use)** - Historical tools are useful for tracing dogmatic development but must be subordinated to theological criteria.
- **Dogmatic Fidelity** - The norm: whether a doctrinal form faithfully conveys the saving act.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for revelation conceived as a historical event and for redemptive-historical hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic resource** against subjectivist and rationalist accounts of revelation and for guarding the relation of canon and tradition.
 - As an **exegetical-model** guide for reading Scripture and doctrinal history in continuity with covenantal acts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in linking epistemology (knowledge of God) with covenantal, historical self-disclosure.
