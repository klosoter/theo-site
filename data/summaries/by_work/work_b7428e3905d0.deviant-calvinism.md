### TITLE
Deviant Calvinism - Oliver D. Crisp

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century engagement between confessional Reformed theology and the resurgence of popular Calvinist evangelicalism (often labeled "New Calvinism").
 - Situated within analytic theology methods: precise conceptual analysis, philosophical theology, and careful engagement with historical Reformed sources.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary Calvinism contains recognizable strands that depart from historically coherent Reformed commitments; these "deviances" are traceable to certain philosophical presuppositions, methodological shortcuts, and pastoral pressures. The task is diagnostic (identify the deviations), critical (show their problems), and constructive (propose corrective formulations that remain faithful to classical Reformed orthodoxy).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Map and classify current Calvinist variants that he judges problematic (theology that is inconsistent with confessional Reformed commitments or that produces theological and pastoral harms).
 - Identify recurring error types: analytic confusions (e.g., sloppy talk about God's freedom), misplaced emphases (e.g., pietistic or performance-driven assurance), and reductionist readings of atonement and election.
 - Provide philosophical-theological critique: show how certain claims conflict with Trinitarian theology, classical theism, or biblical exegesis.
 - Reconstructive proposals across loci: recalibrate talk about divine sovereignty, human agency, predestination, atonement, and assurance so they cohere with confessional and Trinitarian commitments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Historical interlocutors: Augustine, Calvin, the Reformed scholastics, and classical orthodox authors.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: leading popular and academic Calvinists (broadly conceived), analytic theologians, and pastoral practitioners whose formulations exemplify the deviations.
 - Philosophical interlocutors: analytic metaphysics and philosophy of religion resources used to sharpen theological vocabulary.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of God (sovereignty, freedom, simplicity), Trinity, Christology, soteriology (election, atonement), providence, covenant theology, assurance, and pastoral implications.
- **Closing line**
 - The work aims to defend a disciplined, confessional Calvinism: preserving divine sovereignty while correcting philosophical and pastoral distortions so that doctrine remains Trinitarian, exegetically responsible, and pastorally sound.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Brings analytic-theological precision to debates usually mediated by popular piety and rhetorical pastoralism.
 - Strong insistence that Christology and Trinitarian commitments must shape any corrective project within Reformed theology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques forms of hyper-Calvinism and deterministic rhetoric that undermine evangelism, assurance, or a coherent doctrine of God.
 - Pushes back against popularized Calvinist formulations that trade theological nuance for memorable slogans.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Treats "deviant" as a technical category: not merely heterodoxy but systematic departures traceable to identifiable methodological and philosophical moves.
 - Applies analytic distinctions (e.g., freedom vs. determinism, compatibilism vs. libertarianism) to classic Reformed loci.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Taken seriously in academic and confessional Reformed circles as a clarifying corrective; used in seminaries and among theologians debating the limits of acceptable Calvinist formulations.
 - Provoked pushback in popular evangelical Calvinist networks where rhetorical simplicity and pastoral immediacy are prioritized.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for integrating historical fidelity, philosophical rigor, and pastoral sensitivity in contemporary doctrinal revision and critique.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Deviant Calvinism**
 - The label for strands of Calvinist thought judged to be doctrinally or methodologically off-track from historic Reformed norms.
- **New Calvinism**
 - Popular 21st-century resurgence of Calvinist piety and rhetoric; often the primary sociological target of the critique.
- **Hyper-Calvinism**
 - Overemphasis on divine determinism that has negative pastoral and missional consequences; contrasted with responsible confessional Calvinism.
- **Classical Theism**
 - The theological framework (simplicity, immutability, aseity) used to test and correct certain modern Calvinist formulations.
- **Divine Sovereignty (recalibrated)**
 - Maintained as central but reframed to avoid deterministic caricatures and to protect human responsibility and evangelistic practice.
- **Compatibilism vs. Libertarian Freedom**
 - Philosophical distinction employed to clarify claims about human agency under divine providence; used diagnostically to expose incoherence in some Calvinist assertions.
- **Penal Substitution / Atonement**
 - Treated carefully: defended where orthodox, critiqued where reduced to transactional metaphors that distort Christology.
- **Covenant Theology**
 - Re-examined as a structuring principle for ecclesial and soteriological claims; deviations often manifest as weakened covenantal logic.
- **Assurance**
 - Examined theologically and pastorally; deviations often produce either impossible certainty or debilitating doubt.
- **Analytic Theology**
 - Methodological commitment: clear concepts, argumentation, and engagement with philosophical tools.
- **Trinitarian Christology**
 - Held central to prevent Christological flattening in soteriological formulations.
- **Theological ethnography (implicit)**
 - Attention to how popular culture and pastoral practice shape theological formulations deemed "deviant."

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for mapping boundaries within contemporary Calvinist discourse.
- As a **polemic and corrective** against hyper-deterministic or pastorally harmful formulations.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** demonstrating how analytic theology can serve confessional recovery and systematic reconstruction.
