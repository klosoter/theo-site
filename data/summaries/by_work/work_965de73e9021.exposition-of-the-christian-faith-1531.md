### TITLE
**Exposition of the Christian Faith (1531)** 
Author: Huldrych Zwingli

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the high Reformation (1531) within the Swiss Reformation milieu centered at Zurich. Responds to Roman Catholic sacramental theology and to divergent Protestant positions (notably Luther).
 - Pastoral and polemical: intended as a concise public confession and pastoral exposition for Zurich church life.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian faith must be articulated so that Scripture governs doctrine and worship; sacraments are visible signs instituted by Christ that testify to gospel truths and seal promises, but do not convey grace automatically apart from faith.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural hermeneutic first: exegesis of Gospel and Pauline texts to determine sacramental meaning.
 - Christological and covenantal framing: sacraments interpreted as signs of the covenant between Christ and believers.
 - Polemic move: rejects transubstantiation and Luther's corporeal ubiquity; offers a symbolic/spiritual presence account and stringent pastoral rules for sacramental administration.
 - Pastoral application: ecclesial discipline for admission and fencing of the Lord's Supper; criteria for baptism and its recipients.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Explicitly argues against Roman Catholic scholastic sacramentalism (transubstantiation, ex opere operato) and interprets against Luther's Real Presence insistence (Marburg disputes background).
 - Uses Scripture, patristic citations selectively, and Reformation-era exegesis (Swiss colleagues exemplified by Bucer in practice).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture-principle, Trinity, Christology (incarnation, ascension, session), justification by faith, covenant, ecclesiology, baptism, Lord's Supper, pastoral discipline.

- **Closing line**
 - Zwingli centers the work on the conviction that Word and sacrament function as communicative signs and seals: they point to and confirm Christ's promises, requiring faith and ecclesial order to mediate their promised blessing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sacraments primarily as *signum* and *testamentum* - visible proclamations of gospel promises rather than instrumental impartations of grace in themselves.
 - Strong covenantal language: infant baptism is defended as covenant sign for children of believers; efficacy is covenantally oriented and dependent on faith.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects medieval sacramental metaphysics by rejecting substance-change theories; contrasts with Luther by denying Christ's bodily ubiquity in the elements and by insisting on a spiritual presence apprehended by faith.
 - Critiques Anabaptist rejection of infant baptism while also criticizing any view that makes baptism automatically salvific.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Develops the language of sacraments as the "visible word" - the sign performs proclamation rather than confers grace ex opere operato.
 - Distinctive pastoral categories: "fencing the table" (disciplinary admission rules) articulated systematically.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in forming Swiss Reformed sacramental theology and had direct impact on later Reformed confessions (via emphasis on sign/seal and ecclesial discipline).
 - Provoked continued controversy with Lutheranism; Marburg colloquy and subsequent debates sharpened confessional lines.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear polemical outline against medieval and Lutheran positions; enduring resource for studies in sacramental theology, covenantal hermeneutics, and pastoral administration of the sacraments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament / Sacramentum** - visible sign and pledge of the gospel promise; not a change in substance but a seal of grace.
- **Visible Word** - the notion that the sacrament is the word made visible; a communicative act that confirms and proclaims.
- **Sign and Seal** - classic Zwinglian pair: sign = testimony; seal = ratification of God's promise to believers.
- **Infant Baptism** - defended as covenant sign for children of believing parents; inclusion in covenant community contrasted with believer-only baptismists.
 - Efficacy: not automatic regeneration; its saving effect is tied to covenant promise and subsequent faith.
- **Believer's Baptism** - acknowledged as appropriate for those who come in personal faith; contrasted with Anabaptist polemics.
- **Lord's Supper: Spiritual Presence** - Christ is present in a real, spiritual manner, apprehended by faith; denies corporeal presence in the elements.
- **Fencing the Table (Admission)** - ecclesiastical discipline governing who may partake; a pastoral safeguard tied to repentance and right belief.
- **Ex opere operato** - rejected: sacraments do not work by mere performance; efficacy presupposes faith and the Spirit's work.
- **Covenant** - framework for understanding sacramental inclusion (children) and corporate identity of the church.
- **Instrumental Means of Grace** - sacraments function instrumentally (as signs that the Spirit uses) but are not autonomous channels independent of faith.
- **Word-Sacrament Unity** - emphasis that sacraments always accompany and are subordinate to proclamation of the Word.
- **Testimony** - sacrament as witness to Christ's work rather than conferring a sacramental metamorphosis.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental categories (sign, seal, visible word).
 - As a **polemic** against Catholic transubstantiation and Lutheran corporeal ubiquity; model for confessional divergence.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and Gospel sacramental texts in covenantal terms.
 - As a **pastoral template** for church discipline concerning baptismal admission and Lord's Supper fencing.
