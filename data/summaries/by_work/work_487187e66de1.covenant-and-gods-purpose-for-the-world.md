### TITLE
Covenant and God's Purpose for the World - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical biblical-theological work (early 21st century). Schreiner writes as a conservative New Testament scholar engaging canonical and covenantal readings of Scripture within the Reformed tradition.
 - Aimed at pastors, students, and scholars wanting a single-framework account of Scripture's storyline centered on covenant and God's global purpose.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture presents a single, unfolding covenantal purpose of God to bless the nations that is progressively revealed in redemptive history and fulfilled in Christ; understanding this unity is essential for correct Christology, ecclesiology, mission, and eschatology.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of biblical history as successive covenant administrations (creation/Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, new covenant in Christ).
 - Argues for substantial continuity between covenants: they are administrations/episodes of one covenantal purpose (often tied to classic Reformed "covenant of grace" structure), while also noting real typological and functional distinctions.
 - Christ is the center: he is the promised seed/son/king who fulfills and consummates the covenantal promises, inaugurates the new covenant, and mediates salvation.
 - Concludes with implications for the church, Israel, mission to the nations, and eschatological consummation under Christ's kingship.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformed covenant theologians (broadly Vosian and modern Reformed interpreters) and engages contemporary biblical theologians and critics.
 - Positions itself against dispensational fragmentation of covenants and against readings that obliterate the distinction between Israel and the church; interacts with scholars who emphasize either radical continuity or sharp discontinuity (implicit conversation with writers like N. T. Wright, dispensationalists, and progressive covenant theologians).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (single covenant / covenant of grace), covenant of works, election, promise-fulfillment, Christology (mediator, fulfillment), soteriology (atonement as covenantal), ecclesiology (people of God), mission, law and Gospel relations, eschatology, and Trinitarian agency across covenants.

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner locates the theological center of gravity in a Christocentric, covenantal reading of Scripture: God's one purpose to bless the nations is progressively revealed through covenant administrations and accomplished definitively in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Emphasis on unity plus nuance**
 - Strong commitment to a single redemptive-covenantal purpose while carefully distinguishing administrations (types, promises, forms) so as to avoid either collapsing Israel into the church or treating covenants as unrelated compartments.

- **Christ-centered canonical trajectory**
 - Sees every major covenant promise as pointing forward to Christ; typology and promise-fulfillment are primary hermeneutical keys.

- **Balanced corrective to rivals**
 - Polemical corrective to dispensational fragmentations (insistence on continuity) and to some supersessionist tendencies (retains distinction between Israel and church in function and promise without denying ultimate unity in Christ).

- **Methodological clarity**
 - Combines exegetical attention to texts with theological synthesis; less speculative than some classic systematic treatments and more canonical than many topical treatments.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a concise, readable introduction to covenantal biblical theology; used in seminary courses and pastoral training as an accessible synthesis of covenant theology and biblical theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear pedagogical bridge between detailed exegetical work and systematic covenantal theology; useful for clarifying how covenants function as the backbone of biblical redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (single unfolding purpose)** - central organizing category; covenants are administrations of God's one saving plan.
- **Covenant of grace** - the theological lens for continuity of salvation-history promises fulfilled in Christ.
- **Covenant of works** - used to frame Adam's original calling and the ground for need of redemptive covenant.
- **Promise-fulfillment** - hermeneutical principle: OT promises find their telos in Christ and the new covenant.
- **Typology** - persons/events (e.g., Adam, David, Moses) are types that point to Christ's decisive fulfillment.
- **Mediator/Christ as covenant head** - Jesus as the one who enacts and consummates covenant promises.
- **People of God (Israel/church relation)** - continuity of covenant people with acknowledged distinction in role and administration until fulfillment in Christ.
- **Mission to the nations** - covenantal purpose extends to Gentile inclusion; mission derived from covenantal promises.
- **Law and Gospel** - law as covenantal stipulation and pointer to need; gospel as fulfillment in Christ.
- **Eschatology/Kingdom consummation** - covenants culminate in Christ's sovereign reign and the restoration of creation.
- **Election** - covenantal undergirding of divine choice within the unfolding plan.
- **Administration/dispensation (as episodes)** - covenants as successive administrations of the one purpose, not unrelated dispensations.
- **Canonical reading** - attention to the Bible's unified storyline as normative.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for classic Reformed covenantal categories (useful in systematic theology summaries).
- As a **polemic** and teaching tool against dispensational fragmentation and certain forms of supersessionism, clarifying continuity and distinction.
- As an **exegetical-model primer** for reading biblical narrative and promise-fulfillment through typology and covenantal progression in preaching and classroom settings.
