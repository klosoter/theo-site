### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper - Geerhardus Vos**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th‑century Reformed milieu; Vos taught at Princeton and influenced North American Reformed scholarship. The volume grows from Vos's lecturing and published essays fitted to systematic concerns in an era responding to liberal theology, historical criticism, and nonconfessional natural theology.
 - Methodologically rooted in **biblical (redemptive‑historical) theology** as corrective to purely philosophical or abstracted systems.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of God must be articulated from God's self‑revelation in redemptive history rather than primarily from speculative metaphysics or nature. Theology proper is the theological reading of the biblical acts and disclosures of God.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Statement of method: theology as theological, shaped by revelation and historical redemption.
 - Survey of revelation: general vs. special; priority of special (Christic) revelation.
 - Attributes of God: communicable/incommunicable, negative and positive formulations, and their grounding in revelation.
 - Trinity: economic relations grounded in redemptive acts; careful balance of immanent and economic concerns.
 - Divine decrees and providence: God's eternal counsel and its historic realization.
 - Christological and covenantal orientations: how the doctrine of God points forward to and is fulfilled in Christ and covenant life.
 - Application: polemic against natural theology and theological liberalism; pastoral and ecclesial implications.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed classics: Calvin, Turretin, and the Reformed orthodox.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: theologians influenced by Schleiermacherian and liberal currents; also dialogue with Neo‑orthodoxy's emphases on revelation.
 - Scriptural exegesis is primary source; patristic and scholastic materials used selectively to illuminate historical reception.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Trinity (economic and immanent), divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, omniscience, omnipotence, aseity), providence, decree/election, covenant as structuring principle, nexus to Christology (anticipatory).

- **Closing line**
 - The volume's theological center of gravity: **God is to be known as the covenantal, redeeming Lord revealed in historical acts culminating in Christ - and doctrine must proceed from that revelatory history rather than abstract metaphysics.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that theology proper be conducted as *biblical‑historical* theology: attributes and doctrines read through the lens of redemptive acts.
 - Emphasis on **revelation as event** (acts and covenants) rather than primarily propositional statements or natural theology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counterposes itself to speculative scholasticism that abstracts God from history and to liberal reductionism that privatizes revelation.
 - Corrects natural‑theology heavy systems by subordinating them to special revelation and covenantal dynamics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of Vos's biblical‑theological categories (historic acts, progressive revelation) within systematic treatment of God.
 - Nuanced use of economic/immanent Trinity language to keep revelation central without collapsing into mere functionalism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed scholarly circles for method more than for novel dogmatic formulas; contributed to the rise of redemptive‑historical approaches in systematic theology.
 - Adopted by conservative seminaries as a corrective resource; continues to be cited for its methodological clarity.

- **Enduring value**
 - As a paradigmatic model for integrating biblical theology and systematics.
 - Useful as a polemical resource against reductionist accounts of God and as a bridge from doctrine to exegesis and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (special vs general)** - prioritizes special revelation (Christ & Scripture) as determinant for knowing God.
- **Redemptive‑historical acts** - revelation principally occurs in events (covenants, incarnation) rather than abstract propositions.
- **Covenant** - organizing category for theology proper; the framework for divine action and relation to creation.
- **Trinity (economic/immanent)** - maintains the reality of the immanent Trinity while reading God's triunity through economic actions in salvation history.
- **Attributes (communicable/incommunicable)** - treated relationally: attributes disclosed and experienced within redemptive contexts.
- **Divine decree / Providence** - God's eternal counsel realized historically; emphasis on sovereignty over contingency.
- **Aseity & simplicity** - affirmed but explicated by reference to God's self‑revelation, not merely metaphysical assertion.
- **Biblical theology (method)** - the method; theology reads Scripture's storyline and draws systematic conclusions from it.
- **Election** - situated in God's historical covenantal purpose, oriented toward Christ.
- **God's sovereignty** - central, but articulated as sovereign in redemptive acts rather than only as abstract dominion.
- **Immutability & eternity** - held alongside God's dynamic engagement in history (no contradiction due to distinction of modes).
- **Incarnation (as revelatory climax)** - Christ as the decisive disclosure of God; theological center for theology proper.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological model** for integrating biblical theology into systematic loci (definition source for a historically grounded approach).
 - As a **polemic** against natural theology and liberal theological methods, supplying scriptural and historical ammunition.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading doctrines of God through covenantal and Christological trajectories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine of God to Christology, covenant theology, and practical theology (preaching, pastoral care).
