### TITLE
**Living in Christ's Church** (1967), Edmund P. Clowney

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-1960s evangelical and Reformed recovery of confessional ecclesiology amid post-Vatican II ecumenism, mainline Presbyterian turmoil, and parachurch expansion.
 - Westminster Seminary milieu; catechetical/pastoral manual for Presbyterian congregations (OPC/PCA use).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church is the covenantal community united to the risen Christ; to live in Christ is to live in his church under the **Word, sacraments, and discipline**, ordered by **Presbyterian polity** and oriented to Christ's **kingdom**.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Biblical identity: people of God, body/bride/temple; Christ the head, Spirit the bond.
 - **Nature and Marks of the Church**: unity, holiness, catholicity, apostolicity; marks as true preaching, right sacraments, and church discipline.
 - Membership and means: covenantal inclusion, baptism and the Supper as means of grace; communion of saints.
 - **Church Government: Presbyterian Polity, Offices, Discipline**: elders (teaching and ruling) and deacons; authority ministerial and declarative; graded courts.
 - Mission and worship: evangelism and edification; worship regulated by Scripture; gifts for service.
 - **Church and Kingdom**: church as outpost/embassy of the eschatological reign; already/not yet.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture as norm; Westminster Standards; Calvin; Reformed scholastic and Dutch neo-Calvinist threads (e.g., Ridderbos on kingdom).
 - Interlocutors: Roman Catholic ecclesiology (Lumen Gentium), Barthian event-ecclesiology, congregational independency, parachurch primacy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Word, covenant theology, Christology (headship), pneumatology (Spirit and gifts), soteriology (union with Christ), sacramentology, ecclesiology, eschatology (kingdom).
- **Closing line**
 - The church lives from Christ and for Christ; as his covenant body it manifests the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic** gospel through Word, sacrament, and shepherding discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Christocentric, covenantal framing of all ecclesial life: union with Christ grounds membership, worship, mission.
 - Re-centering of discipline as pastoral care and a mark of the church, not merely a penalty.
 - Practical exposition of **visible and invisible church distinction** to sustain hope and accountability.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against hierarchical/episcopal fixity: authority is ministerial/declarative, located in Christ-ruled eldership and courts.
 - Against congregational atomism: interconnection in presbyteries/assemblies is of the churchs essence.
 - Against ecumenism without truth: unity is evangelical and confessional, not merely organizational.
 - Against parachurch dominance: the church, not auxiliaries, bears the keys of the kingdom.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Church as **embassy of the kingdom** clarifying **church and kingdom** relation.
 - Two-orders within one eldership (teaching and ruling) under one head; diaconate as ministry of mercy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Presbyterian membership and officer training; precursor to Clowneys later The Church.
 - Cited across Reformed discussions of polity, discipline, and the marks/attributes of the church.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear synthesis for catechesis; bridges biblical theology and confessional polity.
 - Reliable touchstone on the attributes/marks, **Presbyterian polity**, and church-kingdom dynamics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**: the church as God sees (elect, infallibly saved) vs. as we see (mixed body); guards hope and realism in ministry.
- **Marks of the Church**: pure preaching, right administration of sacraments, and faithful discipline; identify true church amid pluralism.
- **One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic**: attributes grounded in union with Christ and the apostolic Word; unity in truth, holiness by sanctifying Word, catholicity across space/time, apostolicity in doctrine and mission.
- **Church and Kingdom**: kingdom is broader and eschatological; the church is its gathered, institutional embassy administering the keys.
- **Presbyterian Polity**: graded courts (session, presbytery, assembly); parity and plurality of elders; connectional oversight.
- **Offices**: elders (teaching and ruling) shepherd by Word and governance; deacons embody merciful service; authority is ministerial/declarative.
- **Keys of the Kingdom**: preaching and discipline bind/loose; stewardship of gospel access.
- **Discipline**: formative (catechesis) and corrective (admonition to censure); aim is restoration and Christly order.
- **Means of Grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer; Spirit uses ordinary means to create and mature faith.
- **Covenant Community**: membership by profession (and children by covenant); obligations and privileges defined by vows.
- **Headship of Christ**: Christ rules by his Word and Spirit through ordained means; guards from clericalism and populism.
- **Communion of Saints**: mutual edification, gift-sharing, diaconal care; extends beyond local congregation.
- **Regulative Principle of Worship**: what Scripture commands shapes corporate worship; safeguards holiness and catholicity.
- **Catholicity and Mission**: catholic scope expressed in mission and church planting under lawful oversight.

- **How this work is used**
 - Definition source for the **nature and marks of the church** and the attributes (One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic).
 - Polemical and pastoral guide for **church government: Presbyterian polity, offices, discipline**.
 - Conceptual pivot for relating **church and kingdom** and deploying the **visible/invisible** distinction.
 - Exegetical-catechetical model for membership instruction and officer training.
