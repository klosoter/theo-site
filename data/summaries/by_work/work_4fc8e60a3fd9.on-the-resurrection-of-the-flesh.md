### TITLE
On the Resurrection of the Flesh (De Resurrectione Carnis) - Tertullian

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 3rd century North Africa (Carthage); Tertullian writing as a vigorous Latin apologist/polemicist. Composed amid conflicts with Gnostic and Platonic spiritualizing tendencies and shortly before or during his turn toward Montanism (c. 200-220 AD).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the bodily (corporeal) resurrection against Gnostic, Platonizing, and spiritualizing opponents who deny that "flesh" will rise; affirm the continuity and identity of the person through a transformed but still bodily resurrection.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scriptural foundation: extensive exegesis of Pauline texts (esp. 1 Cor 15), Gospel witness to Christ's bodily resurrection, typology from Old Testament promises.
 - Philosophical and anthropological move: insistence on soul-body union; the human person is a psychosomatic unity, so salvation and eschatological vindication must include restored flesh.
 - Polemic against opponents: rejects dualistic denigration of matter and defenses of an immaterial-only immortality; argues that God will subject the same created matter to transformation rather than create an entirely new immaterial existence.
 - Practical/soteriological point: bodily resurrection is necessary for divine justice, reward and punishment, and the redemption of creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (chief exegete), Evangelists, Old Testament prophets, and opponents: Gnostic schools (Marcionites, Valentinians), Greco-Roman philosophers, and contemporary Christian spiritualizers.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (soul/body origin and union), eschatology (resurrection, parousia), soteriology (redemption of the whole person), Christology (Christ as exemplar of bodily resurrection), creation and providence.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The hope of Christians is for a real, corporeal, identity-preserving resurrection - the same created flesh transfigured and made incorruptible - because God redeems the whole human person and the created order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the literality and corporeality of resurrection: "resurrection of the flesh" as non-negotiable.
 - Vivid rhetorical stress on continuity (the same flesh) over discontinuity (a disembodied immortality).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct correction of Gnostic denials that matter can partake in salvation; forceful rebuttal of Platonizing contempt for the body.
 - Contrasts with Christian theologians who inclined to more allegorizing spiritualizations of resurrection.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Latin articulation of the psychosomatic unity and of "flesh" (carnis) as the proper object of redemption; early Latin theological vocabulary for continuity/transformation of body.
 - Use of genealogical/seminal reasoning (linked to his broader traducianist anthropology) to defend how sin and corporeal continuity operate.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited in the Western patristic tradition as an exemplar of robust bodily eschatology; influenced later Latin debates about body-soul relation.
 - His explicit traducianist tendencies were contested by others (notably Augustine later), so his anthropology was debated while his resurrection theology remained influential.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of biblically grounded, polemical eschatology that refuses dualistic reductions.
 - Useful resource for teaching the theological necessity of bodily redemption, and as a historical case in debates over soul origin and the meaning of "flesh."

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection of the flesh (resurrectio carnis):** central phrase; affirms that flesh (not merely soul) rises.
- **Flesh (caro/carnis):** technical term for bodily aspect that must be redeemed; not merely synonymous with sinful nature.
- **Body (corpus) vs. Soul (anima):** insists on their union; neither can be fully separated in soteriological hope.
- **Continuity/identity:** the same corporeal continuity is preserved though transformed to incorruptibility.
- **Corruptible/incorruptible:** moral and ontological categories applied to the resurrected body (1 Cor 15 vocabulary deployed).
- **Anastasis (resurrection):** Tertullian reads Greek NT language in Latin conceptual frames, stressing literal rising.
- **Traducianism (seminal transmission):** Tertullian favors transmission of soul and body from parents - used to explain inherited sin and bodily continuity.
 - Contrast: **Creationism (soul created directly by God):** presented as rival view; Tertullian treats it less sympathetically because it complicates continuity and transmission of sin.
- **Gnosticism/Platonism:** named adversaries who spiritualize or deny bodily restoration.
- **Parousia:** eschatological return framing the timing and consummation of bodily resurrection.
- **Transformation/transfiguration:** the process by which corruptible flesh becomes incorruptible while retaining identity.
- **Divine justice and reward:** theological rationale - bodily resurrection necessary for just retribution and vindication.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Western insistence on bodily resurrection and psychosomatic unity.
- As a **polemic model** against spiritualizing or dualistic readings of scripture (useful in apologetics and dogmatic syntheses).
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting 1 Corinthians 15 and Gospel resurrection narratives in service of eschatology and anthropology.
