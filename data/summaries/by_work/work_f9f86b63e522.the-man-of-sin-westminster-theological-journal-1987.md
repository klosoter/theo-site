### TITLE
"The Man of Sin" - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal 49 (1987): 227-244.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in a Reformed academic periodical during the late 20th-century surge of renewed interest in Pauline eschatology and apocalyptic hermeneutics.
 - Engages debates between historicist, futurist, and preterist interpreters of 2 Thessalonians 2 and the wider "Antichrist" tradition in the New Testament.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Poythress contends that careful lexical, syntactic, and intertextual exegesis of 2 Thessalonians 2 yields a theologically precise picture: the "man of sin" (ho anthropos tes anomias) functions as a **corporate, lawless authority** and counterfeit Christ-figure rather than merely an isolated enigmatic individual or simplistic historical label.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical re-reading of key phrases in Greek (e.g., ho anthropos tes anomias, ho katechon, ho huios tes apoleias).
 - Intertextual correlation with Johannine "antichrist" language and Old Testament apocalyptic motifs (Danielic and prophetic imagery) to show continuity in biblical portrayal of counterfeit authority.
 - Analysis of the "mystery of lawlessness" as an active theological category in the present age (not merely future), pointing to a corporate socioreligious phenomenon (idolatrous coercive power).
 - Treatment of the "restrainer" (ho katechon) as a present godly restraint operative in providence and ecclesial reality that postpones the full disclosure of lawless power until God's appointed time.
 - Conclusion: the Pauline diagnosis aims at theological pastoral correction - exposing the lawless counterfeit and reassuring believers of Christ's impending vindication.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with traditional identifications (papacy, Nero, future individual) and with contemporary scholarly positions across futurist and historicist lines; draws on philological and canonical-theological resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and eschatology (parousia, coming and revealing), Christology (counterfeit Christology), ecclesiology (role of restraint in the church-age), providence, sin and apostasy.
- **Closing line**
 - A Christ-centered exegetical correction that reframes the "man of sin" as a systemic, theological phenomenon of lawlessness and counterfeit authority ultimately judged at Christ's parousia.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the **corporate and systemic** character of the man of sin rather than an exclusive focus on a single future personality.
 - Prioritizes tight lexical and syntactical exegesis as a corrective to overly speculative identifications.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters both crude historicist labeling (e.g., automatic identification with a single institution) and simplistic futurist individualism that divorces the text from its present pastoral function.
 - Pushes back against readings that isolate the passage from Johannine and prophetic antichrist motifs.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Treats "mystery of lawlessness" and "restrainer" as theological categories with present and ongoing operation, not merely future curiosities.
 - Emphasizes a "corporate-person" lens: the man of sin functions as a collectivized personification of apostasy and counterfeit rule.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles for methodological rigor; used as a model for exegetical restraint and canonical correlation in eschatological questions.
 - Cited as a corrective resource against sensationalist eschatologies in popular and some scholarly accommodations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as an academic exemplar: close Greek exegesis married to canonical-theological sensitivity; profitable for pastors and scholars seeking sober, text-grounded treatments of Antichrist motifs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Man of sin (ho anthropos tes anomias)** - central titular phrase; read as corporate lawless authority/personification rather than only an isolated future individual.
- **Lawlessness (anomia)** - theological category designating rebellion against divine order; operative as both present power and eschatological manifestation.
- **Mystery of lawlessness** - denotes an active, providentially permitted deception and organized opposition to God, with both present operation and climactic revelation.
- **The restrainer (ho katechon)** - interpreted as the present godly restraint (ecclesial/providential), delaying the full revelation of lawlessness until God's appointed time.
- **Son of perdition (huios tes apoleias)** - a Johannine/Psalm resonance; functions as a title linking character to doomed, self-destructive apostasy.
- **Parousia** - Christ's coming as the decisive terminus for lawless power; sets eschatological horizon for Pauline argument.
- **Antichrist / Johannine parallels** - cross-canonical identity markers showing continuity of theme: counterfeit Christ-claims and deception.
- **Corporate-person language** - methodological move to see singular grammatical forms as representing organized, social realities.
- **Counterfeit Christology** - the man of sin offers a pseudo-salvific authority; theological polemic targets false messianic claims.
- **Apostasy** - theological diagnosis of the church-age danger; both individual and systemic.
- **Providence and timing** - God's governance restrains and times the disclosure of lawlessness.
- **Exegesis over speculation** - hermeneutical posture advocated by Poythress: close reading precedes identification.
- **Typology / canonical correlation** - reading 2 Thess 2 in light of Daniel, John, and prophetic motifs.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for treating apocalyptic Pauline texts with lexical care and canonical integration.
- As a **polemic resource** against sensationalist futurism and simplistic historicist identifications.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of apostasy, providence, and Christ's final vindication.
