### TITLE
The Covenant of God: A New Perspective (conference lectures and essays) - Steve Schlissel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century conference lectures and essays produced within the circle of authors associated with the **Federal Vision** conversations. Situated amid post-1990s Reformed debates over covenant theology, sacraments, and justification; aimed at rearticulating covenant doctrine against both liberal accommodation and pietistic individualism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Advocates a **monocovenantal** reading of Scripture: there is one covenant of God (the Covenant of Grace) spanning both Testaments. This pattern reframes issues of covenant membership, sacramental efficacy, justification, and the relation of Old and New Testament peoples.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical case for uniform covenant language from Genesis through Revelation (promise, sign, seed, land/kingdom motifs).
 - Historical-theological recovery of pre-modern cohesion in covenantal thinking (critique of what is called a later "fragmentation" in Protestant orthodoxy).
 - Theological systematization: implications for **justification**, election, and sanctification when covenant is treated as corporate, continuous, and sacramentally mediated.
 - Ecclesio-sacramental consequences: baptism and Lord's Supper as covenantal means that objectively incorporate persons into the covenant community.
 - Pastoral and ethical implications: covenant faithfulness, communal accountability, and the relation of covenant membership to assurance and discipline.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Uses Scripture as primary warrant; dialogues with classical Reformed writers (Calvin, Westminster tradition), critics of Federal Vision, and contemporary covenant theologians. Implicitly contrasts with continental two-covenant readings and with emphases in later pietistic and individualistic strains of Reformed theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant (central), revelation (hermeneutics of covenantal continuity), justification (forensic language re-read in covenantal terms), sanctification, election (corporate aspects), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church), typology and fulfillment.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The work presses that the gospel must be understood within one unfolding Covenant of Grace whose continuity, sacramental means, and corporate shape reshape how Reformed theology reads justification, membership, and the church's life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong advocacy for **monocovenantal continuity**: Israel and the church are covenantally one people in progressive revelation.
 - Emphasis on the **objectivity of covenant membership**-sacraments objectively mark incorporation rather than functioning solely as testimonies to inward faith.
 - A relational/corporate account of salvation that stresses **participation** and covenantal standing alongside forensic categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against readings that sharply separate Old Testament covenant administration from New Testament covenant realities.
 - Challenges models that isolate justification into purely forensic imputation without attendant covenantal incorporation and ethical consequences.
 - Corrects perceived theological fragmentation by recovering familial and communal dimensions of covenant life.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes justification language within a **covenant-of-grace grammar**-less as an isolated legal act and more as declaration within a covenantal administration.
 - Uses corporate categories (membership, household, covenant family) as primary explanatory tools rather than individualist idioms.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central to the broader Federal Vision debates; lauded within sympathetic circles for forcing re-engagement with covenantal categories.
 - Criticized by many in the wider Reformed community for blurring classical distinctions in justification and for perceived risks to sola fide.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes needed re-examination of sacramental theology, ecclesiology, and how covenant language shapes soteriology.
 - Serves as a stimulus for careful exegetical work on covenant texts and for pedagogical clarity about corporate dimensions of salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monocovenantalism:** The claim that Scripture reveals a single Covenant of Grace administrated differently over time, not two fundamentally separate covenants of salvation.
- **Covenant of Grace:** Central covenantal framework; promise-based, fulfilled in Christ and mediated within the church.
- **Covenant Community / Household:** Corporate locus of covenantal life; sacraments and discipline operate at the communal level.
- **Sacramental Efficacy:** The view that baptism and the Lord's Supper objectively participate individuals in covenant realities (incorporation, membership), not merely signifying inner faith.
- **Justification (covenantal framing):** Forensic declaration is retained but is read within covenantal incorporation and covenantal responsibilities; stresses both forensic and participatory language.
 - Contrast: classic imputation-focused accounts vs. participation/covenantal-account dimensions emphasized here.
- **Imputation vs. Participation:** Tension addressed by proposing complementary rather than strictly opposed categories; legal declaration and real communion with Christ are both emphasized.
- **Continuity / Fulfillment:** Typological reading that sees Israel's institutions as real precursors fulfilled in the New Covenant church.
- **Visible vs. Invisible Church:** Reassessed through corporate covenant criteria; visibility relates to covenant signs and communal life.
- **Corporate Election:** Emphasis on election as corporate/people-centered alongside individual response and perseverance.
- **Covenant Faithfulness / Obedience:** Ethical outworking of covenant membership; obedience is indikator of ongoing covenant standing in pastoral practice.
- **Typology and Promise-Fulfillment:** Method for reading OT institutions as fulfilled in Christ and the church.
- **Baptismal Incorporation:** Baptism as the chief covenantal rite of entry into the covenant household.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for monocovenantal readings and Federal Vision hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic** against strict two-covenant or individualistic accounts of justification and sacramental practice.
 - As an **exegetical model** for covenant passages and a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology and ecclesiology curricula.
