### TITLE
**The Emotional Life of Our Lord - B. B. Warfield**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton conservatism. Warfield writes within the Reformed, orthodox reaction to liberal historical-critical and pietistic accounts of Jesus that either naturalize his emotions or relativize his deity. The essay/lecture-address style seeks to secure classical Christology against modern revision.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jesus experienced genuine human emotions without compromise of his divine immutability and impassibility; the emotional life of Christ must be explained by a properly articulated hypostatic union and Chalcedonian Christology rather than by kenotic or reductionist accounts.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Affirm the reality and intensity of Christ's human affections as reported in the Gospels (compassion, grief, anger, sorrow, zeal, agony).
 - Trace how these affections belong to the human nature of the incarnate Son, truly and personally felt by the one divine Person.
 - Defend the Chalcedonian claim that two natures remain distinct yet united in one Person; thus human passibility does not entail alteration of the divine nature.
 - Reject kenotic and certain open-theist readings that either lay aside divine attributes or posit qualitative change in the divine essence to account for Jesus' emotions.
 - Show that Jesus' messianic consciousness and sense of divine mission frame his emotions (e.g., sorrow over Israel, anguish before the cross) and that these are intelligible within theodicy and divine condescension.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit and explicit engagement with:
 - Patristic affirmations and Chalcedonian formulary as normative.
 - Contemporary liberal critics and proponents of kenosis/open views (modernists who would naturalize Jesus).
 - Reformed and Anglican predecessors emphasizing eternal Sonship and classical theism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union, two natures), eternal Sonship and incarnation, communicatio idiomatum, Chalcedonian definition, theodicy (suffering and divine justice), divine impassibility/condescension, critiques of kenosis and open theism.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Warfield locates the emotional life of Christ squarely in the real humanity of the incarnate Son while preserving the integrity and impassibility of the divine nature by appeal to a robust Chalcedonian hypostatic union and the communicatio idiomatum.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emotive phenomena are treated as authentic human experiences occasioned by the incarnate Son's human nature and personal consciousness - not as mere appearances or functional expressions.
 - Strong insistence that one must not explain away divine immutability to account for Christ's feelings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to kenotic and certain "open" readings that suggest God relinquishes attributes or becomes mutable in the Incarnation.
 - Polemic against liberal-historical efforts to reduce Jesus' emotions to sociocultural or psychological phenomena divorced from his divine personhood.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Clarifies and sharpens the application of the communicatio idiomatum to affectivity - distinguishing predicates ascribed to the person (who experiences) from those properly ascribed to a nature (which is passible or impassible).
- **Reception and influence:** Highly influential within Princeton/Reformed circles and later conservative evangelical scholarship as a model of orthodox Christological handling of Jesus' humanity; used historically against mid-20th-century kenotic revivals and as a touchstone in debates about divine impassibility.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Provides a compact, careful exemplar of how to integrate biblical exegesis, classical dogma, and pastoral concern in defending orthodox accounts of Christ's emotional life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Emotional life / Affectivity:** Gospel-reported feelings (compassion, sorrow, anger, grief, joy) treated as genuine human experiences of the incarnate Son.
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of two complete natures (divine and human) in the one Person of the Son; the framework Warfield uses to explain how human emotions belong truly to Christ.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine:** The normative schema preserving both natures without confusion, change, division, or separation; central to Warfield's solution.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** The communication of properties between natures mediated by the person; used to explain predication of emotions to the Person without collapsing natures.
 - Contrast: distinguishes person-level ascription from nature-level properties to avoid theological category errors.
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation:** Warfield's affirmation that the Son who is divine eternally assumes humanity; thus emotions are real experiences of the incarnate eternal Son.
- **Kenosis (and critiques):** The proposal that the Son emptied certain divine attributes in the Incarnation; Warfield rejects readings that entail divine change or loss of deity.
- **Passibility vs. Impassibility:** Debate over whether God can suffer or be affected; Warfield maintains divine impassibility in essence but allows for real human passibility as experienced by the incarnate Son.
- **Divine Condescension / Theodicy:** Explanation of how God's voluntary self-limitation in the Incarnation explains the Son's suffering without compromising divine justice or immutability.
- **Messianic Consciousness / Kingdom:** Warfield reads Jesus' emotions within the horizon of his messianic identity and kingdom mission - emotions often arise from prophetic and salvific concern.
- **Open Theism (critique):** Modern positions positing divine responsiveness and genuine risk are resisted insofar as they require change in divine nature.
- **Human Nature (of Christ):** Real, full human affective life that can be described in psychological and ethical terms but must be integrated into personal, redemptive context.
- **Theodicy / Divine Justice:** Uses Christ's suffering to explain divine solidarity with human suffering without compromising justice or sovereignty.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for orthodox limits on attributing passibility to the divine nature.
- As a **polemical resource** against kenotic and open-theist theologies that change classical divine attributes.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Gospel passages that report Jesus' emotions through a Chalcedonian, person-nature distinction.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching communicatio idiomatum and the application of Chalcedon to concrete Christological data.
