### TITLE
Paul and the Law in the Last Ten Years (Scottish Journal of Theology, 1996) - Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1990s engagement with the surge of the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** sparked by E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, and N.T. Wright. Moo writes as a conservative evangelical Pauline scholar surveying roughly the previous decade of scholarship and polemic.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Moo contends that while NPP contributions sharpen the historical background of Judaism, they do not overturn the **forensic, imputed character of Pauline justification**; many NPP claims misread Pauline rhetoric and fail to account for the soteriological force of Paul's critique of the Law.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of major NPP theses and allied scholarship (ca. 1986-1996).
 - Close attention to Pauline texts (principally Romans and Galatians) to test NPP claims about "works of the law," "righteousness," and "justification."
 - Critical evaluation of historical Judaism (covenantal nomism) and assessment of whether that context displaces traditional readings of Paul.
 - Defense of a nuanced traditional position: recognizes value in NPP contextualization but reasserts key forensic and imputed elements in Pauline soteriology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal interlocutors: E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright; engages classical Protestant interpreters implicitly and explicitly (e.g., reformational formulations of justification).
 - Primary Pauline loci: Romans, Galatians (exegetical focus), with reference to Second Temple Judaism studies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Justification** (forensic/declared righteousness), **imputation**, **covenant**, **the Law/Torah**, **soteriology**, **eschatology** (as context for righteousness language), **union with Christ** (as explanatory locus).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Moo centers on conserving the **forensic declaration of righteousness** in Paul while integrating legitimate historical insights from the NPP - i.e., keep covenant-historical sensitivity without abandoning imputation as central to Pauline soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that **Pauline forensic language cannot be reduced** to merely social-boundary critique; legal-adjudicative categories remain primary in key Pauline texts.
 - Methodological balance: accepts NPP's recovery of Jewish context but subjects it to close exegetical testing in Romans and Galatians.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against reductive NPP claims that "works of the law" refer only to ethnic boundary markers; argues for a **multi-layered** understanding that allows boundary functions but preserves an ethical/meritorious sense relevant to Paul's polemic.
 - Challenges NPP tendency to downplay individual sin and divine righteousness language.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Advocates a **context-sensitive synthesis**: covenantal nomism as background, but forensic imputation as Paul's theological move - not a simple replacement but a relational integration.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among conservative and Reformed scholars as a measured rebuttal to extreme NPP claims.
 - Used in textbooks, commentaries, and classroom debates as a model of temperate but firm critique.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable resource for students and teachers who seek to honor historical Judaism studies while defending classical doctrines of justification and imputation; exemplary for combining historical sensitivity with canonical exegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - Paul's declared acquittal before God; Moo defends a primarily **forensic** reading against purely sociological reinterpretations.
- **Forensic / imputation**
 - **Imputation**: Christ's righteousness counted to believers; Moo maintains this remains central to Paul's soteriology.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - The scholarly movement reinterpreting Paul's critique of Judaism; Moo accepts some historical claims but critiques theological displacement of forensic themes.
- **Covenantal nomism**
 - Sanders' description of Judaism as law within covenantal belonging; treated as helpful background but insufficient to displace Pauline concerns about justification.
- **Works of the law**
 - Contested phrase: Moo argues for **multi-valence** - includes boundary markers but also the idea of works-based self-justification in Paul's polemic.
- **Righteousness (dikaiosyne)**
 - Ambiguous term with divine, forensic, and ethical nuances; Moo stresses Paul's emphasis on **God's reckoned righteousness** as salvific, not merely social status.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The relational ground for imputation and new status; used by Moo to explain how forensic declaration operates existentially for believers.
- **Boundary markers**
 - Practices (circumcision, food laws) highlighted by NPP; Moo allows their role but resists their exclusive identification with "works."
- **Soteriology / eschatology nexus**
 - Moo highlights how eschatological motifs (justification as present-declared and future-assured) shape Paul's argument.
- **Torah / Law**
 - As covenantal guide and as locus of Paul's polemic; Moo navigates both descriptive (Jewish) and normative (Christian) uses.
- **Merit / Works**
 - Discussed in relation to human attempts at achieving status before God; Moo insists Paul critiques merit-based self-justification.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** defending classical forensic imputation within contemporary debates.
- As a **polemical resource** against strong versions of the NPP that dismiss forensic categories.
- As an **exegetical model** applying careful text-work (Romans/Galatians) while integrating historical background.
