### TITLE
**Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary - John Murray**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century Reformed theological renewal. Murray writes as a conservative Presbyterian theologian rooted in the Westminster tradition, responding to modernist, Arminian, and dispensational challenges while retrieving classical Reformed orthodoxy for pastors and scholars.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To expound, defend, and apply the Westminster Confession as a unified, biblical systematic statement-showing that the Confession coherently articulates Scripture's teaching on God, Christ, covenant, salvation, church, and last things and is necessary corrective to contemporary theological error.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Sequential, chapter-by-chapter exposition of the Confession: exposition of text, biblical proof, theological analysis, and pastoral implications.
 - Emphasis on the unity of Scripture as the norming standard and on covenant theology as the key structural principle.
 - Repeated moves: exegetical grounding → doctrinal formulation → polemic against errors (liberalism, Arminianism, dispensationalism) → pastoral application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutors: the Westminster divines and earlier Reformed authorities (Calvin, Turretin, Owen).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: 20th-century liberal theology, Arminian theologians, dispensationalists, and some evangelical trends Murray sees as weakening confessional commitments.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, God and the Trinity, providence, decrees, creation, fall, covenant of works and covenant of grace, Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), soteriology (effectual calling, particular redemption, imputation), sanctification and perseverance, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), church polity and worship, eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Murray's theological center of gravity is a covenantal, scripturally-rooted Reformed orthodoxy in which the person and work of Christ (grounded in a robust doctrine of the hypostatic union and communicatio idiomatum) secures the elect through federal representation and gracious application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong, sustained covenantal reading of the Confession that treats the covenant of works and covenant of grace as explanatory keys for the whole system.
 - Precise articulation of the union between Christ and his people as the central mechanism by which redemption is applied (union theology receives repeated focus).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects tendencies in some modern evangelicals to soften confessional particularity (e.g., on atonement and effectual calling).
 - Opposes dispensational bifurcation of God's purposes and the fragmentation of redemptive history.
 - Rejects liberal reductionism of revelation and subjectivist distortions of assurance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not radical innovations but disciplined clarifications: refined language on imputation, federal headship, and the mechanics of union with Christ; careful technical use of Christological categories (including communicatio idiomatum) to secure doctrinal clarity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles as a reliable, compact theological resource.
 - Used in seminaries and by pastors for confessional instruction and polemical clarity; reprinted frequently by confessional publishers.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of how to read and apply a historic confession responsibly: exegetical, theological, and pastoral integration.
 - Valuable for clarifying contested loci (union with Christ, imputation, covenantal structure) and for training ministers in confessional fidelity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** Central structural dyad; Murray emphasizes continuity-by-distinction-works-covenant required obedience, grace-covenant provides salvation in Christ.
- **Federal Headship (federal representation):** Adam and Christ as covenant heads; Murray uses this to explain imputation of guilt and righteousness.
- **Imputation:** Legal attribution of Christ's righteousness to believers and of believers' sin to Christ - core to justification.
- **Union with Christ:** The instrumental and ontological bond by which benefits of redemption are applied; Murray treats this as the locus of sanctification and assurance.
- **Effectual Calling:** God's inward, efficacious summons that secures conversion; distinguished from external proclamation and resistible calls.
- **Particular/Definite Atonement:** Affirmation that Christ died effectively for the elect (Murray defends particularity against both universalizing and overly narrow interpretations).
- **Perseverance of the Saints:** Covenantal and grace-grounded preservation of the elect; Murray connects perseverance to union and divine faithfulness.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** The communication of properties between the divine and human natures in the one person of Christ; Murray employs this to explain how one can ascribe human experiences (suffering, death) to the one Person who is God without confusion of natures-crucial for soteriological claims (e.g., "Christ died" as a saving event for the elect).
 - Use: grounds how Christ's human obedient life and suffering are effective for sinners due to the personal union-avoids mixture of natures while affirming personal attribution.
- **Scriptural Authority (sufficiency and perspicuity):** Scripture as final norm; Murray stresses both the formal authority and practical sufficiency for doctrine and life.
- **Sacraments as Seals:** Baptism and Lord's Supper as signs and seals of covenant promises, applied by the Spirit to the elect.
- **Antithesis:** The moral and spiritual divide between regenerate and unregenerate spheres-practical outworking of covenant distinction.
- **Law and Gospel distinction:** Law as rule and convicting mirror; gospel as promise and power for salvation-Murray preserves forensic and moral roles.
- **Providence and Decrees:** Strong affirmation of divine sovereignty, compatibilist freedom, and God's ordering of secondary causes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed positions (seminaries, catechetical instruction).
- As a **polemic** against Arminianism, dispensationalism, and liberal theology-supplying concise theological rebuttals.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading confessional statements in a biblically-anchored, doctrinally systematic way.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Christology and soteriology, especially on union with Christ and the application of redemption (via communicatio idiomatum, imputation, and federal headship).
