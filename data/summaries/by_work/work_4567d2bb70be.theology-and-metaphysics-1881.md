### TITLE
**Theology and Metaphysics** (1881) - Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant liberalism; post-Kantian, historically oriented theology.
 - A programmatic manifesto against speculative metaphysics in dogmatics; aligned with Ritschl's school (Herrmann, Kaftan) and indebted to Kant and Lotze.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Christian theology must renounce metaphysical constructions** and be grounded in the church's **value-judgments** formed by God's historical revelation in Jesus and oriented to the **Kingdom of God**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique: metaphysical theology (Scholastic, Idealist) confuses faith with explanation of being; produces alien categories for Christian knowledge.
 - Method: distinguish **judgments of existence** (Seinsurteile) from **value-judgments** (Werthurteile); theology belongs to the latter as a practical science of the community's salvation.
 - Material norm: God is known in the **history of Jesus** as love and righteousness; this revelation constitutes the teleological center, the Kingdom.
 - Reconstruction of loci:
 - **Bibliology/Revelation**: Scripture as normative witness arising from the apostolic community; authority tied to its service to faith and the Kingdom.
 - **Doctrine of God**: divine attributes determined by salvation-history; priority of love and righteousness over metaphysical perfections.
 - **Trinity**: confessed economically; speculative ontological trinitarianism set aside as non-practical.
 - **Christology**: deity of Christ affirmed as the community's decisive value-judgment about his saving efficacy and vocation, not as two-natures ontology.
 - **Soteriology**: justification and reconciliation as incorporation into the ethical community; forgiveness creates filial relation to God.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit as the power constituting communal life and moral renewal.
 - **Ecclesiology/Sacraments**: church as communal realization of the Kingdom; sacraments serve assurance and fellowship, not metaphysical change.
 - **Eschatology**: Kingdom chiefly ethical and historical; apocalyptic schemas relativized to present vocation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kant (practical reason), Lotze (value, teleology), Luther (justification), and controverts Scholasticism, Hegelian idealism, and aspects of Schleiermacher's feeling-based method.
 - Subsequent dialogue with Herrmann, Kaftan, Harnack; later critics include Bavinck, Kuyper, Warfield, and Barth.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture; God and attributes; Trinity; Christology; Sin/Justification/Reconciliation; Church/Sacraments; Spirit; Kingdom/Eschatology; Method.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Christologically mediated, Kingdom-oriented value-judgment** method that makes theology a practical science for the church's moral and communal vocation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Method of **value-judgments** as constitutive of dogmatics.
 - **Historical-Christological norm** over ontology; teleology of the **Kingdom of God**.
 - Ethical-community focus in soteriology and pneumatology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **Scholastic metaphysics**: rejects substance, causa sui, speculative attributes as theological foundations.
 - Against **Hegelian system**: refuses identity of logic and theology; prioritizes history over dialectic.
 - Against **Schleiermacher**: replaces feeling of dependence with communal judgments ordered to salvation.
 - Against **natural theology**: denies access to God via nature or abstract reason apart from Christ.
- **Innovations**
 - Sharp **Seinsurteil / Werthurteil** distinction; theology as **practical science**.
 - Recasting of **deity of Christ** as soteriological function and community confession rather than metaphysical essence.
 - **Economic Trinity** without speculative intratrinitarian metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Formative for the **Ritschlian school** and liberal Protestantism; mediated by Harnack and Herrmann.
 - Provoked powerful **Reformed and neo-orthodox critiques** (Bavinck, Warfield, Barth) while shaping 20th-century method debates.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies methodological limits of metaphysics; centers **Christ and the Kingdom**; integrates ethics and ecclesial life.
 - Serves as a foil prompting more constructive accounts of ontology, revelation, and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Value-judgment (Werthurteil)**: Faith's evaluative judgment of saving significance; the medium of theological knowledge.
- **Judgment of existence (Seinsurteil)**: Claims about what is; proper to metaphysics/nature, not constitutive of dogma.
- **Kingdom of God**: Teleological center; ethical community ordered by God's love and righteousness manifest in Christ.
- **Revelation-in-history**: God known in Jesus' historical life and work, not in abstract being.
- **God as love and righteousness**: Material norm for divine attributes drawn from salvation-history.
- **Economic Trinity**: Trinitarian language tied to salvation and revelation, not speculative essence.
- **Christ's vocation and sonship**: Functional Christology grounding deity in saving role and filial obedience.
- **Justification and reconciliation**: Forgiveness that founds filial relation and communal membership.
- **Community (Gemeinde)**: Subject and context of theology's value-judgments; site of the Spirit's work.
- **Holy Spirit**: Power of moral renewal and fellowship; binds believers into Kingdom life.
- **Scripture as normative witness**: Canon's authority serves faith's ends; read with historical criticism.
- **Anti-metaphysics**: Programmatic refusal of speculative ontological schemas in dogma.
- **Teleology / End-purpose**: Orientation of doctrines to the Kingdom's ethical end.
- **Natural theology critique**: No knowledge of God's saving will apart from Christ.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Methodological charter** for dogmatics centered on Christ and the Kingdom.
 - **Polemic resource** against speculative metaphysics and natural theology.
 - **Conceptual pivot** for re-describing Trinity, Christology, and soteriology in communal-ethical terms.
