### TITLE
Leo the Great: Summaries in Patristic Collections with focus on Communicatio Idiomatum (Tome and Chalcedonian reception)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-5th century (papacy of Leo I, 440-461), theological crisis after Nestorius and Eutyches; Flavian of Constantinople seeks Roman input; Leo's Tome (sent 449) read at the Council of Chalcedon (451) and becomes authoritative in Western and Chalcedonian formularies recorded in standard patristic collections (e.g., Nicene and Post‑Nicene Fathers).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** how to confess the Incarnation so as to secure both the full divinity and full humanity of Christ while maintaining the unity of the Person (hypostasis) - specifically, how to predicate attributes of divinity and humanity of the one Christ (communicatio idiomatum) without confusion or division.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirm two natures (physis) - divine and human - each retaining its proper properties.
 - Affirm one person/hypostasis (the Word) in whom both natures subsist inseparably and indivisibly.
 - Allow transfer of predicates to the single Person: what pertains to the Word may be said of the incarnate Lord, and what pertains to the human nature is assumed into the one Person.
 - Reject both Nestorian division of persons and Eutychian mixture of natures; insist on distinction of natures without separation and unity of person without confusion.
 - Ground claims in Scripture, patristic tradition (notably Cyril), and ecclesial definition (Chalcedon).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Cyril of Alexandria (as theological authority to be retrieved), Augustine (Western theological background), Flavian, Eutyches (target), Nestorius (target), the Council of Chalcedon (definitive forum).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (central), Incarnation, Trinity (related by the Word's identity), soteriology (implications: healing by assumption), ecclesial authority (role of episcopal councils and Roman see).
- **Closing line:** Leo centers theology on the hypostatic union: one Person, two unconfused natures united such that the properties of each can be ascribed to the one Lord - the communicatio idiomatum protects both full deity and full humanity in service of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong juridical and personal language: insistence on a single hypostasis (persona) of the Word who acts and suffers.
 - Balancing of ontological distinction (natures) with personal unity - careful technical qualifiers ("without confusion, without change, without division, without separation").
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Nestorian tendencies to separate the human and divine in a way that prevents ascription of divine titles to the incarnate Lord (e.g., Theotokos controversy).
 - Corrects Eutychian/Monophysite tendencies that collapse the two natures into a confused single nature, losing true humanity or true divinity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Consolidation and Western framing of Cyril's language into a formula that supports Chalcedon, making communicatio idiomatum a linchpin for predication of attributes across natures.
 - Precision in distinguishing physis (nature) and hypostasis (person) in Latin theological idiom.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became a cornerstone of Chalcedonian orthodoxy; Leo's Tome widely cited in Western medieval, Reformation, and modern theological texts.
 - Eastern reception mixed: Chalcedonian East accepted it; Oriental Orthodox rejected Chalcedon's dyophysitism, leading to long-standing schism.
 - Reformed and Protestant theology have used Leo/Chalcedon to frame orthodox Christology and to justify predication and imputation doctrines.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable model for negotiating unity and distinction in Christology.
 - Serves as a pedagogical and polemical template for later debates on the communication of attributes, atonement, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** the ascription of properties/attributes of both natures to the one Person of Christ; central explanatory tool in Leo's Christology.
- **Hypostatic union:** the union of divine and human natures in the one hypostasis (Person) of the Word; Leo's preferred way to speak of personal unity.
- **Physis (nature) / Physeis:** the categories of divine and human being; Leo insists both natures remain distinct in their properties.
- **Persona / Hypostasis:** the single subject (the Word) who assumes human nature; the locus of predication.
- **"Without confusion, without change, without division, without separation":** Chalcedonian formula adopted and reinforced by Leo to guard against heresy.
- **Tome of Leo:** the formal letter/text submitted to Constantinople (449) and authoritative for Chalcedon; primary source for Leo's teaching in standard patristic collections.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** the council's phrasing that integrates Leo's Tome into ecclesial dogma; used to operationalize communicatio idiomatum.
- **Theotokos:** "God-bearer" - affirmed against Nestorian denial; a practical application of communicatio idiomatum.
- **Predication of attributes:** theological practice Leo defends - e.g., "the Word suffered" is true by virtue of the Person assuming suffering in his human nature.
- **What is assumed is healed (tradition):** soteriological maxim linked to the idea that the Word's assumption of human nature effects its healing; used to justify incarnation's salvific purpose.
- **Two natures, one person (dyophysite Christology):** concise label of Leo/Chalcedon's position.
- **Cyrillian retrieval:** Leo's selective appeal to Cyril of Alexandria to authorize his formula while avoiding monophysite implications.
- **Predicational logic:** method of transferring properties across natures through the single Person.

How this work is used across loci:
- As **definitional source** for orthodox Chalcedonian Christology and for teaching communicatio idiomatum.
- As **polemic** against Nestorian and Monophysite errors, supplying canonical language for councils and pastors.
- As an **exegetical model** for attributing scriptural sayings to Christ (divine and human predicates).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in soteriology and sacramental theology: incarnation as healing by assumption and the basis for atonement language.
