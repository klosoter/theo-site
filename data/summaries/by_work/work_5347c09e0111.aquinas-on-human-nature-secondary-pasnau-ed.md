### TITLE
Aquinas on Human Nature (ed. Robert Pasnau) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 13th-century scholasticism; synthesis of Aristotelian metaphysics with Latin Christian doctrine. Pasnau's edition collects key Thomistic texts and interpretive essays for contemporary readers.
 - Milieu: University of Paris/Oxford theological debate over soul, intellect, divine action, grace, and law.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Human nature is a hylomorphic union of body and rational soul whose powers (intellect, will) bear the image of God yet are disordered by original sin and in need of grace for full flourishing and beatitude.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Ontology: human being as composite of matter (body) and substantial form (rational soul) - unity is real and not merely accidental.
 - Faculties: distinguishes vegetative, sensitive, and rational powers; intellect and will as principal faculties that orient humans to truth and ultimate good.
 - Image of God: located primarily in the soul's rationality and in the capacities for knowledge and love (intellect and will), not in material attributes.
 - Original sin and impairment: original sin corrupts human appetites and inclinations, wounds the will and lower powers, and brings concupiscence; it does not annihilate the image but darkens and weakens it.
 - Grace and restoration: supernatural grace elevates and heals the natural powers, perfects the intellect and will toward supernatural beatitude; Christology and sacraments are mediators of this restoration.
 - Moral and legal consequence: natural law derives from human rational nature; virtue and vice judged by conformity to the natural order informed by reason and enlightened by grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Aristotle (hylomorphism, psychology), Augustine (original sin, grace), Pseudo-Dionysius (capabilities language), contemporaries (Henry of Ghent, Siger of Brabant).
 - Biblical texts interpreted through patrimonial and Aristotelian lenses: Gen 1-2 (Image), Paul (Rom 5 on original sin and imputation).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology, original sin and imputation, image of God, grace and justification, Christology (as healer of nature), ethics (virtue, law), knowledge (intellect, abstraction), freedom/will.

- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas locates the image of God in rational capacities and diagnoses human deficit in original sin while proposing a metaphysical and soteriological economy whereby grace restores nature to its ordered end in beatitude.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Hylomorphic anthropology**: soul as substantial form - human unity explained metaphysically rather than dualistically.
 - **Functional account of the Image of God**: image primarily equals rational faculties (intellect and will) and ordered love rather than mere ontological likeness.
 - **Nature-grace relation**: strong insistence that grace perfects and does not destroy nature (fides quod Deus adjuvat naturam).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Balances Augustine's stress on original sin with Aristotelian optimism about natural capacities; resists both Pelagian self-sufficiency and Manichaean dualism.
 - Clarifies imputation: original sin as a privation/defect in the will and concupiscence passed by human generation, respecting metaphysical continuity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deployment of potency/act language to explain moral disorder, sanctifying grace, and beatific elevation.
 - Distinction between image (imago) and likeness (similitudo) to mark natural capacities vs. supernatural destiny.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence on medieval and later Catholic anthropology, moral theology, and sacramental theology.
 - Reformed reception: Reformed theologians adopt certain Thomistic categories (e.g., nature-grace distinction, richness of natural law) while diverging on original sin's transmission and the mechanics of imputation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable conceptual framework for debates about personhood, moral responsibility, natural law, and the interplay of nature and grace; indispensable for systematic and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hylomorphism** - body (matter) + soul (form) unity; avoids platonic dualism.
- **Substantial form** - the soul as the organizing principle that makes a human one living being.
- **Intellectus (intellect)** - capacity for abstraction, immaterial knowledge; primary locus of the Image of God.
- **Voluntas (will)** - rational appetite ordered to the good; capacity for love and moral agency.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - principally rationality and ordered love; distinguished from likeness (beatific conformity).
 - Site usage: used to argue that the image persists after fall but is impaired; serves as theological basis for human dignity.
- **Original sin** - hereditary privation/wound affecting appetites and will; not ontological guilt but a state needing remedy.
- **Imputation** - Thomistic treatment: Adam's fault passes by human generation producing a corrupted nature; juridical imputations are shaped by metaphysical account.
 - Site usage: frames debates on Original Sin And Imputation by grounding imputation in ontological continuity rather than merely forensic decree.
- **Concupiscence** - disorder of lower appetites resulting from original sin; explains ongoing inclination to sin.
- **Grace (gratia)** - elevating, healing gift from God that perfects nature toward supernatural end.
- **Potency and act** - metaphysical framework explaining change, virtue, and sanctification.
- **Natural law** - moral norms derived from human nature's ordering to the good; reason-accessible.
- **Beatific vision** - ultimate end; supernatural fulfillment of the image and likeness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source**: to define key anthropological terms (hylomorphism, imago Dei) in systematic theology.
 - **Polemic and exegetical model**: as a model to critique or defend doctrines of Original Sin And Imputation and to interpret Genesis on Image Of God.
