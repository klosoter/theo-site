### TITLE
Christ Our Salvation: Expositions & Proclamations - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century theological retrieval within contemporary Reformed/Anglican scholarship. Webster writes as a systematic and pastoral theologian responding to modern secularizing pressures, liberal reductions of doctrine, and fragmented evangelical practice.
 - Positioned amid renewed interest in classical dogmatics (Barth, Torrance, Calvin, Athanasius) and in the recovery of preaching as theological locus.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church's preaching and proclamation must re-establish Christ as the constitutive center of salvation: the triune God's saving act is embodied, proclaimed, and sacramentally mediated in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
 - Problem addressed: theological and ecclesial tendencies that domesticate Christology (as private piety, moral exemplar, or abstract doctrine) rather than confessing Christ as the decisive, public, efficacious act of God for sinners.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Christological and soteriological texts showing how biblical witness frames salvation as an event of the triune God in Christ.
 - Theological analysis arguing that revelation is Christ-centered and that proclamation is not merely verbal information but an encounter effected by the Word.
 - Practical emphasis on preaching and sacrament - how sermons, baptism, and the Lord's Supper function as means by which the church participates in Christ's saving presence.
 - Final move: pastoral doxology - theological doctrine must lead to worshipful discipleship and ecclesial formation centered on Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical and modern figures: Augustine, Athanasius, Calvin; modern interlocutors include Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance, with critique of liberal theology and certain strains of pietistic individualism.
 - Uses scriptural exegesis, historical dogmatics, and pastoral reflection as integrated sources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word and sacrament), Christology (Incarnation, person and work), Atonement and Justification, Union with Christ, Trinity (as the grounding of salvation), Ecclesiology (preaching, sacraments, witness), Grace.

- **Closing line**
 - The book insists: true Christian proclamation and practice must presuppose and enact the reality that salvation is the triune God's decisive, present act in and through Jesus Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Christocentric retrieval:** doctrine is consistently refracted through the person and work of Christ; Christ is both content and form of revelation.
 - **Proclamation as sacramental event:** preaching is treated as a real, theologically efficacious encounter with the Word, akin to sacramental mediation rather than mere moral exhortation or information-transfer.
 - **Integration of dogmatics and homiletics:** tight coupling of systematic theology with the practice of proclamation and worship.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges liberal accounts that reduce salvation to moral influence or ethical transformation.
 - Corrects pietistic privatizations by reasserting the public, ecclesial, and objective dimensions of Christ's saving work.
 - Nuances certain Barthian moves by insisting on ecclesial mediation (preaching, sacraments) as means, not mere analogies, of Christ's presence.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes language of **"salvation as event"** and **"proclamation as presence"**, insisting on both objective accomplishedness and participatory reception (union with Christ).
 - Articulates a robust sense of Word-event that resists both nominalistic and purely symbolic readings.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected among contemporary Reformed and Anglican theologians; used in seminary courses bridging doctrine and homiletics.
 - Influenced recent debates on sacramental realism, the role of preaching, and the recovery of classical Christology within evangelical and mainline contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for integrating doctrine and worship; exemplary for pastors who want theology to shape preaching.
 - Serves as a corrective to both doctrinal abstraction and devotional superficiality.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word (Verbum)**
 - The revelation of God constituted in Christ; preaching participates in the Word-event.
- **Revelation as Christocentric**
 - Revelation is not propositional data first but the self-disclosure of the triune God in the person of Christ.
- **Incarnation**
 - Ground of all soteriological claims: God's saving action takes place in embodied history.
- **Atonement**
 - Treated as both forensic and participatory - substitutionary accomplishment and the basis for union with Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The central soteriological category for participation in justification, sanctification, and new life.
- **Proclamation**
 - The church's mouthpiece of the Word; an event that mediates Christ's saving presence when faithful to the triune God.
- **Sacrament / sacramental realism**
 - Baptism and the Lord's Supper as means of grace in which believers are genuinely joined to Christ.
- **Trinity**
 - Not an abstract doctrine but the matrix of salvation: Father's gift, Son's obedience, Spirit's appropriation.
- **Grace**
 - God's initiative that precedes and grounds human faith; both objective (already accomplished) and personally applied.
- **Justification**
 - Linked inseparably to Christ's person and work and to the believer's participation through faith.
- **Ecclesial mediation**
 - The conviction that the church, through preaching and sacraments, is the ordinary milieu of salvation.
- **Proclamation as presence**
 - Key shorthand for Webster's claim that preaching effects an encounter with the living Word.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for robust Christocentric soteriology in dogmatics classes.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal, pietistic, and reductionist accounts of salvation.
 - As an **exegetical and homiletical model** showing how preaching can be theologically informed and sacramentally effective.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking systematic theology, ecclesiology, and pastoral practice.
