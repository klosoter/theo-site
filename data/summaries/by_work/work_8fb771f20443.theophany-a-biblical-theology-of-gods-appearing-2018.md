### TITLE
**Theophany: A Biblical Theology of God's Appearing** (2018) - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2018 amid renewed evangelical and Reformed interest in biblical theology, typology, and Trinitarian readings of the Old Testament. Poythress writes from a conservative Reformed, confessional vantage with strengths in biblical-theological method and systematic retrieval.
- **Central thesis**
 - Theophanies (God's visible or audible appearances) form a coherent biblical theology that is Trinitarian, christological, covenantal, and eschatological: Old Testament appearances point to the incarnate and risen Christ and are continued and consummated in the Spirit-led life of the church toward the new creation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey and theological reading of OT theophanies (Yahweh, Angel of the LORD, Divine Presence).
 - Christ as the decisive theophany - fulfillment and climax of prior appearances; identification of pre-incarnate appearances with the Son in continuity with incarnation.
 - The Spirit as the mode of God's ongoing and present appearing after ascension (life, resurrection power, presence in worship and sacraments).
 - Eschatological consummation: final, universal theophany in resurrection and new creation.
 - Practical and doctrinal implications across worship, anthropology (image of God), and systematic loci (revelation, covenant, pneumatology, eschatology).
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Close exegesis of OT and NT narrative texts; dialogue with patristic and Reformation readings that saw pre-incarnate Christophanies; engagement with contemporary biblical theologians and systematicians (broadly represented).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), Trinity, Christology (pre-existence, incarnation, resurrection), Pneumatology (Spirit as present mode of appearing), Covenant theology, Eschatology (individual and cosmic), Anthropology (Imago Dei), Typology and fulfillment, Bibliology (canonical reading).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - God's visible and audible manifestations constitute a single, covenantal drama: theophanies anticipate and are fulfilled in Christ, continue by the Spirit, and culminate in the resurrection and new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses continuity: theophanies are not isolated phenomena but integrated into covenant history, typology, and canonical fulfillment.
 - Strong Trinitarian framing: treats many OT appearances as revelatory acts that point forward to the Son yet involve the Spirit's ongoing role post-ascension.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on reductionist accounts that naturalize or purely metaphorize theophanies; resists views that detach OT manifestations from Christological fulfillment.
 - Counters approaches that separate historia salutis (historical acts) from ordo salutis (soteriological ordering) by showing how appearances shape both narrative and soteriological logic.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refinement of "appearance" language to cover audible, visible, mediated (angelic/Shekinah) and sacramental modes, and a clear taxonomy linking OT categories to NT fulfillments.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable in Reformed circles for integrating covenant theology, typology, and Trinitarian doctrine; used by pastors and teachers for preaching on divine presence and sacramental theology.
 - Cited in biblical-theological conversations for its exegetical breadth and for rehabilitating pre-incarnate Christophany readings.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for connecting biblical narrative to systematic loci; useful for teaching the unity of revelation and for demonstrating how the Spirit mediates Christ's continuing presence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theophany** - God's appearance in history (visible/audible); treated as covenantal acts unfolding toward Christ.
- **Christophany** - Pre‑incarnate appearances of the Son; read as anticipatory and integrative with incarnation.
- **Shekinah / Divine Presence** - OT categories of presence; mapped into New Testament reality in Christ and the Spirit.
- **Angel of the LORD** - Reinterpreted in many instances as a theophanic agent pointing to the Son's activity.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - Theophanies function as types whose antitype is Christ; methodually canonical and christocentric.
- **General and special revelation** - Theophanies exemplify special, concrete revelation; discussion clarifies relation to general revelation.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - Humans as arenas for encountering God's appearing; ethical and eschatological implications toward renewed image.
- **Pneumatology - Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection** - Spirit as the present mode of divine appearing after ascension: empowers, raises, and embodies presence.
- **Resurrection and New Creation** - Final theophany; resurrection as both historical event and anticipatory entrance into new creation presence.
- **Historia salutis vs Ordo salutis** - Theophanic acts are historical events that order soteriological meaning; Poythress resists sharp separation.
- **Covenant presence** - Theophanies framed as covenantal promises and enforcement of divine claims.
- **Anthropomorphic language** - Method for reading and reason about divine appearances without collapsing transcendence.
- **Divine name / revelation acts** - How naming in narratives signals identity and presence (YHWH speech-acts as appearances).

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition/source** for what counts as a theophany and how it functions typologically.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading OT narratives christologically within a canonical framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology connecting revelation, Trinity, pneumatology, and eschatology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against naturalistic, purely metaphorical, or strictly non‑Christocentric interpretations of OT appearances.
