### TITLE
**Edmund P. Clowney, "The Biblical Theology of the Lord's Supper" (The Westminster Theological Journal, 1972)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1970s Reformed academic milieu; shaped by the resurgence of redemptive-historical methods (Vosian influence) and pastoral concerns about sacramental practice in Reformed churches.
 - Reaction against both mechanistic sacramentalism and bald memorialism; conversation with Calvinist, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic Eucharistic theologies.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Lord's Supper must be understood as a covenantal, redemptive-historical ordinance: a means of grace that communicates Christ by the Spirit through the Word, grounded in the Old Testament typology (chiefly Passover and covenant meals) and fulfilled eschatologically in Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Old Testament antecedents: Passover, covenant meals, sacrificial rites as foreshadowing a covenant banquet.
 - New Testament grounding: Institution narratives, Pauline rules (1 Cor 11), Johannine emphases - showing continuity and fulfillment in Christ.
 - Theology of sacramental function: sacraments as signs and seals; presence of Christ is real and spiritual (not corporeal transubstantiation); efficacy is by the Spirit and received in faith.
 - Practical and ecclesial implications: connection of preaching, prayer, and sacrament; corporate dimensions (unity, discipline, discernment); eschatological hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformation voices (Calvin), conservative Reformed scholarship (Vos, Warfield), and critiques of both Lutheran sacramental realism and Zwinglian memorialism. Allusions to confessional standards and New Testament exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, Christology (presence of the risen Lord), pneumatology (Spirit as agent of sacramental efficacy), ecclesiology (communion, discipline), sacramental theology (means of grace; sign and seal), eschatology (banquet motif).

- **Closing line**
 - The Lord's Supper, rightly seen within biblical theology, is a covenantal means of grace: a public, redemptive-historical feast where the Spirit by the Word sustains faith and anticipates the eschatological banquet.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong redemptive-historical framing: sacraments are moments inside God's unfolding covenantal story, not isolated rites.
 - Integration of preaching, prayer, and sacrament: sacramental efficacy is bound to proclamation and corporate prayer, not independent ritual magic.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Push-back against Roman transubstantiation - refuses a physical/ontological metamorphosis of elements.
 - Critique of crude memorialism - insists the Supper is more than commemoration; it objectively presents Christ's promise to believers.
 - Correction to purely individualistic piety: stresses corporate, covenantal character and the necessity of ecclesial discipline (1 Cor 11).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the term **"covenant meal"** as the key conceptual pivot linking OT types and NT fulfillment.
 - Frames sacramental presence as **"spiritual, objective, and covenantal"** - objective in promise, spiritual in mode.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clarifying sacramental theology by biblical-theological method.
 - Influential in pastoral-theological teaching: used to recover sacramental seriousness without sacramentalism.
 - Cited in later treatments that seek a middle path between memorialism and transubstantiation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how biblical theology can inform sacramental practice.
 - Useful for pastors teaching the Supper, for seminarians on sacramental doctrine, and for theologians seeking an ecclesial, covenantal shape to sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper**
 - Covenant meal instituted by Christ that proclaims and applies redemption.

- **Means of grace**
 - Instruments (Word, sacraments, prayer) by which Christ communicates benefits to believers; Supper functions here in union with the preached Word.

- **Covenant meal**
 - Central descriptor: sacrament as the renewing and sealing of covenantal fellowship.

- **Redemptive-historical / Biblical theology**
 - Method: reading the Supper in the sweep of redemptive history (Passover -> Christ -> eschatological banquet).

- **Passover typology**
 - Key OT antecedent showing deliverance, covenant, and meal imagery fulfilled in Christ.

- **Spiritual presence**
 - Presence of Christ in the Supper is real but mediated by the Spirit and the promise, not by physical presence of his body.

- **Sign and seal**
 - Reformed categories: elements signify Christ's death and seal the promise to faith.

- **Objective promise**
 - The Supper conveys an objective promise of Christ to the covenant community, not merely a subjective remembrance.

- **Efficacy by the Spirit**
 - Sacramental grace is applied by the Holy Spirit through the Word and received by faith.

- **Unity and discernment (1 Cor 11)**
 - The Supper presupposes and cultivates church unity and demands self-examination and discipline.

- **Eschatological banquet**
 - The Supper as anticipation and foretaste of the heavenly feast.

- **Preaching and sacrament union**
 - Emphasizes inseparable relation: sacrament without proclamation loses its covenantal connective tissue.

- **Prayer in the Supper**
 - Corporate prayer is intrinsic, not peripheral - shapes reception and thanksgiving.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, redemptive-historical account of the Lord's Supper.
- As a **polemic** resource against both Roman Catholic sacramental ontology and minimalist memorialism.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how Type->Antitype logic can ground sacramental practice.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking sacramental theology to preaching, prayer, ecclesial discipline, and eschatology.
