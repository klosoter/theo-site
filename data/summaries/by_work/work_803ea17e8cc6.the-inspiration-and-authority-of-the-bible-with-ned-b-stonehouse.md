### TITLE
The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible (with Ned B. Stonehouse) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; reaction to modernism, neo-orthodoxy, and liberal critiques of Scripture.
 - Linked to Westminster/Princeton Reformed circles; conversation partners include Ned B. Stonehouse (colleague and moderator of confessional Reformed responses), Charles Hodge/Benjamin B. Warfield legacy, and opponents such as Karl Barth and liberal-critical scholarship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible's authority rests on its divine self-attestation: Scripture is authoritative because it is the Word of God, and this authority is witnessed internally by the Holy Spirit to the believer.
 - Problem addressed: How to affirm objective, propositional divine revelation and binding authority of Scripture without appealing to autonomous human reason as final arbiter.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Critique of autonomous reason and natural theology as ultimate judges of Scripture.
 - Affirmation that Revelation is propositional and verbal - Scripture communicates divine truth legitimately grasped by faith and reason under the Spirit's illumination.
 - Defense of **self-attestation**: Scripture authenticates itself in that God, through the Spirit, gives internal testimony to its truth; this is not mere psychological persuasion but epistemic warrant.
 - Clarification of **epistemological circularity**: a Christian epistemic circle (Scripture grounds belief in God; God guarantees Scripture) is legitimate and unavoidable; alleged vicious circularity is rebutted.
 - Polemic against neo-orthodoxy and non-propositional models (which reduce Scripture to existential encounter) and against liberal skepticism (which denies divine origin).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Warfieldian conservative defenders of inspiration; interacts critically with Barthian neo-orthodoxy, existentialist readings (e.g., Bultmann), and liberal critical scholarship.
 - Uses Reformed confessions and patristic/testimonial traditions to ground claims; interlocutor Stonehouse supplies moderating confessional perspective.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs general), inspiration, inerrancy/infallibility, authority of Scripture, Holy Spirit testimony, epistemology of faith, covenantal understanding informing hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - The Bible's authority is ultimate because it is God's self‑disclosure; affirmed as propositional, self-attesting, and epistemically basic for Christian truth - Scripture is the norming norm witnessed by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong presuppositional epistemology: Christian faith provides the necessary presuppositions for intelligible knowledge; Scripture is not proven by neutral reason but by the divine witness.
 - Emphasis on **self-attestation** clarified against both naive foundationalism and purely existential encounters.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors and rivals**
 - Corrects liberals who make Scripture a human product; resists neo-orthodox reduction of Scripture to a mere encounter with the Word (as opposed to propositional content).
 - Moves beyond Warfield's juridical proofs by insisting that ultimate warrant is divine and internal, not merely historical-empirical demonstration.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise refining of **self-attestation** vs. **self-evidence**: Scripture does not coerce unbelievers by intrinsic self-evidence but becomes self-authenticating through the Spirit to those who repent and believe.
 - Re-articulation of epistemological circularity as positively unavoidable and institutionally legitimized in Christian knowledge.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant influence in conservative Reformed and presuppositional apologetics (notably at Westminster and among Van Tillians).
 - Provoked debates with neo-orthodox and evidentialist camps; used as a formative text in training ministers in doctrines of Scripture and apologetics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for clarifying the relation of revelation, epistemology, and apologetics; indispensable for students exploring presuppositional theology and confessional defenses of biblical authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation / self-authentication**
 - Scripture's claim to be God's Word is confirmed by the Spirit's internal testimony to the believer; not reducible to mere subjective feeling.

- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Epistemic stance that Christian truth-claims are the basic presuppositions necessary for coherent thinking about reality.

- **Propositional revelation**
 - Revelation consists in propositional truths (statements) given by God in Scripture, against purely existential or symbolic accounts.

- **Verbal plenary inspiration**
 - The doctrine that God inspired the words of Scripture in their entirety while allowing human authorship and style.

- **Inerrancy / infallibility**
 - Biblical truthfulness in what it affirms; Van Til insists on essential correspondence to divine truth, grounded in divine authorship.

- **Holy Spirit internal testimony**
 - The Spirit's work of assuring believers that Scripture is God's Word - the epistemic mechanism of self-attestation.

- **Epistemological circularity**
 - The claim that Christian knowledge depends on presupposing Christian truths (Scripture and God), which is defended as a benign, unavoidable circle.

- **Antithesis**
 - The fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought-systems; autonomous reason is rejected as neutral.

- **Transcendental argument (TA)**
 - A move to show that preconditions for intelligible experience presuppose the Christian God; used to displace naturalistic presuppositions.

- **Special vs general revelation**
 - Distinction showing Scripture's unique normative role over and above natural revelation.

- **Norming norm**
 - Scripture as the final standard by which doctrine and life are judged.

- **Autonomy of reason**
 - Rejected as an ultimate criterion; reason is valid but must be grounded in divine revelation.

- **Covenantal context**
 - Scripture read within covenantal narrative and redemptive-historical framework, not abstracted into purely propositional syllogisms.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a primary apologetic/presuppositional defense of Scripture's authority and self-attestation.
 - As a polemic text against neo-orthodoxy and liberal critical approaches to revelation.
 - As a conceptual pivot in teaching the epistemology of Christian doctrine and the doctrine of Scripture.
