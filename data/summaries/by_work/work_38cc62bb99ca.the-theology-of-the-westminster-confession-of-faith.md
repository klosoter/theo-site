### TITLE
The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed retrieval (Murray lectured and wrote in the 1940s-1960s; book published 1959). Situated within conservative Presbyterian/Reformed scholarship reacting to liberal theology and systematizing historic Westminster orthodoxy for modern ministry and academy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Westminster Confession embodies a coherent, scripturally grounded Reformed theology in which the covenantal structure, Christ's objective work and union with believers, and divine sovereignty integrate all loci of doctrine. Murray aims to reconstruct and defend that coherence against both modern revisionism and novel covenant readings.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition follows the Confession's order while pressing theological principles beneath its formulations.
 - Major moves: Scripture as normative → God and decree → covenantal ordering of Scripture's economy → sin, Christ and redemption → application (justification, sanctification, union) → church, sacraments, civil order.
 - Emphasis on the objective, forensic character of redemption together with the personal union of believer and Christ as the ground of application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Westminster divines (primary), Calvin and the Puritan tradition (Owen, Rutherford), patristic and scholastic touchpoints; engages contemporary interlocutors including neo-Reformed and covenant theologians (notably contrasted with strands associated with Meredith G. Kline) and critics from liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, God (Trinity), decree/predestination, creation and providence, covenant theology (works/grace), sin and fall, Christology (person and work), justification, sanctification, union with Christ, law and gospel, sacraments, church and civil magistrate.
- **Closing line:** Murray presents the Westminster system as a disciplined, covenantal theology centered on Christ's objective redemption and the believer's federal and vital union with him, undergirded by divine sovereignty and Scripture's normative authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **objectivity** of Christ's work (forensic satisfaction) together with an equally robust account of **vital union** as the means of application.
 - Systematic recovery of the Confession as a theological *architecture* rather than mere historical document.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against theological liberalism's subjective or moralized readings of the Confession.
 - Distinguishes Murray's covenantal reading from certain **Klinean** emphases by maintaining continuity in the normative moral law within the covenant and by resisting an overly typological/eschatological rewiring of federal theology.
 - Responds to what some label **"intrusion ethics"** (the tendency to read eschatological or covenantal motifs as primary ethical determinants), arguing instead for ethics grounded in God's revealed law together with covenantal relations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Clarifies the interplay of **federal** (legal/representative) and **vital** (organic/union) categories; sharp delineation of law/gospel functions within covenant frames.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed seminaries as a standard treatment of the Confession; influential among conservative Presbyterians and Reformed scholars; a corrective resource for those who treat the Confession historically rather than theologically.
- **Enduring value:** Reliable exegetical-theological model for teaching Westminster theology, particularly valuable for its synthesis of doctrine of salvation (objective work + union) and its sober method for retrieving confessional theology in contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith:** The organizing text Murray explicates; treated as normative theological system rather than only historical artifact.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** Federal categories used to map human condition and redemptive order.
 - Murray stresses continuity and distinction: covenantal promises grounded in God's decree and Christ's mediation.
- **Federal Headship:** Representation (Adam/Christ) as the legal framework for imputation of sin and righteousness.
- **Union with Christ:** Vital, organic relation by which the benefits of Christ's work are applied; complements forensic justification.
- **Justification by Faith:** Forensic declaration grounded in Christ's righteousness; Murray defends its central role without collapsing into subjectivism.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive outworking of justification; moral transformation grounded in union and Spirit work, not mere ethicalism.
- **Divine Decree / Predestination:** Sovereignty of God in election and reprobation, integrated into covenant ordering.
- **Law and Gospel:** Distinct functions; law as rule of life and convicting tutor, gospel as promise and provision in Christ.
- **Sacraments (Sign and Seal):** Means of grace that signify and confirm covenant promises; instrumental within union with Christ.
- **Church and Civil Magistrate:** Ecclesiology and polity construed within confessional and covenantal parameters.
- **Klinean Covenant Theology:** A contemporary alternative Murray engages - emphasizes covenantal structure and typology; Murray affirms covenantal centrality but resists wholesale methodological shifts Kline proposes.
- **Intrusion Ethics:** Phrase used in recent debates to describe reading covenant-eschatology into ethics; Murray cautions against reducing moral theology to eschatological 'intrusions' and instead grounds ethics in law, covenant, and union.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed theology and the theological content of the Westminster Confession.
- As a **polemic resource** against theological liberalism and against readings that fragment federal and vital aspects of salvation (including select Klinean emphases).
- As an **exegetical-model** for deriving systematic loci from confessional texts-especially in soteriology, covenant, and sacramental theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the relation of divine sovereignty, covenant, and union with Christ across doctrinal loci.
