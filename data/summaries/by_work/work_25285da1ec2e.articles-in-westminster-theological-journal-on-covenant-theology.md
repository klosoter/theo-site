### TITLE
Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on Covenant Theology (Covenant of Grace; Confessional Formulations of Covenant)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Westminster Theological Journal (est. 1938) is a seminary-based Reformed evangelical venue; articles on covenant theology appear across mid-20th to 21st centuries amid debates over federal theology, dispensationalism, new covenant theology, and redemptive-historical approaches.
 - The milieu combines confessional fidelity (Westminster/continental Reformed formularies), rigorous biblical exegesis, and engagement with contemporary systematic and historical-theological critics.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The journal corpus consistently defends the **unity and centrality of covenant theology** for interpreting Scripture and formulating doctrine, arguing that the **Covenant of Grace**-properly understood and confessed in Reformed formularies-is the controlling structure of redemptive history.
 - Secondary problem: how to articulate confessional covenant formulations so they are exegetically sound and pastorally useful in face of competing systems.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of covenant passages (e.g., Genesis, Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, Hebrews) to establish continuity of God's gracious covenant promise culminating in Christ.
 - Theological synthesis: articulation of federal categories-covenant of works, covenant of grace, federal headship, covenant signs-and their systematic placement within soteriology, Christology, and ecclesiology.
 - Confessional analysis: tracing how Westminster and related Reformed confessions formulate covenant doctrines; defense of confessional language against revision or reduction.
 - Polemic and correction: critique of dispensational, overly "progressive," or anti-confessional accounts that fragment redemptive history or deny covenant unity.
 - Pastoral and liturgical application: implications for sacramental theology (baptism/communion), catechesis, and covenantal pastoral practice (household catechesis, covenant renewal).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: classical Reformed divines and confessions (Westminster Standards, Heidelberg Catechism), biblical exegesis literature, and contemporary opponents including dispensationalists and some strands of "new covenant" or progressive covenantalism.
 - Frequent engagement with exegetes and historians concerned with covenantal language and redemptive-historical method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (promise and fulfilment in Christ), covenant (works/grace, administrations), Christology (mediator/head of covenant), soteriology (federal imputation, union with Christ), sacraments (signs and seals in covenant household), ecclesiology (covenant community and continuity), typology and hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - Across the WTJ contributions the theological center of gravity is emphatically confessional-federal: the Covenant of Grace, as confessed in Reformed standards, is the hermeneutical and doctrinal axis binding Scripture, sacraments, and church life under the lordship of Christ the covenant head.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strenuous insistence on **one Covenant of Grace** with multiple administrations rather than a succession of ontologically distinct covenants.
 - Emphasis on **federal headship**-Adam and Christ as covenant representatives-as the key to understanding imputation, promise, and continuity.
 - Careful linking of confessional formulations to biblical exegesis: confessions are treated both as doctrinal summaries and as critical theological tools.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensational compartmentalization of redemptive history and critiques "new covenant" proffers that collapse covenant distinctions or downplay sacramental continuity.
 - Pushes back on pietistic or experiential reductions that divorce covenant theology from confessional and exegetical anchors.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refined use of terms such as **administration** (distinct from ontological covenant changes), **covenant sign-and-seal language**, and a precise delimitation of "continuity vs. discontinuity" as hermeneutical categories rather than rhetorical poles.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in seminary teaching and Reformed pastoral practice; reinforced confessional commitments in Reformed academic circles and contributed to the revival of covenantal catechesis and sacramental theology.
 - Provided a scholarly bulwark for conservative Reformed responses to evangelical fragmentation on covenantal questions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a disciplined exegetical-model and confessional check for contemporary covenant theology; valuable for teaching, polemical clarity, and integrating doctrine with worship and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace** - The single, promised covenant of redemption fulfilled in Christ; central thesis of the articles.
- **Covenant of Works** - Prelapsarian covenant with Adam; used to explain imputation, law, and the necessity of a Mediator.
- **Federal Headship** - Representative functioning of Adam/Christ; key to understanding guilt, righteousness, and imputation.
- **Administration(s) of the Covenant** - Distinct historical administrations (e.g., promise, law, gospel) without ontological covenant rupture.
- **Confessional Formulations** - Westminster and continental confessions as authoritative summaries and interpretive guides for covenant teaching.
 - Relation: confessions mediate between biblical exegesis and systematic formulations.
- **Typology / Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic** - Use of types and antitypes to read Scripture as unified covenant history.
- **Signs and Seals** - Baptism and Lord's Supper as covenantal markers; continuity of sign use emphasized.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity** - Nuanced categories to judge covenantal relation across covenants; emphasis on essential continuity in promise and promise-fulfillment.
- **Mediator / Mediatorial Kingship** - Christ as the one who effects and administers the Covenant of Grace.
- **Imputation** - Legal transfer of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness within federal schema.
- **Covenant Community (Church)** - Ecclesiological implications: the church as visible covenant society with sacramental identity.
- **Covenant Renewal** - Pastoral-practical outworking of covenant theology in worship and household instruction.
- **Redemptive Promise** - Promise-oriented nature of covenant revealed progressively and fulfilled in Christ.

- **How this material is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source: clarifies classical Reformed definitions of covenant terms in systematic theology and confessional teaching.
 - As polemic: supplies concise rebuttals to dispensational and revisionist covenant schemes.
 - As an exegetical model: offers redemptive-historical readings of covenant texts used in biblical theology and homiletics.
 - As a conceptual pivot for sacramental and ecclesial practice: grounds baptismal and communion theology and forms the basis for catechesis and covenant pastoral care.
