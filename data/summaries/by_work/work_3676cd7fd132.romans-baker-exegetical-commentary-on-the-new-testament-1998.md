### TITLE
Romans (Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, 1998) - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1998 in the Baker Exegetical Commentary series; product of late-20th-century evangelical, Reformed scholarship engaging heightened Pauline studies, the "covenant vs. new perspective" debates, and renewed interest in Pauline theology and Israel.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Schreiner reads Romans as Paul's theological answer to how God's righteousness is displayed in justification and election, culminating in the problem of Israel's present rejection and its future-arguing that God remains faithful to his covenant promises and that Israel's rejection is not final.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Careful verse-by-verse exegesis of Romans, with sustained attention to rhetoric, syntax, and Pauline theology.
 - Romans 9-11 analyzed as a unit: (1) Paul's lament over Israel, (2) doctrine of election and mercy, (3) mechanics of partial hardening and grafting (olive-tree metaphor), (4) eschatological hope for Israel's restoration.
 - Central claim for Romans 11: the hardening of Israel is temporary, a mysterious providential act "until the fullness of the Gentiles," after which corporate Israel will be ingrafted again.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary); interacts with modern interpreters (e.g., Dunn, Moo, Cranfield, N. T. Wright, Sanders). Draws on classical Reformed hermeneutics while engaging "new perspective" critiques.
- **Doctrines treated:** Election, justification, covenant faithfulness, eschatology (Israel's future), ecclesiology (Jew/Gentile relations), divine sovereignty and human responsibility, the remnant, and Pauline soteriology.
- **Closing line:** Schreiner's Romans affirms God's righteousness as both vindicated in justification and displayed in his faithful, eschatological commitment to Israel - a theology that preserves covenant promises while integrating Gentile inclusion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - A consistently **conservative, Reformed** reading that balances divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
 - Firm insistence that Romans 11 promises a future, corporate salvation/ingathering of Israel rather than simple spiritualization or complete replacement.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Romans 11 to mere metaphor for the church or that claim Israel's rejection is permanent (i.e., classical supersessionism).
 - Engages the "new perspective" by maintaining traditional readings of justification and election while interacting with sociocultural insights.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not so much neologisms as terminological precision: tight definitions of "remnant," "hardening," and "fullness" tied to Pauline context rather than later ecclesiological redefinitions.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used in conservative seminaries and Reformed circles as a readable, technical exegesis of Romans.
 - Often cited in debates over Israel's future and in critiques of supersessionism; serves as a bridge between rigorous exegesis and pastoral application.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of combining careful grammatical-historical exegesis with theological synthesis; valuable for discussions on covenant fidelity, Pauline eschatology, and Jewish-Gentile relations in the church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Remnant:** Paul's concept of a preserved faithful subset within Israel; Schreiner emphasizes its grounding in God's electing mercy rather than human merit.
- **Hardening:** Temporary judicial act by God permitting Israel's partial rejection; not absolute or irreversible.
- **Fullness of the Gentiles (pleroma):** A key chronological marker in Romans 11:25; Schreiner reads it as a boundary point after which God turns again to Israel.
- **Engrafting / olive tree metaphor:** Corporate, covenantal imagery: natural branches (Israel), wild branches (Gentiles), with future regrafting of natural branches as a real eschatological event.
- **All Israel will be saved:** Interpreted as an eschatological corporate fulfillment of God's promises to ethnic Israel (not a universalistic claim).
- **Election:** Corporate and individual dimensions; Schreiner insists election retains both corporate covenantal shape and personal application.
- **Covenant faithfulness (fides/faithfulness of God):** Central explanatory axiom-God's promises to Israel remain trustworthy and determinative for the plot of redemptive history.
- **Mystery (mysterion):** Paul's term for the partial hardening; Schreiner highlights its revelatory and eschatological dimensions, not mere secrecy.
- **Justification / righteousness of God:** Core Pauline soteriological themes; Schreiner defends the classical Reformed understanding against reductionist readings.
- **Doxology (Rom 11:33-36):** The theological summit interpreting God's wisdom in election and Israel's fate.
- **Israel's natural branches:** Ethnic Israel whose future restoration is affirmed.
- **Grafted branches:** Gentile believers incorporated into the covenant people by grace.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for close Pauline exegesis and theological synthesis.
 - As a **polemic resource** against supersessionism and reductive "spiritual Israel" readings.
 - As a **definition source** for terms like remnant, fullness of the Gentiles, and corporate election in teaching and sermon preparation.
