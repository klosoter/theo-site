### TITLE
Calvin and the Reformation (selected writings of John Calvin; ed. William Stacy Johnson) 
Primary author: **John Calvin** - selections emphasizing Reformation theology as articulated in the Institutes and related treatises/sermons.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation, Geneva as polemical and pastoral center. Calvin writes within humanist exegetical method and Protestant confessional debates with Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and radical Reformers.
 - The edition (Johnson, ed.) collects Calvin's canonical expositions chiefly from the Institutes and shorter tracts/sermons that shaped Reformed identity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a coherent Protestant systematic theology centered on **God's glory, Christ's redemptive work, and the Spirit's renewing effect** - answering how sinners are known, justified, and transformed while maintaining divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Foundation: human sin and corruption (origin and nature of sin) → need for divine remedy.
 - Remedy: Christ's person and work as the exclusive ground of salvation; justification by faith alone.
 - Effect: faith necessarily issues in repentance and progressive sanctification; the Spirit preserves and conforms believers to Christ.
 - Pastoral moves: apply doctrine to church life, sacraments, discipline, and assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine strongly (recovery and reinterpretation), polemics with scholastic Catholics (Aquinas), debates with Luther (agreement on justification, divergence on some pastoral and ecclesial points), and criticisms of Anabaptists.
 - Uses Scripture as primary warrant; classical and patristic sources read through Reformation concerns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Sin** (original and actual), **Providence**, **Election**, **Justification by faith**, **Union with Christ**, **Repentance**, **Sanctification (definitive and progressive)**, **Church and sacraments**, **Assurance**.
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin's theological center of gravity: the all-sufficient, effectual work of Christ applied by the Spirit to a ruined humanity, producing justification and a Spirit-wrought, progressive conformity to Christ for the glory of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of **forensic justification** with **union with Christ** - justification is forensic but inseparable from mystical union that enables sanctification.
 - Persistent insistence on **God's absolute sovereignty** in salvation without collapsing human responsibility.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against late-medieval scholasticism: rejects merits, infused righteousness, and sacramentalex opere operato models; emphasizes imputed righteousness.
 - Compared to Luther: closer pastoral systematization and ecclesial ordering (Geneva discipline), more developed doctrine of **progressive sanctification** as distinct yet inseparably linked to justification.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes **"union with Christ"** as the nexus connecting justification, sanctification, and perseverance.
 - Sharp binary between **definitive (positional) sanctification** in justification and **progressive sanctification** in the Christian life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Principal formative source for Reformed confessions (Belgic, Heidelberg Catechism, Westminster).
 - Influenced later Reformed scholastics, Puritans, and modern Reformed systematicians; used polemically against Roman Catholic and Arminian positions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined biblical theology linking doctrine and pastoral care; indispensable for teaching on sin, justification, and the Christian life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin**
 - Human nature corrupted by Adam; transmitted, universal, and culpable (Institutes II.1-3).
- **Actual sin**
 - Concrete sinful acts flowing from corrupt nature; both voluntary and unwilling dimensions considered.
- **Total depravity**
 - Emphasis that every faculty is affected by sin; not annihilation of faculties but radical disability toward God.
- **Justification (forensic)**
 - God declares the sinner righteous on account of Christ's obedience; imputed righteousness, not infused.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The pivotal relational reality by which benefits of Christ (justification, adoption, sanctification) are applied.
- **Faith**
 - Fiducial reliance on Christ that involves knowledge, assent, and trust; instrument of justification (Institutes III.2).
- **Repentance**
 - A true change of mind and life produced by the Spirit; inseparable from faith yet distinct as fruit and evidence (Institutes III.3).
- **Definitive sanctification**
 - Positional set-apartness in Christ effected in justification; believers declared holy before God.
- **Progressive sanctification**
 - Ongoing transformation by the Spirit in the believer's life; real but imperfect until glorification.
 - Calvin stresses both assurance of status and the necessity of ongoing mortification and vivification.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance of all events; includes permission and ordination of evil within sovereign purposes.
- **Election**
 - Unconditional divine choice for salvation; tied to God's glory and mercy, not human foreseen merit.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in objective promises and the Spirit's witness; pastoral emphasis on evidences (fruits) and sacraments.
- **Imputation**
 - Key forensic mechanism: Christ's righteousness credited to believers; sin imputed to Christ in penal bearing.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed formulations of justification, sanctification, and original sin.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Roman Catholic soteriology and later Arminian revisions.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for linking Pauline soteriology (Romans, Galatians) with pastoral practice and ecclesial discipline.
