### TITLE
Karl Barth and the Problem of the Ordo Salutis (Bruce L. McCormack, secondary) - reading Barth on **Historia Salutis** vs **Ordo Salutis**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century reception of Karl Barth (primarily through Church Dogmatics) refracted by late-20th-century systematic concerns; McCormack writes as a Barth specialist reconstructing Barth's soteriological method and its implications for Reformed dogmatics.
 - The controversy sits within broader Protestant debates over scholastic ordering of salvation (ordo salutis) versus narratival/evental accounts (historia salutis).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Barth resists treating salvation as a sequence of logically ordered moments (ordo salutis). Instead he grounds soteriology in the one, historical, and decisive act of God in Christ (historia salutis). McCormack reads Barth as shifting the question from "Which comes first?" to "What is the one saving act in which all these realities subsist?"

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Expose classical ordo salutis as a schematic, juridical ordering inherited from scholastic and post-Reformation Reformed theology.
 - Show Barth's methodological move: Christocentric event ontology - salvation is an indivisible event (the reconciling act of God) that contains what the ordo attempts to sequence.
 - Trace how theological predicates (election, calling, justification, sanctification, glorification) are reframed as aspects or dimensions of the one historia salutis rather than discrete, temporally or logically prior moments.
 - Analyze Barth's use of Scripture and Christology to justify rejection of a formal ordo and defend a single redemptive act.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics).
 - Secondary/interlocutors: Reformed scholastic tradition (Calvinic schema), later neo-Reformed writers who maintain ordo schemas; McCormack interprets Barth against these backgrounds.
 - Methodological interlocution with historical-critical concerns around concept formation in dogmatics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (order and nature of salvation), election, justification, reconciliation, calling, sanctification, eschatology; undergirding doctrines: Christology, Trinity, revelation (Word-event).

- **Closing line**
 - Barth, as read by McCormack, relocates the question of salvation's order into the singular, Christocentric historia salutis: salvation is not a series of separable acts but the one triune act of God in Christ that realizes and contains what scholastic orders seek to enumerate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the primacy of the saving **event in Christ** over any schematic ordering of soteriological moments.
 - Methodological unity: doctrinal loci are to be read and organized by the single redemptive act rather than abstract logical sequences.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects classical ordo salutis by arguing it risks abstracting salvation into humanly conceivable steps and thus fragments the unity of God's act.
 - Contrasts with Reformed scholasticism that privileges a logical or temporal ordering (e.g., forensic justification preceding sanctification).

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reintroduces and centralizes **historia salutis** as the theological category that preserves the unity of salvation.
 - Treats soteriological terms as **aspects** of one act rather than autonomous events.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among neo-Barthian and postliberal theologians; provoked renewed debates in Reformed circles about the utility and orthodoxy of ordo salutis schemata.
 - Provided a template for dialectical approaches to systematic theology that prioritize event/Word over schematic sequence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Helps students and teachers rethink method: how Christology and the Trinity constrain and reorder soteriological formulations.
 - Serves as a corrective to scholastic compartmentalization while pressing modern dogmatics to preserve historical concreteness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ordo Salutis**
 - Traditional sequence of salvific stages (calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification).
 - Barth (via McCormack) is critical of treating it as a fixed logical or temporal order.

- **Historia Salutis**
 - The narrative/historical act of salvation centered in Christ; for Barth the determinative category.
 - Serves to unite what ordo partitions.

- **Event ontology / event of reconciliation**
 - Salvation conceived as a single divine action; all soteriological predicates are related to this event.

- **Election**
 - Re-understood as election in Christ, within the one saving act rather than a prior metaphysical decree separable from reconciliation.

- **Calling / Effective calling**
 - Not a discrete step but an aspect of the one salvific act realized in proclamation and Spirit.

- **Justification & Reconciliation**
 - Treated as dimensions of the one act of God in Christ - forensic and relational aspects within historia salutis.

- **Christocentric ordering**
 - Ordering doctrine by the person and work of Christ rather than by abstract categories.

- **Unity of divine action**
 - Emphasis on God's singular, undivided redemptive act in Trinitarian economy.

- **Logical vs. Historical priority**
 - Distinction between what is logically prior in doctrinal schema and what is historically prior or actualized in Christ.

- **Dialectical theology method**
 - Use of paradox and event-centered proclamation rather than systematic sequencing.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the term historia salutis and Barth's rejection of classical ordo schemas.
- As a **polemic** weapon against scholastic compartmentalization of soteriology.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reinterpreting salvation texts through the lens of the one Christ-event and for integrating Christology, Trinity, and soteriology.
