### TITLE
**Gilles Emery, The Trinitarian Theology of St Thomas Aquinas (secondary study of Thomas Aquinas)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary scholastic revival by a Dominican systematician interpreting medieval sources for modern theology. Positioned in late 20th/early 21st-century Trinitarian renewal that seeks to read Aquinas on his own metaphysical and patristic terms rather than through modern propositional grids.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Emery argues that Aquinas presents a coherent and theologically orthodox account of the Trinity rooted in **divine simplicity** and the metaphysics of **procession and relation**, thereby protecting personal distinctions without admitting any real inequality or ontological subordination among the Divine Persons.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical groundwork: close readings of key Thomistic loci (Summa Theologiae Ia q.27-43; scriptural commentaries; Sentences commentaries) to recover Aquinas's usage of Augustine, Boethius, and Pseudo-Dionysius.
 - Metaphysical synthesis: shows how **simplicity**, **principle of procession**, and **relation as real relation** produce distinct persons without composition.
 - Doctrinal consequences: accounts for filiation and spiration as eternal relations of origin that secure personhood and mutual indwelling (perichoresis) while excluding any ontological subordination.
 - Methodological claim: advocates reading Aquinas with a hermeneutic that respects his metaphysical categories instead of imposing modern functionalist or political categories.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** St. Thomas Aquinas (primary), Augustine, Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius; modern interlocutors include Karl Rahner and Karl Barth (hermeneutical frames), and contemporary debates such as proponents and critics of Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (immanent and economic), divine simplicity, relations of origin (filiation, spiration), personhood, naming and appropriation, revelation vs. natural theology, Christology implications.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Emery's study presents Aquinas as a metaphysically disciplined Trinitarian whose account of processions and relations secures genuine personal distinction without compromising divine unity or equality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that Aquinas' Trinitarian theology must be read through the twin lenses of **divine simplicity** and **analogical predication**; relations are real but not compositional.
 - Careful articulation of how procession (filioque/spiration) grounds personal properties while preserving absolute equality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on readings that retrofit **functionalist** or role-based hierarchies into Aquinas (relevant to the Eternal Functional Subordination debates) - Emery argues Aquinas gives no warrant for eternal subordination of will or authority.
 - Employs but also qualifies **Rahner's Rule**: Emery uses Rahner's hermeneutical admonition to respect the Fathers' categories when reading Aquinas, yet resists Rahner/Barth re-formulations that displace Thomistic metaphysics with purely existential or revelationist categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies terminological distinctions in Thomistic Latin (relationes, subsistentia, procedere) for contemporary debate; emphasizes **order of origin** vs. order of time or value.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted in Catholic and ecumenical Trinitarian studies as a reliable Thomistic account; increasingly cited in conservative and centrist critiques of EFS and in constructive proposals that seek a classical alternative to modern functional language.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a model of historically sensitive, philosophically robust Thomistic theology useful for bridging medieval doctrine and contemporary controversies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine simplicity:** God has no composition; persons are not parts, making relational distinctions non-compositional.
- **Relationes (real relations):** Relations that are rooted in origin (principium) and constitute personal distinctions without dividing the divine essence.
- **Procession / Processio:** The eternal emanation(s) (filiations, spiration) that ground personhood; central to explaining origin without subordination.
- **Filiation & Spiration:** The Son's and Spirit's origins respectively; explained as eternal relations of origin, not functional inferiority.
- **Persona / Subsistentia:** Person as subsistent relation in Aquinas - the term by which the divine persons are spoken of without implying separability.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being):** Methodological principle governing how human language analogically refers to God; prevents category mistakes in Trinitarian talk.
- **Appropriation:** Legitimate ascription of operations to persons without implying exclusive or hierarchical ontology.
- **Immanent vs. Economic Trinity:** Emery follows Aquinas in showing continuity: economic realities reveal immanent relations, but the immanent Trinity is described in metaphysical terms.
- **Perichoresis:** Mutual indwelling framed within Thomistic simplicity and relational ontology.
- **Order of origin:** The metaphysical ordering of persons by principium, distinct from temporal or ontological subordination.
- **Rahner's Rule (hermeneutical use):** Emery invokes Rahner's maxim to insist on respecting patristic categories in reading Aquinas, while resisting reductive reformulations.
- **Barth's Reformulation (contrast):** Emery critiques over-privileging of revelation-language that eclipses Thomistic metaphysics; warns against collapsing metaphysical grounding into purely existential categories.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) - application:** Emery's Thomistic reading is frequently deployed to argue that classical doctrine does not support EFS claims of eternal subordination of will/authority.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Thomistic Trinitarian categories (simplicity, procession, relation).
 - As a **polemic resource** and corrective in debates over EFS and against modernist reinterpretations. 
 - As an **exegetical-method model** showing how to apply Rahner's hermeneutical caution while resisting Barthian displacement of metaphysical categories.
