### TITLE
**Alfred J. Freddoso, "Introduction" to Luis de Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Jesuit theology (Molina) embedded in the De auxiliis controversy with Dominican Thomists (e.g., Domingo Báñez).
 - Freddoso's introduction is a modern scholarly framing (translation/critical edition) aimed at analytic-readers and historical-theologians; it situates Molina within both his Counter-Reformation milieu and contemporary analytic debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Molina seeks to reconcile **divine omniscience and providence** with **genuine libertarian human freedom**; Freddoso presents Molina's chief move-scientia media-as the key to that reconciliation and explicates its stakes.
- **Core argument / structure (Freddoso's explanatory moves)**
 - Explicate Molina's threefold taxonomy of divine knowledge:
 - **Scientia naturalis** (knowledge of all possibilities).
 - **Scientia media** (middle knowledge: counterfactuals of free creaturely decisions).
 - **Scientia libera/actualis** (knowledge of the actual world as willed).
 - Show how scientia media licenses God to know what free agents would do in any hypothetical situation without determining those choices.
 - Connect that knowledge to a model of providential ordering: God chooses to create a world in light of middle knowledge, thereby securing foreknowledge and providential outcomes while preserving libertarian freedom.
 - Anticipate and summarize principal objections (e.g., grounding objection, worries about explanatory priority, charge of making counterfactuals metaphysically mysterious).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Luis de Molina.
 - Historical interlocutors: Dominican Thomists (Báñez), later Jesuits and scholastics.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: analytic philosophers and theologians who revived or reformulated Molinism (modern Molinists and critics).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine omniscience, providence, predestination, grace, concurrence (divine causation), libertarian freedom, contingency, foreknowledge vs. foreordination.
- **Closing line**
 - Freddoso frames Molina as a pivotal figure who invented a conceptually precise mechanism (scientia media) that still functions as the central instrument for reconciling God's comprehensive knowledge and governance with genuine creaturely freedom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Freddoso emphasizes Molina's careful logical ordering and the epistemic distinctness of the three kinds of divine knowledge-clarifying ambiguities in earlier summaries of Molinism.
 - He highlights Molina's insistence that middle knowledge is neither determined by divine decrees nor reducible to mere logical entailment.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Presents Molinism as a corrective to Thomist accounts that ground future contingent knowledge in divine predetermination or physical premotion.
 - Distinguishes Molina from both deterministic readings of providence and from libertarian accounts that deny any intelligible divine knowledge of counterfactuals.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Restoration and defense of the technical notion **scientia media** and explicit treatment of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)** as the central theoretical device.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Historically controversial (De auxiliis); often marginalized then revived in modern analytic theology.
 - Freddoso's introduction aided the contemporary reception by translating Molina into analytic idiom, facilitating engagement from secular philosophers and Protestant theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined framework for ongoing debates about divine foreknowledge, freedom, and providence.
 - Valuable for teaching both historical theology and philosophical theology because it links primary text, historical controversy, and modern objection/response.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)**: God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance (counterfactuals of freedom).
- **Scientia naturalis (natural knowledge)**: Knowledge of all possibilities and essences (what could be).
- **Scientia libera / actualis (free/visionary/knowledge of the actual world)**: God's knowledge of the world He actualizes by decree.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)**: Propositions of the form "If agent A were in situation S, A would freely choose action X"; central explanatory content of scientia media.
- **Grounding objection**: Challenge about what metaphysically grounds truth-makers for counterfactuals of freedom if agents never are actually in the relevant situations.
- **Concursus (divine concurrence)**: Doctrine of God's cooperation with creaturely causes; Molina's view aims to preserve genuine causality for creatures while affirming divine concurrence.
- **Providence**: Divine ordering and government of the world; Molina links providential choice to God's use of middle knowledge.
- **Predestination / Election**: How God's choosing of a people or ends coexists with libertarian human freedom in Molina's schema.
- **Libertarian freedom**: The view that human choices are not determined by antecedent factors and thus could have been otherwise.
- **De auxiliis controversy**: Historical dispute between Jesuits (Molina) and Dominicans (Báñez) over grace, free will, and foreknowledge.
- **Omniscience (types)**: Freddoso parses omniscience into the three knowledge types Molina intends to secure.
- **Actualization / Divine decree**: God's creative choice which selects one possible world among many known under scientia media.
- **Trans-worlds / possible-worlds language**: Modern analytic idiom often used to model Molina's insights; Freddoso maps Molina into this vocabulary.
- **Explanatory priority**: Distinction between epistemic and causal/explanatory ordering in Molina's account-God knows counterfactuals prior to decreeing, but they do not causally determine free choices.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for scientia media and the structure of Molinist epistemology.
- As a **polemic resource** against deterministic or Thomist accounts of foreknowledge/grace.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for reconciling biblical/pastoral commitments to divine providence with a robust libertarian doctrine of human freedom.
