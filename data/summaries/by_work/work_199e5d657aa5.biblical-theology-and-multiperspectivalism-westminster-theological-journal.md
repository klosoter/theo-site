### TITLE
**"Biblical Theology and Multiperspectivalism" - Vern Poythress.** Westminster Theological Journal. 
(Article presenting a multiperspectival methodological proposal for doing biblical theology and relating historia salutis to ordo salutis.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in a Reformed academic venue; engages late 20th-century debates about method in biblical theology.
 - Responds to tendencies that either isolate historical description (historia salutis) from systematic ordering (ordo salutis) or collapse one into the other.
 - Situated amid conversations with Vosian biblical theology, canonical criticism (e.g., Childs), and renewed interest in hermeneutical method.

- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical theology must be practiced multiperspectivally: distinct but complementary perspectives (normative/linguistic, situational/historical, existential/personal) together yield a fuller, disciplined account of redemptive history and doctrine.
 - The tension between historia salutis and ordo salutis is not insoluble when treated as different legitimate perspectives rather than mutually exclusive methods.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines and defends three primary perspectives:
 - **Normative/linguistic**: focuses on the propositional and theological content of Scripture as authoritative speech.
 - **Situational/historical**: attends to events, institutions, and the unfolding of salvation history (historia salutis).
 - **Existential/pastoral**: concerns appropriation, application, and the experience of believers (ordo salutis emphasis).
 - Shows how each perspective brings necessary constraints and insights; mistakes arise when any one perspective is absolutized.
 - Applies the multiperspectival framework to classic issues: typology, covenant continuity, the unity of Scripture, and the ordering of salvation doctrines.
 - Proposes methodological guardrails so biblical theology can remain historically sensitive while serving systematic and pastoral ends.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit conversation with Geerhardus Vos (historia salutis emphasis), Brevard Childs (canonical concerns), and more recent systematic/theological method debates.
 - Dialogues with positions that sever systematics from historical description or that prioritize doctrine at the expense of narrative-history.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics and normativity).
 - Soteriology (historia vs ordo distinctions).
 - Typology and covenant theology (unity and diversity across redemptive history).
 - Christology and the centrality of Christ as interpretive key.

- **Closing line**
 - Multiperspectival biblical theology preserves the distinctness of historical description and doctrinal ordering while enabling their constructive, disciplined integration for exegesis, doctrine, and pastoral application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats historia salutis and ordo salutis as complementary perspectives rather than rival methodologies.
 - Explicitly frames biblical theology as an exercise in disciplined perspectival integration, not merely historical reconstruction or system-building.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Vosian polarity where historia salutis is elevated in isolation by insisting on the normative-linguistic and existential checks.
 - Counters purely systematic or dogmatic readings that neglect diachronic historical development and typological movement.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Formalizes a threefold perspective model as a practical hermeneutical tool for biblical-theological work.
 - Recasts typology and covenant continuity as phenomena best handled by cross-perspective analysis (historical patterns informed by normative interpretation and existential appropriation).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed scholars sympathetic to methodologically plural approaches; used to justify integrated biblical-systematic projects.
 - Cited as a clarifying method in debates over the proper relations of biblical theology, systematics, and homiletics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a pragmatic framework for advanced students and teachers to hold tensions without reductionism.
 - Valuable for orienting exegetical projects that aim to feed systematic theology and pastoral ministry responsibly.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Multiperspectivalism** - Method claiming complementary perspectives (normative, situational, existential) are required for full theological understanding.
- **Normative / Linguistic Perspective** - Scripture as propositional, authoritative speech; governs doctrinal formulation.
- **Situational / Historical Perspective** - Focus on events, institutions, and the unfolding of salvation history (historia salutis).
- **Existential / Pastoral Perspective** - Concerns personal appropriation, application, and the ordo salutis angle (how salvation is received and experienced).
- **Historia Salutis** - The history of salvation; sequence of redemptive events and institutions in time.
- **Ordo Salutis** - The logical or doctrinal ordering of salvation truths as applied to the believer; treated as a perspective, not a rival account.
- **Diachronic** - Analysis across time; emphasizes historical development and typological progression.
- **Synchronic** - Analysis at the level of canonical or systemic coherence; emphasizes present doctrinal articulation.
- **Typology** - Patterns in redemptive history that prefigure Christ; explained via cross-perspective analysis.
- **Canonical Reading** - Attention to the final shape of Scripture as normative for theological claims.
- **Hermeneutical Guardrails** - Practical rules Poythress proposes to prevent perspectival dominance (e.g., let the normative perspective check historical reconstructions).
- **Integration** - The methodological aim: synthesize insights from multiple perspectives into coherent theological conclusions.
- **Application** - How biblical theology informs preaching, doctrine, and Christian life; foregrounds the existential perspective.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological definition source** for courses on biblical theology and theological method.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist historicism or doctrinaire systematics that ignore other perspectives.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading typology, covenant, and the relationship between narrative history and doctrinal formulation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in integrating biblical-theological findings into systematic soteriology (bridging historia salutis and ordo salutis).
