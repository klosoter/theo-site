### TITLE
The Presbyterian Review (selected articles on federal theology) - Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Presbyterianism; Hodge writing from Princeton seminary milieu through periodical essays addressing contemporary theological controversies.
 - Reaction to Enlightenment moralism, German critical theology, and domestic theological liberalism; aimed to defend historic Reformed orthodoxy in public theology venues.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical and systematic necessity of the **Covenant of Works** as the foundational prelapsarian covenant, which secures the coherence of original sin, federal headship, imputation, and the necessity of Christ's representative obedience.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundations: readings of Genesis narratives and Pauline texts (esp. Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) show a covenantal pattern with Adam as federal head.
 - Doctrinal implications: the covenant of works explains how Adam's disobedience incurs legal guilt for his posterity and justifies the doctrine of imputation.
 - Systematic consistency: without a covenant of works, Hodge argues, penal justice, God's law, and the rationale for Christ's substitutionary work become incoherent.
 - Polemical moves: rejects Pelagian/Arminian mitigations, moral-government theories that downplay federal imputation, and skeptical readings that reduce Adam's sin to mere example.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed sources: Westminster Confession and Reformational tradition (Calvinic categories).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: American and British liberals, moral-government advocates, Socinian and Pelagian framings; engages exegetical critics of Romans 5.
 - Philosophical engagement: counters Enlightenment ethics that relativize divine justice or reduce culpability.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (works and grace), original sin, imputation (of Adam's guilt and of Christ's righteousness), federal headship, justification (forensic), Christology (as second Adam), law and promise, soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - Hodge's essays press that the **Covenant of Works** is the indispensable legal-covenantal framework by which Scripture coherently explains human guilt, divine justice, and the necessity of a federal Redeemer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong forensic/legal language: treats covenants primarily as juridical instruments with conditional promises and sanctions.
 - Stresses continuity between Adam as representative and Christ as federal head: anti-nihilistic on typology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects sentimental or exemplar readings of Adam (that reduce transfer of guilt) by reasserting corporate personality and legal imputation.
 - Pushes back against the moral-government view that interprets the fall and atonement primarily in terms of public example rather than legal substitution.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions between **merit** and **imputation**, and between **personal** and **federal** guilt; refines the language of "preliminary probation" for Adam's covenantal condition.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in American Presbyterian and Princeton theology; reinforced standard Reformed catechetical formulations in seminaries and churches.
 - Later reception mixed: New Perspective and some modern Reformed writers critique aspects (especially the mechanics of imputation), but Hodge's legal-covenantal model remains a standard reference.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of integrating exegesis and systematic theology; useful for teaching covenantal thinking, defending classical federalism, and engaging contemporary critiques of imputation and original sin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-fall covenant between God and Adam promising life for perfect obedience and threatening death for disobedience; central explanatory device for original guilt.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The post-fall covenant mediated in Christ, promising salvation by faith; set against and presupposing the failure of the covenant of works.

- **Federal Headship (representative headship)**
 - The notion that Adam acted legally for his posterity; Christ's headship is the parallel restorative reality.

- **Imputation**
 - The forensic transfer of guilt (Adam's sin to us) and of righteousness (Christ's obedience to believers); Hodge insists on objective, legal imputation.

- **Original Sin**
 - Inherited depravity and guilt rooted in Adam's violation of the covenant of works.

- **Forensic justification**
 - Justification conceived as a legal declaration based on Christ's imputed righteousness, not merely moral transformation.

- **Penal substitution**
 - The doctrine that Christ bore the penalty due to sinners under divine justice; fits Hodge's covenantal-legal schema.

- **Probation (prelapsarian condition)**
 - Adam's conditional state under the covenant of works; obedience was required to obtain promised life.

- **Law and Promise**
 - Distinction between covenantal demands (law) and covenantal offer (promise) used to analyze Genesis and Pauline argumentation.

- **Typology**
 - Adam-Christ parallel (first and second Adam) as theological interpretive device with forensic import.

- **Merit vs. Imputation**
 - Merit: inherent claim to reward by performance; Imputation: legal crediting by God apart from intrinsic merit in the recipient.

- **Corporate personality**
 - The social ontology that allows Adam's action to affect his descendants legally.

- **Works-righteousness (rebuttal target)**
 - The mistaken notion that human standing before God can be earned; Hodge distinguishes covenantal works (pre-fall) from legalistic soteriology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed accounts of the covenant of works and imputation.
- As a **polemical resource** against moral-government, exemplarist, and liberal reconstructions of the fall and atonement.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 2-3 and Romans 5 within a juridical-covenantal framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching soteriology and anthropology in Reformed seminaries.
