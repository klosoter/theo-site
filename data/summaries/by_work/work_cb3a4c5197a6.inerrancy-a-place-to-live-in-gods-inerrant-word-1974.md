### TITLE
**"Inerrancy: A Place to Live" - John M. Frame, in God's Inerrant Word (1974)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1970s evangelical milieu: reaction to modernist biblical criticism and to both laissez-faire fundamentalism and neo-orthodox denials of propositional revelation.
 - Part of a collected volume addressing trustworthiness of Scripture; dialogue aimed at clarifying evangelical commitments prior to later formal statements (e.g., Chicago 1978).
 - Frame writes from a Reformed evangelical perspective with interest in connecting doctrine to Christian practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Inerrancy is not merely an abstract doctrinal formula but the doctrinal basis for a Christian "place to live" - a communal, practical habitation in which theology, worship, ethics, and daily life are governed by the trustworthy Word of God.
 - Problem addressed: how to defend the Bible's truthfulness without reducing it to mechanical dictation or a set of detached propositions, and how to make inerrancy ecclesially and pastorally meaningful.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and scope: affirms Scripture as wholly trustworthy (inerrant) in all that it affirms; distinguishes levels of affirmation (authorial intention, canonical context).
 - Rejection of extremes:
 - Rejects dictation theory (mechanical verbalism) as inadequate to account for human authorship and literary variety.
 - Rejects liberal skepticism and neo-orthodox denial of propositional truth.
 - Positive construction:
 - Grounds inerrancy theologically in the character of God (God is truth; his revelation to covenant community is reliable).
 - Connects inerrancy to hermeneutics: truthfulness must be read according to genre, authorial intent, and canonical purpose.
 - Emphasizes pastoral and ecclesial consequences: inerrancy as authoritative rule for doctrine, morals, and worship - a "place to live."
 - Practical corollary: adherence to inerrancy fosters doctrinal confidence and Christian formation; abuse or neglect leads to either brittle legalism or theological drift.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with fundamentalist defenders of inerrancy and with critics drawn from neo-orthodoxy and historical-critical scholarship.
 - Implicit dialogue with earlier conservative witnesses (e.g., Warfield-style defenses) and with contemporary evangelical theologians seeking nuance.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: Inspiration and Inerrancy (authority of Scripture).
 - Secondary implications: Revelation, ecclesiology (Scripture as rule of life), theology proper (God's truthfulness), hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame centers the doctrine of inerrancy not as an abstract guarantee of propositions alone but as the normative ground for Christian existence - the Word provides a reliable "place to live" for theology and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses pastoral and existential function of inerrancy: doctrine as habitat rather than only proposition.
 - Balances divine authorship with genuine human authorship; avoids reductionism on both sides.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects naïve dictationist readings common in some fundamentalist circles.
 - Counters neo-orthodox and liberalmoves that equivocate on propositional truth by insisting Scripture's affirmations are trustworthy when properly understood.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The metaphor of a "place to live" - doctrinal truth as existential and communal home - reframes inerrancy as lived theology.
 - Emphasis on canonical-function and theological reading over isolated proof-texting.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within Reformed and evangelical circles for integrating orthodoxy with pastoral concern.
 - Served as a moderate, academically respectable articulation of inerrancy in dialogues leading toward later definitional statements (e.g., Chicago Statement participants found such nuance helpful).
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to defend inerrancy while engaging contemporary hermeneutical challenges.
 - Useful pedagogically for bridging confessional conviction and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture is without error in all it affirms; a foundational trustworthiness for doctrine and life.
- **Inspiration** - God as ultimate author working through human authors without negating their faculties or styles.
- **Authority (of Scripture)** - Scripture's normative, governing role for belief and practice; the "place to live."
- **Dictation theory** - Mechanical verbal inspiration; Frame critiques as inadequate and misleading.
- **Verbal plenary** - Affirms both words and content as inspired while allowing human linguistic agency.
- **Accommodation** - God condescends to human modes of expression; explains Scripture's variety without undermining truth.
- **Hermeneutics / historical-grammatical reading** - Reading by genre, authorial intent, and canonical purpose to discern what Scripture affirms.
- **Propositional truth** - Scripture contains true propositions; Frame defends propositional content while contextualizing it.
- **Canonical function** - Scripture's authority arises in and for the covenant community that lives by it.
- **Praxis / place to live** - The sociological/pastoral dimension: doctrine forms communal identity and daily life.
- **Infalibility (contrast)** - Often paired with inerrancy; Frame uses inerrancy to refer to truthfulness, infallibility to refer to unfailing efficacy - related but distinct.
- **Theological reading** - Interpreting individual texts in light of the whole canon and God's redemptive purposes.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source** - Clarifies evangelical definitions of inerrancy that balance divine and human authorship.
 - **Polemic** - Employed against both dictationist fundamentalism and neo-orthodox or liberal denials of propositional truth.
 - **Hermeneutical/Exegetical model** - Gives a practical template for reading Scripture with doctrinally-informed hermeneutics.
 - **Pastoral theology pivot** - Serves as a resource to connect doctrine of Scripture to congregational formation and Christian piety.
