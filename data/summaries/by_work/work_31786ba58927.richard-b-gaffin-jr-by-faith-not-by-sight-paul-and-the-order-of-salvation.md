### TITLE
**Richard B. Gaffin Jr., By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation (with redemptive-historical debts to Geerhardus Vos)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship (first published 1990). Emerges within conservative Reformed and evangelical debates over soteriology, historical theology, and Pauline interpretation. Builds on the covenant-historical (redemptive-historical) method associated with Geerhardus Vos and mid-century Princeton/Reformed exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's soteriology should be read as fundamentally *historical* (historia salutis) - God has accomplished salvation in Christ objectively and historically - and faith is the God‑wrought means by which believers are related to that accomplished salvation. Gaffin opposes treating the "ordo salutis" as a primarily logical/psychological sequence that rearranges or abstracts the biblical narrative.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Defend a redemptive-historical reading of Pauline texts: Christ's work is prior, objective, and the ground of all saving benefits.
 - Show exegetically that Paul speaks of justification, reconciliation, adoption, and sanctification in categories of what God has done in Christ (past/historical) and what God effects in believers by faith (application).
 - Argue that faith does not precede justification in a way that makes faith the meritorious ground; rather, faith is a means of appropriation grounded in Christ's completed work.
 - Critique systematic treatments that isolate points of the ordo salutis into an abstract order divorced from biblical chronology and covenant history.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavily engages Geerhardus Vos's redemptive-historical method; intersects with Calvinist exegetes (e.g., Herman Ridderbos, John Murray) and counters systematicians who emphasize a schematic ordo salutis. Dialogues implicitly with modern analytic treatments that prioritize logical or psychological sequence.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (justification, sanctification, adoption), union with Christ, imputation, atonement (objective accomplishment vs subjective appropriation), covenant theology, hermeneutics (redemptive-historical method), Pauline theology.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity: salvation is first an accomplished, historical act in Christ; Christian faith is the God‑wrought means by which believers are incorporated into that objective salvation - theology should order doctrine by redemptive history rather than by abstract logical sequencing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong recuperation of **historia salutis** as the primary corrective to over‑systematized ordo schemata.
 - Insistence that *objective* accomplishment (Christ's finished work) is normative for interpreting Pauline forensic and covenantal language.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against treatments that make regeneration or faith the explanatory ground for justification in a way that obscures Christ's prior accomplishment.
 - Challenges theologians who treat the ordo salutis as a set of intra‑individual steps analyzable apart from covenant-historical sequence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rearticulates the practical distinction between *accomplished* (objective, historical) and *applied* (appropriative by faith) salvation as central hermeneutical principle.
 - Reframes "order" language: favors historical-priority and covenant sequence over purely logical or psychological priority.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in conservative Reformed circles and among those sympathetic to Vosian covenant history; used to rehabilitate covenant-historical readings of Paul.
 - Provoked sustained debate with systematicians and some evangelicals who defend a more technical ordo salutis taxonomy.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a robust exegetical model for connecting Pauline texts to covenant historiography.
 - Serves as a corrective to treating soteriology as primarily a set of abstract intra‑personal operations; valuable for courses on Paul, soteriology, and hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historia salutis (history of salvation):** The redemptive-historical sequence; God's objective acts in Christ that ground all soteriological language.
- **Ordo salutis (order of salvation):** Traditional systematic listing of soteriological stages; Gaffin critiques its abstraction when detached from historia salutis.
 - Contrast: *ordo* as logical/psychological sequence vs *historia* as covenantal/historical priority.
- **Objective accomplishment:** Christ's finished work (atonement, justification provision) as an established historical fact.
- **Subjective appropriation:** The believer's reception of Christ's benefits by faith; application rather than origination of salvation.
- **Union with Christ:** The fundamental theological link that explains imputation, justification, and sanctification in Gaffin's reading.
- **Justification (forensic language):** Treated as rooted in what God has done in Christ and declared in history, not merely in the believer's prior moral state.
- **Imputation:** Grounded in union with Christ and the objective accomplishment of his obedience and suffering.
- **Faith (instrumental/means):** God-wrought means of receiving Christ's benefits; not a prior meritorious cause but the God-ordained channel of appropriation.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic:** Method of interpreting Scripture that reads doctrines in light of covenantal actions and chronology.
- **Application vs accomplishment:** Key distinction; keeps the accomplished (Christ's work) primary and application (faith) secondary in logical and biblical priority.
- **Pauline soteriology:** Read as narratively anchored to Christ's saving acts; theological categories (justification, reconciliation) are to be interpreted within that narrative.
- **Forensic vs experiential sequencing:** Gaffin insists forensic declarations belong to the historical accomplishment, not to a later experiential precede.
- **Covenant theology:** Underpins the interpretive framework; sees salvation as unfolding in covenantal history rather than discrete logical steps.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing historia salutis from ordo salutis.
- As a **polemic** against systematic schemas that separate Christ's objective work from the believer's appropriation.
- As an **exegetical model** for Pauline theology emphasizing covenant-historical priority and union with Christ.
