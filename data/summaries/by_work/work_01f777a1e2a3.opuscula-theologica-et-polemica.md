### TITLE
**Opuscula Theologica et Polemica - Maximus the Confessor**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑7th century Byzantine theological controversy; aftermath of Chalcedon (451) and during the Monothelite crisis. Maximus writes as a Chalcedonian monk and imperial official turned polemicist (c. 580-662).
 - Milieu: Eastern patristic theology (Gregory of Nazianzus, Cyril, Leo I), Byzantine political theology, and growing tensions with Western formulations (later Filioque debates).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend the Chalcedonian articulation of Christ as one Person in two natures while rejecting Monothelitism (one will) and clarifying Trinitarian procession language so as to preserve the monarchy of the Father without severing communicative relations between Son and Spirit.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of Chalcedon: Jesus Christ is one hypostasis (person) with two unconfused, unmingled natures (divine and human). (See: Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine.)
 - Dyothelitism: Christ possesses two natural wills and two activities corresponding to his two natures; these wills act in unity because of the single person, not by confusion.
 - Distinguishes "natural will" (thumos/volition per nature) from "operation" (energeia) and insists on non‑contradiction between the wills.
 - Theandric operation: human acts of Christ are truly human yet inwardly united to the divine action - a key corrective to both Nestorian and Monophysite tendencies.
 - Trinitarian balance and creeds: defends conciliar creedal formulations and nuances the Spirit's procession as from the Father through the Son to resist unilateral Western Filioque while allowing mediated relations. (See: Filioque And Ecumenical Creeds.)
 - Polemic method: close exegesis of scripture, appeal to earlier Fathers (Cyril, Leo), and logical argumentation against Monothelite formulary proposals.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Chalcedonian authorities (Leo I), Cappadocians, John of Damascus, and contemporary Monothelite proponents (Sergius of Constantinople, Pyrrhus). His texts were read and employed at the Third Council of Constantinople (680-681).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two natures, wills, operations), Trinity (procession of the Spirit, monarchy of the Father), soteriology implicitly (union as basis of deification), ecclesial authority (conciliar creeds).

- **Closing line**
 - Maximus centers theology on a disciplined harmony: one hypostasis and two uncompromised natures with distinct wills and energies, preserving both Chalcedonian fidelity and Trinitarian monarchy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The term and doctrine of the **theandric operation**: divine and human actions coexist inseparably in Christ without commixture - a lexical and conceptual staple.
 - Precise distinction between **natural will** and **volitional acts/operations**, enabling dyothelitism without Nestorian separation of persons.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Monothelitism by showing that denying distinct wills undermines the reality of Christ's human nature.
 - Counters Nestorian over‑separation by affirming the unity of personhood that ensures shared operations.
 - Nuances Western Filioque language: resists a simple addition of "and the Son" to the Creed while offering a mediated language ("through the Son") that preserves both relations.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **energeia** (operation) vocabulary to explain communicatio idiomatum without collapsing natures.
 - Articulation of a theologically functional **via media** between Eastern insistence on Father's monarchy and Western filiation language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Eastern Orthodox: regarded as a central patristic authority in defense of Chalcedon and dyothelitism; texts used in later Byzantine theology.
 - Western/Latin: fragments and ideas were taken up by councils and scholastics; influence on later medieval theologians (via dyothelite debates and Third Council of Constantinople).
 - Reformed theology: indirect influence-Maximus is cited for patristic corroboration of Chalcedonian Christology and as a resource against any Christological soteriological reductions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating Christology and Trinitarian theology; indispensable for teaching the logic of hypostatic union and the doctrine of wills/operations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - one person (hypostasis) of the Son with two natures; central frame for Maximus' Christology. (See: Hypostatic Union.)
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - authoritative standard Maximus defends; undergirds his dyophysite commitments. (Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine)
- **Dyothelitism** - doctrine that Christ has two wills; Maximus' principal polemical stance against Monothelitism.
- **Natural will (thelema kata physin)** - will proper to each nature; distinguished from mere acts or choices.
- **Energeia (operation)** - operative energies/activities of natures; used to explain how human acts are truly human yet united to the divine.
- **Theandric operation** - Maximus' phrase for the inseparable divine‑human action of the incarnate Word.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - theological principle preserved by Maximus in Trinitarian ordering; guards against conflating origins.
- **Filioque nuance: "from the Father through the Son"** - Maximus' conciliatory language resisting unilateral Filioque while acknowledging relational mediation.
- **Communicatio idiomatum (exchange of properties)** - interpreted via operations and wills rather than ontological mixture.
- **Person (hypostasis) vs. nature (physis)** - technical distinctions refined for polemic and catechesis.
- **Conciliar authority** - Maximus appeals to councils (Chalcedon, later Constantinople) as rule of faith.
- **Scriptural exegesis** - hermeneutical anchor for theological demonstrations.
- **Polemic method** - combination of philosophical precision and patristic citation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Chalcedonian Christology and dyothelitism (teaching hypostatic and volitional distinctions).
 - As a **polemic resource** against Monothelitism and for nuanced critique of unilateral Filioque insertions.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating Trinitarian order and incarnational operations in systematic and historical theology.
