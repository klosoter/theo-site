### TITLE
Covenant: God's Purpose, God's Plan (John H. Walton, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 2010s biblical-theological conversation shaped by ANE studies, functional ontology, and renewed interest in covenant as a macro-structure for Scripture.
 - Walton writes from an evangelical, Old Testament-specialist standpoint; engages both scholarly ANE literature and popular theological reception.
- **Central thesis**
 - Covenant is best understood primarily as **God's purposeful plan to order reality and bring creatures into participation with his presence**, not principally as a juridical contract or a set of imposed legal obligations.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reorients covenant language through categories of **purpose, plan, and ordering** rather than legal suzerainty alone.
 - Uses ANE treaty and temple motifs to show covenant functions as divine establishment of a functional order (role, place, responsibility) for the created order.
 - Traces covenantal development through Israel and into the New Testament as progressive realization of God's plan culminating in Christ's restoration of proper function and presence.
 - Applies this model to ethics and ecclesiology: covenant ethics flow from participation in God's ordered purpose rather than primarily from external imposition.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws heavily on ANE treaty studies, temple theology, and recent functional-ontology scholarship (including Walton's prior works).
 - Explicitly interacts with **Klinean covenant theology** (Meredith G. Kline and the suzerainty‑treaty model) and the associated reading that frames covenant ethics as an external "intrusion" of divine stipulations into human life.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (pattern and medium of covenant disclosure), covenant (nature and development), ecclesiology (covenant community), soteriology (participation and restoration), Christology (fulfillment of covenantal purpose), eschatology (full ordering of creation).
- **Closing line**
 - Walton's theological center of gravity: **covenant is God's intentional ordering of creation toward his presence and purpose - a teleological plan embodied in institutional and narrative forms across Scripture.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **purpose/plan/ordering** over juridical contract metaphors.
 - Treats covenant as fundamentally participatory and functional: entry into an ordered role within God's created reality.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges elements of **Klinean covenant theology**: while acknowledging treaty-language parallels, Walton resists reducing covenant to a suzerain‑vassal legal model that makes ethics chiefly an "intrusion" of stipulations.
 - Pushes back on readings that over-legalize covenantal relations and underplay cultic/temple and ontological dimensions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts covenant language into a framework of **divine plan and functional ordering**, making "covenant" a vehicle of cosmic governance rather than primarily juridical obligation.
 - Reframes ethical implications as **participatory formation** rather than merely compliance with external commands.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received attention among evangelicals for its ANE-informed reorientation and for providing a bridge between OT scholarship and theological application.
 - Provoked debate with proponents of traditional federal/suzerainty covenant models; used in classrooms to broaden covenant hermeneutics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a corrective to contract-heavy readings; durable for teaching covenant theology that privileges narrative, temple motifs, and the telos of redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant**: God's purposeful plan to order creation and establish relationship/participation rather than merely a legal contract.
- **Purpose / Plan / Ordering**: Core categories Walton uses to interpret covenantal acts as formative, teleological processes.
- **Functional ontology**: Emphasis on role and function in creation; covenant assigns roles within God's ordered cosmos.
- **Temple theology / cultic motif**: Covenant as establishing access to divine presence (temple imagery central to meaning).
- **Suzerainty-treaty model (Klinean covenant theology)**:
 - Walton engages this as historically important but argues it is insufficient if read exclusively as juridical stipulation.
- **Intrusion ethics**:
 - The view that covenant ethics are chiefly divine impositions intruding upon human life; Walton critiques this as a limited ethical model, proposing instead ethics as shaping participation in God's purpose.
- **Participation**: Key ethical and soteriological term - covenant invites creatures into shared function with God.
- **Continuity/discontinuity**: Walton frames continuity across covenants as continuity of purpose (not necessarily of every institution), allowing nuanced typology.
- **Telos / eschatological consummation**: Covenant seen as forward-aiming toward restoration of creation under God's presence.
- **Sign and seal**: Reinterpreted in light of function and presence (e.g., signs as markers of role and access).
- **Covenant blessings/curses**: Read within the framework of functional ordering - blessings as proper function, curses as disorder.
- **Federal headship**: Addressed but attenuated; Walton emphasizes group/function over strictly juridical federal categories.
- **Revelatory mediation**: Covenant as God's chosen medium for revealing and establishing his plan.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: reframing "covenant" for courses emphasizing teleology and temple motifs.
- As a **polemic**: used to critique overly legalist or suzerainty-only covenant models (notably Klinean/readings emphasizing "intrusion ethics").
- As an **exegetical model**: employs ANE and temple frameworks to read covenant texts functionally rather than exclusively juridically.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: for biblical theology linking OT covenant formation to NT fulfillment in Christ by means of participation and ordered restoration.
