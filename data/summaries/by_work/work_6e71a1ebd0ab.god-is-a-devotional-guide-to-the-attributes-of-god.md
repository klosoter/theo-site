### TITLE
God Is: A Devotional Guide to the Attributes of God - Mark Jones

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical, broadly Reformed / confessional milieu aimed at pastors, Bible-study leaders, and committed laity.
 - Positioned as a devotional complement to systematic and historical treatments of doctrine rather than as an academic monograph.
 - Fits late-20th/early-21st-century renewed interest in doctrinal devotion (accessible theology that forms piety).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Knowing the attributes of God is not primarily an intellectual exercise but the essential means by which believers are drawn into worship, comforted in trial, and shaped for holiness.
 - Theological knowledge must be pastoral and doxological: true doctrine leads to prayerful response and practical trust.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Organized as short, focused devotional meditations on distinct attributes (each entry includes biblical grounding, theological summary, practical reflection, and prayer prompts).
 - Major moves in each entry:
 - **Biblical exposition**: key texts that reveal the attribute.
 - **Theological definition**: concise doctrinal formulation, often drawing on Reformed categories (communicable/incommunicable).
 - **Pastoral application**: how the attribute shapes Christian life, worship, and trust.
 - **Doxology/prayer**: suggested responses for devotion and discipleship.
 - Emphasizes interplay between doctrine and sanctification: doctrine forms affections and ethics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit dialogue with the classical Reformed tradition (Calvinistic emphases on God's sovereignty, providence, and simplicity).
 - Pastoral-evangelical interlocutors (contemporary devotionalists and homileticians) influence tone and application.
 - Scriptural exegesis is primary; theological tradition is used to clarify language and avoid popular misconceptions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary focus: **divine attributes** (omnipotence, omniscience, immutability, aseity, holiness, sovereignty, etc.).
 - Treated in relation to: **Trinity** (trinitarian doxology and relational attributes), **providence**, **revelation**, and implications for **Christology** and **salvation** (how attributes relate to gospel assurances).
 - Less technical on covenantal or historical theology; centers on personal knowledge of God.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological knowledge of God's attributes, rightly framed by Scripture and prayer, is the engine of true worship, pastoral consolation, and practical holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strongly devotional orientation: attributes are presented as motives for prayer and sources of comfort rather than abstract propositions.
 - Short, pastoral entries designed for repeated meditation and memorization.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves away from purely scholastic or speculative treatments that isolate attributes from piety.
 - Counters sentimental or therapeutic portrayals of God by insisting on the majesty and otherness of divine glory alongside tenderness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Habit of framing an attribute as a "spiritual affordance" - what this trait makes possible for the believer (e.g., God's immutability affords confidence in promises).
 - Prioritizes relational language (how the attribute draws us into right response) rather than only metaphysical description.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical churches as a devotional handbook and sermon-source.
 - Appreciated by pastors and lay leaders for clarity and practical application; used less as an academic reference and more as formative material for preaching and discipleship.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a pocket-theology for forming the affections and catechetical memory.
 - Valuable bridge between systematic theology and daily Christian formation; useful for small groups, pastoral care, and sermon illustration.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Attribute(s) of God** - Distinct properties revealed in Scripture that describe who God is and how he acts.
- **Communicable / Incommunicable** - Distinction used to sort attributes that creatures share analogically (love, wisdom) from those unique to God (aseity, immutability).
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; God as the source of being, which grounds divine independence and sufficiency.
- **Immutability** - God does not change; presented as the basis for the trustworthiness of promises and covenant.
- **Omnipotence** - God's all-powerful sovereignty; stress on providential control and pastoral comfort.
- **Omniscience** - God's all-knowingness; used to reassure believers concerning prayer and moral accountability.
- **Omnipresence** - God's presence with his people; applied to consolation in trial and holiness.
- **Sovereignty** - God's rule over all events; framed to encourage worship and humble dependence rather than fatalism.
- **Holiness** - God's moral otherness; summons to reverence and personal sanctification.
- **Simplicity** - God's unity (no parts); employed to guard against dividing God into isolated properties.
- **Eternity** - God's relation to time; comforts regarding permanence of salvation and hope.
- **Providence** - God's governance of creation; practical implications for suffering and prayer.
- **Trinity** - Relational framework for attributes; treatments end with doxological affirmation of Father, Son, and Spirit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **devotional / formation** resource for daily meditation and pastoral counseling.
 - As a **homiletical template** for sermon series on the attributes (clear structure: text, definition, application, prayer).
 - As a **catechetical aid** - concise, memorable definitions useful in discipleship and small-group teaching.
