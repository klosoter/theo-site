### TITLE
Saving Karl Barth: Hans Urs von Balthasar's Preoccupation - D. Stephen Long

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late twentieth-century scholarly engagement with the two foremost theologians of mid-century Europe: Karl Barth (Protestant dialectical theology) and Hans Urs von Balthasar (Catholic ressourcement and aesthetic theology). Long writes from a contemporary ecumenical and historical-theological vantage, reading Balthasar's career as a sustained response to Barth within the postwar theological realignment (nouvelle theologie, Vatican II, Barth reception).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Long contends that Balthasar's theology is animated by a single obsessive project: to "save" Barth - that is, to appropriate, correct, and reintegrate elements of Barthian Christocentrism and revelation-theology into a Catholic framework that insists on doxology, ecclesial sacramentality, and a positive aesthetics of glory.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Barth's strengths (Christocentric focus, trust in revelation) and perceived limits (apophatic tendencies, weak account of glory, ecclesial/sacramental life).
 - Balthasar's response: development of a theological aesthetics (beauty, glory), theo-drama, and Trinitarian account that supplements and corrects Barth.
 - Methodological consequences: Balthasar reframes revelation so that Word, glory, beauty, and the Church form a unified theological economy, thereby rendering Barth serviceable to Catholic theology without abandoning his core insights.
 - Evaluation: Long weighs how convincing Balthasar's rescue is, noting hermeneutical moves, possible misreadings of Barth, and ecumenical implications.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary: Karl Barth and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Secondary interlocutors: members of the nouvelle theologie (de Lubac, Congar), Barthian interpreters, and broader twentieth-century patristic and Thomistic sources Balthasar mobilizes.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Word and Scripture), Christology (centrality of the Word made flesh), Trinity and economic/ontological relation, ecclesiology and sacrament, soteriology/kenosis, theological aesthetics (beauty, glory), and method (analogia entis vs. analogia relationis).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Theologically, Long locates Balthasar's project as an ecumenical and doctrinal recovery: to preserve Barth's robust Christocentrism while reorienting theology toward doxology, beauty, and a richly sacramental Trinitarianism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Balthasar treats theological aesthetics (pulchritudo, doxa) as corrective to what he sees as Barth's sometimes sterile dialectic.
 - He reads Barth with a pastoral-ecclesial aim: theology must lead to worship and communal life, not merely to dogmatic precision.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contrasts with Barth's strict anti-analogical posture by reasserting a positive analogia (rooted in patristic and Thomistic resources) so that created beauty can signify divine glory.
 - Pushes against Protestant tendencies to privatize revelation by re-embedding revelation within sacramental and liturgical forms.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularization of the pairings "theo-drama/theo-logic of glory" as systematic tools to reframe revelation and history.
 - Integration of aesthetic categories (beauty, splendour) into method and doctrine in a systematic way.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Heavily influential in ecumenical theology and in shaping Catholic appropriations of Barth; provoked renewed Barth scholarship and critical reassessment among Protestants.
 - Critics charge Balthasar with selective appropriation or softening of Barth; defenders argue he recovers what Barth risked occluding.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a model for cross‑tradition theological conversation that is both constructive and critical.
 - Valuable for courses on theological method, aesthetics in theology, Barth reception history, and postwar ecumenism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Saving Barth:** Balthasar's programmatic aim to appropriate Barth's insights while correcting perceived deficits.
- **Theo-drama:** Balthasar's framework treating salvation-history as dramatic interplay of divine initiative and human response; used to reframe Barth's event-focused theology.
- **Glory (doxa):** Central corrective term-divine splendour that theology must name and minister to via worship and beauty.
- **Beauty (pulchritudo):** Ethical-aesthetic category that mediates divine revelation to human perception; contrasts Barth's polemical tone.
- **Kenosis:** Balthasar's use emphasizes Christ's self-giving within a doxological economy; aligns with but nuances Barthian kenotic themes.
- **Analogia entis vs. analogia relationis:** Tension over whether creaturely being can analogically point to God (Balthasar more positive, Barth more cautious).
- **Christocentrism:** Shared emphasis but reinterpreted by Balthasar to demand sacramental and aesthetic anchoring.
- **Apophaticism:** Barth's negative theology that Balthasar seeks to balance with positive talk of glory.
- **Ecclesial sacramentality:** The Church as locus where Word, beauty, and glory cohere-an explicit corrective to a purely word-event model.
- **Ressourcement:** Balthasar's retrieval of patristic and Thomistic motifs to mediate Barth for Catholic doctrine.
- **Doxological method:** Method that begins and ends in worship; central to Balthasar's critique of purely propositional theology.
- **Dialectical theology:** Barth's methodological background that Balthasar selectively appropriates.
- **Theological aesthetics:** Balthasar's systematic insertion of aesthetic categories into dogmatics.
- **Event (Ereignis) and revelation:** Concepts where Balthasar and Barth intersect and diverge over how revelation is located and mediated.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **hermeneutical pivot** for reading mid-century Barth through a Catholic lens (interpretive model).
- As a **polemic/resource** in ecumenical theology-both to defend Catholic recovery of Barth and to critique Barthian limitations.
- As a **conceptual source** for integrating aesthetics and sacramentality into systematic discussions of revelation, Trinity, and Christology.
