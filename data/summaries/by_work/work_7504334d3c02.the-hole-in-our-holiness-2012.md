### TITLE
The Hole in Our Holiness (2012) - Kevin DeYoung

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Published within the early-21st-century resurgence of conservative Reformed and evangelical interest in practical holiness; responds to perceived pastoral lapses in churches influenced by "cheap grace" and therapeutic or pragmatic Christianity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Modern evangelicals often affirm justification while neglecting sanctification; Christians are declared holy in Christ (definitive sanctification) yet remain morally impaired and thus must pursue progressive holiness. The "hole" is failure to press the implications of union with Christ for practical obedience.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary Christianity tolerates ongoing, undisputed sin among professing believers.
 - Retrieval: Biblical and Reformed resources show sanctification is both positional (definitive) and progressive (ongoing), rooted in union with Christ and worked by the Spirit.
 - Application: Calls to repentance, discipline, means of grace, mortification of sin, and pastoral accountability; practical guidance for personal and congregational holiness.
 - Pastoral illustrations and exhortations to re-integrate doctrine and discipleship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages the New Testament witness (Pauline ethics), Reformed theology broadly (Puritans and classic Protestant categories), and contemporary evangelical trends (antinomian tendencies, moralistic therapeutic deism). Dialogues implicitly with proponents of both cheap grace and moralistic perfectionism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sanctification (definitive and progressive), justification (as distinct but related), union with Christ, indwelling sin, the Spirit's work, repentance, law and gospel, ecclesial discipline, perseverance.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Holiness flows from union with Christ and the Spirit's work; true grace both frees from condemnation and propels sincere, sustained holiness - Christians must embody both the "already" and the "not yet."

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Clear, pastorally driven articulation that sanctification is simultaneously definitive and progressive; insistence that positional holiness obliges practical holiness.
 - Practical linkage of doctrine to everyday disciplines (prayer, Scripture, accountability, church life).
- **Corrections/contrasts:**
 - Counters antinomian readings of "grace alone" that excuse habitual sin.
 - Opposes legalistic/perfectionist expectations by affirming ongoing struggle with indwelling sin and the necessity of grace.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes the phrase "the hole in our holiness" as shorthand for the gap between professed status in Christ and lived obedience.
 - Refreshes classic Reformed distinctions (definitive vs progressive sanctification) for a contemporary pastoral audience.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed evangelical circles, small groups, and pastoral training; praised for clarity, criticized by some for potentially pressuring works-oriented responses if nuance is missed.
 - Stimulated further conversations about church discipline, pastoral accountability, and discipleship practices.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Compact, sermonizable treatment that bridges academic categories and parish ministry; valuable as a corrective, devotional stimulus, and teaching primer on sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification (definitive):** The believer's positional holiness in Christ at conversion; declared and imputed status.
- **Sanctification (progressive):** The Spirit-wrought, ongoing transformation of character and conduct toward conformity to Christ.
- **Union with Christ:** The theological root of both justification and sanctification; basis for ethical obligation.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration of righteousness by faith; distinct from but related to sanctification.
- **Mortification:** Deliberate putting to death of sin through means of grace and the Spirit's power.
- **Vivification:** The enlivening work of the Spirit producing newness of life and obedience.
- **Indwelling sin:** The continued presence of a sin nature in the believer that necessitates ongoing repentance and struggle.
- **Means of grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer, and Christian community as instruments God uses to produce sanctification.
- **Repentance:** Ongoing contrition and turning from sin; central practical response to the "hole."
- **Law and Gospel:** Distinction used to show the law's role in exposing sin and the gospel's role in empowering obedience.
- **Perseverance:** Assurance that true believers will continue in faith and seek holiness, not as proof-text legalism but as evidence of union with Christ.
- **Church discipline/accountability:** Corporate mechanisms to address persistent, public sin and foster holiness.
- **Cheap grace (polemic term):** Critique of grace that removes moral demand; DeYoung argues for a robust grace that transforms.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for contemporary discussions of definitive vs progressive sanctification.
- As a **polemic** against antinomian tendencies and against a purely moralistic Christianity.
- As a **pastoral-exegetical model** for applying Pauline ethical teaching to congregational life and discipleship programs.
