### TITLE
Sinai and the Saints: Reading Old Covenant Laws for the New Covenant Community - James M. Todd III

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed context addressing practical and theological tensions about Old Testament law in post-Christian-covenant practice.
 - Engages ongoing debates in biblical theology and pastoral ethics about continuity between covenants and how churches should read Sinai today.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Covenant laws, given at Sinai, continue to have normative, ecclesial significance for the New Covenant community when read and applied under Christ; they are not simply abolished or relegated to antiquarian interest.
 - The doctrinal problem: how to account for both Christ's fulfillment and the ongoing normative force of Sinai without collapsing into legalism or lawless antinomianism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes a hermeneutical framework: canonical, covenantal, and Christ‑centered reading of Sinai.
 - Distinguishes levels of application rather than resorting to an arbitrary moral/ceremonial/civil tripartition:
 - Some commands retain direct normative force because they embody God's unchanging will and the moral order intrinsic to covenant life.
 - Other commands are fulfilled and transformed in Christ and thus require typological, analogical, or ecclesial reapplication.
 - Provides criteria for discerning which Old Covenant laws bind, which are fulfilled and adapted, and how to derive ecclesial practice from Sinai.
 - Applies framework to representative case studies (e.g., sabbath, cultic regulations, witness/judicial laws, social legislation) to show concrete theological and pastoral implications.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Works in conversation with the Reformed/covenantal tradition and contemporary biblical theologians and ethicists.
 - Dialogues with both classical interpreters and modern positions that emphasize discontinuity (e.g., some dispensationalist and liberal approaches) and with antinomian or purely moralizing readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and canonicity (authority of Scripture)
 - Covenant theology (Old and New Covenant relations)
 - Law (nature, categories, and normative force)
 - Christology (fulfillment of the law)
 - Ecclesiology (how the church embodies Sinai)
 - Ethics and pastoral theology (application in congregational life)

- **Closing line**
 - Todd advances a disciplined, covenantal hermeneutic that reads Sinai as formative for the saints: Sinai is fulfilled in Christ but remains a crucial source for the church's moral, liturgical, and communal ordering.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses an **ecclesial reading** of Sinai: laws are to be read primarily as instruction for covenant people, not as ancient legal curiosities or merely moral axioms.
 - Avoids the simplistic moral/ceremonial/civil taxonomy; instead offers **functional criteria** linking law to God's invariant will and covenant plan.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects antinomian trends that dismiss Old Testament law as irrelevant for Christians.
 - Counters both strict continuity that merely imports Mosaic prescriptions uncritically and radical discontinuity that treats Sinai as wholly abrogated.
 - Reorients some classical Reformed uses of the moral law by insisting on canonical and Christic mediation rather than an abstract natural-law reading.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes terms like **ecclesial applicability**, **Christ-mediated fulfillment**, and **functional continuity** to frame which laws bind.
 - Proposes pragmatic hermeneutical rules for distinguishing direct commands from typological instruction.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Helpful within Reformed and evangelical ethics as a corrective to polarized readings.
 - Cited by pastors and scholars seeking a middle path: serious regard for Sinai with careful Christological qualifying.
 - Influences homiletics and pastoral practice by encouraging concrete applications of Old Testament statutes in church life.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a robust model for integrating biblical theology with pastoral ethics.
 - Valuable for seminaries and church leaders wanting a principled, theologically anchored approach to OT law.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sinai / Sinai legislation** - The corpus of Mosaic laws as given in covenantal context; treated as address to covenant community.
- **Old Covenant / New Covenant** - Two covenantal administrations; continuity is mediated through Christ rather than identical legal regimes.
- **Normative force** - The degree to which a command remains binding for the church; determined by Christological and covenantal criteria.
- **Ecclesial reading / applicability** - Reading laws primarily as instructions for the community of saints, not merely historical prescriptions.
- **Fulfillment (Christ-mediated)** - The idea that Christ fulfills the law in a way that transforms how laws apply without necessarily nullifying their theological content.
- **Functional continuity** - Emphasis on the underlying purpose and function of laws (e.g., holiness, justice) as the basis for their ongoing relevance.
- **Typology / typological mediation** - Old Covenant institutions as figures that find fuller meaning in Christ, informing but not dictating ecclesial forms.
- **Moral/ceremonial/civil distinctions (reworked)** - Traditional categories are interrogated and reconfigured in light of covenantal and Christological commitments.
- **Hermeneutical rules** - Practical criteria offered for judgeship: canonical context, Christic telos, covenantal audience, and pastoral prudence.
- **Telos** - The end or goal of the law (holiness, covenant faithfulness) as the key determinative for application.
- **Canonicity / Revelation** - Scripture's authority as the premise for reading Sinai into church life.
- **Prudential application** - Distinguishes direct binding commands from those requiring contextual, ecclesial adaptation.
- **Ecclesial ethics** - The application of Sinai to corporate worship, discipline, social ethics, and church order.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Old Testament law within a canonical, Christ‑centered framework.
 - As a **polemic** against both antinomian and uncritical continuist positions.
 - As a **source for ecclesial practice**, guiding preaching, liturgy, and church policy on matters rooted in Sinai.
