### TITLE
Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione (1588) - Luis de Molina

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Jesuit theology; Counter-Reformation debates over grace, predestination, and free will.
 - Published amid rising controversy with Dominican Thomists (notably Domingo Báñez) and shortly before the Roman Congregatio de Auxiliis hearings (1590s).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To reconcile **libertarian free will** with **divine omniscience and providential predestination** without resort to Thomistic physical premotion or Calvinist double predestination.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduces and develops the doctrine of **scientia media** (middle knowledge): God knows not only natural consequences and actual future acts but also what free creatures would do in any hypothetically feasible situation (counterfactuals of freedom).
 - Uses middle knowledge to explain how God can foresee and providentially order the world such that human freedom remains genuine while divine decrees (election/reprobation) remain sovereignly effective.
 - Reinterprets election and reprobation as compatible with foreknowledge of free responses to grace (conditional rather than strictly unconditional election).
 - Differentiates types of grace (sufficient, congruent, efficacious) and explains their role within libertarian freedom and God's ordering of circumstances.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine and Aquinas selectively; primary controversy with Dominican Thomists (Báñez).
 - Replies to Protestant (Calvinist) readings of predestination and to internal Jesuit debates over grace.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine foreknowledge and providence, free will (liberum arbitrium), grace (sufficient, congruent, efficacious), predestination, reprobation, concurrence, divine freedom in decree.
- **Closing line**
 - Molina locates the theological center of gravity in a **middle-knowledge framework** that aims to preserve both libertarian human freedom and a personal, providentially ordering God who foresees and actualizes a world consistent with those free choices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic articulation of **scientia media** as the key to reconciling foreknowledge and libertarian freedom.
 - Stress on God arranging **circumstances** (including prevenient/congruent graces) informed by middle knowledge rather than coercive premotion of wills.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Thomistic physical premotion: denies that God physically moves the will to its choice; instead God knows counterfactual choices and actualizes the world accordingly.
 - Opposes deterministic readings of predestination typical of strict Augustinian/Calvinist frameworks by grounding election in foreseen free responses.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Robust use of **counterfactuals of freedom** as a theological category; formal distinction among **scientia naturalis, scientia media, scientia visionis**.
 - Clarification of multiple grades/kinds of grace (gratia sufficiens, gratia congrua, gratia efficax) within a libertarian model.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate controversy: vigorously attacked by Dominican Thomists; subject of the Congregatio de Auxiliis debates; Rome neither definitively condemned nor fully endorsed Molina, but his system became the staple of **Molinism**.
 - Long-term influence: major touchstone in Catholic theology and in Protestant philosophical theology; revived interest in modern philosophy of religion (omnipotence/omniscience vs. free will), and as precursor to contemporary middle-knowledge theories.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as the canonical articulation of a freedom-friendly model of providence; indispensable for courses on grace, predestination, and theodicy; useful as a conceptual pivot in analytic theology debates about counterfactuals and divine knowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)** - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do under any feasible set of circumstances; central move to reconcile foreknowledge with libertarian freedom.
 - Contrasts with **scientia naturalis** (knowledge of all possibilities/natures) and **scientia visionis** (beatific vision, God's knowledge in the divine essence).
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - propositions about what a free agent would do in hypothetical scenarios; foundational for middle knowledge.
- **Liberum arbitrium (free will)** - understood as libertarian (genuinely alternative possibilities, not necessitated by divine causation).
- **Divina praescientia (divine foreknowledge)** - reinterpreted through middle knowledge so it is compatible with genuine contingency of free acts.
- **Praedestinatio (predestination)** - presented as compatible with foreseen voluntary cooperation with grace; election conditioned on God's foreknowledge of acceptance.
- **Reprobatio (reprobation)** - explained as permitted or foreseen resultant of free rejection rather than arbitrary decreeing to damn.
- **Gratia sufficiens (sufficient grace)** - grace that enables but does not guarantee assent without concurrence of the will.
- **Gratia efficax / gratia congrua** - distinctions tracking intrinsic efficacy versus congruent/prevenient offers that, given circumstances, will likely be accepted.
- **Physical premotion (premotio physica)** - the Thomistic doctrine Molina rejects: that God physically moves the will to its act.
- **Concurrence** - God's cooperation with created acts is affirmed but understood so as not to override freedom.
- **Divine providence / ordering of circumstances** - how God actualizes a world where free choices and divine ends coincide via middle knowledge.
- **Omniscience and contingency problem** - Molina's framework treats omniscience as including counterfactuals, preserving contingency.
- **Molinism** - the tradition and system tracing from Molina's use of middle knowledge; a lasting school in Catholic and analytic theology.

How the work is used across loci:
- As the **definitional source for Molinism** and scientia media in systematic theology and philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic resource** against Thomistic premotion and Calvinist double predestination in historical-theological studies.
- As a **conceptual/exegetical model** for handling texts on election, foreknowledge, and grace without collapsing into determinism.
