### TITLE
Commentary on Leviticus (1846) - Andrew A. Bonar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Scottish evangelical milieu (Free Church/Presbyterian circles). Bonar writes as pastor-theologian within the Scottish Evangelical Revival; work aimed at pastors and devout laity rather than critical-historical scholarship.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Leviticus is a Christ-centered manual of divine holiness, atonement, and priestly mediation; its cultic prescriptions are typological, instructing believers in both the **passive** and **active** obedience of Christ and the required holiness of God's people.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition proceeds chapter-by-chapter with pastoral application.
 - Cultic acts (sacrifices, ordination, purifications) are explained as types that point forward to Christ's work.
 - Emphasizes moral and spiritual lessons drawn from ceremonial law: inward holiness, dependence on substitutionary sacrifice, and obedience to God's law as fruit of grace.
 - Repeated pastoral moves: historical explanation → typological Christo-centric application → ethical exhortation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Bonar writes from the Reformed/evangelical tradition, dialoguing implicitly with earlier Protestant interpreters (Calvinic typology, Puritan pastoral practice) and reacting against both rationalist downplaying of typology and ritualistic literalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Atonement (substitution), priesthood (Christ as great High Priest), typology, holiness, law and gospel relation, justification and sanctification, sacrificial imagery (propitiation/covering), covenant theology elements.
- **Closing line:** Leviticus, interpreted typologically, displays God's holiness and creates a pastoral theology that centers Christ's priestly, passive suffering and active law-fulfilling obedience as the foundation for sanctified Christian living.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Warm evangelical pastoral tone: theological exposition consistently married to devotional application.
 - Strong insistence that Levitical rites teach both Christ's **passive obedience** (suffering/substitution) and his **active obedience** (fulfilling God's law as representative).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects rationalist or moralizing readings that ignore sacrificial typology.
 - Counters ritualist readings that make Levitical forms ends in themselves by asserting their provisional and typological character.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Combines strict Reformed typology with sustained pastoral moral theology: rites are simultaneously forensic (atonement) and formative (sanctification).
 - Language often frames sacrifices as both "covering" (immediate forensic effect) and "removal" (progressive sanctifying effect), emphasizing both aspects without collapsing them.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in 19th-century evangelical and Presbyterian preaching and devotional study; less cited in later critical scholarship but influential as a pastoral-exegetical model.
 - Used by ministers and Bible students for sermon material and devotional reflection on holiness and atonement.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A model of pastoral, Christ-centered typological exegesis of Old Testament law.
 - Helpful for preaching the continuity of moral demands with gospel provision and for articulating active/passive obedience in sermonic form.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology:** Levitical rites read as divinely ordained types pointing to Christ; not mere allegory but covenantal foreshadowing.
- **Sacrifices (burnt, sin, guilt, peace):**
 - Burnt: devotion/submission.
 - Sin/guilt: substitutionary atonement and forensic cleansing.
 - Peace: fellowship and covenant restoration.
- **Priesthood:** Foreshadowing of Christ as perfect High Priest who mediates, sympathizes, and secures reconciliation.
- **Atonement / Substitution:** Central interpretive key; sacrificial death prefigures Christ's passive obedience in bearing penalty.
- **Passive obedience:** Emphasis on Christ's suffering and bearing of sin as the fulfillment of sin-offerings and scapegoat motifs.
- **Active obedience:** Emphasis that Christ's perfect law-keeping fulfills what burnt-offerings and consecration rituals prefigured; grounds imputation of righteousness.
- **Holiness (qodesh):** Both cultic separateness and moral sanctity; Leviticus teaches inward holy living as fruit of grace.
- **Covering vs removal:** Distinction between immediate forensic covering (typical sacrifice) and progressive sanctifying removal of sin.
- **Covenant framework:** Ceremonial laws function within covenantal pedagogy, teaching both responsibility and promise.
- **Sanctification:** Ritual purity as an emblem of progressive moral cleansing in Christian life.
- **Propitiation / Expiation:** Sacrificial language used to explain God's justice and mercy reconciled in Christ.
- **Ritual law vs moral law:** Bonar guards the typological value of ritual without re-imposing ceremonial prescriptions on New Covenant believers.
- **Pastoral application:** Frequent use of Levitical texts to exhort repentance, faith, and holiness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for typological reading of cultic law in pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against both antinomian tendencies and ritualistic literalism.
- As an **exegetical model** for sermonizing Old Testament law Christocentrically and for teaching the relation of active/passive obedience.
