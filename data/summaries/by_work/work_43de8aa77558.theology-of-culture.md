### TITLE
**Paul Tillich, Theology of Culture (1959)** 
Essays forging a method of correlation between Christian theology and modern culture, centering on ultimate concern, symbol, and the Ground of Being.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century German-American Protestant thought; post-war crisis of meaning; dialogue with existentialism, phenomenology, depth psychology, and modern art.
 - Volume of essays (1919-1958; ed. R. C. Kimball) consolidating Tillichs mature program after The Courage to Be and Systematic Theology I-II.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can Christian theology speak truthfully to modern cultures autonomy without surrendering to secularism or retreating into heteronomy?
 - Programmatic claim: religion is the substance of culture and culture is the form of religion; theology must interpret the religious dimension present in all cultural expressions.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Method of correlation:** theological answers correlate with existential questions disclosed by culture (art, politics, science, psychology).
 - **Ontology of the holy:** God as the Ground of Being and depth of reason; encounter of finite spirit with the ultimate.
 - **Symbol and myth:** religious symbols participate in the reality they signify and open the dimension of depth; they are necessary yet revisable.
 - **Protestant principle vs Catholic substance:** principle of radical criticism of idolatry and finite absolutes, balanced by the need for concrete embodiment and sacramental depth.
 - **Theonomy, autonomy, heteronomy:** construal of rightly ordered culture under God (theonomy) against coercive heteronomy and self-enclosed autonomy.
 - **Kairos and the demonic:** discernment of crises in history where the New Being breaks in; diagnosis of cultural distortions that absolutize the finite.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Luther, Kierkegaard; debates Schleiermacher and Barth; draws on Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Freud, Marx; conversant with modern aesthetics and science.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology / revelation:** revelation as event mediated by symbols and witness; Scripture as kerygmatic norm rather than inerrant repository.
 - **Theology proper:** God as absolute, personal-transpersonal Ground of Being; critique of theism-as-one-being.
 - **Anthropology / creation:** human finitude, freedom, and estrangement; culture as creative self-transcendence of spirit within creaturely limits.
 - **Ecclesiology / sacraments:** church as bearer and critic of culture; sacraments as transparent symbols of the holy.
 - **Covenant / history:** covenantal life reframed as theonomous culture and communal ultimacy; history read through kairos.
 - **Eschatology:** New Being, anticipation, and fulfillment without mythological literalism; symbolic eschatology.
- **Center of gravity**
 - A theological hermeneutic of culture: correlate the questions of finite meaning with the answer of the ultimate, under the rule of the Protestant principle.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Religion as dimension-of-depth pervading culture; not a segregated sphere.
 - Strong ontology: Ground of Being; depth language over voluntarist personalism.
 - Irenic yet critical posture to modernity via correlation, not capitulation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against fundamentalist biblicism: insists on symbol, myth, and mediation.
 - Against secular autonomy: exposes idolatry of nation, success, technique (the demonic).
 - In tension with Barth: affirms event-character of revelation but allows broader cultural preparation and philosophical mediation.
 - Revises classical natural theology: ontology of depth rather than proofs.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Ultimate concern;** **Protestant principle;** **theonomy/autonomy/heteronomy;** **demonic;** **kairos;** **New Being;** **symbol participates** in what it signifies.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalytic for theology-and-culture studies; shaped religious studies, art theology, political theology, secular theology.
 - In Reformed circles: widely cited as diagnostic tool for idolatry and cultural critique; also a frequent foil regarding God-language and revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a portable grammar for engaging modern culture theologically; sharp tools for idolatry critique; vocabulary for sacramentality of culture and symbolic discourse.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ultimate concern:** the unconditional that claims us; criterion for discerning the religious dimension in any practice.
- **Ground of Being (depth):** God not as a being but the power-of-being; safeguards transcendence and ubiquity.
- **Method of correlation:** systematic linking of existential questions to revelatory answers.
- **Symbol / participation:** symbols open realitys depth and participate in what they point to; irreducible yet vulnerable to distortion.
- **Myth:** narrative symbol-clusters bearing ultimate meaning; to be demythologized, not discarded.
- **Protestant principle:** perpetual critique of turning finite forms (church, nation, ideology) into absolutes.
- **Catholic substance:** the positive weight of tradition, form, sacramentality needed for embodiment.
- **Theonomy:** culture rightly ordered under God; beyond coercive heteronomy and self-enclosed autonomy.
 - **Autonomy:** legitimate creaturely freedom that becomes idolatrous when absolutized.
 - **Heteronomy:** imposed sacred law suppressing freedom and culture.
- **Demonic:** the finite elevated to the ultimate, producing destructive cultural powers.
- **Kairos:** qualitative moment when the New Being breaks into history; discernment category for cultural change.
- **Estrangement:** existential condition of separation from ground, self, and others; basis for soteriological need.
- **New Being:** Christological symbol for healing estrangement; underwrites eschatological hope.
- **Secular faith:** trust directed to finite centers; can be purified or become idolatrous.
- **Ambiguity of culture:** culture mediates both revelation and distortion; calls for critical-affirmative engagement.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Bibliology (11):** to frame Scripture as symbolic witness and norm within revelatory event; to critique biblicism.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments (8):** to elucidate sacramental symbolism and the Protestant principle in church polity and practice.
 - **Covenant Theology (8):** to discuss public theonomy, communal ultimacy, and historical kairos in covenantal life.
 - **Theology Proper (7):** as reference for Ground-of-Being language and anti-idolatry theism.
 - **Anthropology & Creation (6):** for accounts of culture, creativity, finitude, and estrangement.
 - **Eschatology (6):** for symbolic eschatology, New Being, and historical discernment.
