### TITLE
**Truth as Encounter** - Emil Brunner 
Late 1930s, within dialectical theology and personalist currents

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Interwar Europe; post-liberal, anti-scholastic mood of dialectical theology. Engages the Natural Theology debate (Brunner vs. Barth) and absorbs existential-personalist insights (notably Buber) against both rationalism and romantic-religious subjectivism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** **Truth is not primarily propositions but the personal self-disclosure of God that confronts and claims us in Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit.** Propositions and doctrines are secondary, faithful witnesses to this divine-human encounter.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - From **I-It** to **I-Thou**: Knowledge of God cannot be objectified; it is a meeting of persons, God addressing and the human responding.
 - **Revelation as event (Ereignis):** God makes Himself known; truth is an act of divine self-communication, not human discovery.
 - **Faith as obedient response:** Trust and obedience constitute knowing; decision before the Word is central.
 - **Scripture and proclamation:** Scripture is the normative **witness**; proclamation is the living address where the Word encounters. Doctrine orders witness, but the Spirit gives reality.
 - **Christological concentration:** The encounter is concretely in Christ; the cross and resurrection are the decisive unveiling of God.
 - **Spirit and Church:** The Spirit actualizes encounter; the Church is the fellowship formed by the Word, with sacraments as confirmatory signs rather than causal mechanisms.
 - **Nature and conscience:** A qualified point of contact remains in the imago Dei; yet saving knowledge requires the event of revelation.
 - **Eschatological horizon:** Every encounter anticipates consummation; time is opened by God's promise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture; Luther and Calvin; Kierkegaard; Martin Buber; critiques of Schleiermacher and Ritschl; debate with Karl Barth; attention to Kant's limits of reason.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and the Word of God; Trinity and divine personhood; Christology; anthropology (imago Dei, conscience); hamartiology (revolt); justification and faith; Holy Spirit; Church and sacraments; eschatology.
- **Closing line:** **Truth is the living God meeting us in Christ through the Spirit, to which faithful doctrine bears witness and obedient faith responds.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Truth-as-encounter** displaces truth-as-proposition while preserving normativity in witness.
 - **Event-language** for revelation and faith; decision and obedience belong to knowing.
 - **Personalist ontology:** God is Subject who addresses; persons know in relation.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **scholastic objectivism:** God cannot be possessed as an object.
 - Against **liberal subjectivism:** truth is not inner feeling but God's external address.
 - Against some **Barthian closures:** affirms a qualified **point of contact** in the imago Dei (over against Barth's Nein).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Encounter (Begegnung), address (Anrede), event (Ereignis),** and **witness (Zeugnis)** as controlling categories.
 - **I-Thou vs. I-It** appropriation for theology of revelation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in Reformed and ecumenical circles for kerygmatic theology, mission, and homiletics.
 - Critiqued by conservatives for weakening propositional inerrancy and by strict Barthians for residual subjectivism or natural-theology concessions.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Centers proclamation, sacrament, and pastoral care on the **living address of God**.
 - Useful for integrating epistemology, soteriology, and ecclesiology around the **Word-and-Spirit event** without collapsing doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Encounter (Begegnung):** The personal meeting in which God self-communicates and claims the human.
- **Address (Anrede):** God's initiating Word that summons response; revelation as call.
- **Event (Ereignis):** Revelation and faith occur as concrete happenings, not timeless ideas.
- **I-Thou vs. I-It:** Modes of relation; only I-Thou suits divine knowledge; rejects objectification.
- **Witness (Zeugnis):** Scripture and doctrine serve as attestation to the revelatory event.
- **Word of God:** God's self-communicative act mediated through Christ, Scripture, and proclamation under the Spirit.
- **Faith as obedience/decision:** Knowing God entails trusting submission; no neutrality before the Word.
- **Imago Dei / point of contact (Anknuepfungspunkt):** Residual capacity for address in human personhood; insufficient for salvation without revelation.
- **Kerygma:** Proclaimed gospel as the site of encounter in the Church's life.
- **Truth as unveiling (aletheia):** Truth happens as God unveils Himself; propositional truth is derivative.
- **Justification as relational righteousness:** Being set right by entering communion with God in Christ.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals:** Confirm the Word's promise; reject ex opere operato efficiency.
- **Objectivity-in-personalism:** Divine objectivity safeguarded by God's sovereign initiative, not by impersonal data.
- **Eschatological prolepsis:** The encounter anticipates final fulfillment and orients hope.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Bibliology and revelation: anchors Scripture-as-witness and dynamic inspiration models.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: frames Church as event of Word and sacrament as confirmatory signs.
 - Soteriology and pneumatology: clarifies faith-as-encounter and the Spirit's role in actualizing address.
 - Theology proper and Christology: underwrites a personalist doctrine of God focused on Christ's revelatory centrality.
