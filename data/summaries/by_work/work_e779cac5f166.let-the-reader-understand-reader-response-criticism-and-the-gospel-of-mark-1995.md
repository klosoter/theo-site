### TITLE
Let the Reader Understand: Reader-Response Criticism and the Gospel of Mark (1995) - David W. Pao

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published mid-1990s amid rising interest in literary and reader-response approaches to Scripture; interacts with narrative criticism, canonical approaches, and postmodern hermeneutics.
 - Theological milieu: evangelical scholarship open to literary methods; concern to recover theological reading practices (typology, fulfillment) without collapsing into purely historical reconstructions.
- **Central thesis**
 - Mark shapes an implied reader by narrative means so that readers are led to construe Jesus as the fulfillment of Israel's story via typological patterns and implicit intertextual cues rather than explicit fulfillment citations.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduces reader-response theory (Iser, Jauss, Fish) and narrative critical models applied to Mark.
 - Diagnoses how Mark creates textual "gaps," defamiliarizes expectations, and uses motif repetition (e.g., secrecy, failure/discipleship, passion motifs) to invite reader construction of meaning.
 - Demonstrates, through close readings, that otic echoes and narrative parallels function as typological prompts: characters, events, and reversals in Mark parallel Israel's formative episodes so that the reader recognizes Jesus as the eschatological fulfillment.
 - Concludes with theological implications: Mark's rhetoric forms a believing community; understanding Christian typology is an act of communal reading disciplined by the Gospel narrative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Literary and reader-response theorists: Wolfgang Iser, Hans Robert Jauss, Stanley Fish.
 - Narrative critics and Mark scholars (e.g., David Rhoads et al., proponents of Mark-as-story).
 - Counterpoints to historical-critical, form-critical, and redaction-critical readings that privilege source-historical questions over readerly formation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Typology and fulfillment** (primary), revelation (how Christ is disclosed through narrative), Christology (identity of Jesus as fulfillment), hermeneutics (canon, community reading), ecclesiology (formation of reading community).
- **Closing line**
 - Mark is a theological storyteller who, by shaping readers' expectations and responses, engenders typological recognition of Jesus as the culmination of Israel's narrative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats typology not primarily as an authorial exegetical claim or proof-text strategy but as a rhetorical-narrative effect produced in the reader.
 - Emphasizes the communal and formative dimension of reading: recognition of fulfillment is an act learned by participating in Mark's narrative world.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that demand explicit OT fulfillment citations (e.g., Matthew-style fulfillment formulae) or that reduce typology to allegorical eisegesis.
 - Challenges purely historical-critical reconstructions that treat typology as later theological imposition; locates typology in narrative shaping and reader cognition.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "fulfillment" as an emergent reader-response phenomenon - "typological reception" - rather than solely an authorial hermeneutical intent.
 - Treats motifs and narrative gaps as hermeneutical engines that instantiate typological recognition.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in evangelical and narrative-critical circles as a model integrating literary theory with theological exegesis, used by preachers and teachers to explicate Mark's theological artistry.
 - Criticized by some historians for underplaying authorial/historical referents and by some literary theorists for reintroducing theological teleology into reader-response frameworks.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical model for studying typology and fulfillment in Gospels that preserves theological claims while employing sophisticated literary theory; especially useful for preaching, canonical reading, and theology of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reader-response criticism** - literary theory focusing on how readers produce meaning; Pao adapts it to Gospel hermeneutics.
- **Implied reader** - the reader position constructed by the text; Pao traces how Mark scaffolds this role toward typological insight.
- **Actual reader** - historical/contemporary readers who bring contexts and can be trained by the text to see fulfillment.
- **Narrative gaps** - deliberate omissions or tensions that invite readers to infer meaning; used to generate typological connections.
- **Motif repetition** - recurring narrative elements (secrecy, failure, passion motifs) functioning as typological prompts.
- **Intertextual echo / allusion** - subtle OT resonances in characters/events that signal typological parallels without explicit citation.
- **Typology** - figural correspondence between earlier (Israelite) events/persons and Christ; redefined here as reader-constructed recognition prompted by narrative cues.
 - Contrast: not merely authorial claim or later allegory, but an interpretive effect arising in the reader.
- **Fulfillment (implicit)** - the sense that Jesus completes Israel's story as perceived by an engaged reader, often without Matthew-style fulfillment formulas.
- **Messianic secret** - Markan motif that both conceals and reveals Jesus' identity by creating readerly tension; used to foster typological insight.
- **Hermeneutical community** - the socio-religious reading community shaped by Mark; formation of discipleship through reading.
- **Figural reading** - interpreting persons/events as prefigurations; Pao locates figurality in reader-response dynamics.
- **Defamiliarization** - technique that makes familiar OT patterns new, prompting readers to re-evaluate their expectations.
- **Fulfillment recognition** - the cognitive act whereby readers perceive Jesus as the eschatological figure.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for locating typology and fulfillment in Gospel narrative strategies rather than only in explicit citations.
- As a **pedagogical resource** for teaching preachers and communities how narrative shapes theological perception.
- As a **polemic** against readings that separate literary efficacy from theological claim, arguing for an integrated reader-formed theology.
