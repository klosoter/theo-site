### TITLE
**The Impeccability of Jesus Christ: Theological Reflections on the Person and Work of Christ** - Bruce A. Ware (Southern Baptist Journal of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical academic context; addresses intramural debates within conservative Protestant and Southern Baptist scholarship about Christology and soteriology.
 - Responds to contemporary pressures from theological liberalism, kenoticism, and certain proposals that the incarnate Son could have sinned (peccability proposals).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus Christ was **impeccable** - he could not sin - and this claim is both biblically grounded and theologically necessary for orthodox atonement and mediation. Any claim that Christ was potentially peccable undermines salvation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation
 - Appeals to Scriptural texts emphasizing sinlessness: Hebrews 4:15; 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22; 2 Corinthians 5:21; John 8:46.
 - Theological rationale
 - Links impeccability to the hypostatic union and the divine person of the Son: the Son's divine will and moral perfection are decisive factors.
 - Connects impeccability to the logic of redemption: an atoning mediator must be sinless to bear guilt and satisfy divine justice.
 - Philosophical-theological clarification
 - Distinguishes between real temptation and inability to sin; defends genuine human experience of testing without moral failure.
 - Offers an account of freedom compatible with inability to sin (freedom as the acting in accord with one's perfected character/will).
 - Polemical moves
 - Critiques kenoticism and formulations that posit voluntary diminution of divine attributes resulting in moral vulnerability.
 - Argues that attributing real capacity to sin to Christ makes his obedience contingent and thus undermines the universality and efficacy of his atoning work.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on patristic and medieval affirmations of Christ's sinlessness and Reformation emphases on substitutionary atonement.
 - Engages modern theologians proposing peccability or strong kenotic readings; dialogues with recent evangelical scholars over biblical exegesis and philosophical implications.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two natures)
 - Soteriology (atonement, substitution, merit)
 - Divine attributes (immutability, omnipotence within kenotic debates)
 - Anthropology (temptation, freedom, human experience of Christ)

- **Closing line**
 - Ware's central claim: the orthodox gospel requires an impeccable Christ - genuinely tempted yet incapable of sin - because only such a mediator secures objective atonement and faithful redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insists on a theologically robust compatibility between **real temptation** and **inability to sin**, avoiding sentimentalized notions of either.
 - Frames impeccability as integral to the logic of substitutionary atonement, not merely an incidental moral attribute.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges kenotic models that propose a self-limitation of divine power leading to potential peccability.
 - Opposes views that try to preserve moral authenticity by allowing Christ a genuine power to sin; argues this threatens the definitiveness of his atoning work.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the category of freedom operative in Christ's humanity: freedom as volitional congruence with perfected will rather than libertarian indeterminism.
 - Tightens distinctions between moral incapacitation (lack of moral agency) and metaphysical inability to sin rooted in the divine-human unity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a clear evangelical defense of classical impeccability; used widely in conservative seminary syllabi and articles defending orthodox Christology.
 - Influential in Baptist and Reformed circles as a corrective to perceived theological softening on the necessity of Christ's sinlessness.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, scripturally oriented, philosophically nuanced case for impeccability that remains a reliable reference for courses in Christology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability**
 - The doctrine that Christ could not sin; central claim Ware defends.
- **Peccability**
 - The view that Christ could have sinned; Ware critiques this as theologically dangerous.
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The personal unity of divine and human natures in the Son; used to ground why Christ's person secures sinlessness.
- **Temptation**
 - Real trials Christ experienced; Ware emphasizes their genuineness despite non-fallibility.
- **Freedom (volitional account)**
 - Freedom understood as acting according to perfected character; allows meaningful agency without possibility of sin.
- **Kenoticism**
 - The claim that the Son voluntarily emptied divine attributes; Ware resists forms implying moral vulnerability.
- **Substitutionary Atonement**
 - The penal, objective exchange where Christ bears sin's penalty; requires sinless mediator for efficacy.
- **Divine immutability**
 - God's unchanging nature; appealed to against models that posit changeful, peccable incarnate deity.
- **Sinlessness**
 - Moral purity of Christ across life and actions; scripturally affirmed and soteriologically necessary.
- **Moral responsibility**
 - Ware addresses worries that impecability removes responsibility; argues responsibility remains grounded in genuine volition.
- **Objective redemption**
 - The accomplished, universal validity of Christ's atoning act; linked to his inability to sin.
- **Exegesis (Hebrews, Gospels, Pauline texts)**
 - Primary scriptural basis Ware marshals to support claims.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for orthodox evangelical teaching on Christ's sinlessness and its necessity for atonement.
 - As a **polemic** against kenotic and peccability proposals within contemporary Christological debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how Hebrews and Gospel material can be integrated with doctrinal formulations of freedom and the hypostatic union.
