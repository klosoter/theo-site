### TITLE
**Children of the Living God** - Sinclair B. Ferguson (modern Reformed pastoral theology; late 20th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed evangelicalism; Ferguson writes as a Scottish Presbyterian theologian-pastor addressing pastoral and catechetical needs amid rising concerns about assurance, pietism, and debates over covenant and sacraments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians' identity and assurance flow from being adopted as **children of God** through union with Christ - an objective, covenantal work of Christ applied by the Spirit - not from self-scrutiny or meritorious works.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose human plight: the Fall and its consequences - **guilt, pollution, and death** - and how these distort filial assurance.
 - Show Christ as covenant head (pactum salutis) who secures justification, adoption, and sanctification for his people.
 - Explain how justification and adoption are received and sealed: the Spirit's inward witness, the Word, and the sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper) as **means of grace**.
 - Apply to pastoral concerns: assurance, perseverance, the role of good works, and ecclesial practice (including baptism debates).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy use of Reformation and Puritan resources (Calvinian covenant thought, Westminster standards), interlocution with contemporary evangelical/Pietist tendencies, and engagement with Baptist critiques on baptism and sacramental efficacy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (pactum salutis), Christology (Christ as covenant head), justification, adoption, sanctification, pneumatology (Spirit's witness), sacraments, law-gospel distinction, doctrine of sin, assurance and perseverance, ecclesiology.
- **Closing line:** The book centers on a covenantal, Christocentric pastoral theology: Christians are assured and formed as God's children because of Christ's objective work and the Spirit's application within the covenant community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Filial emphasis:** Moves beyond legal categories to foreground **adoption** and filial identity as primary for pastoral assurance and Christian life.
- **Union/covenant synthesis:** Distinctive stress on **Christ as covenant head** (pactum salutis) linking corporate covenant structure with individual union and participation.
- **Balanced sacramental view:** Affirms sacraments as **means of grace** - not magical signs nor mere memorials - and defends infant baptism's place within covenant households while engaging believer-baptist criticisms.
- **Pastorally robust doctrine of assurance:** Avoids both a brittle introspective spirituality and a careless presumption; assurance rests on promises, not fluctuating feelings, yet requires Spirit-wrought appropriation.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** Corrects pietistic over-subjectivism and antinomian tendencies; counters any notion that good works earn covenant standing while also rebutting works-centered assurance.
- **Conceptual innovation:** Tight integration of the threefold effects of sin (guilt, pollution, death) with covenantal remedy - objective forensic change plus ongoing sanctifying presence of the Spirit.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed pastoral ministries, seminary courses on assurance and pastoral care, and catechetical programs; influential among conservative Presbyterians and broader Reformed evangelicals.
- **Enduring value:** Clear model for teaching assurance, sacramental catechesis, and presenting covenant theology in pastorally sensitive, doctrinally rigorous terms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Children of God:** Central identity; status given in adoption rather than achieved by works.
- **Adoption:** Legal and relational entrance into God's family; primary lens for assurance.
- **Union with Christ:** Ontological and covenantal union that grounds justification, sanctification, and adoption.
- **Pactum Salutis / Christ as Covenant Head:** Christ's role as representative and federal head securing blessings for his elect.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration rooted in Christ's righteousness; distinguished from sanctification.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive renewal effected by the Spirit; evidence of filial standing but not its ground.
- **Guilt, Pollution, Death:** Threefold consequences of sin; framework for diagnosing need and God's remedy.
- **Sacraments as Means of Grace:** Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper) are effective signs/seals by which promises are confirmed and the Spirit often strengthens faith.
 - Sub-contrast: **Infant vs believer baptism** - affirms infant baptism within covenant households while addressing Baptist objections about efficacy and mode.
- **Law-Gospel Distinction:** Law exposes sin and drives to Christ; gospel proclaims filial status and grace.
- **Assurance and Perseverance:** Assurance is objective (Christ's work) and subjective (Spirit's witness); perseverance follows from union and covenantal promise.
- **Good Works and Merit:** Good works are necessary fruit and covenantal obedience, but not meritorious for salvation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **soteriological** primer on adoption, assurance, and the nexus of justification/union with Christ.
- As a **pastoral/catechetical** model for teaching believers about assurance, sacraments, and covenant membership.
- As a **covenantal polemic** against both antinomianism and overly subjective pietism; resource in sacramental debates (baptism).
