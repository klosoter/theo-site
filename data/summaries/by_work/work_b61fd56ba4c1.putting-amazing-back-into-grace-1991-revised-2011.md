### TITLE
Putting Amazing Back into Grace (1991; rev. 2011) - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed evangelical milieu reacting to both pietistic moralism and cheap-grace evangelicalism.
 - Horton writes as a systematic and polemical theologian rooted in historic Reformed confessions, addressing contemporary North American evangelical theology and pastoral practice.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary evangelicalism has minimized the radicality of grace and muddled the relation of justification, sanctification, and the law; Horton aims to "put amazing back into grace" by reclaiming a covenantal, forensic, and transformative doctrine of grace.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: liberal and legalistic distortions have made grace either trivial (cheap grace) or licentious (antinomian) and undermined assurance and holiness.
 - Reconstruct: recover classical Reformed categories - covenant of grace, imputation of Christ's righteousness, effectual calling and regeneration - to account for both pardon and progressive sanctification.
 - Emphasizes **imputed** righteousness as the basis of justification and **infused/renewed** life as the basis for good works within the covenant.
 - Locates good works and Christian obedience within the covenant structure: they are neither meritorious for justification nor irrelevant to covenantal identity and reward.
 - Apply: practical pastoral implications for preaching, assurance, church discipline, and spiritual formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classic Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster Standards), contemporary evangelical critics, Roman Catholic notions of merit and infused righteousness, and modern movements that blur law/gospel distinctions.
 - Dialogues implicitly with Arminian emphases on human cooperation and with pietistic/therapeutic strains in evangelicalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, justification (imputation), sanctification, regeneration and effectual calling, faith and repentance, assurance and perseverance, law and gospel, good works and merit.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Grace is simultaneously free and dominative: a forensic declaration of righteousness that issues in a covenantal life of grateful obedience - restored by Horton as both astonishing gift and crucible for holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly integrates *covenant* categories with forensic justification: good works are covenant signs and fruits, not meritorious causes of salvation.
 - Reasserts the primacy of *imputation* (Christ's righteousness accounted to the believer) while refusing antinomian conclusions.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against "cheap grace" (grace detached from sanctification) and against legalism that treats obedience as salvageable merit.
 - Challenges sentimentalized pietism and parts of evangelicalism that privatize assurance and neglect doctrinal articulation of regeneration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the phrase "amazing grace" as a theological program: grace must be proclaimed as both forensic gift and transformative power within covenant relations.
 - Clarifies the distinction between *merit* (merit before God) and *deserved reward* within the covenant - preserving divine initiative.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed evangelical circles as a succinct corrective to popular distortions of grace; influential in pastoral and seminary contexts.
 - Critiqued by some for strong polemical tone; praised for clarity in linking doctrine and piety.
- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable resource for teaching on the relationship of justification and sanctification, and for reclaiming covenantal categories in pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of grace** - central framework: God's promise-of-relational-favor realized in Christ; grounds both justification and life of obedience.
- **Imputation** - Christ's righteousness legally credited to believers; the basis of justification and assurance.
- **Justification (forensic)** - declarative forgiveness and right-standing before God apart from works.
- **Sanctification** - Spirit-wrought progressive conformity to Christ; distinct from justification but inseparably connected as covenant fruit.
- **Good works** - covenantal evidence and necessary fruit, not meritorious causes of salvation.
 - Contrast: *merit* (as a human claim before God) vs. *reward* (God's covenantal recompense).
- **Merit** - rejected as ground for salvation; Horton distinguishes habitual Christian service as rewardable, not deserving of status before God.
- **Faith** - trusting reliance upon Christ's person and work; instrument of justification and life in covenant community.
- **Repentance** - integral to faith; genuine turning that accompanies saving faith, not merely remorse.
- **Assurance** - rooted in God's promises and Christ's imputation; informed by persevering faith and evidences of sanctification.
- **Perseverance** - covenantal perseverance secured by God's faithfulness and effectual calling; grounds perseverance-based pastoral assurance.
- **Regeneration** - spiritual rebirth wrought by the Spirit; precedes or accompanies faith in the economy of effectual calling.
- **Effectual calling** - God's gracious, efficacious summons that results in conversion and regeneration.
- **Union with Christ** - the ontological and relational bond that grounds imputation, sanctification, and Christian identity.
- **Law/Gospel distinction** - maintained: law reveals sin and drives to gospel; gospel frees for obedience without turning law into a salvific norm.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing merit and reward within covenantal soteriology.
 - As **polemic** against both antinomian and moralistic distortions of grace in preaching contexts.
 - As an **exegetical-model** resource linking justification texts to sanctification praxis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for courses on assurance, regeneration, and effectual calling in Reformed pastoral theology.
