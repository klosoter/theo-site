### TITLE
When the Time Had Fully Come: Studies in New Testament Theology - Herman Ridderbos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Dutch Reformed scholarship (original Dutch mid-1950s; English translations thereafter). Post-war renewal in European NT theology reacting to both liberal historicism and existentialist demythologizing.
 - Ridderbos situated within a Reformed, redemptive-historical movement seeking a theologically coherent reading of the New Testament as fulfillment of Israel's hope.

- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus possessed a genuine **messianic consciousness** rooted in Israel's eschatological hope, and his life, death, and resurrection inaugurate the **kingdom of God** as fulfillment of salvation-history - an eschatological reality that is both present and yet to be consummated.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establish the historical reality of Jesus' self-awareness as Messiah through careful Synoptic and Pauline exegesis.
 - Place Jesus' consciousness within the matrix of OT expectation and Second Temple eschatology rather than modern anachronisms.
 - Theologically synthesize Jesus' ministry and Pauline eschatology: the kingdom is **inaugurated** in Christ (the "already") and awaits full consummation (the "not yet").
 - Emphasize the decisive role of the cross and resurrection as the eschatological turning point in salvation-history (redemptive-historical center).
 - Practical and ecclesial implications: mission, preaching, sacraments read as participation in inaugurated eschatology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Critical engagement with: Rudolf Bultmann (demythologizing/existential interpretation), C.H. Dodd (realized eschatology), Ernst Käsemann and other mid-century eschatological critics.
 - Draws on Reformed theologians and biblical exegesis; frequent appeal to OT prophetic texts and apostolic (especially Pauline) witness.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (messianic self-understanding; messiah as fulfillment)
 - **Eschatology** (inaugurated eschatology; already/not-yet)
 - **Revelation** (Christ as the decisive revelation of God)
 - **Covenant and salvation-history** (fulfillment motif)
 - **Soteriology and kingdom theology** (cross/resurrection as eschatological nexus)

- **Closing line**
 - Ridderbos centers New Testament theology on the historical and theological reality that **in Christ the eschatological promises of Israel begin to be fulfilled**, making Jesus' messianic consciousness and the inaugurated kingdom the pivot of biblical theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong redemptive-historical hermeneutic: the NT must be read as fulfillment of Israel's history; chronology and theological development are decisive.
 - Balanced insistence on both the **historical** reality of Jesus' self-understanding and the **theological** significance of inauguration (avoids reducing Christ to an idea or an outcome of community proclamation).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Dodd's tendencies toward over-realized eschatology by insisting on a future consummation.
 - Pushes back on Bultmann's existentialist reading that detaches Jesus' words from concrete historical-eschatological claims.
 - Offers an alternative to reductionist historical-critical readings that strip theological unity from the NT.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of "fulness of time" (chronological and theological fulcrum) as a motif for the Christ-event initiating eschatological fulfillment.
 - Clear integration of Synoptic portrait of Jesus with Pauline eschatology, showing canonical coherence rather than fragmentation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential within Reformed and evangelical New Testament studies; shaped subsequent work on inaugurated eschatology and Christ-centered biblical theology.
 - Adopted by pastoral and academic circles that favor redemptive-historical preaching and covenantal readings of Scripture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise corrective to both extremes (purely realized eschatology and purely future-oriented eschatology).
 - Valuable for teaching Christology and kingdom-theology with a coherent, historically anchored theological framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Fulness of time" (pleroma tou chronou)** - used as the decisive chronological-theological hinge: God acts definitively in Christ.
- **Messianic consciousness** - Jesus' personal awareness and self-interpretation as Messiah grounded in Israel's eschatological expectations.
- **Kingdom of God** - inaugurated reign realized in Christ's ministry, death, and resurrection; both present and consummatory.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / already-not yet** - central hermeneutical category articulating present reality and future consummation.
- **Salvation-history (heilsgeschichte)** - reading Scripture as a progressive unfolding of God's covenantal acts culminating in Christ.
- **Fulfillment (plerosis / telos)** - motif tying NT claims to OT promises; theological completion rather than mere fulfillment of prophecy.
- **Historical-theological method** - combination of historical-critical exegesis with confessional theological synthesis.
- **Suffering Servant motif** - integrated with messianic identity; Ridderbos emphasizes suffering as integral to messianic role.
- **Prophetic consciousness** - Jesus as the eschatological prophet who both announces and enacts God's rule.
- **Revelation in Christ** - Christ as the decisive self-disclosure of God, not merely a bearer of ideas.
- **Covenant-fulfillment** - covenant promises receive their consummation in the Christ-event.
- **Canonical coherence** - the Synoptics and Pauline writings form a unified theological testimony when read redemptively.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a succinct source for defining and teaching **inaugurated eschatology** within Reformed contexts.
 - As a polemic resource against extreme **realized eschatology** and existentialist demythologizing.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** to recover Jesus' authentic messianic self-understanding in NT studies.
