### TITLE
Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans - Charles Hodge (Princetonian Reformed Exegesis; emphasis on covenant and sacraments)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Reformed milieu (Princeton Seminary). Hodge writes within the confessional Presbyterian tradition, addressing post-Enlightenment skepticism, Unitarianism, and American theological controversies.
 - Format: verse-by-verse exposition with systematic-theological digressions; aims both pastoral and polemical.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Romans is the locus classicus for the doctrines of sin, justification, and covenantal standing; the epistle must be read to defend forensic justification by faith and the federal structure of sin and salvation.
 - Sacraments (especially baptism) interpreted in light of covenant theology: signs and seals of grace bound to promises and the Spirit, not mechanical channels.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of Paul's argument: universality of sin → justification by faith → implications for law, covenant, and Christian life.
 - Major theological moves:
 - Establishes the objective reality of original sin and Adamic federal headship as the foundation for Pauline anthropology.
 - Distinguishes imputation (Adam/Christ) from personal guilt and from inherited corruption.
 - Interprets sacraments as covenantal signs and seals; baptism as the covenantal initiation (supports infant baptism within covenant households).
 - Explores the Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection to ground assurance and sacramental efficacy.
 - Addresses eschatological and anti-legalist warnings (e.g., "man of lawlessness"/antichrist motifs) in a historical-future framework.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Reformed authorities (Calvin, Reformed confessions, Westminster divines) and engages opponents: Roman Catholic sacramentalism, Socinian/Unitarian denials of original sin, Arminianism on free will and moral influence theories.
 - Uses patristic and biblical precedent selectively to buttress covenantal readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, justification, covenant theology (covenant of works/grace), Trinity (eternal generation, spiration), Christology (incarnation, accommodation), pneumatology (Spirit operative in resurrection and sacraments), anthropology (original sin, free will), ecclesiology and sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), eschatology (antichrist/man of lawlessness).

- **Closing line**
 - Hodge's Romans centers Reformed federal theology: Adam and Christ as representative heads, justification by faith upheld, and sacraments located as covenantal signs/seals efficacious through the Spirit but not ex opere operato.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigidly historical-federal reading of Adam and Christ as legal representatives; strong resistance to mystical or purely moral readings of Pauline sin-doctrine.
 - Balanced sacramental position: sacraments are not mere symbols but are covenantal signs and seals which the Spirit uses in connection with faith (common Reformed nuance).

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic sacramentalism (rejects automatic efficacy) and Socinian/Unitarian denials of inherited guilt and the need for imputation.
 - Counters Arminian appeals to semi-Pelagian free will by emphasizing total corruption and the necessity of divine initiative (yet preserves responsibility).

- **Conceptual/terminological contributions**
 - Clear popularization of "federal headship" language in American theology; sustained linking of sacramental administration to covenant membership (supporting infant baptism).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in 19th-20th century American Presbyterianism and broader Reformed circles; standard textbook/model for conservative exegetical theology at Princeton.
 - Used repeatedly in debates over baptism, original sin, and the nature of justification.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact exegetical-theological model for covenantal interpretation, pastoral application of Romans, and Reformed sacramental doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification by faith** - forensic declaration of righteousness through Christ's imputation, central Pauline theme.
- **Imputation** - transfer of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness; key to Hodge's anthropology and soteriology.
- **Federal headship (Adam/Christ)** - historical Adam as representative who fell for many; Christ as federal head of redeemed.
- **Original sin / total corruption** - inherited depravity affecting will and affections; grounds necessity of grace.
- **Free will (sin and will)** - genuine but bound will; Hodge affirms moral responsibility yet stresses inability to effect saving change unaided.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace** - structural rubric for reading Scripture and sacraments; baptism marks entrance into the covenant community.
 - Infant baptism: affirmed as covenantal inclusion when parents profess faith.
 - Mode of baptism: not decisive (sprinkling/pouring accepted within Reformed practice); efficacy tied to covenant and Spirit, not mode.
- **Sacraments: signs and seals** - visible signs that attest and confirm covenant promises; efficacious when accompanied by the Spirit and faith.
- **Spirit's role in Christ's ministry & resurrection** - Spirit active in empowering, vindicating (resurrection), and applying benefits to believers; grounds sacramental efficacy and assurance.
- **Eternal generation & spiration** - orthodox Trinitarian language used to safeguard Christological and pneumatological assertions in Paul's theology.
- **Accommodation / incarnational analogy** - Paul's language and law-addresses understood as accommodated to human weakness; used to explain Pauline pedagogy.
- **Antichrist / man of lawlessness** - treated as real eschatological adversary; Hodge reads Pauline warnings both historically and futurally.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: concise exposition of federal-headship, imputation, and sacramental categories.
 - Polemic: deployed against Roman Catholic, Socinian, and Arminian positions in historical and contemporary debates.
 - Exegetical model: paradigm for verse-by-verse Reformed exegesis that integrates doctrinal synthesis with pastoral application.
