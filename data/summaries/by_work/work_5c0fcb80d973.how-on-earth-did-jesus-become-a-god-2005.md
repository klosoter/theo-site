### TITLE
How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God? (2005) - Larry Hurtado 
Topics cited: Biblical Basis OT and NT; Revelation of the Trinity

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century NT scholarship, reaction against mid-20th-century gradualist and purely theological-development models of Christology. Engages philological, epigraphic, and ritual-historical methods to reassess origins of Christian devotion.
- **Central thesis**
 - High Christology (worshipful devotion to Jesus as divine) emerged very early within the Jesus movement and is best explained by early Christian practices and experiences, not by a long doctrinal evolution from a simple human Jesus to deity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Present-day puzzle: how could Jews who affirmed strict monotheism come to worship Jesus?
 - Empirical base: earliest Christian texts (Paul, earliest strata of the Gospels), liturgical/practical evidence (prayer, baptism, Eucharist, invocation), and non-literary data (inscriptions, early hymn fragments).
 - Key moves:
 - Demonstrate that Paul and other early sources show worshipful language and practices directed to Jesus (e.g., kyrios confessions, Philippians hymn).
 - Show that these practices are not later Hellenistic accretions but already embedded in earliest communities.
 - Argue that Jewish monotheism and patterns of divine agency/representation allowed a reconfiguration: Jesus was experienced as God's unique agent/presence, receiving cultic devotion without abandonment of monotheism.
 - Conclude that early devotion creates theological reflection (including proto-trinitarian patterns) rather than vice versa.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary texts: Paul (esp. earliest letters), Philippians 2:6-11 hymn, Gospel attestations, baptismal/prayer formulas.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: scholars advancing gradualist or adoptionist accounts; James D. G. Dunn (binitarian proposals), Richard Bauckham (overlaps in affirmation of early divine identification), and earlier historical-critical models.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (origins of high Christology), early Trinitarian patterns (binitarian sensibilities), monotheism, worship/devotion, incarnation/exaltation debates.
- **Closing line**
 - Hurtado locates the origin of Christian claims about Jesus' divine status primarily in early communal devotion and experience, producing an immediate, practice-grounded high Christology within a Jewish monotheistic horizon.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes ritual/ devotion practices (prayer, baptismal use, invocation, eucharist) as primary evidence, not secondary epiphenomena of doctrinal reflection.
 - Treats early Christian worship of Jesus as a formative social practice that generates theological language.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges linear "evolution" or purely theological-speculative accounts (e.g., gradual deification, late Hellenization).
 - Distinguishes himself from scholars who read early high Christology solely as theological development or late imposition.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasizes a functional concept often called "early devotion to Jesus" and endorses the term "binitarian" to describe early, two-centered devotion within monotheism-prior to formalized Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Uses ritual practice as hermeneutical lens for textual Christological claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in NT and historical theology circles; helped normalize the claim that worship of Jesus is an early phenomenon.
 - Provoked debate with scholars who emphasize continuity with Jewish monotheism differently or who see more gradual doctrinal elaboration.
- **Enduring value**
 - Strong model for integrating liturgical/ritual data with textual exegesis; indispensable for students tracing the social origins of Christological language and for theological apologetics arguing for early high Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Early high Christology** - The claim that earliest Christians attributed divine status and worship to Jesus.
- **Devotion / worship of Jesus** - Practices (prayer, invocation, hymns, Eucharist) directed toward Jesus that indicate cultic recognition.
- **Binitarian patterns** - Early two-centered devotional configurations (Father + Son) within monotheistic confession, antecedent to formal Trinitarian doctrine.
- **Monotheism (Jewish)** - Hurtado's backdrop: explains constraints and resources in which early devotion was articulated.
- **Kyrios (Lord)** - Title applied to Jesus; linguistic and functional evidence for divine status in early texts.
- **Philippians hymn (2:6-11)** - Key textual locus showing early exaltation and divine-language applied to Jesus.
- **Ritual/Practice hermeneutic** - Methodological move: social-liturgy informs theological origins; practices generate Christological meaning.
- **Exaltation vs. preexistence models** - Hurtado critiques simplistic exaltation-only accounts that posit later, gradual deification.
- **Divine agency / presence** - The mechanism by which Jewish monotheism could accommodate devotion to Jesus: Jesus as God's unique agent or locus of presence.
- **Revelation (OT and NT)** - Hurtado reads NT revelation as disclosing Jesus' divine status within Israel's God-language rather than importing pagan deities.
- **Invocation / Prayer formulas** - Concrete evidence for early worship directed to Jesus.
- **Baptismal and Eucharistic usages** - Liturgical settings where Jesus receives cultic address.
- **High Christology as praxis-originating** - Thesis that practice precedes doctrinal formulation.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Exegetical model** - As an empirical template for reading Pauline and early Gospel materials through the lens of worship/practice.
- **Polemic / apologetic** - Employed to argue for the antiquity and authenticity of high Christology against skeptical historical reconstructions.
- **Conceptual pivot** - Serves as a bridge between historical-critical NT studies and doctrinal theology on the early revelation of the Trinity (especially binitarian origins).
