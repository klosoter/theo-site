### TITLE
**The Structure of the Pauline Eschatology** (essay in The Pauline Eschatology) - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 20th-century Reformed biblical-theological project. Vos, professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, wrote within the rise of historical/typological biblical theology against liberal critical and narrowly futuristic readings of Paul. His method is redemptive-historical and confessional-Reformed.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul frames salvation history as an organic two-stage economy (this age vs. the age to come). The eschaton is both inaugurated in Christ (resurrection/Spirit) and still future; the apparent "delay of the Parousia" is intelligible within and necessary to this structure.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: Paul's key terms (parousia, resurrection, arrabon/pledge, firstfruits, redemption, adoption) demonstrate an overlap of ages rather than pure futurism or pure realization.
 - Redemptive-historical schema: Christ's death-resurrection inaugurates the age to come; the Spirit and the church are foretaste/pledge; consummation awaits bodily resurrection and final judgment.
 - Explanation of delay: Delay is intentional divine long-suffering built into the economy to allow Gentile mission, sanctification, revelation of hidden things (e.g., Man of Lawlessness), and moral testing - not mere disillusionment or doctrinal error.
 - Practical consequences: Ethics, perseverance, and hope derive from living in the inaugurated yet awaiting tension.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicitly critiques Schweitzerian imminence thesis, liberal "realized eschatology" (e.g., Johannes Weiss-type tendencies), and certain pietistic/futurist distortions. Draws on Pauline corpus as primary source, with patristic and Reformed covenantal categories as interpretive background.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology, Christology (resurrection/ascension), pneumatology (Spirit as pledge), soteriology (redemption, adoption), covenant/history of redemption, ecclesiology (church as present eschatological community), judgment.
- **Closing line:** Vos centers Pauline eschatology on a sovereign, purposeful overlap of ages: Christ has inaugurated the new age ushered in by Spirit and resurrection, yet final consummation is delayed by divine patience to fulfill mission, sanctification, and moral-testing - thereby making Christian hope both present reality and future expectation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Systematic insistence on an organic, redemptive-historical "structure" rather than isolated doctrinal loci.
 - Strong exegetical linkage of Pauline metaphors (firstfruits, pledge/arrabon, adoption) into one coherent inaugurated-eschatology framework.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Schweitzer's notion of purely imminent expectation that collapsed under delay; also resists liberal reductions that spiritualize away future bodily consummation.
 - Rejects both naive futurism (as if nothing is yet begun) and radical realization (as if everything is already present).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Deploys covenantal two-age schema as hermeneutical backbone for Pauline eschatology, clarifying how "already/not yet" functions theologically and pastorally.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Reformed biblical theology and later evangelical discussions of inaugurated eschatology; foundational for 20th-century attempts to integrate biblical exegesis with covenantal systematic theology.
 - Served as corrective to both liberal denial of future consummation and to simplistic dispensational futurism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of tightly integrated exegesis, historical-theological synthesis, and pastoral application; indispensable for study of Pauline temporal categories and for teaching the logic of "delay" within divine purpose.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia:** The coming of Christ; for Vos both imminent hope and future event, integral to Paul's consummation motif.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / overlap of ages:** The central structural claim - the age to come has begun in Christ but awaits completion.
- **Arrabon (pledge / guarantee):** Spirit as down-payment; evidences present possession and guarantees future inheritance (1 Cor 15; Eph 1).
- **Firstfruits:** Resurrection as first instance of the new creation; guarantees collective future resurrection.
- **This age / the age to come:** Covenant-historical categories that frame Paul's temporal theology and moral exhortations.
- **Delay of the Parousia:** Not a problem to be explained away; a providential delay allowing mission, sanctification, and the unfolding of God's purposes (patience, demonstration of judgment).
 - Sub-use: Explains Pauline ethical urgency and pastoral exhortation in light of waiting.
- **Man of Lawlessness / revelation of hidden things:** Part of the eschatological sequence that occupies the interim and signals approaching consummation.
- **Adoption / redemption:** Soteriological markers showing present-benefit and future-completion structure.
- **Spirit / pneumatology:** Agent of present eschatological reality (seal, pledge) and means of sanctification.
- **Kingdom of God:** Both present rule and future consummation - ethical and ontological dimensions.
- **Resurrection (eschatological):** Central hinge for inaugurated/future tension; bodily and corporate.
- **Divine patience / longsuffering:** Theodicy element explaining delay as mercy suited to missionary scope.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for inaugurated eschatology and the "already/not yet" schema in Pauline studies.
- As an **exegetical model** linking Pauline metaphors into a systematic redemptive-historical structure.
- As a **polemic resource** against both liberal realized-eschatology and simplistic futurism/dispensationalism.
