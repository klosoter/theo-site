### TITLE
The Augustinian-Calvinist View (Paul Helm) - Four Views on Divine Providence

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century rearticulation of classical Reformed-Augustinian providence in a contemporary debate with Molinism, Open Theism, and Arminian alternatives. Part of the "Four Views" format presenting and defending a single, representative model.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God exercises **exhaustive providential control**: every contingent event is ordered by God's decree and foreknowledge while human agents act truly and responsively. This account preserves divine sovereignty and responsibility for the ordering of the world without collapsing creaturely moral responsibility.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm classical theism (God as atemporal or 'outside' time and omniscient) so divine knowledge of future events is **definite and simple**, not dependent on creaturely counterfactuals.
 - Defend a compatibilist theory of freedom: human choices are determined by character and motives but are genuinely voluntary and morally accountable.
 - Articulate a doctrine of concurrence and secondary causation: God ordains and causes events in such a way that creaturely causes operate truly and effectively.
 - Critique rival models:
 - Molinism (middle knowledge) is unnecessary and incoherent with divine sovereignty.
 - Open Theism undermines God's omniscience and fails to provide better resources for the problem of evil.
 - Apply theological and philosophical resources to theodicy: God ordains the circumstances of sin permissively (allows creatures' morally bad acts) yet uses even sin to accomplish his good ends.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine and the classic Reformed confessional tradition (Calvin, Reformed scholastics) and engages modern interlocutors: Molinists, Open Theists, and Arminians.
 - Uses analytic-philosophical tools concerning time, causation, and modality.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine foreknowledge, predestination, human freedom and responsibility, concurrence, theodicy, divine timelessness/eternity, and the distinction of decretive vs permissive will.
- **Closing line**
 - Helm situates providence squarely in an Augustinian-Calvinist metaphysic: God sovereignly ordains all that comes to pass while preserving genuine, morally significant creaturely agency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linkage of classical theism (God outside time) to a robust doctrine of exhaustive foreknowledge and decretive providence.
 - Careful philosophical defense of **compatibilist freedom** as adequate for moral responsibility within a sovereignly ordered universe.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Argues that Molinism's counterfactual apparatus compromises divine sovereignty and introduces metaphysical puzzles about true freedom.
 - Contends that Open Theism sacrifices biblical and classical attributes of God (omniscience, immutability) without resolving theodicy.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the language of concurrence, secondary causation, and the relation between decretive and permissive divine will for contemporary analytic debate.
 - Reframes common objections (e.g., responsibility for sin) by distinguishing causal ordering from moral culpability.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited as a clear, philosophically informed statement of the Reformed-Augustinian position in modern providence debates; used by conservative Reformed theologians and analytic philosophers of religion.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, rigorous template for defending classical providence across biblical, metaphysical, and pastoral loci; remains a go-to representative case for the Augustinian-Calvinist option in pluralist comparative volumes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's ultimate control and ordering of all events.
- **Providence (exhaustive/decretive)** - God not only sustains but ordains the sequence of contingent events by decree.
- **Foreknowledge (definite/simple)** - God's knowledge of future free actions is certain and not dependent on creaturely counterfactuals.
- **Predestination** - Divine eternal ordering of election and reprobation consistent with providential governance.
- **Concurrence** - Doctrine that God cooperates causally with secondary (creaturely) causes so their actions are genuinely theirs.
- **Compatibilist freedom** - Human volition is free (in a morally significant sense) though determined by character/causes compatible with God's decree.
- **Middle knowledge / counterfactuals** - Molinist device critiqued as unnecessary and problematic for divine sovereignty.
- **Open Theism** - Position denying exhaustive divine foreknowledge of future free acts; Helm argues it undermines classical theism.
- **Permissive vs decretive will** - Distinction used to explain how God ordains ends while permitting sins as contingent means.
- **Divine timelessness / atemporality** - God's relation to time undergirds the account of foreknowledge and decrees.
- **Problem of evil / theodicy** - Treated by showing how God can ordain the order of events, including permitted evils, to bring about greater goods.
- **Secondary causation** - Creatures genuinely cause effects within the scope of God's providential ordering.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - Helm is critical of treating these as ontologically prior to divine decrees.
- **Meticulous providence** - Notable label for a view emphasizing divine detail-orientation without negating creature responsibility.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed/Augustinian accounts of providence and foreknowledge.
 - As a **polemic** against Molinism and Open Theism in philosophical theology and systematic theology courses.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading biblical texts that speak of divine decrees, election, and providential ordering.
