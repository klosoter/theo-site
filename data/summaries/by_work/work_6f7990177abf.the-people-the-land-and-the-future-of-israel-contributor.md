### TITLE
**The People, the Land, and the Future of Israel** (contributor) 
Author (contributor): **Craig A. Blaising**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical debate over the relations of Israel and the church; rise of *progressive dispensationalism* as a mediating position between classical dispensationalism and covenantal approaches.
 - Conversation aims to re-evaluate promises to Israel (people, land, temple) in light of New Testament revelation and inaugurated eschatology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How should the covenantal promises to ethnic Israel (land, people, future) be understood after Christ? Blaising argues for a model of **progressive fulfillment**: promises are partially realized in Christ and the church but retain future, concrete fulfillment for Israel as a distinct people.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Hermeneutical foundation: **progressive revelation** - later revelation (esp. NT) clarifies but does not nullify earlier promises.
 - Exegetical move: careful reading of key OT and NT texts (e.g., prophetic land promises, Romans 9-11, eschatological passages) to show both continuity and future particularity for Israel.
 - Theological synthesis: advocate an **already/not-yet** framework - spiritual participation of the church in OT blessings without erasing national/land promises reserved for a future restoration of Israel.
 - Ecclesiological implication: the church **partakes** in blessings but does not fully replace Israel; ecclesial mission interacts with but does not dissolve ethnic-historical promises.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages classical dispensationalists (e.g., Ryrie, Walvoord) and covenant theologians; dialogues with interlocutors who argue either for strict replacement or total continuity.
 - Draws on NT exegesis (Pauline theology, Gospel eschatology) and recent evangelical scholarship advancing progressive dispensationalism (e.g., Darrell Bock as allied figure).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (promise, fulfillment), eschatology (inaugurated vs consummated), ecclesiology (people of God), Christology (messianic fulfillment), election, land and temple theology, hermeneutics of prophecy.

- **Closing line**
 - Blaising centers a mediating theology: **Israel retains a future, particular role in God's redemptive plan even as many promises find initial fulfillment in Christ and present participation by the church.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses *both* continuity and distinction: Israel and the church share in redemptive blessings without ontological absorption of national Israel into the church.
 - Puts weight on **typological and progressive** readings of promises rather than exclusive literalism or symbolic replacement.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back at classical dispensationalism's sharp severance of promises by arguing for partial present fulfillment and theological continuity.
 - Challenges progressive covenantalists/covenant theologians who read Israel's promises as wholly transferred to the church, insisting on retained literal future expectations for ethnic Israel.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematizes the use of **inaugurated eschatology** within a dispensational frame: prophetic promises can be inaugurated in Christ yet still await consummation for Israel.
 - Clarifies methodological categories: *promise*, *type*, *fulfillment*, and *future consummation* applied to land and people.

- **Reception & influence**
 - Important within evangelical discourse as a bridge position: influential among scholars seeking alternatives to polar extremes.
 - Criticized by strict dispensationalists for perceived concessions, and by covenant theologians for preserving national distinctions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust, teachable model for seminars on Israel and the church; useful for pastors and scholars navigating biblical-theological tensions about land and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Progressive Dispensationalism** - Blaising's framework: promises are progressively revealed and fulfilled; retains distinction between Israel and the church.
- **Already / Not-Yet** - Christ inaugurates promises (already) while some national/land consummations await future fulfillment (not-yet).
- **People of God** - Two-fold sense: corporate Israel as an ethnic-historical people and the church as spiritual participants; both relate but are not identical.
- **Land Promise** - Treated as both typologically fulfilled in Christ and literally reserved for future restoration of Israel.
- **Fulfillment (partial vs consummate)** - Distinguishes initial (typological, spiritual) fulfillment from final, literal consummation.
- **Typology** - OT persons/institutions as types that find greater clarity in NT without obliterating original referents.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology** - Jesus' coming begins the eschatological age; prophetic promises initiate fulfillment now and extend to future consummation.
- **Hermeneutic of Progressive Revelation** - Later revelation (NT) interprets earlier texts and can disclose fuller meaning without annulling prior promises.
- **Remnant** - National continuity motif: God preserves an elect remnant within Israel with eschatological hope.
- **Temple / Eschatological Worship** - Temple imagery has present-sacrificial/typological meaning and future literal/ritual implications for Israel's restoration.
- **Election** - Corporate and covenantal election of Israel remains theological anchor for future hopes.
- **Literal vs Typological Reading** - Blaising navigates a middle course: literal sense retained for promises, typology allows spiritual application.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for progressive dispensational categories (promise/fulfillment, inaugurated eschatology).
 - As a **polemic** counter to both classical dispensational replacement of prophecy and covenantal replacement theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading OT land and people promises through NT revelation, useful in eschatology, ecclesiology, and covenant studies.
