### TITLE
The Temptation and Triumph of Christ (Sermons on Matthew 4) - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-17th century English Puritan milieu (John Owen, 1616-1683). Delivered and published amid Interregnum theological ferment; Owen writes as a Reformed Congregationalist rooted in covenant theology and orthodox Protestant Christology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Matthew 4 portrays temptations that were genuinely experienced by the incarnate Son, yet Christ was **impeccable** - truly tempted without any possibility of actual sinning. His victory demonstrates both perfect obedience and the sufficiency of mediatorial grace for redemption.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical reading of Matthew 4: the threefold temptation as representative of the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil.
 - Clarification of categories: temptation versus sin; external solicitation versus inward consent.
 - Theological defense of Christ's impeccability:
 - Christ's human nature experienced temptation (real passivity and suffering).
 - But by hypostatic union and indwelling grace, Christ lacked sinful propensity - hence could not consent to sin.
 - Pastoral and soteriological application: Christ's sinless triumph secures both active and passive obedience necessary for atonement and our imitation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (exegetical labor), Augustine and Calvin as upstream authorities; polemical engagement with contemporary Arminian/Socinian tendencies (and implicitly Romanizing misunderstandings) concerning Christ's freedom and liability to sin.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), peccability/impeccability, temptation, human will and affections, original sin/concupiscence, covenant of redemption, active and passive obedience, soteriology.
- **Closing line:** Owen centralizes the paradox: **Christ was truly tempted as man yet could not sin, and that impeccability undergirds his mediatorial work - his triumph is the ground of ours.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear, technical distinction between *being tempted* and *being able to sin*; Owen insists on the reality of temptation without admitting any sinful possibility in Christ.
 - Uses the hypostatic union as the hinge: Christ's human faculties were genuine but governed by a will united to the divine nature and upheld by prevenient grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against any view that renders Christ's temptation unreal (over-spiritualizing) or that ascribes peccability (Arminian or Pelagian-leaning tendencies). Also counters Socinian denials of true deity and consequent effects on temptation.
 - Corrects simplistic accounts that reduce temptation to external testing only - insists on internal assault yet no concupiscence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of nuanced moral-philosophical categories (real temptation, moral inability to sin, natural susceptibility) to preserve both Christ's genuine humanity and absolute holiness.
 - Precise linking of temptation typology (stone, pinnacle, kingdoms) to the tripartite schema: flesh, pride/ambition, and idolatry/expediency.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and Puritan Christological teaching; Owen's sermons have been used as a standard defense of impeccability in subsequent orthodox theology.
 - Cited frequently in debates on Christ's freedom and in polemics against modern skeptical readings of the temptation narratives.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models careful exegetical-theological method: close text work married to doctrinal precision.
 - Serves as a compact, pastorally sensitive defense of orthodox Christology and the soteriological necessity of Christ's sinlessness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability:** The doctrine that Christ could not sin; Owen argues for moral inability despite genuine temptation.
- **Temptation (tentatio):** Real external and internal solicitations experienced by Christ; distinguished from sin by lack of consent.
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of divine and human natures; for Owen, the ontological basis for Christ's sinlessness and genuine human experience.
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** Christ's obedience in life (active) and suffering/death (passive) - both secured by his sinless nature and necessary for atonement.
- **Concupiscence / Corruptible Propensity:** Owen denies any sinful propensity in Christ's human nature though he allows for susceptibility to external solicitations.
- **Freedom of the Will:** Treated to show Christ's freedom is real but not libertarian ability to choose sin; freedom is perfected by union with the divine will.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Implicit background framework: Christ's triumph as fulfillment of mediatorial covenant obligations.
- **Typology of Temptations:** The three temptations as canonical paradigms: sustenance (flesh), spectacle/glory (pride/ambition), dominion/expediency (idolatry).
- **Actual Sin vs Original Sin:** Distinguishes Christ's immunity to both: no actual sin nor transmission of corruption.
- **Grace (prevenient and sustaining):** Christ's human experience included sustaining grace that preserved him from sin without negating real suffering.
- **Soteriological Grounding:** Christ's impeccability grounds the efficacy of his sacrifice and representational righteousness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the doctrine of Christ's impeccability in Christology textbooks and lectures.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates against Arminian, Socinian, or modern skeptical accounts that either deny Christ's deity/sinlessness or reduce temptation to mere appearance.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading temptation narratives: marrying historical-critical attention to text with doctrinal coherence.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christ's personal holiness to covenantal soteriology (active/passive obedience).
