### TITLE
Calvin and the Federal Vision (secondary analysis of John Calvin, ed. J. Mark Beach) 
A focused appraisal of how Calvin's covenant language, exegetical moves, and soteriological commitments are invoked, affirmed, or contested in recent Federal Vision debates.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Modern re-examination: editors and contributors bring Calvin into conversation with the 21st‑century Federal Vision controversy over covenant, sacraments, and justification.
 - Theological milieu: Reformed confessional tradition confronted by contemporary emphases on corporate covenantal identity, sacramental efficacy, and covenant perseverance.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Can Calvin's covenant theology be read to support Federal Vision emphases (covenant objectivity, corporate election, sacramental baptismal incorporation) without compromising his commitments to forensic justification and imputed righteousness?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical close-readings of Calvin on Adam, the Mosaic law, and Christ as covenant mediator.
 - Comparative analysis: Calvin's rhetoric and theological moves versus Federal Vision formulations about covenant membership and covenantal blessings.
 - Assessment of continuity and rupture: where Calvin can be appropriated and where modern readings impose foreign categories.
 - (Reference anchors: Calvin, Institutes on law and covenant [Institutes 2.x]; Calvin's Genesis commentary on Adam's state; Beach, ed., Calvin and the Federal Vision.)
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes; commentaries).
 - Secondary: editors and contributors in the Beach volume representing both critics and sympathetic readers of the Federal Vision; larger Reformed confessional voices (e.g., Westminster tradition) as comparative benchmarks.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace), law and gospel distinction, imputation and forensic justification, union with Christ, sacraments as signs/seals, typology and the Mosaic covenant.
- **Closing line**
 - The volume treats Calvin as both resource and corrective: his robust covenant theology supplies materials for covenantal realism, but his persistent emphasis on forensic imputation and Christ's unique mediatorial work sets limits that constrain Federal Vision readings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Calvin prioritizes God's promise and Christ's mediatorial work as the hinge of covenantal reality; covenant membership is grounded in Christ, not merely in external sign or familial inclusion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against readings that collapse forensic justification into covenantal standing, Calvin maintains a juridical account of justification alongside corporate covenant language.
 - Calvin resists speculative metaphysics about Adam's hypothetical continuity; he insists on Scripture's historical framing of creation and fall.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Calvin uses covenantal terminology flexibly but does not systematize a later technical distinction "covenant of works" vs. "covenant of grace" in the exact terms later systems will; later Reformed theologians formalize what Calvin treats in loci.
 - Calvin's notion of "republication" of the law (law's renewed function under Moses) is a critical pivot for discussing Mosaic covenant status.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Calvin remains a primary touchstone in Reformed debates; both Federal Vision advocates and critics appeal to him selectively, producing competing appropriations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a measured exegetical and theological standard: careful use of Calvin helps guard against conflating covenant membership with salvific justification or treating sacraments as automatically efficacious apart from faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (foedus / pactum)** - relational framework binding God's promises to Christ's mediatorial role.
- **Covenant of Works** - Calvin treats Adam's original command as binding obligation, but avoids late technical systematization; used by later Reformed authors to describe Adam's pre‑fall relation to God (cf. Institutes 2.2).
- **Covenant of Grace** - God's redemptive arrangement fulfilled in Christ; Calvin centers promise and Christ's obedience/imputation.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - Calvin sees law under Moses as a distinct administration with typological and civil functions; he stops short of calling it a pure "covenant of works as to substance" without qualification (see Institutes 2.10; Genesis/Exodus commentaries).
- **Republication of the Law** - Calvin's account of law's renewed articulations under Moses, used to explain continuity/division between Adamic command and Sinai.
- **Imputation / forensic justification** - central Calvinist term: righteousness of Christ counted to believers; a primary constraint on Federal Vision redefinitions.
- **Union with Christ** - existential and forensic bond that grounds salvation and covenantal privileges.
- **Sacraments (signs and seals)** - visible means that confirm promises; Calvin affirms their corporate and promise‑sealing role but ties efficacy to Spirit and faith.
- **Law and Gospel distinction** - hermeneutical axis for Calvin's pastoral and doctrinal moves; law condemns, gospel promises life in Christ.
- **Type and antitype** - typology as exegetical method linking Old covenant institutions to Christ.
- **Hypothetical Adam (What if Adam had not sinned?)** - Calvin resists idle speculation but affirms that Adam had a real probation and that obedience would have secured continuance in life (Institutes 2.2).
- **Forensic / covenantal tension** - a recurring dialectic: covenantal belonging vs. forensic declaration; Calvin preserves both.
- **Corporate election / covenantal incorporation** - Calvin's corporate language is appropriated by Federal Vision interpreters but must be tempered by Calvin's doctrine of personal faith and imputed righteousness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed covenant categories (with caveats about Calvin's non‑technical usage).
- As a **polemic**: both for defending Federal Vision emphases on covenantal realism and for rebutting those who minimize forensic justification.
- As an **exegetical model**: Calvin's typological method and use of the Mosaic texts inform contemporary covenantal exegesis.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over sacraments, baptismal inclusion, and the boundaries of covenant membership.
