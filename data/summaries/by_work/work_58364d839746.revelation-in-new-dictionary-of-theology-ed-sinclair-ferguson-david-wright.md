### TITLE
Revelation - Henri Blocher, entry in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical Reformed milieu (entry in the New Dictionary of Theology, 1980s/90s). Blocher writes as a French Reformed evangelical theologian conversant with Continental and Anglo‑American debates (Barthian critique of natural theology, revival of doctrinal apologetics, post‑Enlightenment epistemological pressures).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To define and defend a coherent doctrine of revelation that preserves both the objective disclosure of God and the personal, Christ‑centered, redemptive character of that disclosure; to situate Scripture and Christ in rightly ordered relation to general revelation without collapsing or bifurcating knowledge of God.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Distinguishes **revelation as God's act** (self‑disclosure) from **revelation as content** (what is disclosed).
 - Analyzes **general revelation** (nature, conscience, providence) as real, analogical, and cognitively sufficient to ground theism but not soteriologically adequate.
 - Analyzes **special revelation** (Christ, Scripture, saving acts) as definitive, propositional and personal - the culmination of God's self‑disclosure in history.
 - Affirms **Christocentric primacy**: Christ is the decisive revelation; Scripture bears witness to this revelation and functions normatively for doctrine and life.
 - Emphasizes the role of the **Holy Spirit** in illumination and the ecclesial reception of revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Implicit engagement with **Karl Barth** (limits of natural theology), **classical Reformed** sources (Calvin on sensus divinitatis and Scripture), and modern apologetic problems (empiricism, historicism).
 - Dialogues with evangelical exegetical tradition (Rom 1; Heb 1:1-3; John 1).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (general & special), Scripture (inscripturation, authority, sufficiency), Christology (revelation in the person of Christ), Holy Spirit (illumination), knowledge of God (analogical vs. univocal), natural theology.
- **Closing line:** God truly makes himself known in creation and conscience, but his saving and definitive self‑disclosure occurs in Christ and is mediated normatively by the Spirit‑witnessed Scriptures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced mediating posture:** Blocher refuses both the absolutizing of natural theology (naive naturalism) and the radical negation of general revelation; he affirms meaningful, analogical knowledge of God in creation while insisting on the priority of special revelation for salvation and doctrine.
- **Act/content distinction sharpened:** Emphasizes that revelation is first an event (God's self‑communication) and only secondarily the content we summarize; this avoids reducing revelation to mere propositions or texts.
- **Christ as decisive revelation:** Blocher stresses a strongly Christocentric model - Scripture's authority is derivative and interpretive, pointing to the incarnate Word rather than competing with it.
- **Propositional but personal:** He defends that revelation contains propositional truth-claims without denying its fundamentally personal, relational, and historical character.
- **Corrective to Barth and fideism:** While sympathetic to Barth's Christocentrism, Blocher corrects what he sees as Barth's underestimation of natural revelation's cognitive role; likewise he resists fideistic dismissal of rational or evidential claims.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely read in Reformed and evangelical reference literature as a clear, compact synthesis; used in teaching on doctrine of revelation and in apologetics that wish to combine intellectual credibility with confessional fidelity.
- **Enduring value:** Clarity in conceptual distinctions (act/content; general/special), pedagogical usefulness, and a model for integrating Scripture, Christ, and natural knowledge without collapsing boundaries.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (act vs content):** God's self‑disclosure (act) and the propositional/contentual output that communicates that self.
- **General revelation:** Knowledge of God available in creation, providence, and conscience - analogical, universal, non‑soteriological.
- **Special revelation:** God's redemptive disclosure in Christ, Scripture, and saving acts - definitive and normative for faith.
- **Christocentric revelation:** The principle that Christ is the culmination and decisive locus of divine self‑disclosure.
- **Scripture (inscripturation):** The written witness that makes the redemptive revelation accessible and authoritative.
- **Analogy (analogical knowledge):** Human knowledge of God is true but proportionate and derivative, avoiding univocal claims.
- **Natural theology:** Claims about God from reason/nature - affirmed as valid but limited; critiqued when absolutized.
- **Propositional content:** Revelation conveys true propositions about God without reducing revelation to mere abstract syllogisms.
- **Illumination (Holy Spirit):** The Spirit's work in enabling recognition and appropriation of revealed truth.
- **Normativity:** Scripture functions as the normative rule for doctrine and life because it witnesses to Christ.
- **Sufficiency:** Special revelation's sufficiency for salvation and theology, contrasted with the inability of general revelation to save.
- **Witness/witnessing:** Emphasizes ecclesial and textual testimony as the medium by which revelation is received.
- **Cognitive adequacy:** The degree to which revelation furnishes reliable knowledge about God; different for general vs special revelation.
- **Mediation:** The means (Scripture, preaching, sacraments) by which revelation is encountered in the church.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: concise, balanced definitions for entry-level and advanced overviews of revelation.
- As a **polemic resource**: to critique both liberal overconfidence in natural theology and strict fideism/Barthian reductions.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model**: for teaching Christocentric, Spirit-mediated reading of Scripture that preserves propositional content without depersonalizing revelation.
