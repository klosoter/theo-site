### TITLE
The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th - early 20th century Princeton Reformed orthodoxy; reaction to higher criticism and theological liberalism. Warfield (1851-1921) stands in the conservative Princeton lineage (Hodge) defending classical Protestant bibliology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture is the inspired, inerrant, and self-attesting Word of God; its authority is normative for theology because of divine authorship and the Spirit's attestation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defense of *plenary, verbal inspiration*: God inspired the Scripture in its words and sense; human authors wrote genuinely but under divine supervision.
 - Affirmation of *inerrancy*: properly interpreted, Scripture is without error in all that it intends to affirm.
 - Distinction of *general* vs *special revelation*: natural revelation reveals God's existence/attributes but cannot substitute for saving knowledge; Scripture is the decisive, propositional disclosure.
 - Role of the Holy Spirit: Spirit provides internal testimony (illumination) that authenticates Scripture to believers without adding new revelation.
 - Authority is both objective (God-authored text) and subjectively apprehended (Spirit-witness); Warfield addresses the alleged circularity by locating the Spirit's historic, ecclesial witness and the evidential confirmation of Scripture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages higher critics and theological modernists (German criticism), the empiricist objections to supernatural revelation, and later anticipates debates with neo-orthodoxy (e.g., Barth) and Thomistic/Rahnerian moves on natural theology.
 - Draws on Reformed confessional tradition, classical Protestant scholasticism, patristic appeals to Spirit-witness.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology (chief focus), Pneumatology (Spirit's attestation and illumination), Anthropology (Imago Dei and human receptivity to revelation), Doctrine of God (natural revelation), Covenant theology (Scripture as covenantal witness), and implications for theology as a discipline.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center of gravity: Scripture, as the Spirit-authenticated, divinely inspired record, is the final, binding norm for knowledge of God and for theological method.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust defense of *plenary verbal inspiration* distinguishing divine authorship from mechanical dictation: human authors are real authors under divine superintendence.
 - Sharp insistence that authority is not merely ecclesial or existential but objectively grounded in God's action in revelation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against liberal historicism: rejects reduction of Scripture to religious experience or moral teaching only.
 - Against emerging neo-orthodoxy (Barthian tendencies): insists on Scripture's propositional content and inerrancy rather than making Scripture merely a witness to the living Word (Christ) such that its propositional reliability is secondary.
 - On natural theology: accepts general revelation but resists the weakening of special revelation (pushback vs Rahner's openness to analogies between faith and reason).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced handling of *self-attestation* - not an isolated subjective claim but a Spirit-witnessed, historically rooted attestational structure; sophisticated defense of non-vicious circularity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Formative for 20th-century conservative Reformed and evangelical bibliology; key source for later inerrancy formulations (e.g., Chicago Statement).
 - Critiqued by neo-orthodox and liberal theologians for perceived epistemic circularity and overemphasis on propositional revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a dense, disciplined model for bibliology that integrates pneumatology and epistemology; indispensable for teaching classical Protestant views on inspiration, authority, and the Holy Spirit's role.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plenary verbal inspiration**
 - God's full (plenary) and word-level (verbal) involvement in Scripture's production; expressions of human authorship remain genuine.
- **Inerrancy**
 - Scripture is without error in all it intends to affirm; not a claim about modern historiography or scientific minutiae beyond authorial intent.
- **Self-attestation**
 - Scripture's claim to authority is ultimately self-authenticating because it is God's Word, validated by the Spirit's internal testimony.
 - Warfield frames this to avoid a vicious epistemic circle: Spirit's historical witness and the community's reception provide corroboration.
- **Illumination**
 - The Spirit's enabling work in believers that makes Scripture intelligible and convincing; distinguished from additional revelation.
- **General vs Special Revelation**
 - General: natural revelation (creation, conscience) yields knowledge of God's existence/attributes.
 - Special: Scripture (and Christ) provides saving, propositional revelation that completes general revelation.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Human capacity (rational, moral, covenantal) to receive and respond to divine revelation; grounds theological anthropology for receptivity to Scripture.
- **Analogia entis vs analogia fidei**
 - Warfield privileges analogia fidei-style methodology (Scripture governs theology) and is wary of analogia entis claims that elevate natural theology beyond its limits.
- **Rahner's rule / Barthian reformulation**
 - Warfield anticipates and resists Rahner-style rapprochements between autonomous reason and faith, and Barthian redefinitions that relocate authority from Scripture-as-text to Scripture-as-witness-to-Christ.
- **Continuationism vs Cessationism**
 - Warfield leans cessationist: miraculous sign gifts were normative for apostolic authentication and are not normative for ordinary church life.
- **Propositional revelation**
 - Warfield affirms Scripture communicates propositional truths (doctrine), not merely religious insight or existential encounter.
- **Objective vs subjective authority**
 - Objective: divine authorship and inerrant content; Subjective: Spirit's internal attestation and ecclesial reception.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a defining source for conservative *bibliology* and the doctrine of inerrancy.
 - As polemic against liberal and neo-orthodox accounts of revelation; used in debates over Barth, Rahner, and modernist criticism.
 - As a methodological and exegetical model for integrating pneumatology (illumination) with theological epistemology.
