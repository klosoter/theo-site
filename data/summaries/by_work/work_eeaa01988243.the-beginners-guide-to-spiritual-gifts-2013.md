### TITLE
**Sam Storms, The Beginner's Guide to Spiritual Gifts (2013)** 
A Reformed-evangelical manual for practicing and discerning New Testament gifts in the local church.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 2013 evangelical landscape; convergence of Calvinist soteriology with charismatic practice (so-called Charismatic Calvinism).
 - Pastoral response amid renewed cessationist critique and debate; aims at accessible, church-facing instruction.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - All New Testament spiritual gifts continue and should be earnestly desired and exercised under Scripture's sufficiency for the edification and sanctification of the church.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Biblical foundations**: Exegesis of 1 Cor 12-14; Rom 12; Eph 4; 1 Thess 5:19-22; Acts narrative.
 - **Taxonomy of gifts**: Descriptions, aims, and safeguards for revelatory, miraculous, and service gifts.
 - **Pastoral practice**: How to pursue, test, interpret, and order gifts in gathered worship.
 - **Answering objections**: Replies to cessationist arguments (apostolic signs, canon closure, sufficiency).
 - **Prayerful pursuit**: Practical counsel to cultivate expectancy without triumphalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively engages **Wayne Grudem** (NT prophecy), **D. A. Carson** (1 Cor 12-14), **Jonathan Edwards** (discernment, affections), **Gordon Fee**, **Craig Keener**.
 - Responds to **B. B. Warfield** and contemporary cessationists (e.g., **John MacArthur**).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology**; **revelation and canon** (Scripture's sufficiency vs non-canonical impressions); **sanctification**; **ecclesiology and worship**; **mission**; **providence and healing**; **inaugurated eschatology** (already/not yet).
- **Closing line**
 - Gifts are **love-driven, Word-governed, Spirit-empowered means** for building up Christ's body until the eschatological fullness arrives.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Reformed continuationism**: Strong divine sovereignty with Pauline imperatives to "earnestly desire."
 - **Prophecy as fallible report**: Distinguishes infallible revelation (Scripture) from congregational prophecy that must be weighed.
 - **Edification first**: Love (1 Cor 13) and intelligibility regulate every practice.
 - **Already/not yet realism**: Expect healing and miracles without presuming guarantees.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **cessationism**: Sign gifts are not tethered to apostles alone; 1 Cor 13's "perfect" refers to the eschaton, not the canon; sufficiency of Scripture is compatible with ongoing gifts rightly tested.
 - Against **charismatic excess**: Rejects manipulative techniques, over-realized eschatology, and conflating gifts with maturity; insists on testing, order, and elder oversight.
- **Conceptual clarifications**
 - **Revelation-interpretation-application** triad in handling impressions.
 - **Gift vs office**: Distinguishes the gift of prophecy from the foundational office of prophet (Eph 2:20).
 - **Fruit vs gifts**: Character grounds credibility; gifts do not equal holiness.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical churches exploring Word-and-Spirit integration; a bridge text for cautious non-charismatics.
 - Critiqued by strict cessationists yet often respected for exegetical tone and pastoral safeguards.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, church-tested guidance; balanced apologetic and praxis; accessible synthesis of scholarly and pastoral insights.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism**: View that all NT gifts persist; grounded in exegesis and inaugurated eschatology.
- **Cessationism**: View that certain gifts ceased; Storms answers arguments from apostolicity, canon, and sufficiency.
- **Charismata**: Spirit's grace-gifts (1 Cor 12); for common good and edification.
- **Manifestation of the Spirit**: Concrete, situational expressions of the Spirit's activity (1 Cor 12:7, 11).
- **Prophecy (NT)**: Human, fallible report of a divine prompting; must be weighed (1 Thess 5:19-22; 1 Cor 14:29).
 - Distinct from Scripture: non-canonical, corrigible, congregationally tested.
- **Tongues and Interpretation**: Prayer/praise in unlearned language; requires interpretation in the assembly for edification.
- **Word of Knowledge/Wisdom**: Timely, Spirit-given insight; submitted to Scripture and community testing.
- **Gifts of Healings**: Real, variable manifestations of God's mercy; pursued in prayer, not presumed.
- **Miracles**: Signs that attest Christ's reign; neither routine nor rare by rule, but sovereignly distributed.
- **Discerning of Spirits**: Evaluating influences (divine, human, demonic) in teaching and phenomena.
- **Edification, Consolation, Encouragement**: Pauline criteria for judging helpfulness and order (1 Cor 14:3).
- **Quenching/Despising**: Forbidding gifts or cynically dismissing prophetic speech; avoided by testing rather than banning.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture**: Scripture uniquely norms and tests all gifts; gifts do not add doctrine or canon.
- **Already/Not Yet**: Eschatological frame that shapes expectancy and patience in practice.
- **Impartation/Laying on of Hands**: Prayerful means God sometimes uses to awaken gifts; not mechanical.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Pentecostalism and Reformed Response**: As a Reformed-charismatic alternative clarifying continuist practice without Pentecostal distinctives like tongues-as-initial-evidence.
 - **Spiritual Gifts and Sanctification**: As a pastoral model showing gifts as means for corporate holiness, subordinated to love and fruit.
 - **Continuationism vs Cessationism**: As an accessible exegetical and theological brief for ongoing gifts that preserves Scripture's sufficiency and church order.
