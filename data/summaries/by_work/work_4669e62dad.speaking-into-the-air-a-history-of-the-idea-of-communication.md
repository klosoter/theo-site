### TITLE
**Speaking Into The Air: A History of the Idea of Communication** - John D. Peters (John Durham Peters)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1999-2001 period in media studies and communication theory; cross-disciplinary conversation with philosophy, literary studies, and theology.
 - Responds to dominance of the engineering/information model (Shannon) and later constructivist/pragmatist accounts by recovering a longue duree of Western thinking about "communication."
 - Moves within a broadly humanistic and historical method rather than technical social-science empiricism.

- **Central thesis**
 - The idea of "communication" is historically constructed; sustained metaphors and theological-political commitments have shaped how Western thought imagines voice, address, medium, and reception. Contemporary assumptions (especially the transmission model) obscure older and alternative ways of thinking about speech, presence, and relation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of a genealogy: classical rhetoric, medieval theology, early modern epistemology, Romantic and modern philosophies, up to 20th-century media theory.
 - Key moves:
 - Reconstruct rhetorical and theological antecedents that imagine communication as address, gift, divine speech, or demonic/angelic mediation.
 - Diagnose modern reification of communication as reliable transmission of content and the attendant political/ethical consequences.
 - Offer conceptual resources to think about nonideal communication: misrecognition, incommunicability, atmosphere, indirect address, and the role of nonhuman media.
 - Uses historical case studies and close readings rather than programmatic theory-building.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Classical rhetoric (Plato, Aristotle), Augustine and medieval theologians on speech and divine Word, early moderns (Descartes, Locke), Romantic and nineteenth-century writers on voice, and modern media theorists (including Shannon and Heidegger indirectly).
 - Draws on literary texts, philosophical tracts, ecclesiastical sources; dialogues with communication scholars and continental philosophers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Word**: theological accounts of divine speech, inspiration, and address as models of perfect communication.
 - **Pneumatology / Spirit**: implicit and explicit concerns about presence, inspiration, and spirit as communicative agency.
 - **Anthropology of language**: how persons are constituted as speaking/listening subjects.
 - **Publicity / ecclesiology**: the public sphere, assembly, and the politics of address.
 - Less emphasis on systematic dogmatics, more on the theological feedstock that conditioned communicative metaphors.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Peters situates communication not as a neutral technical process but as a culturally and theologically saturated practice of address and reception whose ideals of transparency and perfect transmission must be historically interrogated.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the history of "communication" as an intellectual history of metaphors (air, voice, ventriloquism, transmission) rather than solely as technical evolution.
 - Brings theological sources (Augustine, notions of divine Word) into conversation with media theory in a rigorous way.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges the dominance of the Shannon/information-entropy model by showing its limited philosophical pedigree and by proposing a pluralized set of communicative imaginaries.
 - Counters purely linguistic/pragmatic reductions by reintroducing rhetorical, liturgical, and sacramental notions of address and reception.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses metaphors such as **"speaking into the air"** to capture the precariousness of address and to critique assumptions of guaranteed reception.
 - Emphasizes **incommunicability, indirect address, and nonhuman mediation** as analytically decisive terms for rethinking communication.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted and cited across media studies, communication theory, and theologically oriented cultural criticism.
 - Influential for scholars rethinking the normative claims of information theory and for those exploring the theological dimensions of media.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for theologians interested in revelation, rhetoric, and ecclesial speech; for media scholars seeking a historically sensitive critique of technical models; and for interdisciplinary courses on language, religion, and public life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communication** - historically variable concept; not a single natural category but a set of cultural practices and metaphors for address and reception.
- **Transmission model** - engineering/information paradigm criticized for masking historical-theological assumptions about presence and clarity.
- **Air / atmosphere** - medium metaphor emphasizing openness, risk, and the possibility of nonreceipt; signals precarious address.
- **Voice** - not simply sound but a social and ontological act; configured differently in theological (divine Word), rhetorical, and technological registers.
- **Address / addressee** - the relation of speaker to listener; Peters stresses the ethics and politics implicit in who is considered a legitimate addressee.
- **Incommunicability** - the persistent residue of failure, secrecy, opacity, and otherness that resists perfect transmission.
- **Ventriloquism** - metaphor for projection of voice into the world and for problems of authorship, agency, and mediation.
- **Revelation / Word (Logos)** - theological models of perfect communication that shape secular notions of fidelity and presence.
- **Medium** - material and institutional conditions of speaking and hearing; includes nonhuman media and environmental contexts.
- **Public sphere / publicity** - political dimension of communicative practice: assembly, publicity, and exclusion.
- **Reception** - not mere passive receipt but active interpretation conditioned by historical presuppositions.
- **Nonhuman listeners** - attention to animals, spirits, technologies as participants in communicative ecologies.
- **Ontology of communication** - the claim that "communication" names constitutive relations for subjects, politics, and theology rather than a neutral tool.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theology and communication to recover theological resources (Word, revelation) for media critique.
 - As a **historical source** for courses on rhetoric, media history, and theology of language - supplying genealogies and close readings that challenge technocratic assumptions.
 - As a **polemic** against reductive information models, used to reframe debates about transparency, authenticity, and the ethics of address.
