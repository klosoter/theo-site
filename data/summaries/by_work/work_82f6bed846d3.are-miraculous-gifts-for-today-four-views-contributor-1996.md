### TITLE
Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (contributor, 1996) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-1990s ecumenical debate over Pentecostal/charismatic renewal; volume presents four continental positions. Gaffin writes from a conservative Reformed, post-Reformation theological milieu concerned to protect the canonical and confessional shape of Protestant doctrine concerning the Spirit and gifts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Whether the New Testament "sign" or "miraculous" gifts (tongues, prophecy as revelatory, healings, miracles) continue today, or whether they belonged uniquely to the apostolic foundation and have ceased.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Distinguishes between **foundational sign-gifts** given to authenticate apostles and the initial revelation, and **ordinary gifts** that continue for sanctification and ministry. 
 - Argues that once the apostolic foundation and normative revelation (canon) were in place, the authenticating function of sign-gifts ceased. 
 - Asserts the finality and sufficiency of Scripture as the normative locus of revelation; contemporary claims to revelatory parity with Scripture are therefore illegitimate. 
 - Uses exegetical treatment of key texts (esp. 1 Cor 12-14, 1 Cor 13:8-12, Eph 2:20) combined with canonical and historical theology to support cessation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** primary interlocutors are continuationist/charismatic advocates in late 20th-century evangelicalism; Gaffin draws on Reformed authorities and patristic/modern scholarship (e.g., Warfield-type cessationist resources) and engages exegetical tradition on Pauline passages.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation (finality of canon), pneumatology (Spirit's gifts and offices), ecclesiology (apostolic foundation, order), scriptural authority and sufficiency, and indirectly soteriology and eschatology (relation of gifts to consummation).
- **Closing line:** Gaffin's theological center: the Spirit continues his sanctifying and ordinary gifting in the church, but the extraordinary, revelatory sign-gifts belonged primarily to the apostolic age for authentication of the gospel and thus are not normative for the post-apostolic church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Careful categorical distinction between **foundational sign-gifts** (temporary, apostolic-authenticating) and **nonfoundational/ordinary gifts** (ongoing). 
 - Strong canonical orientation: the closure and sufficiency of Scripture is a decisive factor for denying modern revelatory gifts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Moves beyond simplistic "gifts stopped" slogans by grounding cessation in the apostolic-canonical function of gifts rather than mere chronological exhaustion. 
 - Contrasts with continuationists who insist on ongoing revelatory parity, by reinterpreting Pauline "the perfect" and related texts as indicating completion of foundation/canon rather than unrestricted ongoing gift-use.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Emphasis on **apostolicity** as a theological criterion for the legitimation and termination of certain gifts (i.e., gifts authenticating apostleship cease with the apostolic era). 
 - Use of the term **ordinary vs. extraordinary** gifts as normative categories in pastoral theology.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited and respected within conservative Reformed and many evangelical seminary contexts as a learned, pastorally sensitive articulation of cessationism. 
 - Serves as an important foil in debates and dialogues with charismatic theologians; less persuasive to continuationists but often acknowledged for exegetical seriousness.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models how to integrate exegesis, historical theology, and confessional commitments when treating pneumatological controversies. 
 - Useful as a seminary-level summary of the cessationist position that refuses anti-Spirit caricature while rejecting charismatic claims to new revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism:** position that certain miraculous/sign gifts ceased with the apostolic foundation.
- **Continuationism:** opposing position claiming ongoing validity of miraculous/revelatory gifts.
- **Sign-gifts / Miraculous gifts:** tongues, prophetic revelation (in revelatory sense), healings, miracles - Gaffin treats these as primarily apostolic-authenticating.
- **Ordinary gifts:** Spirit-given abilities for ministry and sanctification that continue in the church (preaching, teaching, pastoral oversight, spiritual fruit).
- **Apostolicity:** criterion that grounds the legitimacy and eventual cessation of foundation-level gifts; the apostolic era had unique needs for authentication.
- **Canon / Canonical sufficiency:** the Bible as the final normative revelation; once in place, it renders ongoing revelatory gifts non-normative.
- **1 Corinthians 12-14 & 13:8-12:** principal exegetical locus; Gaffin reads Paul as indicating a transition from provisional gifts to a fixed, authoritative revelation.
- **Authentication:** the function of miracles and signs to verify apostolic proclamation and the initial revelation.
- **Revelatory vs. non-revelatory prophecy:** Gaffin distinguishes prophecy that adds revelatory content (abrogated) from prophecy as edification under Scripture (continues in regulated sense).
- **Extraordinary vs. ordinary ministry:** framework for discerning gift categories and appropriate ecclesial practice.
- **Eschatological consummation vs. canonical completion:** two interpretive options for "the perfect"; Gaffin emphasizes completion of foundation/canon as decisive for practice, while not denying eschatological relevance.
- **Normativity of Scripture:** recurring principle limiting claims to contemporary revelation.
- **Sanctifying work of the Spirit:** affirmed as ongoing and distinct from apostolic sign-gifts.

How the work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline gift texts within a Reformed theological frame. 
- As a **polemic and clarifying definition** in debates with charismatic continuationists (used to rebut claims of ongoing revelatory parity). 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary curricula to teach distinctions between foundational/authenticating and ongoing/ordinary gifts.
