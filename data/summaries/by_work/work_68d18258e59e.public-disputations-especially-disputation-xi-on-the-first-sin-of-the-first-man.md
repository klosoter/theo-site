### TITLE
Public Disputations (Disputation XI: On the First Sin of the First Man) - Jacobus Arminius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 17th century Leiden; part of Arminius's academic disputations delivered at the University of Leiden (c. 1590s-1600s).
 - Milieu: late Reformation scholasticism turning toward polemical exchanges between emerging Arminian (Remonstrant) positions and strict Reformed (Gomarist/Calvinist) orthodoxy.
 - Audience: students, colleagues, and later polemicists who used the disputations in the Remonstrant controversy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How did the first sin of Adam affect his posterity? Specifically: what is the nature of original sin, how is it transmitted, and in what sense (if any) is Adam's sin imputed to his descendants?

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition: Arminius carefully distinguishes types of "sin" (actus peccati, culpa, privatio boni) and defines the "first sin" as Adam's disobedient act with its consequences.
 - Transmission: argues that the corruption of human nature is transmitted by natural generation (seminal/mediate transmission), producing universal concupiscence and loss of original righteousness in posterity.
 - Imputation: distinguishes between
 - **forensic imputation** (the legal reckoning of guilt), and
 - **natural participation** (being corrupted and depraved by descent).
 - He rejects the idea that each person is guilty as if he personally committed Adam's specific act; guilt arises from the corrupted nature and from personal transgression.
 - Exegetical moves: close appeal to Genesis and Romans (esp. Rom. 5) to show corporate solidarity without collapsing individual moral responsibility.
 - Pastoral/theological move: insistence on universal need of prevenient and subsequent grace, not excusing personal responsibility.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis of Genesis and Pauline texts (Romans 5).
 - Engagement with Augustine's formulations (selective acceptance and critique).
 - Polemical orientation toward contemporary Reformed scholastics (e.g., Gomarus) who defended a sterner forensic imputation and federal-head model.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin (nature, transmission, effects)
 - Imputation (forensic vs. ontological participation)
 - Human freedom/will and responsibility
 - Covenant headship (implicit treatment insofar as headship relates to imputation)
 - Soteriology: universal need for grace

- **Closing line**
 - Arminius centers the discussion on a twofold truth: human posterity is genuinely deprived and corrupted by Adam's fall (thus universally needy), yet individuals are not simply the forensic bearers of Adam's personal act; culpability arises from corrupted nature and personal transgression, demanding divine grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precise distinction between *natural participation* in a corrupted nature and *forensic imputation* of Adam's personal guilt.
 - Emphasis on natural generation as the mechanism of transmission rather than a purely juridical transfer of guilt.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters an uncompromising federalism that treats every descendant as juridically guilty of Adam's single act in the same mode as Adam's personal guilt.
 - Modifies Augustinian language by restraining blanket forensic imputation while retaining Augustine's conviction of universal depravity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic triage of categories (act, guilt, privation) applied to the historical fall and its consequences.
 - Use of "participation" language to mark ontological continuity without collapsing personal culpability.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a core text for Remonstrant teachers defending a mitigated doctrine of original sin.
 - Influenced later Arminians (notably Methodists) who sought to balance human responsibility and universal need of grace.
 - Provoked sharp rebuttals from Reformed scholastics, contributing to the formulation of stricter confessional statements.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a nuanced, exegetically careful approach to Romans 5 and Genesis on original sin.
 - Serves as a temperate corrective within Protestant debates-helpful for courses on sin, covenant headship, and the history of the Arminian-Calvinist controversy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin** - the inherited depravity and loss of original righteousness resulting from Adam's fall.
- **First sin (Adam's act)** - the historical disobedient act; treated as distinct from the ensuing inherited condition.
- **Natural generation / seminal transmission** - the mechanism Arminius affirms for passing corrupted nature to posterity.
- **Forensic imputation** - juridical reckoning of guilt; Arminius limits its application so as not to make every descendant the author of Adam's specific act.
- **Participation (ontological participation)** - being partakers of Adam's corrupted nature without being the personal agents of his particular sin.
- **Privatio boni (privation of good)** - language Arminius uses to describe what is lost in humanity by the Fall (a classical philosophical/theological idiom).
- **Concupiscence** - the inclination to sin; seen as real and universal in posterity.
- **Guilt (culpa) vs. corruption (peccatum originale)** - central analytic distinction: guilt relates to culpability, corruption to ontological condition.
- **Federal headship** - engaged critically; Arminius accepts corporate consequences but nuances how headship effects imputation.
- **Prevenient grace** - implied pastoral consequence: universal need and divine initiative preceding personal conversion.
- **Romans 5 / Genesis exegesis** - Arminius's primary scriptural loci for argument.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a nuanced Arminian doctrine of original sin that combines seminal transmission with restraint of forensic imputation.
 - As a **polemic** against strict federal-imputation models in Reformed scholasticism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5 that preserves corporate solidarity and individual responsibility.
