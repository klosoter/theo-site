### TITLE
**In Christ Alone: Living the Gospel Centered Life** - Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century Reformed renewal; part of Ligonier/Reformation Trust efforts to re-center evangelical piety on classical Christology and the ordo salutis. Pastoral-theological essays pitched to advanced lay readers, pastors, and students.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Christian life is intelligible only in union and communion with the incarnate, crucified, risen, and reigning Christ; gospel-centeredness is Christ-centeredness, which alone answers sin's guilt, pollution, and power and secures assurance, perseverance, and hope.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Person of Christ:** True God and true man; two natures, one person; **impeccability** upheld without compromising the reality of temptation; obedience in humiliation and exaltation.
 - **Work of Christ:** Active and passive obedience; penal substitution and priestly mediation; cross and resurrection as the axis of redemptive history.
 - **Union with Christ:** Federal headship (Adam/Christ), participation by the Spirit; justification and sanctification as distinct yet inseparable benefits.
 - **Sin and the Fall:** Origin and nature of sin; **total depravity and inability**; guilt, corruption, and death from Adam; the necessity of regeneration.
 - **Assurance and perseverance:** Gospel grounds of assurance in Christ's finished work and promises, not introspective performance; Spirit's witness; perseverance as God's preserving grace.
 - **Eschatology:** Personal and cosmic horizons; judgment seat of Christ; resurrection and new creation shaping present holiness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture as primary; Nicene-Chalcedonian Christology; Augustine, Calvin, Westminster Standards, Puritans (esp. Owen); engages contemporary evangelical moralism, antinomian drift, and revisions of atonement/justification.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; Trinity implicitly; Christology (person, states, offices); hamartiology (original sin, death); soteriology (union, justification, sanctification, adoption, perseverance); ecclesial means of grace; eschatology (individual and cosmic).
- **Closing line:** The gospel's center of gravity is the person and work of Christ applied by the Spirit; all Christian doctrine and devotion coheres in union with him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Impeccability clarified:** Christ could not sin, yet truly faced temptation as the obedient Son for us and our salvation.
 - **Gospel grammar of grace:** Justification and sanctification are distinct, never separated; grace both pardons and transforms.
 - **Pastoral deployment of federal theology:** Adam-Christ contrast animates assurance, holiness, and hope.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Counters moralistic therapeutic religion by rooting assurance in Christ's objective work.
 - Pushes back against antinomianism by locating holiness in union with Christ and the Spirit's renewing power.
 - Rejects atonement reductions by insisting on penal substitution within a rich priestly-mediatorial frame.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes **gospel-centered life** with rigorous Christological scaffolding.
 - Re-energizes classic categories (humiliation/exaltation; offices) for contemporary discipleship.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed churches, seminaries, and study groups as a gateway to classic Christology and piety.
 - Helped shape early 2000s gospel-centered discourse with confessional depth rather than mere slogans.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Reliable primer on Christ's person and work alongside practical implications for assurance, mortification, and mission.
 - Integrates doctrinal loci under the controlling theme of union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Spirit-wrought participation in Christ, the fountainhead of every saving benefit.
 - Distinct from but grounds justification and sanctification; both are received in union, not apart from it.
- **Impeccability of Christ:** Non posse peccare; safeguards the efficacy of his obedience while preserving true temptation.
- **Active/Passive Obedience:** Christ fulfills the law for us and bears the penalty for us; one obedience viewed in two aspects.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; condemnation in Adam, righteousness in Christ.
- **Total Depravity and Inability:** Sin's reach is exhaustive, leaving the will unable to choose God apart from grace.
- **Guilt, Pollution, and Death:** Threefold effect of sin addressed by justification, sanctification, and resurrection life.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration of righteousness in Christ, received by faith alone.
- **Sanctification:** Spirit-enabled conformity to Christ flowing from union; inseparable from justification but not its ground.
- **Adoption:** Filial status and privileges secured in the Son, foundational for assurance and prayer.
- **Assurance and Perseverance:** Confidence rooted in Christ's promise and priesthood; God preserves, we persevere.
- **States of Christ:** Humiliation to exaltation; interpret temptations, cross, resurrection, ascension, and session.
- **Offices of Christ:** Prophet, Priest, King; unify revelation, redemption, and rule.
- **Penal Substitution:** Christ bears our penalty, satisfying divine justice and reconciling us to God.
- **Eschatological Hope:** Final judgment, resurrection, and new creation orient present holiness and mission.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - Definition source for impeccability, union with Christ, and the Adam-Christ schema.
 - Polemical resource defending penal substitution and grace-driven sanctification.
 - Exegetical-pastoral model for applying Christ's states and offices to Christian life.
 - Conceptual pivot linking hamartiology, Christology, and eschatology in a unified gospel frame.
