### TITLE
De Unione Verbi Incarnati - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-13th century Scholastic theology; Thomas Aquinas (Dominican), working within Aristotelian metaphysics and patristic tradition to explicate Chalcedonian Christology for medieval disputation and pedagogy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** how the divine Person of the Word (Verbum) is united to a true human nature without confusion, division, change, or separation - i.e., a rational, philosophically coherent account of the **Hypostatic Union** that preserves both Chalcedonian formula and divine impassibility.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarify terms: person (hypostasis) vs nature (essence), act of assuming, and modes of union.
 - Establish that the Word assumed a human nature (not a human person), so the union is personal: one subject (the Word) subsists in two natures.
 - Show metaphysically how a nature can be assumed without conversion: the human nature remains complete (body and rational soul) while its subsistence is by participation in the Word's hypostasis.
 - Treat the consequences: communication of idioms (communicatio idiomatum), operations and properties attributed to the one Person, and the compatibility with divine impassibility and simplicity.
 - Answer objections from Nestorianism (two persons) and Eutychianism/Monophysitism (fusion of natures).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture and patristic authorities (Cyril of Alexandria, Leo I, Augustine), the Council of Chalcedon, Aristotelian natural philosophy, medieval theological rivals and common heresies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (central), with implications for Trinity (relation of the Word), soteriology (redemptive efficacy tied to union), metaphysics of personhood and nature, theology of operations and properties.
- **Closing line:** Thomas aims to show that the Word's assumption of human nature produces a **real, personal union** that preserves ontological distinctions while grounding the attribution of both divine and human predicates to the single Person of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous separation of **person/hypostasis** from **nature/essence** using Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics; the Word is the subsisting subject that personalizes the assumed nature.
 - Stress on the mode of subsistence: human nature does not subsist by itself after assumption but exists concretely in the Word.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects Nestorian separation of persons by showing assumption, not conjunction of two subsisting subjects.
 - Opposes Eutychian fusion by insisting on the integrity and properties of both natures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of Thomistic notions (actus essendi, form/matter composite, relation as a basis for personal subsistence) applied to Christological problems.
 - Clarifies communicatio idiomatum as grounded in personal attribution rather than ontological commixture.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central to later medieval scholastic Christology and to the Roman Catholic doctrinal tradition; served as a primary Thomistic model for teaching the hypostatic union.
 - Reformed theologians often accept the Chalcedonian and Thomistic conclusions in substance but differ on nuances of communicatio idiomatum and metaphysical categories.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a philosophically disciplined bridge between patristic formulas and systematic metaphysics; remains a key resource for advanced studies in classical Christology and for clarifying how divine simplicity and incarnation coexist.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** the personal union of the divine Word and human nature in one hypostasis; Thomas's central term for the doctrine.
- **Hypostasis / Person:** the concrete subsisting subject; the Word is the single hypostasis that assumes the human nature.
- **Nature / Essence:** what is assumed; retains its properties after assumption though it does not subsist independently.
- **Assumption (assumptio):** the act by which the Word takes to himself a human nature - not by mixture but by personal appropriation.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** attribution of properties of either nature to the one Person; grounded in personal union, not nature-confusion.
 - Distinguish: communicatio idiomatum (Thomistic personal attribution) vs ontological mixture (rejected).
- **Impassibility / Passion:** divine impassibility preserved; the Word suffers in his assumed human nature without change in the divine nature.
- **Subsistence (substantia, subsisto):** the mode of concrete existence; key to explaining how the human nature exists in the Word.
- **Actus essendi (act of being):** metaphysical principle used to account for the concrete reality of the assumed nature in union.
- **Form & Matter (hylomorphism):** used to show human nature's integrity (soul as form of body) within the union.
- **Operation / Personhood of Operations:** distinction between operations proper to a nature and those ascribed to the Person; unifies Christ's works as those of the Person.
- **Chalcedonian formula:** authoritative patristic standard that Thomas explicates and defends philosophically.
- **Appropriation (appropriatio):** manner of ascribing acts to one nature or the Person, often used in preaching and soteriological explanation.
- **Verbum (Word):** the divine Person who assumes human nature; the principle of personal unity.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **doctrinal source**: authoritative Thomistic exposition supporting Chalcedonian definitions in dogmatic theology.
 - As a **polemical tool**: refutation of Nestorian and Monophysite errors by precise metaphysical distinctions.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model**: guides interpretation of Christ's biblical predicates and grounds soteriological and sacramental claims.
