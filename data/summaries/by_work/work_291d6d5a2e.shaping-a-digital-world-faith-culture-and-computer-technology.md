### TITLE
Shaping a Digital World: Faith, Culture, and Computer Technology - Derek C. Schuurman (Baker Academic, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century moment of rapid diffusion of computing, mobile internet, algorithms, and cyber-infrastructure.
 - Written by an engineer-theologian situated in Reformed evangelical intellectual culture; aims to bring technical literacy into Christian theological reflection.
 - Addresses a gap between pastoral/ethical commentary and technical understanding of computing systems.

- **Central thesis**
 - Computing is not a neutral toolkit but a world-shaping force; Christians must theologically and practically shape digital technologies so they serve human flourishing under God, grounded in creation, fall, redemption, and consummation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: computing technologies mediate human action, identity, institutions, and moral perception; they embed values and exert formative power.
 - Theological resources: a Reformed schema (creation/imago Dei, fall, common grace, vocation, redemption, eschatology) offers interpretive and normative lenses for technology.
 - Ethical framework: move beyond simple instrumentalism to a stewardship and vocation model that treats design and engineering as moral practices.
 - Practical proposals: policy, professional ethics, education of engineers, design practices that account for affordances, privacy, accountability, and public goods.
 - Call to action: Christians in technology must craft alternative practices and institutions rather than merely critique.

- **Figures and interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogue with philosophy of technology and STS thinkers (e.g., themes from Heideggerian and postphenomenological accounts of mediation; social-constructivist insights about social shaping of technology).
 - Uses Reformed theological traditions (Kuyperian emphases on common grace and vocation) and contemporary Christian ethicists; draws on engineering practice and case studies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation / Imago Dei:** technology as stewardly cultivation of creation and a context for human flourishing.
 - **Sin / Fall:** technology both expresses and exacerbates sin (distortion/lust for control), and requires critical judgment.
 - **Redemption / Renewal:** possibility of redeemed practices, institutions, and artifacts oriented to shalom.
 - **Vocation & Common Grace:** engineers and technologists as called actors under God's providence; secular benefits as common grace.
 - **Eschatology:** ultimate telos shapes ethical horizon; technology is provisional and accountable to divine consummation.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Computing must be understood and disciplined within a Christian account of creation and calling: technologies are powerful cultural mediators to be shaped for neighborly flourishing under God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Authoritative integration of technical detail with robust Reformed theological categories; treats software, algorithms, and architectures as theological subjects.
 - Strong vocational thrust: engineering as Christian calling, not merely a site for applied ethics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves beyond naive instrumentalism (technology as neutral means) and also beyond technological determinism by emphasizing human agency and design responsibility.
 - Offers a corrective to purely secular STS accounts by supplying theological telos and moral resources for evaluating technologies.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes language of "shaping" the digital world - focusing on intentional design, institutional structures, and practices rather than only outcomes.
 - Emphasizes **mediation** and **affordance** in a Christian ethical register: artifacts as mediators of moral perception and action.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in Reformed and evangelical academic circles; adopted in seminary courses on theology and technology and in engineering-ethics curricula.
 - Praised for technical credibility and practical orientation; critiques note limited engagement with broader critical social theory and non-Western theological perspectives.

- **Enduring value**
 - Bridges the technical-theological divide, equipping pastors, ethicists, and engineers to converse; provides a durable framework for ongoing ethical engagement with emergent computing technologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Shaping** - intentional design, institutional, and cultural work to form technological outcomes and social practices.
- **Mediation** - the idea that technologies mediate human perception, action, and moral imagination; artifacts participate in moral formation.
- **Affordance** - the possibilities for action that artifacts enable or constrain; crucial for ethical design evaluation.
- **Instrumentalism (critique of)** - the notion that tech is value-neutral; Schuurman rejects this as inadequate.
- **Constitutive view** - technologies help constitute identities and social orders; contrasted with pure instrumentality.
- **Imago Dei & vocation** - human dignity and calling provide normative anchors for technology's purpose.
- **Common grace** - explains beneficial secular goods from technology without collapsing into theological complacency.
- **Embedded values** - normative content built into software/architecture; designers bear moral responsibility.
- **Design ethics** - practical commitments, processes, and professional responsibilities in engineering practice.
- **Public theology of technology** - proposals for policy, governance, and civic formation informed by Christian doctrine.
- **Redemptive stewardship** - stewardship that recognizes sin's distortion but aims at renewal of practices and artifacts.
- **Sociotechnical systems** - integrated view of social institutions and technical artifacts; used as unit of ethical concern.
- **Accountability & transparency** - applied to algorithms, data practices, and architectures as moral requirements.
- **Flourishing / shalom** - telos for evaluating technologies within eschatological hope.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for theological accounts of technology (clear categories: mediation, affordance, embedded values).
 - As a **pedagogical model** in seminary and engineering ethics courses linking doctrine to design practice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for conservative Protestant public theology debates on regulation, privacy, and the vocational role of technologists.
