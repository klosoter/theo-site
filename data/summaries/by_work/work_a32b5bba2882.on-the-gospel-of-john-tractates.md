### TITLE
On the Gospel of John (Tractates) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 4th / early 5th century North Africa (Hippo); part of Augustine's mature pastoral-exegetical corpus. Composed in a patristic milieu shaped by controversies with Manichaeans, Donatists, and Pelagians; addressed an episcopal congregation and clergy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - John's Gospel reveals the Word-made-flesh as the true source of life, and must be read as coherent theology: incarnational Christology, union with Christ, sacramental mediation of grace, and a spiritualized eschatology.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Verse-by-verse homiletic tractates moving from the Prologue (John 1) through key Johannine motifs.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the Logos doctrine: preexistence, divinity, and incarnation of Christ.
 - Explicate Johannine dualities (light/dark, flesh/spirit, belief/unbelief) as soteriological categories.
 - Read Johannine signs and "I am" sayings as pointers to ecclesial and sacramental realities (e.g., Eucharistic feeding in John 6; footwashing and love command).
 - Interpret eschatological passages (incl. Revelation 20 resonances) spiritually: present reign of Christ in the church rather than a future earthly millennium.
 - Apply doctrine to pastoral controversies: grace and predestination vs. Pelagianism; sacramental efficacy vs. Donatist rigorism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Scripture first, with extended use of patristic tradition (Origenic and Alexandrian exegetical habits), and polemic against Pelagian and literalist millenarian readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Incarnation, Trinity, Christology (Logos, two natures), Sacraments (Eucharist as spiritual participation), Soteriology (regeneration, adoption, predestination), Ecclesiology, Eschatology (amillennial framing), typology/allegory.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine reads John to bind Word, Spirit, sacrament, and church into a coherent, incarnational theology of salvation in which Christ already reigns spiritually and mediates life to believers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Persistent insistence on the union of Word and flesh: the sent Word both reveals and effects new birth; signs (sacraments) are real instruments of grace, not mere symbols.
 - Johannine theology used systematically to rebut Pelagianism: faith, divine initiative, and interior regeneration are central.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond purely allegorical readings by anchoring allegory in Christological incarnation and sacramental reality.
 - Opposes literalist, futurist millenarianism by reinterpreting Revelation 20 as the present reign of Christ and the church's witness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight linking of Johannine motifs (Logos, Light, Life, Truth) into a pastoral doctrine of participation and adoption; nuanced use of "flesh" to denote both humanity of Christ and the unregenerate human condition.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply formative in Western theology: shaped medieval and Reformation sacramental theology, contributed to development of Augustinian amillennialism, and informs later covenantal readings of John.
 - Used by Reformed theologians for doctrines of prevenient grace, justification by faith, and spiritual presence of Christ in sacraments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models close theological reading that integrates exegesis, pastoral concern, and doctrinal formulation; indispensable for studies in Johannine Christology, patristic sacramental thought, and historical eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Logos (Word)**
 - Preexistent divine agent who becomes flesh; doctrinal center for incarnation and revelation.
- **Incarnation / Word-made-flesh**
 - Foundation for sacraments, union with believers, and the reality of redemption.
- **Light and Darkness**
 - Moral-ontological duality: revelation and knowledge given to the elect versus blindness of unbelief.
- **Flesh (caro) / Spirit**
 - Contrasts human corruption/unregeneracy with life in the Spirit; also used of Christ's humanity united to the Word.
- **Belief / Faith (fides)**
 - Active trusting that effects participation in Christ and new birth; not merited by human effort alone.
- **Regeneration / Adoption**
 - New birth through the Word and Spirit leading to filial status; used to counter Pelagian self-sufficiency.
- **Eucharist / Presence of Christ**
 - Sacramental feeding seen as real, spiritual participation in Christ's body and blood; denies mere symbolicism and corporeal localism.
- **Kingdom / Reign of Christ**
 - Emphasized as present, spiritual, and ecclesial rather than an earthly political kingdom.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness**
 - Interpreted as both present spiritual opposition and a future intensification; read against literal apocalyptic expectations.
- **Millennium / Thousand Years (Revelation 20)**
 - Spiritualized as the church age; Augustine's treatment foundational for amillennialism.
- **Typology / Allegory**
 - Allegorical method anchored to Christic fulfillment; typology used to read OT persons/events as Christological foreshadowings.
- **Predestination / Grace**
 - God's sovereign initiation of salvation; key polemic point versus Pelagianism.
- **Witness / Testimony**
 - Johannine emphasis on verbal and sacramental witness to the incarnate Word; ecclesial function.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological concept: participation, sanctification, and justification flow from union effected by Word and Spirit.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As an exegetical model for Johannine theology and sermon practice (verse-by-verse, theological synthesis).
 - As a polemic resource: theological ammunition against Pelagianism, Donatism, and literal millenarianism.
 - As a conceptual pivot for sacraments, Pauline-Augustinian doctrines of grace, and amillennial eschatology.
