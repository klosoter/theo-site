### TITLE
Salvation Applied by the Spirit: Union with Christ - Robert A. Peterson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical academic milieu; Peterson writes from Covenant Theological Seminary and the conservative Reformed tradition.
 - Part of a broader renewal of interest in Pauline union theology and its implications for systematic soteriology and pneumatology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is the primary agent by whom the benefits of Christ's redemptive work are applied to believers; this application occurs through a real, saving **union with Christ** that grounds justification, adoption, sanctification, and assurance.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Pauline and other New Testament passages that speak of union (e.g., Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, John) to locate the Spirit's role.
 - Theological synthesis: argues that union with Christ is simultaneously relational, positional, and participatory - not merely forensic or metaphorical.
 - Systematic implications: shows how justification, sanctification, adoption, and assurance are intelligible and coherent when explained as effects of Spirit‑wrought union.
 - Pastoral/ministrial application: emphasizes the Spirit's work in assurance, perseverance, and everyday sanctification via union rather than detached moralism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Pauline corpus as primary scriptural base; engages classical Reformed theologians (Calvin and Reformed orthodoxy) for historical continuity.
 - Dialogues with contemporary pneumatological and soteriological writers who treat application as separate from union or who minimize the Spirit's role in application.
 - Interacts implicitly with theological currents that bifurcate objective redemption and subjective appropriation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (central focus)
 - Union with Christ (primary structuring category)
 - Soteriology: justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification, assurance
 - Christology (as the ground of union)
 - Covenant theology and sacramental considerations insofar as they relate to the Spirit's mediating role

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - The Spirit does not merely witness to Christ's benefits; by creating and sustaining union with Christ he is the real instrument through which the objective work of the Redeemer becomes the believer's lived possession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Places union with Christ squarely at the center of application; the Spirit is not an auxiliary presence but the personal agent effecting participation in Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
 - Stresses a balanced Reformed nuance: union is real and transformative without collapsing into mystical pantheism or a merely forensic legal fiction.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects reductionistic soteriologies that treat justification as self‑sufficient and neglect how sanctification and assurance are grounded in the same Spirit‑wrought union.
 - Pushes back against pneumatologies that divorce the Spirit's saving work from objective Christology or that over‑spiritualize union into vague spirituality devoid of forensic realities.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies vocabulary around "participation," "positional" vs "experiential" aspects of union, and the Spirit as the "bond" or "agent" of that union - emphasizing personal agency rather than abstract force.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well regarded in Reformed seminaries and among scholars stressing Pauline union; frequently cited in soteriology and pneumatology treatments as a concise defense of union‑centered application.
 - Influential in curricula that aim to reintegrate pneumatology with classical doctrines of salvation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically useful for courses on soteriology and pneumatology; durable resource for pastors wanting a biblically grounded, pastorally sensitive account of how the Spirit applies salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - Central category: ontological/relational participation in Christ effected by the Spirit.
- **Application of redemption** - The work by which Christ's objective achievements become believers' actual possession through the Spirit.
- **Pneumatic union** - The Spirit's specific action in producing and sustaining union; underscores agency.
- **Positional vs. experiential union** - Distinction between legal/forensic standing in Christ and the progressive, lived experience of participation; both grounded in the Spirit.
- **Participation (koinonia)** - Fellowship/participation language used to explain how believers share in Christ's benefits.
- **Imputation and participation** - Imputation (forensic) and participation (relational/ontological) are complementary, both mediated by the Spirit.
- **Indwelling** - The Spirit's presence in believers as the proximate means of union and sanctification.
- **Seal and guarantee** - The Spirit as the pledge/earnest of future inheritance; connects assurance to objective promise.
- **Firstfruits/earnest** - Pneumatological metaphors used to show forward‑looking aspect of applied salvation.
- **Assurance** - Treated as a fruit of union; the Spirit's testimony and the believer's relation to Christ ground confidence.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive conformity to Christ that flows from Spirit‑wrought union, not merely moral effort.
- **Adoption** - Social/relational status conferred through union by the Spirit.
- **Justification** - Forensic declaration tied to union's positional reality; applied by the Spirit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for union‑with‑Christ in syllabi and lexicons.
 - As a **polemic** against accounts that separate application from union or underplay pneumatology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts that link the Spirit, union, and salvation benefits.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments seeking to integrate Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology.
