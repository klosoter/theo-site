### TITLE
**"Divine Attributes" - Vern Poythress (chapter in John Frame, Reformed Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical systematic theology, situated within John Frame's multivolume project; combines classical theistic commitments with analytic clarity and Reformed confessional commitments.
 - Responds to late 20th-21st century challenges to classical attributes (open theism, process theology, popular pietistic personalization).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Affirm classical predicates of God (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) while showing how they cohere with Scripture's personal, relational, and redemptive portrayal of God.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Define incommunicable attributes and locate them in the divine essence. 
 - Argue for **divine simplicity**: attributes are not parts but identical to the divine essence; avoid composition language that compromises transcendence.
 - Defend **aseity**: God is uncreated, self-existent, ontologically independent; creation depends on God.
 - Defend **immutability** with nuance: God's being and essential character do not change, while his relations and actions in time manifest different economic appropriations of the same immutable being.
 - Defend **impassibility** in the classical sense: God is not subject to finitude or suffering as a creature is; yet God genuinely relates and experiences covenantal emotions in a way consistent with his immutability and sovereignty.
 - Tie attribute-talk to Trinity, revelation, and covenantal action - attributes are manifested in the economic Trinity without compromising ontological simplicity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Classical sources (Augustine, medieval scholastics), Reformed tradition (Calvin, Reformed scholasticism), and modern interlocutors (analytic philosophers of religion, proponents of open/process theism).
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Doctrine of God (theology proper), Trinity (ontological vs economic distinctions), revelation (how attributes are known), providence (grounded in immutability and aseity), and implications for Christology and covenant practice.
- **Closing line capturing the work's center of gravity:** 
 - Poythress seeks to preserve classical theism's rigorous metaphysical claims about God's essence while reading biblical language of emotion and action through a Reformed, Trinitarian, and analogical framework that secures both transcendence and personal relationality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Combines rigorous philosophical theology (careful on simplicity and identity of attributes) with robust biblical exegesis of covenantal, emotional, and triune language.
 - Emphasizes that classical predicates must be interpreted trinitarianly and economically - attributes are not abstract properties apart from God's triune life and redemptive acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against both extremes: denies the anthropomorphic personalization that erodes transcendence and rejects process/open theist reductions that compromise divine sovereignty and aseity.
 - Refines classical impassibility to allow genuine divine emotions without introducing passivity or change in divine essence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Stress on harmonizing **simplicity** with **relational economic manifestations** (a clarification rather than invention): the same immutable divine essence can be spoken of diversely in action without implying composition.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, biblically anchored defense of classical attributes; influential among those seeking a philosophically informed Reformed theism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating metaphysics and exegesis; useful for courses on theology proper, for polemics versus open/process positions, and for pastoral theology that must negotiate biblical emotional language about God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God has no metaphysical parts; attributes are identical with God's essence - avoids composition that would make God contingent.
 - Relation: informs how attributes cohere and prevents attributing contradictions to God.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence; God's being is not caused or dependent on anything.
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo essential change; intra-Trinitarian relation and economic actions are not changes in essence.
 - Clarification: distinguishes between ontological immutability and relational/occasional manifestations.
- **Impassibility:** God does not suffer or undergo creaturely passivity; yet he genuinely bears covenantal emotions analogically.
- **Communicable vs Incommunicable Attributes:** Framework for whether qualities can be reflected in creatures (love, wisdom vs aseity, simplicity).
- **Attributes-Essence Identity:** The claim that attributes are not separable qualities but identical to the divine essence.
- **Economic vs Ontological Trinity:** Use to explain how attributes appear in redemptive history without implying ontological division or change.
- **Anthropopathism/Analogy:** Method for interpreting Scripture's emotional language about God - genuine but analogical, not raw anthropomorphism.
- **Relational Action:** How immutable attributes are manifested in temporal, relational acts (providence, promise-keeping).
- **Sovereignty/Providence:** Practical loci linked to aseity and immutability - grounds for God's faithfulness and control.
- **Personalism vs Classical Theism:** Contrast showing Poythress's commitment to personal God within a classical metaphysical framework.
- **Polemic Targets:** Open theism, process theology, naive anthropomorphism.
- **Exegetical Model:** Uses Scripture to ground and shape the metaphysical claims rather than treating philosophy as primary.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for doctrine of God (concise presentation of classical attributes in a Reformed frame).
- As a **polemic** tool against open/process theist accounts and against reductionist personalization of God.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical emotion-language about God analogically and trinitarianly.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking attributes to Trinity, revelation, and practical theology (providence, covenant).
