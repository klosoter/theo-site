### TITLE
**The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended** - Jonathan Edwards

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-18th century New England within the Reformed Puritan and Great Awakening milieu. Edwards wrote as an intellectual defender of traditional Calvinist orthodoxy against Enlightenment-leaning and Arminian critics.
 - The work functions as apologetic theology: restoring confidence in doctrines of human depravity and federal representation amid pastoral and philosophical challenge.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Edwards defends that Adam's first sin is the seminal cause of human guilt and corruption: original sin is both imputed guilt and transmitted depravity; this explains universal human sinfulness and culpability.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis: key use of Romans 5 (representative headship), Genesis (Adam as covenant head), and Psalms/Prophets for universal corruption.
 - Philosophical/anthropological move: analysis of will, affections, and moral agency to show how corruption can be both voluntary and transmitted without denying responsibility.
 - Distinguishes types of transmission:
 - Immediate imputation of Adam's guilt (legal/forensic aspect).
 - Natural propagation of a corrupted nature or propensity to sin (ontological/psychological aspect).
 - Rebuttals to objections: answers to charges that imputation is unjust, that depravity could not be inherited, and to softening accounts that reduce original sin to mere bad example or social conditioning.
 - Pastoral/polemical conclusion: original sin is necessary to account for universal need of Christ and the Gospel.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture and patristic/Reformed tradition (Augustine, Calvin alluded to).
 - Contemporary opponents: Enlightenment skeptics and Arminian or "new-light" ministers who minimized hereditary guilt or voluntariness of sin.
 - Philosophical interlocution with notions of liberty, necessity, and moral responsibility.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (nature of sin), soteriology (necessity of Christ), covenant theology (Adam as federal head), divine justice and imputation, will and freedom (compatibilist account), and indirectly, revelation and Christology as the remedy.

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on the conviction that without imputed guilt and inherited corruption rooted in Adam, Scripture's account of human sin, culpability, and the Gospel's necessity collapses.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Edwards combines tight exegetical proof-texting with rigorous philosophical analysis of voluntariness and moral psychology - sin as volitional bent or disordered affections rather than mere external corruption.
 - Strong compatibilist account of freedom: moral necessity (acting from strongest motives) coexists with genuine responsibility.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes beyond a merely forensic (legal) account by insisting on real ontological transmission of a sinful nature; yet he avoids reducing imputation to mere metaphor or social imitation.
 - Counters Arminian minimizations and Enlightenment moral-sentiment critiques that treat original sin as implausible or unjust.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clearer treatment of the distinction between **imputed guilt** and **propagated corruption**, with analytic attention to how a holy God can justly impute guilt while permitting natural descent of a sinful nature.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in New England Calvinism; used as a scholarly defense of traditional Reformed anthropology.
 - Shaped later Reformed discussions on imputation, moral psychology, and the nature of human freedom.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models an integrated exegetical-philosophical defense of doctrine; remains a prime example for teaching original sin, federal headship, and compatibilist responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin** - the condition of guilt and corruption derived from Adam's first transgression.
- **Imputation** - the forensic counting of Adam's sin to his descendants; Edwards insists on real imputation of guilt (see Original Sin And Imputation).
- **Hereditary corruption (propagation)** - the transmission of a depraved nature or propensity to sin (see Nature And Origin Of Sin).
- **Federal headship** - Adam as representative whose act legally binds his posterity.
- **Total depravity** - comprehensive effect of original sin on all faculties (not absolute inability to act morally but radical bent toward sin).
- **Voluntariness of sin** - sin is voluntary, arising from affections and will even when shaped by a corrupt nature.
- **Compatibilist freedom (moral necessity)** - freedom defined as acting from strongest motives; compatible with determinism and moral responsibility.
- **Guilt vs. corruption** - analytic distinction: guilt is imputed, corruption is transmitted; both are necessary for Edwards's account.
- **Natural inability** - inability to will spiritual good apart from divine grace; differs from excuse.
- **Representative culpability** - legal responsibility derived from another's act (Adam).
- **Affections/heart** - Edwards's locus for moral disposition; sin is primarily a disorder of love and inclination.
- **Scriptural loci** - Romans 5, Genesis 3, Psalms used as exegetical anchors.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source and classical exposition for **Original Sin and Imputation** (polemical and classroom use).
 - As an exegetical model for Romans 5 and for treating the **Nature and Origin of Sin** (theological anthropology and moral psychology).
