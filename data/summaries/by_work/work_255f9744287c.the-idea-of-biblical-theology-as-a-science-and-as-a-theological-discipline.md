### TITLE
**The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline** 
Author: **Geerhardus Vos** 
Form/genre: Lecture/essay articulating method and status of biblical theology within Reformed scholarship and the academy. 
Known for: Foundational statement for a redemptive-historical approach to Scripture; frequent citation across bibliology, theology proper, Trinity, anthropology, pneumatology, and eschatology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Reformed Princeton milieu; reaction to German higher criticism, Romantic subjectivism (e.g., Schleiermacher), and Hegelian historicism.
 - Vos seeks a disciplined method that preserves supernatural revelation yet employs rigorous historical inquiry.

- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical theology is both a science (an objective, historical discipline) and a theological discipline (churchly, pedagogical function). It must be historically rigorous without collapsing into either mere description or dogmatic subsumption.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define biblical theology as the historical investigation of the **history of redemption (Heilsgeschichte)**: doctrine as it comes to expression within the unfolding revelation of Scripture.
 - Distinguish biblical theology from systematic theology:
 - Biblical theology: diachronic, empirical, descriptive - traces development of revelation across time and stages.
 - Systematic theology: synchronic, synthetic, normative - analyzes and formulates doctrine in propositional, contemporary statements.
 - Argue for the **organic, progressive unity of Scripture**, culminating in the person and work of Christ; doctrines must be seen in their redemptive-historical context.
 - Methodological prescriptions: faith in revelation as presupposition; historical-critical tools properly governed; emphasis on canonical form and finality of scriptural revelation.
 - Practical/pedagogical role: biblical theology informs preaching, catechesis, and theological reflection by showing how God acted and revealed through stages toward consummation.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Implicit contrasts with Schleiermacher (subjective feeling), Hegel (abstract historicism), and radical higher critics (reductionist literary reconstruction). Builds on Reformed confessional heritage and historical-critical methods selectively.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and bibliology (primacy: Scripture's historical development).
 - Covenant theology (central structural motif for redemptive history).
 - Christology and the Trinity (as climactic content of revelation).
 - Anthropology, pneumatology, eschatology appear as loci whose meaning is clarified by redemptive-historical unfolding.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Biblical theology must be a disciplined, historical science of redemption that preserves the organic, Christ-centered unity of Scripture while serving the church's doctrinal life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that biblical theology is essentially a **history of redemption** - not mere history of ideas nor a catalog of doctrines outside their narrative context.
 - The **organic-development** model: doctrines develop historically but are organically bound to one revelation culminating in Christ.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Romantic/private-experience readings by insisting on objective historical content.
 - Counters Hegelian and reductionist critics by refusing to reduce revelation to mere cultural/philosophical evolution; still employs critical-historical method under confessional commitments.
 - Distinguishes clearly from systematic theology's aims and methods to avoid conflation.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recast biblical theology as a science with methodological rules: descriptive-historical rather than polemical-dogmatic.
 - Elevates redemptive-historical (Heilsgeschichte) approach as methodological center.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Core formative text for 20th-century Reformed biblical theology; influenced Princeton tradition and later evangelical redemptive-historical movements.
 - Frequently cited by scholars (e.g., Gaffin, Murray, Kaiser, Goldsworthy) and used as a corrective to both liberal critical and pietistic readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a sustainable method that integrates historical rigor with doctrinal faithfulness; invaluable for seminary pedagogy and for bridging exegesis and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - The historical-scientific study of the progressive revelation of God in Scripture; descriptive and diachronic.
- **Systematic theology**
 - A synthetic, normative discipline that organizes biblical truth for confession and application; synchronic.
- **History of redemption (Heilsgeschichte)**
 - Central organizing principle: revelation unfolds historically toward Christ and eschatological consummation.
- **Progressive revelation**
 - The idea that divine truth is disclosed gradually and culminates in Christ; must be traced historically.
- **Organic development**
 - Doctrinal growth is real but rooted in a single, unified revelation; not merely evolution of ideas.
- **Final canonical form**
 - The Bible's normative, completed form governs interpretation; historical inquiry respects canonical closure.
- **Science (in Vos's sense)**
 - Methodical, objective discipline with rules - applicable to biblical theology as an empirical-historical enterprise.
- **Theological discipline**
 - The churchly, pedagogical function of biblical theology in teaching and preaching.
- **Covenant**
 - Structural key for interpreting redemptive history across loci.
- **Christocentric culmination**
 - Doctrinal meanings discover true shape only in relation to Christ's person and work.
- **Normativity vs. description**
 - Distinguishes the descriptive aims of biblical theology from the normative formulations of dogmatics.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for biblical theology method; authoritative for how to frame doctrinal questions historically.
 - As a **polemic** against both subjective-Romantic and reductionist-critical approaches.
 - As an **exegetical model**: guides exegesis toward redemptive-historical readings that feed systematic construction.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** between bibliology (Scripture's status and unity) and systematic dogmatics (organized confession).
