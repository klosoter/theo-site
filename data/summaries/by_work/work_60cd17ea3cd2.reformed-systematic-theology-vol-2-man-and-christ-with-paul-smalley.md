### TITLE
**Reformed Systematic Theology, Vol. 2: Man and Christ** - Joel R. Beeke (with Paul Smalley)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary late-20th/early-21st-century Reformed revival: pastoral, confessional, and Puritan-influenced renewal within conservative Reformed churches.
 - Aimed at pastors, seminarians, and informed laity who desire an integrated systematics that is both doctrinal and devotional.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a thoroughly Reformed anthropology and Christology that preserves confessional orthodoxy while insisting on experiential union with Christ and practical piety.
 - Addresses how sin, the image of God, Christ's person and work, and the believer's new status cohere within a covenantal framework.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Systematic exposition proceeds from human origin and fall to Christ as center and solution:
 - Anthropology: image of God, nature of sin, total depravity qualified by common grace.
 - Soteriology centered on the person and work of Christ: incarnation, active/passive obedience, union, and application.
 - Application: faith and repentance, justification, sanctification, adoption, and consummation.
 - Emphasizes the nexus of doctrine and devotion - doctrine leads to worship and holy living.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy debt to the Reformed confessions and Puritan writers (e.g., John Owen, Richard Baxter, William Perkins).
 - Engages classical scholastic categories (imputation, federal headship) and dialogues with modern critics (Arminian and pietistic distortions, secular anthropology).
 - Contemporary interlocutors include late-20th-century Reformed apologists and pastoral theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as basis), covenant theology, anthropology (image of God, sin), Christology (two natures, offices), union with Christ, ordo salutis, justification, sanctification, adoption, eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - A confessional, pastoral Reformed synthesis that makes Christ the interpretive center of anthropology and the practical life of faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong integration of Puritan experientialism with systematic categories: doctrinal precision married to pastoral application.
 - Emphasizes **union with Christ** as the organizing principle for understanding believerly status (justification, sanctification, adoption).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters both rationalistic/ethical reductions of sin (minimizing depravity) and pietistic/experiential reductions of doctrine (reducing doctrine to mere feeling).
 - Opposes common evangelical decisionism by insisting on repentance and faith as gifts wrought by the Spirit within covenantal promises.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines classical terms with pastoral nuance (e.g., distinguishing forensic imputation from mystical union without separating their salvific efficacy).
 - Recovers older Puritan categories within a modern systematic frame, making them accessible for pastoral theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in confessional Reformed seminaries and churches; valued for clarity, pastoral warmth, and fidelity to older Reformed sources.
 - Influential in renewing interest in Puritan resources and in shaping pastor-theologian training.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable bridge between historical Reformed orthodoxy and contemporary pastoral exigencies; excellent for preaching, catechesis, and pastoral counseling.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - relational and functional emphasis: human vocation, responsibility, and distortion by sin; not merely rational capacity.
- **Total depravity** - universal corruption of faculties; qualified by common grace but not fatalism.
- **Covenant theology** - covenantal structures (works/ grace, administrations) govern biblical narrative and soteriology.
- **Union with Christ** - central theological category tying justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification together.
- **Imputation (sin and righteousness)** - forensic transfer: Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness imputed to believers; distinguished from impartation.
- **Faith** - a divinely wrought trust and reliance on Christ; cognitive and fiducial; instrument of justification and evidence of union.
 - Used to rebut purely intellectual or merely transient notions of faith.
- **Repentance** - genuine sorrow for sin plus decisive turning; both gift and duty; inseparable from saving faith.
 - Contrasts mere remorse or moral reformism.
- **Adoption** - legal and relational status: positional (now) and experiential (grows in sanctification), inaugurated eschatology with future consummation.
- **Christology (two natures/unified person)** - orthodox Chalcedonian framing with emphasis on mediatorial offices (prophet, priest, king).
- **Ordo salutis** - treated pastorally: not mere logical sequence but organic reality in union with Christ.
- **Justification** - forensic declaration by imputation; assurance grounded in Christ's obedience rather than human response.
- **Sanctification** - progressive, mortification and vivification in union; instrumental means include Word, sacraments, Spirit.
- **Glorification/eschatology** - final consummation vindicating adoption and the image of God restored.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source** for Reformed treatments of faith and repentance - clarifies biblical categories for preaching and catechesis.
 - **Exegetical and pastoral model** for teaching adoption (Romans/Galatians context): combines forensic/legal analysis with relational, experiential application.
 - **Polemic resource** against Arminian, pietistic, or reductionist accounts of conversion and sanctification.
