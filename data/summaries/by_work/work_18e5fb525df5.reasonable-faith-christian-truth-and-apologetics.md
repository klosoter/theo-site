### TITLE
Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical analytic theology; textbook-style apologetics originally published in the 1990s with later expanded editions. Sits at the intersection of analytic philosophy of religion, contemporary cosmology, and conservative Protestant theology.
 - Responds to scientific naturalism, historical-critical challenges, and public atheism with arguments intended for both students and interested lay readers.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian theism is intellectually credible and can be defended rationally against philosophical naturalism and historical skepticism. Key doctrinal claims (God as Creator, Christ's resurrection) are argued to be the best explanations of empirical and philosophical data.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Metaphysical and cosmological arguments:
 - Revival and formulation of the **Kalam cosmological argument**: whatever begins to exist has a cause; the universe began to exist; therefore the universe has a cause - identified with a transcendent personal Creator.
 - Scientific apologetics:
 - Use of contemporary cosmology (Big Bang, origin of space-time) and fine-tuning considerations to argue for divine creation.
 - Historical apologetics:
 - Case for the **historic resurrection** of Jesus as the best explanation of early Christian data; employs historical criteria and probabilistic reasoning.
 - Epistemology and faith:
 - Defense of Christian truth-claims as rationally warranted; engagement with religious epistemology (e.g., sensus divinitatis, evidential standards).
 - Practical applications:
 - Moral and existential implications, critiques of naturalism, and pastoral apologetics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary philosophers and scientists (e.g., David Hume, Immanuel Kant in background; modern cosmologists), prominent skeptics and atheists, and fellow Christian apologists (briefly interacts with Plantinga, Swinburne-type probabilistic theism by contrast).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (ex nihilo, cosmology), providence, divine attributes (simplicity, timelessness/eternity debated), incarnation and resurrection, revelation (scripture and reason), and the problem of evil (treated elsewhere but implicit).

- **Closing line**
 - A systematic, philosophically rigorous defense that situates biblical theism as both historically credible and consonant with modern science, with the universe's beginning and Christ's resurrection as central pivots.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly analytic and evidentialist method: clear logical formulations, attention to scientific data, and probabilistic/historical reasoning rather than purely existential or fideistic apologetics.
 - Reinvigorated public use of the **Kalam cosmological argument** grounded in contemporary cosmology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond classical natural theology (Anselmian/ontological) to arguments tightly integrated with modern physics and historical methods.
 - More evidential and philosophically formal than classical fideists; less sectarian than some revivalist apologetics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of Bayesian-style probabilistic language in historical apologetics (resurrection case).
 - Framing fine-tuning as a probabilistic inference to design in cosmology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and conservative academic circles; standard textbook for apologetics courses.
 - Critiqued by some Reformed and analytic theologians for overreliance on philosophical argumentation and for presumed compatibility with a variety of Genesis interpretations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear organization of contemporary apologetic resources; durable model for integrating philosophy, historical method, and science in defense of Christian theism.
 - Especially valuable as a pedagogical bridge between philosophy of religion and pastoral apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kalam cosmological argument**
 - Craig's central philosophical argument for a finite-origin universe that requires a transcendent personal cause.

- **Fine-tuning**
 - Probabilistic claim that physical constants are set within narrow life-permitting ranges, argued as evidence for design.

- **Beginning of the universe**
 - Empirical anchor (Big Bang cosmology) used to support metaphysical claims about creation ex nihilo.

- **Resurrection (historical case)**
 - Treated as a historical hypothesis evaluated by explanatory scope, plausibility, and best-explanation criteria.

- **Probabilistic / Bayesian reasoning**
 - Employed in weighting historical evidence and assessing miracle claims.

- **Metaphysical naturalism**
 - Primary foil; Craig diagnoses its insufficiency to account for cosmology, morality, and consciousness.

- **Classical theism / divine attributes**
 - God as timeless/eternal, simple, personal - invoked as the best candidate for the cosmological cause.

- **Revelation and scriptural interpretation**
 - Scripture treated as theological-historical witness; Craig allows interpretive flexibility (e.g., non-literal readings of Genesis days where warranted by science and hermeneutics).

- **Days of Creation**
 - Discussed as a locus where exegetical options (24-hour literalism, day-age, literary-framework, analogical) intersect with scientific evidence; Craig emphasizes theological priority over a scientific-specific reading and argues compatibility of Christian theism with Big Bang cosmology.

- **Historical method**
 - Application of historiographical criteria to New Testament data (e.g., multiple attestation, criterion of embarrassment).

- **Explanatory minimalism**
 - Preference for the hypothesis that provides the best explanatory power with minimal ad hoc assumptions.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a definition source and standard syllabus text in evangelical apologetics courses (method + arguments).
- As a polemical resource against philosophical naturalism and historical skepticism (cosmology, resurrection).
- As a conceptual pivot in dialogues between science and faith regarding the origin of the universe and interpretive options for Genesis (including the Days of Creation).
