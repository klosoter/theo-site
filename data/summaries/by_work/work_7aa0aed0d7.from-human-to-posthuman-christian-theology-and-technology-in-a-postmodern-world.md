### TITLE
From Human to Posthuman: Christian Theology and Technology in a Postmodern World - Brent Waters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century engagement with rapid technological change, emergence of transhumanist discourse, and widespread interest in "posthuman" thought within humanities and philosophy.
 - Positioned at the intersection of systematic theology, ethics, and critical theory; responds to postmodern critiques of humanism and to debates about technological enhancement.

- **Central thesis**
 - Technology is not a neutral instrument but a formative force reshaping what it means to be human; Christian theology must reconceive theological anthropology and eschatology to address both the risks and possibilities of a technicized/posthuman future.
 - Theologically robust response requires neither naïve rejection nor uncritical embrace of technological transformation, but a retrieval and rearticulation of Christian resources (imago Dei, incarnation, finitude, redemption).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic phase: analyzes how postmodern theory and technological practice problematize classical humanist notions of personhood and agency.
 - Theoretical engagement: examines key philosophical and cultural accounts of the posthuman (Heideggerian enframing, Haraway's cyborg, N. Katherine Hayles' posthumanist critique, transhumanist projections).
 - Theological resources: revisits doctrines-creation, imago Dei, sin, incarnation, eschatology-to provide conceptual tools for naming and judging technological transformations.
 - Normative proposals: sketches theological criteria for assessing technologies (finitude, vulnerability, relationality, hope) and suggests pastoral and ecclesial practices for formation in a technological age.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophical/theoretical: Martin Heidegger (enframing), Donna Haraway (cyborg imagery), N. Katherine Hayles, and postmodern/posthuman thinkers.
 - Ethical/critical: Jacques Ellul and Hans Jonas (technology critique and responsibility).
 - Theological interlocutors: retrieval of classical sources (Augustine, Paul), engagement with contemporary theologians concerned with creation, eschatology, and social ethics (e.g., Jürgen Moltmann, Stanley Hauerwas).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theological anthropology** (imago Dei and its dissolution/reconfiguration under technological regimes).
 - **Christology and incarnation** (as corrective to disembodied visions of the future).
 - **Creation and providence** (technology as both stewardship and distortion).
 - **Sin and ethics** (hubris, domination, commodification).
 - **Eschatology** (vision of redemption that resists both escapist technophilia and nihilistic despair).

- **Closing line**
 - Waters insists that a Christian theology of technology must affirm human finitude and embodied relationality while articulating an eschatological hope that judges and reorients technological possibility toward true human flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the posthuman not merely as speculative fiction but as a present cultural and theological problem: technology reconstitutes subjectivity, embodiment, and community.
 - Balances critique with constructive theological imagination: neither Luddite rejection nor techno-utopian embrace.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Offers a corrective to technological determinism (Ellul) by insisting on theological agency and moral discernment without underestimating technology's formative power.
 - Pushes back against transhumanist optimism by recovering doctrines of finitude, vulnerability, and dependence rooted in incarnation and kenosis.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Frames "posthuman" as a theological category mediating anthropology and eschatology rather than solely a philosophical/technical label.
 - Introduces criteria (finitude, relationality, sacramental reading of materiality) for assessing technological projects.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Recognized in theology of technology and ethics as a key interdisciplinary resource; used in seminars on posthumanism, theological anthropology, and technology ethics.
 - Influential beyond strict confessional lines: cited in Reformed and wider Protestant contexts as a measured, constructive theological alternative to both secular posthumanism and technophobic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for theological engagement with ongoing technological change: diagnostic clarity, doctrinal resources, and normative criteria that remain applicable as technologies evolve.
 - Useful pedagogically for training ministers and ethicists to think theologically about embodiment, community, and future-making.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Posthuman**
 - A description of altered human subjectivity and embodiment under technological influence; treated theologically as a category needing judgment and reorientation.

- **Transhumanism**
 - Technological project aiming at human enhancement and transcendence of biological limits; Waters critiques its anthropological assumptions and teleology.

- **Imago Dei**
 - Central theological resource; reframed to resist purely functional or autonomy-based accounts of human worth under technological regimes.

- **Enframing (Gestell)**
 - Heideggerian concept used to analyze how technology frames the world and human beings as resources; Waters adopts and theologically qualifies its critique.

- **Embodiment / prosthesis**
 - Focus on bodies as sites of relation and vulnerability; prostheses and enhancements raise questions about identity, dependency, and sacramentality.

- **Finitude**
 - Theological affirmation of limits and mortal dependence as normative goods against technocratic mastery.

- **Kenosis / incarnation**
 - Christological motifs used to counter disembodied visions of progress and to model humility and relationality for technological praxis.

- **Technological agency**
 - Concept that technologies have formative causal and normative effects on persons and communities; requires theological assessment.

- **Eschatological judgment**
 - Eschatology used both diagnostically (to critique present idols) and constructively (to imagine redeemed technological uses).

- **Ethical responsibility (Jonasian)**
 - Emphasizes responsibility toward future persons and creation in technological deliberation.

- **Cyborg**
 - Borrowed from Haraway as heuristic; Waters treats it cautiously, pressing Christian norms of relationality and integrity.

- **Relationality**
 - Human persons as inherently interdependent; a central criterion for evaluating tech that isolates or commodifies persons.

- **Sacramentality / material theology**
 - Recuperates the material as bearer of grace and relation, resisting purely functional materialism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological anthropology courses to introduce posthuman questions and criteria.
- As a **polemic** against transhumanist reductionism and technological determinism in ethics seminars.
- As a **definition source** for "theology of technology" and its terms (enframing, prosthesis, technological agency).
- As a **pedagogical model** for integrating doctrinal resources (imago Dei, incarnation, eschatology) into technology assessment.
