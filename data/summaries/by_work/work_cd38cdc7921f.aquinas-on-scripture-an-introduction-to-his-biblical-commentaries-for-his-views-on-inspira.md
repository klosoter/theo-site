### TITLE
Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (focus: inspiration and prophecy)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 13th century Scholasticism; Dominican intellectual milieu; intensive engagement with Augustine, Jerome, and the newly recovered Aristotle via Arabic commentators (Averroes, Avicenna).
 - Major works across genres: biblical commentaries, Scriptum super librum Sententiarum, Summa Theologiae - commentary tradition shapes his explicit doctrine of inspiration/prophecy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How can Scripture be genuinely divine speech while remaining authentically human discourse? How does prophecy operate as a supernatural form of knowledge and sign?
- **Core argument or structure**
 - God is the **principal cause** of Scripture; human authors are **instrumental causes** who employ their faculties (language, style, historical situation).
 - Inspiration = divine concurrence that elevates and orders the human intellect and will so that the intended truth is expressed; this preserves human linguistic character while securing divine truth.
 - Prophecy = a supernatural infused cognition or vision whereby God communicates what is necessary (especially for salvation) and sometimes contingent future events; prophetic utterance is confirmed by signs and fits into the Church's interpretive norms.
 - Hermeneutical rule: the **literal (sensus literalis)** is the foundation; spiritual senses (allegorical, moral, anagogical) are subordinate and legitimate when drawn from literal sense and authorial intention.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine and Jerome (patristic exegesis), Aristotle (epistemology), Islamic and Jewish philosophers (on prophecy and illumination), medieval canon law and ecclesial authority.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, prophecy, authority of Scripture, inerrancy (qualified), senses of Scripture, concurrence and causality, signs/miracles as confirmatory.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas situates Scripture and prophecy within a metaphysical account of causation and epistemology: Scripture is God's speech through real human authors, and prophecy is a divinely infused knowledge whose authority is judged by authorial intent and ecclesial/sacramental confirmation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong causal vocabulary: **principal vs instrumental cause** clarifies divine authorship without obliterating human freedom or style.
 - Emphasis on the **sensus literalis** as normative; spiritual senses must be tethered to literal meaning and intention.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against strict dictation theories: rejects the idea that Scripture is mere mechanical divine dictation; preserves human rhetorical diversity.
 - Against purely naturalistic accounts of prophecy (e.g., prophetic insight reducible to reason): insists on supernatural infusion and divine concurrence.
 - Compared with later Protestant (Reformed) emphases: Aquinas does not adopt the Reformed stress on verbal-plenary formulas or sola Scriptura's polemical posture; his epistemology is more Aristotelian and sacramental.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of causality language in theology of Scripture; integration of Aristotelian psychology (phantasm, imagination) in accounts of prophetic visions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central for Roman Catholic doctrine of inspiration and magisterial exegesis; used as baseline by medieval and post-medieval scholastics.
 - Reformed reception is selective: some appreciate his care for literal sense and theological method; others critique his epistemology and ecclesial locus of authority.
 - For Pentecostalism/Reformed debates: Aquinas provides a measured, cessationist-leaning account of prophecy as special, non-normative illumination - challenging charismatic claims of ongoing canonical-level revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a balanced model bridging divine authority and human authorship; indispensable for teaching on authorial intention, hermeneutics, and the philosophical grounding of inspiration.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principal cause** - God as the ultimate source of Scriptural truth.
- **Instrumental cause** - human authors as true agents who compose in their own styles under divine concurrence.
- **Concurrence** - God's cooperative action in the act of human writing; preserves both divine speech and human agency.
- **Sensus literalis** - the literal sense; the primary guide for interpretation.
- **Sensus spiritualis** - allegorical, moral, anagogical senses derived from and subordinate to the literal sense.
- **Prophetic infusion** - supernatural infusion of knowledge or vision enabling prophecy; distinct from natural reasoning.
- **Phantasm/imagery** - role of imagination and sensory images in prophetic visions (Aristotelian psychology applied).
- **Signs and miracles (signa)** - external confirmations that authenticate prophetic office and revelation.
- **Inerrancy (qualified)** - Scripture cannot err in matters intended by God (primarily salvation); human modes of speech and rhetorical devices explain apparent tensions.
- **Double authorship** - shorthand for Aquinas's doctrine that Scripture has both divine and human authorship (God principal, human instrumental).
- **Authorial intention** - crucial criterion: meaning ties to what the human author intended under divine inspiration.
- **Ecclesial/sacramental context** - Scripture and prophecy are interpreted and confirmed within Church authority and sacramental life.
- **Hermeneutical hierarchy** - literal sense first, spiritual senses properly derived; reason and faith interact in interpretation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Catholic teaching on inspiration/prophecy (double authorship, concurrence).
- As a **polemical resource** against both mechanical dictation theories and purely charismatic continuationism (Pentecostal claims), while offering a constructive alternative to some Reformed formulations.
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing literal sense, authorial intent, and theological integration of philosophical psychology.
