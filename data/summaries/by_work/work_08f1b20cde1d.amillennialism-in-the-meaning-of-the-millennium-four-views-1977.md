### TITLE
Amillennialism - Anthony Hoekema, chapter in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views (1977)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate (1977) on millennium views; book presents four competing positions.
 - Hoekema writes from a Reformed/evangelical amillennial perspective seeking a clear, accessible corrective to dispensational premillennialism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The thousand-year term in Revelation 20 is symbolic: there is no future earthly golden-age millennium; Christ presently reigns spiritually between first and second comings.
 - The epoch between Christ's ascension and parousia is the "millennial" reign - a realized-but-not-yet reign rather than a future literal thousand years.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Hermeneutical principle: Revelation (and apocalyptic) is largely symbolic and should be interpreted in light of the rest of Scripture and the New Testament pattern of inaugurated eschatology.
 - Exegesis of Revelation 20:
 - The thousand years is symbolic, tied to Old Testament typology and apocalyptic imagery.
 - "Binding of Satan" is a present restraint effected by Christ's work, not total eradication.
 - Pauline and Johannine support:
 - Uses 1 Corinthians 15, Romans 8, and John to show resurrection and full consummation are future, while Christ's reign is inaugurated.
 - Addressing problems commonly raised:
 - Delay of the Parousia: explained by the "already/not yet" tension - kingdom inaugurated and consummated at Christ's return.
 - Antichrist / man of lawlessness: treated as both present reality and future intensified manifestation, not single millennium-era figure.
 - Pastoral/ethical implications: Christian hope motivates perseverance, mission, and righteous living without expectation of an earthly utopia prior to final judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogue primarily with dispensational premillennialists and postmillennial optimists.
 - Appeals to Augustine and Reformed tradition for historical precedent; uses New Testament exegesis as decisive.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (central), Christology (mediatorial reign), resurrection, covenant theology (kingdom continuity), revelation/hermeneutics, ecclesiology (church as kingdom community).
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema's amillennialism centers on the **inaugurated reign of Christ**: the millennium is a present, symbolic reality pointing to final consummation at Christ's return.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, clear articulation of **inaugurated eschatology**: the kingdom is present in Christ's reign but awaits final consummation.
 - Balanced pastoral tone stressing ethical urgency without speculative timetables.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to dispensational literalism: rejects a literal future 1000-year earthly reign and strict literal reading of Revelation 20.
 - Rejects postmillennial triumphalism that locates full consummation in church history prior to Christ's return.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Uses "binding of Satan" as a present restraining act rather than an absolute, final removal - preserving both present victory and future conflict.
 - Treats Revelation's numerology and imagery as theological symbols, not chronometric data.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Served as a clear, concise Reformed evangelical statement of amillennialism in a multi-view volume; often cited in academic and pastoral contexts as the standard amillennial brief against dispensational readings.
 - Sparked sustained debate with premillennial contributors; used in seminary courses on eschatology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching inaugurated eschatology, for exegetical approach to Revelation 20, and for framing pastoral eschatology that resists speculative futurism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Amillennialism**: The view that there will not be a literal thousand-year earthly reign; the "millennium" is symbolic of Christ's present reign between first and second comings.
- **Millennium (Revelation 20)**: Interpreted symbolically; denotes the church-age reign of Christ and the restrained activity of Satan.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: The kingdom is inaugurated at Christ's first coming and consummated at his return - central hermeneutic for Hoekema.
- **Realized vs. future eschatology**: Emphasizes the "realized" elements (present reign, spiritual victories) alongside ultimate future consummation.
- **Parousia (Delay of the Parousia)**: Delay explained by the interim character of the kingdom; present age includes both victory and suffering until Christ returns.
- **Binding of Satan**: A present restraining action attributable to Christ's work that allows gospel progress; not an absolute end to demonic activity.
- **Resurrection(s)**: Differentiates inaugurated spiritual resurrection (new life in Christ) from future bodily resurrection at consummation.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness**: Seen as both present-type realities (ongoing opposition) and potentially intensified future manifestation - not tied to a literal millennium epoch.
- **Symbolic/apocalyptic hermeneutic**: A method treating Revelation's images as theological symbols read against the canonical witness.
- **New Heavens and New Earth**: Future consummation; not realized fully in the present but anticipated as final state.
- **Covenant kingdom**: The millennial reign framed within covenantal continuity - the church inherits promises now, fully later.
- **Ecclesiology (church as kingdom)**: Church participates in Christ's reign now; mission flows from this status.
- **Mediatorial reign of Christ**: Christ's present rule from heaven as head of the church and king over the age until final consummation.
- Uses across loci:
 - Definition source: standard concise summary of amillennial doctrine for students and pastors.
 - Exegetical model/polemic: used to critique literalist interpretations of Revelation 20 and as an exegetical template for inaugurated eschatology.
