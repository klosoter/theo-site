### TITLE
**The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority - Lee Martin McDonald**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century historical-critical and ecumenical scholarship on Scripture; McDonald writes as a Pauline/canon scholar engaging patristic, Jewish, and textual-historical evidence for an audience of advanced students and pastors seeking a comprehensive, historically grounded account of canon formation and authority.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The canon is best understood as a historically situated, ecclesially recognized corpus whose origin and authority are rooted in communal processes of reception, criteria (apostolicity, orthodoxy, use), and transmission - rather than a single decisive act or purely ahistorical divine imprint.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical narrative of Old Testament (Jewish) canon formation, emphasizing stages and the role of the Septuagint/Tanak distinction.
 - Development of New Testament canonicity: criteria, patristic lists, and the roadmap from diversity to fourth-century consensus.
 - Transmission: textual families, versions (LXX, Vulgate, Syriac), and mechanics of manuscript copying and patrimony.
 - Authority: how canonical recognition functions theologically - reception by the church, role of liturgy, and implications for doctrine and interpretation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Patristic authors (Athanasius, Eusebius, Jerome), rabbinic evidence, Septuagint and its recension, councils referenced in canon discussions (Hippo/Carthage), and modern canon-critics and historians of early Christianity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration, ecclesiology (church as recognizer of canon), authority of Scripture, tradition and reception history, hermeneutics, and implications for doctrine formation.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The canon is a providentially guided, historically formed instrument of divine revelation whose normative authority is realized through communal recognition and transmission within the life of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong, balanced attention to both Jewish and Christian stages of Old Testament formation; rejects simple one-act formulations.
 - Treats canonicity as an ecclesial reception process rather than a merely textual or metaphysical property.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against views that locate canonicity purely in ecclesiastical fiat (e.g., simplistic appeals to later councils) or purely in immediate divine dictation detached from community recognition.
 - Challenges maximalist readings that treat every patristic citation as canonical proof without assessment of context and nuance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies terminology between "canon" (the bounded corpus) and "canonicity" (the status conferred by recognition and use).
 - Emphasizes the procedural criteria (apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, liturgical use) as diagnostic, not mechanical, tools.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used in academic and seminarial contexts as a standard, balanced introduction to canon studies; appreciated by evangelicals and mainline scholars for its thorough evidence base.
 - Provokes careful reflection in confessional traditions (including Reformed) where doctrinal claims about Scripture's authority must be reconciled with historical contingency of formation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a comprehensive, evidence-rich primer that integrates textual, patristic, and ecclesial data; excellent for courses on biblical theology, church history, and doctrine of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon:** The collection of books acknowledged as Scripture; treated as historically formed and ecclesially ratified.
- **Canonicity:** The process/status by which a text comes to be recognized as authoritative Scripture.
- **Apostolicity:** Criterion emphasizing origin/connection to the apostles or apostolic circle.
- **Orthodoxy (rule of faith):** Conformity to received teaching and faith of the church as a canonical test.
- **Catholicity (universality):** Widespread liturgical and ecclesial use across churches/regions as evidence for acceptance.
- **Septuagint (LXX):** Greek OT translation; central to discussion of early Christian OT use and divergence with later Jewish canon.
- **Tanakh / Jewish canon:** The Hebrew canon's formation and its relationship to Christian OT collections.
- **Patristic evidence:** Use of Church Fathers' citations and lists (e.g., Athanasius) to trace recognition and disputes.
- **Textual transmission:** Manuscript traditions, versions (Vulgate, Syriac), and the mechanics of copying and recension.
- **Councils (Hippo/Carthage):** Historical milestones often cited in canon debates; McDonald treats them as part of consensus-building rather than sole origins.
- **Reception history:** How texts are used interpretively in worship, theology, and preaching - central to McDonald's authority thesis.
- **Closed vs. open canon:** Distinction between a fixed corpus and ongoing claims; McDonald maps historical closure without theological absolutism.
- **Criteria of canon:** Practical list (apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, antiquity, liturgical use) used as heuristic, not formulaic checklist.
- **Canonical authority:** Theological claim that once texts are recognized and received, they function as normative for doctrine and practice.
- **Muratorian-type evidence:** Early lists/fragments used to show the gradual recognition and occasional disputes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what scholars mean by "canon" and "canonicity" in historical theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against simplistic narratives (instantaneous revelation of a closed Bible or pure ecclesial fiat).
- As an **exegetical/reception model** showing how canonical status shapes interpretation and doctrinal formation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking biblical studies, church history, and systematic theology on the authority of Scripture.
