### TITLE
**Scripture Speaks for Itself** - John M. Frame, Westminster Theological Journal (1974)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1970s Reformed evangelical academy; journal audience of conservative Reformed scholars.
 - Conversation against both liberal critical approaches to Scripture and populist/fundamentalist literalism; anticipatory to later inerrancy debates.
 - Frame writing from a presuppositional-Reformed vantage that seeks to systematize apologology and hermeneutics together.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible must be read and judged primarily by its own testimony: Scripture is self-authenticating and interprets Scripture; external interpretive authorities should not override the internal testimony to inspiration and inerrancy.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation that Scripture is divinely inspired and inerrant in the sense of truthfulness and reliability of its witness to God.
 - Defense of a **divine-human authorship** model: God is the ultimate author while human agents and linguistic forms are genuinely theirs; this excludes both mechanical dictation and purely human product models.
 - Hermeneutical principle: **Scripture interprets Scripture** - canonical coherence and the Bible's own explanations take precedence over external theoretical reconstructions.
 - Polemic moves:
 - Rejects reductionist higher criticism that treats biblical claims as merely historical-cultural products.
 - Critiques a naïve fundamentalist literalism that ignores genres, authorial intention, and human modes of expression.
 - Practical consequence: Inerrancy pertains to the Bible's intended propositional teachings as understood in context; methodological humility before the text is required.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Builds on Reformed tradition (Westminster, Warfield) and presuppositional apologetics (roots in Van Til), while distinguishing his own emphases on Scripture's propositional clarity.
 - Implied contrasts with liberal theologians and some neo-orthodox tendencies that downplay propositional content.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (primary)
 - Inerrancy and authority of Scripture
 - Canonical interpretation and hermeneutics
 - Indirectly touches on providence and the doctrine of God (as the ultimate speaker)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Scripture is the authoritative, self-authenticating Word of God; interpretation must start with the Bible's own testimony to itself - divine propositional revelation mediated through genuine human authors.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on Scripture as its own interpreter: canonical, internal criteria trump externally imposed critical schemas.
 - Balanced divine-human authorship view that affirms both plenary inspiration and genuine human linguistic/personality characteristics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects two common extremes:
 - Against dictation-model fundamentalism: stresses human authorial style and genre.
 - Against relativizing historical criticism or neo-orthodoxy: defends propositional content and truth-claims of Scripture.
 - Places Frame's presuppositional apologetics within robust hermeneutical respect for text rather than merely epistemological assertion.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts inerrancy talk into a framework that centers on the Bible's self-testimony and canonical coherence rather than solely on a technical "verbal-plenary" formula.
 - Emphasizes a hermeneutic of "Scripture-as-speaking" - the Bible as an active address rather than inert data.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and evangelical scholars who sought a rigorous yet nuanced defense of inerrancy.
 - Served as an early public statement of themes Frame later develops in his larger works on the doctrine of the Word of God and hermeneutics.
 - Used by presuppositional apologists and conservative exegetes as a touchstone for integrating apologology and biblical theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how to hold inspiration, human authorship, and interpretive method together.
 - Useful corrective to both liberal reductionism and naïve literalism; remains pedagogically helpful for teaching doctrine of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-authenticating** - Scripture's witness to itself is the primary ground for accepting its authority.
- **Inerrancy** - The Bible is free from error in its intended teachings; emphasis on original-autograph truthfulness.
- **Inspiration / Plenary inspiration** - God fully intended the Bible's message; human authors genuinely authored under divine supervision.
- **Divine-human authorship** - The combined reality that God is ultimate author while human authors contribute real linguistic and personal elements.
- **Scripture interprets Scripture** - Canonical coherence and internal cross-reference rule in hermeneutics.
- **Propositional revelation** - The Bible communicates truth‑propositions about God and reality; not reduced to mere religious experience or symbols.
- **Perspicuity** - Scripture is sufficiently clear for its essential doctrines; coupled with canonical aids to interpretation.
- **Hermeneutical humility** - Methodological posture: start with the text's claims and intentions rather than imposing external theories.
- **Canonical coherence** - Theological and textual unity of Scripture used as an interpretive standard.
- **Genre sensitivity** - Recognition that different biblical genres require appropriate interpretive approaches.
- **Apologetic presuppositionalism** - Assumes the truth of the Christian revelation as the coherent starting point for interpretation and defense.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a measured Reformed inerrancy and inspiration position that resists extremes.
 - As a **polemic** against historical-critical reductionism and against simplistic fundamentalism.
 - As an **exegetical/hermeneutical model** promoting Scripture-on-Scripture reading and canonical coherence.
