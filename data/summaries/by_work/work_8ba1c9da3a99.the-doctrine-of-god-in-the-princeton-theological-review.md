### TITLE
The Doctrine of God - Geerhardus Vos (article in The Princeton Theological Review)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton milieu; Vos as a leading Reformed biblical theologian reacting to both classical scholastic formulations and rising liberal/process theologies. Article addresses doctrinal clarity in an age of historical and philosophical challenge to classical theism.
- **Central thesis**
 - Vos aims to defend and rearticulate classical theism: God is utterly simple, self-existent, immutable, and impassible in his being (absolute attributes), while the relational and economic descriptors (relative attributes) are genuine but derivative-grounded in, and consistent with, the divine essence as revealed in covenantal history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological survey: traces how classical categories (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) have been treated by patristic, medieval, and Reformed writers.
 - Biblical-theological corrective: insists that doctrines must be rooted in Scripture; shows how biblical revelation sustains absolute attributes while also demanding a robust doctrine of God's relational acts.
 - Analytical taxonomy: differentiates **absolute** (ontological) from **relative** (economic/relational) attributes and explains their coherence.
 - Pastoral-theological implications: discusses how this balance preserves both God's transcendence and genuine revelation in covenant and Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages patristic and scholastic vocabulary (Augustine, Aquinas), Reformed classics (Calvin, Westminster/Princeton tradition), and contemporary critical voices (liberal theology, nascent process thought).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary focus: attributes of God; secondary implications for revelation, covenant theology, Trinity (as consistent with divine simplicity and relation), and Christology (how divine immutability/impassibility relate to the incarnate Son).
- **Closing line**
 - Vos centers the doctrine of God on the union of ontological absolutes and covenantal relativity: God's immutable, simple being alone secures trustworthy revelation and gracious relational action.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that the classical **absolute attributes** (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) are not abstract metaphysical postulates but necessary theological presuppositions for coherent biblical revelation and covenantal history.
 - Careful account of how **relative attributes** (mercy, patience, holiness as manifested) are not metaphysically opposed to absolutes but flow from them in God's acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern tendencies to anthropomorphize God by appealing to "change" in God; resists processist diminutions of divine immutability.
 - Challenges certain scholastic excesses that sever attributes from concrete revelation; Vos re-binds doctrine to Scripture and historical redemptive acts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear, programmatic use of an absolute/relative taxonomy applied systematically to classical attributes; use of biblical-historical criteria to adjudicate philosophical claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Princeton and conservative Reformed circles as a corrective to liberal and process readings; used by subsequent Reformed theologians as a model for keeping doctrine biblical and philosophically coherent.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, balanced template for teaching divine attributes that honors both transcendence and historical revelation; valuable for polemics, pedagogy, and doctrinal synthesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Simplicity**
 - God is not composite; attributes are identical with divine being. Vos insists simplicity secures divine unity and coheres with revelation.
- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; source of all being. Grounds divine sovereignty and the non-contingency of revelation.
- **Immutability**
 - God's unchangeableness in essence and covenantal fidelity; change in relation (economy) does not imply metaphysical change.
- **Impassibility**
 - God does not suffer metaphysically; divine responsiveness in Scripture is real but not entailment of ontic suffering.
- **Absolute attributes**
 - Ontological properties (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) that define God's being.
- **Relative attributes**
 - Economic or relational predicates (love, mercy, anger) that describe God in covenantal action; derivative but not arbitrary.
- **Communicable / Incommunicable attributes**
 - Traditional distinction recast: incommunicables correlate with absolutes; communicables often appear as relative attributes in redemptive-historical contexts.
- **Economy / Ontology**
 - Vos carefully distinguishes God's economic revelation from his ontological being; both must be cohered, not conflated.
- **Revelation (covenantal)**
 - Revelation is historically grounded; attributes are disclosed through acts in covenant history rather than pure abstraction.
- **Trinitarian coherence**
 - Vos insists the taxonomy must be compatible with intra-Trinitarian relations-absolute attributes do not negate real relations among Persons.
- **Christology**
 - The incarnate Son manifests relative attributes without violating divine immutability or impassibility in being.
- **Scriptural normativity**
 - Scripture adjudicates philosophical reflection on attributes; Vos models exegetical substantiation for theological claims.
- **Polemic utility**
 - Used against process theology and anthropomorphic liberalism to argue for divine transcendence and reliable revelation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for incommunicable/communicable and absolute/relative attribute distinctions in systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against modernist/process accounts of God's change and suffering.
- As an **exegetical-model** resource demonstrating how to ground attribute-talk in covenantal narrative.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in constructing a Reformed doctrine of God that links ontology to redemptive history.
