### TITLE
The New Covenant Work of Christ: Priesthood, Atonement, and Intercession - Stephen Wellum (Southern Baptist Journal of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology within a broadly conservative evangelical and Reformed milieu grappling with covenantal typology, the nature of Christ's work, and Baptist identity.
 - Part of larger conversations (late 20th-21st century) between Dispensationalism and forms of Covenant Theology, especially Progressive Covenantalism (PC) which Wellum helps articulate.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christ's priestly, atoning, and intercessory work constitutes the inaugurative fulfillment of the new covenant: it accomplishes once-for-all substitutionary atonement, establishes Christ as the eternal high priest (Melchizedekic), and secures ongoing intercession on behalf of the covenant people - thereby grounding ecclesial identity, sacramental practice, and eschatological hope.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - exegetical foundation: close readings of Hebrews, Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36-37, and selected Psalms showing covenantal promise fulfilled in Christ.
 - priesthood: identifies Christ as the eschatological high priest of a new covenant order (Melchizedek typology), superior to Levitical priests and inaugurating a holy priesthood of believers.
 - atonement: defends a substitutionary and once-for-all penal/expensive atonement - the sacrificial system finds its terminus in Christ rather than future temple ritual.
 - intercession: argues that Christ's ongoing mediatorial advocacy is the present application and maintenance of the covenant benefits until consummation.
 - covenantal integration: situates these works within a Progressive Covenantal framework that stresses both continuity and discontinuity between covenants - promises are fulfilled in Christ and applied via the Spirit, yet realized eschatologically.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary scriptural interlocutors: Hebrews (central), Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36-37, Psalms, and the Pauline corpus.
 - Theological interlocutors: Dispensational interpreters (on covenant discontinuity and future temple/ritual), classical covenant theologians (on covenant continuity), and contemporary PC proponents.
 - Uses historical categories (Melchizedek typology, Levitical contrasts) and modern systematic concerns (Christology, soteriology).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (new covenant), Christology (priesthood and mediatorial work), soteriology (atonement), pneumatology (application), ecclesiology (identity and ministry of the church), eschatology (inauguration vs consummation), revelation and typology (OT-NT fulfillment).

- **Closing line**
 - Wellum locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that Christ's priestly sacrifice and continuing intercession inaugurate the promised new covenant now, securing salvation and covenant identity for the church while pointing forward to consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the *inaugurative* nature of the new covenant: accomplished in Christ and currently operative by the Spirit, not merely future or purely symbolic.
 - Synthesis of robust Christ-centered priesthood with Progressive Covenantal motifs: continuity of covenant promises with realized fulfillment in Christ.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Dispensational claims that retain future, literal temple-sacrificial systems as normative: argues those systems are typological and complete in Christ's once-for-all work.
 - Qualifies some classical covenant formulations by emphasizing progressive unfolding and the Spirit's role in applying covenant promises (less static than certain federalist reconstructions).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Applies Melchizedek typology and Hebrews structures within a PC hermeneutic, pressing for a more ecclesially centered reading of priesthood and intercession.
 - Clarifies "inaugurated eschatology" in covenantal terms: the new covenant is both present possession and future hope.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative Baptist circles for bridging biblical exegesis and systematic clarity; used by pastors and scholars to rebut dispensational separations and to teach the continuity of redemptive history.
 - Influential in discussions that require a biblical-theological defense of the church's covenantal status without collapsing prophetic eschatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, exegetically grounded account of Christ's priestly work for classroom use, preaching, and pastoral formation; serves as a reliable guide for integrating Hebrews into covenantal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Covenant**
 - The eschatological covenant promised in the OT (Jer. 31); inaugurated by Christ, applied by the Spirit, fulfilled at consummation.
- **Priesthood of Christ**
 - Christ as eternal high priest (Melchizedekic), superior to Levitical priests, mediating access to God.
- **Melchizedek Typology**
 - OT figure used in Hebrews to typify Christ's priesthood; a model for Christ's non-Levitical, eternal sacerdotal role.
- **Once-for-all Atonement**
 - The finality of Christ's sacrifice (Hebrews language); substitutionary and penal in function.
- **Intercession**
 - Ongoing mediatorial advocacy of Christ before the Father; the means by which covenant benefits are secured and maintained.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology**
 - The "already/not-yet" reality of the new covenant: present possession and future consummation.
- **Progressive Covenantalism (PC)**
 - A reading that emphasizes progressive fulfillment of covenants culminating in Christ while maintaining theological continuity and redemptive-historical movement.
- **Typology**
 - OT covenantal and cultic institutions (temple, sacrifices, priesthood) as foreshadowing fulfilled realities in Christ.
- **Covenant Continuity / Discontinuity**
 - Continuity: promises fulfilled in Christ; Discontinuity: ceremonial and custodial features fulfilled and abrogated by Christ's work.
- **Application / Pneumatology**
 - Role of the Spirit in applying the benefits of Christ's atoning work to believers in the present.
- **Ecclesial Identity**
 - The church as the covenant people where Christ's priestly benefits are mediated and manifested.
- **Typological Fulfillment vs. Literal Future Ritual**
 - Clarifies that OT cultic promises are fulfilled typologically in Christ rather than restored as literal future cult.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what the new covenant entails theologically and pastorally.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational separations and future-restoration treatments of temple/ritual.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Hebrews and Jer. 31 within a single covenantal-historical framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching soteriology and ecclesiology from a Progressive Covenantal perspective.
