### TITLE
Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry - Albert Borgmann (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1984; revised ed. 2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1984 amid growing interdisciplinary critique of modern technology (post-Heideggerian, Ellulian, practice-theory currents).
 - Borgmann writes as a philosopher of technology reacting to abstract accounts of "instrumental reason" by offering an empirically sensitive, normative account.
 - Revised edition (2006) adds responses to critics and clarifies the device/focal contrast in light of later technological developments.

- **Central thesis**
 - Technology is not neutral: the prevailing "device paradigm" reorganizes goods and practices in ways that erode engagement, community, and human flourishing; recovery requires cultivating "focal things" and "focal practices."

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: empirical and conceptual exposition of the **device paradigm** - how modern technologies deliver commodities by dispersing complexity and diminishing engagement (e.g., central heating vs. hearth).
 - Analysis: shows social and moral consequences - **disburdenment** (loss of skill and responsibility), commodification of goods, attenuation of communal practices, fragmentation of lived experience.
 - Normative proposal: endorse and nurture **focal things** (objects that center life) and **focal practices** (traditions of sustained attention and skill) that restore depth, meaning, and moral formation.
 - Practical implications: argues for local, communal responses and selective restraint rather than wholesale Luddism; technology should be judged by its effects on the good life.

- **Figures and interlocutors engaged**
 - Heidegger (enframing/technology critique) - Borgmann draws on but departs from Heidegger by offering social/ethical remedies rather than primarily ontological diagnosis.
 - Jacques Ellul (technique), Marxist/social critique traditions, and contemporary sociologists of technology.
 - Engages philosophical pragmatism, Aristotelian teleology implicitly through goods and practices.

- **Doctrines treated (explicitly or by implication)**
 - Not a systematic theological work - **no direct treatment** of revelation, Trinity, Christology.
 - Implicitly touches theological themes: **the good life, vocation, community, sacramentality, stewardship, Sabbath and liturgical centeredness**, and the formation of character.
 - Ethics and teleology: moral anthropology and telos of human flourishing are central.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Technology reshapes human character by reorganizing how goods are obtained and experienced; Christians (and theological ethics) should recover and cultivate focal practices-akin to liturgy, sacrament, vocation-that re-center life toward the good and resist commodifying disburdenment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Device paradigm** as an analytic tool: explains a wide range of technological phenomena by examining how commodities are produced, delivered, and experienced.
 - Focus on **practices and things** rather than solely on systems, policy, or abstract moral principles.
 - Empirical sensitivity - uses everyday examples (hearth, fishing, automobiles, appliances) to ground philosophical claims.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Unlike Heidegger's primarily ontological critique, Borgmann offers concrete social and ethical strategies (focal practices) rather than metaphysical lament.
 - More optimistic and prescriptive than Ellul's sweeping denunciation; Borgmann emphasizes selective appropriation and reform rather than total rejection.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - **Device paradigm**, **focal thing**, **focal practice**, **disburdenment** - become staple vocabulary in philosophy of technology and theological ethics of technology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential beyond philosophy: taken up in theology, liturgical studies, environmental ethics, pastoral theology, and technology ethics.
 - Reformed and mainline theologians use Borgmann as a resource for discussing liturgy, formation, and the social effects of technology; cited in debates on worship, Sabbath, and community life.
 - Influenced contemporary critics of technological secularization and proponents of practice-centered theology (e.g., liturgical and sacramental renewals).

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust analytic framework for assessing technologies by their formative effects on character and community.
 - Highly teachable: concrete examples plus clear normative vocabulary make it useful in seminars on ethics, liturgy, and technology.
 - Durable resource for interdisciplinary dialogue between philosophy, theology, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Device paradigm**
 - The pattern by which modern technologies deliver commodities while hiding the machinery and dispersing engagement.
- **Focal things**
 - Objects that require and reward sustained attention and skill (e.g., hearth, communal table); serve as centers of human life.
- **Focal practices**
 - Traditions or activities that cultivate character, skills, and relationships through sustained engagement (e.g., fishing as communal ritual; liturgy as a Christian focal practice).
- **Disburdenment**
 - The process by which technology relieves burdens and responsibilities, often leading to loss of skill, meaning, and moral accountability.
- **Commodification**
 - Reduction of goods, relationships, or experiences to purchasable commodities, severing ties between means and meaningful practice.
- **Engagement / presence**
 - Ethical-phenomenological criterion: technologies should be judged by whether they foster authentic presence and relational depth.
- **Instrumental reason / neutrality critique**
 - Rejects the notion that technology is value-neutral; shows how forms of technical provision embody and shape values.
- **Locality / community**
 - Emphasis on local practices and institutions as bulwarks against anonymous, globalized technological commodification.
- **Moral formation / character**
 - Technology as formative of dispositions; ethics must address practices that cultivate virtues.
- **Teleology / the good life**
 - Implicit Aristotelian concern with ends - what technologies contribute to or subtract from human flourishing.
- **Sacramentality (implicit)**
 - Borgmann's focal phenomena invite theological appropriation: liturgy, sacraments, and table fellowship function as Christian focal practices.
- **Reformist stance**
 - Advocacy for selective resistance, creative appropriation, and cultivation of practices rather than total rejection.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the "device paradigm" and focal practices in theological ethics and philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic** against techno-optimism and reductionist accounts of human flourishing.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in liturgical, pastoral, and sacramental theology to argue for practice-centered formation (Sabbath, table, liturgy).
- As an **analytic model** in environmental and social ethics to assess technological impacts on community and character.
