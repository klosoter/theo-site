### TITLE
**Karl Barth's Christology as a Resource for a Reformed Version of Kenoticism** - Bruce McCormack (International Journal of Systematic Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Barth scholarship engaging renewed interest in kenotic theology, trinitarian revision, and Reformed identity after modern theology. Situated against debates over natural theology (analogia entis) and the primacy of revelation (analogia fidei).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth's Christology supplies a viable Reformed form of kenoticism: a doctrine of divine self-limitation in the incarnation that preserves God's freedom, immutability, and the Reformed emphasis on revelation without succumbing to ontological diminution of the divine being.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposit Barth's key Christological moves: the Word's self‑condescension is an evental, redemptive act (the Word become flesh) not a metaphysical subtraction in divine essence.
 - Show how Barth's rejection of the analogia entis and insistence on analogia fidei reframes kenosis: knowledge of God occurs in the singular, historical act of revelation (Christ), so divine self‑limitation is best understood as God's self‑communication in history.
 - Distinguish Barthian "kenosis" from classical kenotic theories that posit a real loss or change in God's metaphysical attributes; argue Barth retains classical Reformed commitments (sovereignty, election).
 - Propose that Barth thus offers resources for a Reformed kenoticism that is theologically responsible and pastorally faithful.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Karl Barth and Barthian interpreters (e.g., Jüngel, Torrance) as primary sources; contrasts with classical kenoticists (19th-20th century) and with theological tradition holding analogia entis (Aquinas / scholastic residue); Reformed concerns drawn from Calvinian tradition over immutability and impassibility.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, person and natures), revelation vs natural theology (analogia fidei vs analogia entis), Trinity, divine attributes (immutability, impassibility), election and atonement as correlated to Kenosis.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth's Christocentric account reframes kenoticism as the divine act of gracious self‑condescension in the event of revelation - a model that conserves core Reformed doctrines while permitting a robust account of divine self‑limitation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Kenosis as an evental, revelatory self‑communication of God rather than an ontological diminishment; Christology drives the doctrine of God (Christocentric primacy).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects classical kenoticism that reads kenosis as literal loss; contrasts with analogia entis‑based approaches that infer God from creaturely being - Barthian route places the kenotic act squarely within revelation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of **analogía fidei** to legitimate kenosis theologically; framing kenosis within election and the Word‑event rather than as metaphysical change.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and evangelical theologians seeking a non‑reductive kenoticism; catalyzed further work on trinitarian models of self‑limitation and the relation between divine attributes and historical revelation.
 - Criticized by some for systematizing Barth and for potential tensions with classical formulations of divine immutability.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a careful, Reformed‑sensitive template for doing kenotic theology that is anchored in Christology and faithful to the primacy of revelation; valuable in teaching on incarnation, divine action, and the limits of natural theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenoticism** - doctrine of divine self‑emptying; here reinterpreted as **evental self‑condescension** rather than ontological loss.
- **Barthian kenosis** - kenotic motif grounded in the Word‑event (Verbum in carne), preserving divine freedom and eternity.
- **Analogia fidei** - primacy of analogy of faith (knowledge of God through revelation); central hermeneutical principle for Barthian kenosis.
- **Analogia entis** - analogy of being (natural theology); rejected as a basis for kenotic claims in McCormack's reading of Barth.
- **Incarnation (Word become flesh)** - the concrete locus of divine self‑limitation; the theological hinge for kenotic proposals.
- **Revelation as event** - revelation is historical and singular (Christ), not a set of propositions accessible via creaturely analogy.
- **Divine immutability / impassibility** - preserved in McCormack's Barthian model by locating change in relational, economic terms (God's action) rather than metaphysical alteration of divine essence.
- **Election** - related to kenosis: God's free choice to act in Christ expresses self‑limitation as gracious commitment rather than necessity.
- **Communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum)** - implicitly re‑handled so that locutions about God's suffering are speech about the one person of the Word acting in human history.
- **Evental ontology** - emphasis on events (incarnation, atonement) as decisive for speaking of God, displacing ontological inference from creature to Creator.
- **Christocentrism** - methodological priority of Christ for theology and for understanding divine attributes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a non‑reductive, Reformed form of kenoticism anchored in Barthian Christology.
- As a **polemic** against analogia entis‑based or classical kenotic readings that imply ontological diminution.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for locating divine self‑limitation in the event of revelation (incarnation/election), used in trinitarian and soteriological discussions.
