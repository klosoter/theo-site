### TITLE
The Prayers and Meditations of St. Anselm - Anselm of Canterbury

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 11th century, Benedictine monastery at Bec and later Canterbury; transitional moment between patristic devotion and emerging scholastic reflection. Devotional-ascetic milieu shaped by monastic prayer, Augustine's introspective theology, and Anselm's concurrent polemical works (e.g., Cur Deus Homo).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The manuscript collection functions both as devotional practice and as compact theology: prayered meditations assume and explicate key doctrinal convictions, chief among them the **impeccability of Christ** - that the incarnate Word, though truly human, could not and did not sin, and that this sinlessness is essential for effective atonement.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Collection of prayers and meditations alternating personal penitence, doctrinal confession, and Christological reflection.
 - Moves from recognition of human sin and need for grace to affirmation of Christ's unique moral perfection.
 - Uses scriptural exegesis, Augustine-derived anthropology, and rational argumentation (proto-scholastic) to show: (1) Jesus was tempted but never concupiscently inclined; (2) the divine-human union secures against sin; (3) only a sinless mediator can satisfy divine justice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy use of Augustine (on will, sin, grace), patristic prayer tradition (e.g., Jerome, Gregory), and Anselm's own theological corpus (notably Cur Deus Homo for atonement logic). Implicitly addresses medieval debates over Christ's freedom/will (prefiguring later Thomistic controversies).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union, impeccability), soteriology (satisfaction, active/passive obedience), anthropology (concupiscence, original sin), grace, prayer as theological method, and the function of meditation in sanctification.
- **Closing line:** The work locates true devotion in conjoined affective prayer and precise Christology: Christ's incapacity for sin is both a devotional certainty and a theological necessity for his role as redeemer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats prayer as a vehicle for doctrinal formation; meditations repeat theological affirmations so that belief is internalized affectively.
 - Presents **impeccability** not merely as moral excellence but as a necessary consequence of the hypostatic union and of Christ's role in satisfying divine justice.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Aligns with Augustinian stress on human inability and need for divine initiative, but goes further in arguing that the God-man's divine nature secures an absolute exemption from sin - a firmer statement than later nuanced scholastics who distinguished logical possibility from moral incapacity.
 - Implicitly contrasts with any view that treats Christ as merely exemplary or as a human who could have sinned without jeopardizing his salvific efficacy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Fuses devotional lexicon (confession, petition) with technical Christological terms (impeccability, satisfaction) in compact meditative genres.
 - Reinforces the language of **active obedience** (positive fulfillment of law) and **passive obedience** (suffering/substitution) within prayerful confession.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in medieval monasteries; formative for "Anselmian" soteriology in scholasticism.
 - Reformed and Protestant theologians later drew on Anselm's stress on Christ's sinlessness and satisfaction to articulate active/passive obedience doctrines.
 - Later medieval theologians (e.g., Aquinas) debated the metaphysical status of impeccability; Aquinas allowed theoretical peccability of Christ's human will while affirming practical impossibility.
- **Enduring value:** Models how devotional literature can carry rigorous Christological claims; valuable for teaching links between prayer, christology, and soteriology and for tracing historical debates on Christ's freedom and sinlessness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability:** The claim that Christ could not sin; in these meditations this is both a devotional affirmation and a theological necessity for atonement.
- **Peccability:** The opposing thesis (Christ could have sinned); treated implicitly as false within Anselm's prayers.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's positive fulfillment of God's law; emphasized as necessary for satisfying divine justice.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death as substitutionary satisfaction; paired with impeccability to secure redemption.
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; grounds the argument that sin was impossible for the incarnate Word.
- **Freedom of Will:** Presented in a way that distinguishes freedom from inclination to sin; Christ possesses true freedom, ordered inseparably to the good.
- **Concupiscence:** Human disordered desire; Anselm's meditations stress Christ's freedom from concupiscence as central to sinlessness.
- **Satisfaction (soteriology):** The mechanism by which Christ's obedience and suffering restore divine order; requires Christ's sinlessness.
- **Temptation vs. Sin:** Differentiated: Anselm allows temptation but denies any real consenting to sin in Christ.
- **Grace:** Divine aid that heals the will; in Christ subsumed by the divine nature, ensuring impeccability.
- **Penitence & Prayer:** Mode of the work; shows how doctrinal truths shape the soul's petitions and contrition.
- **Devotional Theology:** Term for the genre where affect and doctrine cohere; Anselm is paradigmatic.
- **Oratio / Meditatio:** The liturgical and monastic forms used to teach doctrine through prayer.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **doctrinal source** for the Impeccability of Christ and for articulating active/passive obedience.
 - As a **devotional-exegetical model** showing how prayer can serve theological formation.
 - As a **polemic resource** against skeptical or minimal views of Christ's sinlessness; and as a **conceptual pivot** in histories tracing medieval and Reformation treatments of Christ's will and freedom.
