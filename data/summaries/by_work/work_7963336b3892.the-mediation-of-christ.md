### TITLE
The Mediation of Christ (anonymous): a doctrinal synthesis linking eternal Sonship, incarnational obedience, penal participation, and the threefold office

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Anonymous treatise of uncertain provenance; language and concerns point to a post-Reformation, confessional milieu shaped by Reformed scholastic exegesis and 19th-century debates over kenosis.
 - Dialogues presuppose Chalcedonian Christology and use Pauline and Hebrews texts as primary exegetical loci (see John 1; Phil 2; Heb 7; Rom 5).
- **Central thesis**
 - Christ's unique mediatorial role is ontologically grounded in the **eternal Sonship** and is realized in history by the incarnational assumption of human nature, an obedient kenotic economy without loss of deity, and the carried-out munus triplex (prophet, priest, king) effecting both the removal of guilt and the defeat of death.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - I. **Prolegomena**: Trinity and eternal relations - Sonship as the ontological basis for mediation (appeals to Chalcedonian grammar).
 - II. **Incarnation and Kenosis**: Exegetical treatment of Philippians 2; affirms genuine self-emptying in function and humiliation while denying ontological divestment of deity.
 - III. **Soteriological mechanics**: Diagnostic of human guilt, pollution, and death (Romans 5) and how the mediatorial union effects forensic imputation and ontic purification.
 - IV. **Munus triplex enacted**: Christ's prophet-priest-king work integrated as stages/expressions of mediation (Hebrews 7 and Psalm 110 as touchstones).
 - V. **Pastoral and ecclesial implications**: How the church proclaims and participates in the mediated benefits.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Chalcedon and early exegesis of John and Paul; engages Anselmian and Reformation penal language, and critiques 19th-century kenotic formulations that collapse deity into mere human finitude.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity (intra‑Trinitarian relations), Christology (eternal Sonship, hypostatic union), kenosis, atonement (forensic and participatory dimensions), soteriology (guilt/pollution/death), and Christ's offices (munus triplex).
- **Closing line**
 - The work locates the ground of mediation in eternal Sonship and insists that true mediation is a historical, incarnational act of obedient union (kenotic in function, not in divine ontology) that secures both the forgiveness of guilt and ontological renewal through Christ's threefold office.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Ontological rooting of mediation** in eternal Sonship rather than treating mediation primarily as an economic role assumed only at the incarnation.
 - A careful lexical separation between **functional kenosis** (self‑emptying in service, humiliation) and **ontological divestment** (which it rejects).
- **Corrections and contrasts**
 - Corrects extreme kenotic models that posit diminution of the Logos' divine attributes; counters purely forensic frameworks (Anselmian reductionism) by insisting on **both** penal and participatory/transformative effects.
 - Reworks Reformed penal language to account for **pollution** (ontic corruption) as distinct from mere legal guilt, thereby integrating forensic imputation with corporate sanctification.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Proposes a modest "mediatorial ontology": a conceptual bridge connecting intra‑Trinitarian relations to economical offices so that eternal Sonship explains, not merely precedes, the incarnational mediation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Limited direct reception due to anonymity, yet frequently cited in Reformed syllabi and conservative critiques of kenoticism; practical influence in sermons and systematic outlines that stress Sonship as the decisive ground for redemption.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clarifying synthesis for students: preserves Chalcedonian verities, provides a robust critique of ontological kenosis, and rebalances forensic atonement with ontic/corporate renewal.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mediation** - The act and office by which the eternal Son bridges God and humanity; both ontological grounding and economical enactment.
- **Eternal Sonship** - The Son's personal relation within the Trinity taken as the ontological root of historical mediation (vs. merely an economic title).
- **Incarnation** - Assumption of human nature by the eternal Son; union that enables representation, obedience, and sacrifice (cf. John 1:1-14).
- **Kenosis** - Functional self‑emptying (Phil 2:6-8); affirmed in humiliation and service, denied as ontological loss of deity.
 - Critique: distinguishes between "kenosis of role" and "kenosis of being."
- **Hypostatic Union** - Chalcedonian two‑natures one‑person grammar used to defend simultaneous deity and humanity in the mediatorial work.
- **Guilt** - Forensic liability before God; treated but not conflated with pollution.
- **Pollution** - Ontic defilement or corruption inherited in Adam; requires not only acquittal but ontological cleansing (Romans 5).
- **Death** - Both legal penalty and existential consequence of sin; Christ's death removes legal guilt and conquers ontic death.
- **Atonement** - Composite account: penal substitution (legal satisfaction) + participatory transformation (moral/ontic restoration).
- **Munus Triplex** - Christ's threefold office (prophet, priest, king) as integrated stages/expressions of his mediation (Hebrews 7; Psalm 110).
- **Imputation** - Transfer of guilt and righteousness; used in tandem with corporate union to explain forensic and transformative results.
- **Active and Passive Obedience** - Christ's fulfilling of the law (active) and suffering/redemptive death (passive) as indispensable to mediation.
- **Mediatorial Ontology** - Term for the work's key move: grounding economical roles in Trinitarian relations.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the relation between eternal Sonship and historical mediation in Christology courses.
 - As a **polemic** or corrective against ontological kenoticism and against accounts that reduce atonement to mere legal fiction.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Phil 2, John 1, Heb 7, and Rom 5 together to form a unified soteriology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in syllabi that seek to integrate Trinitarian ontology with soteriological practice.
