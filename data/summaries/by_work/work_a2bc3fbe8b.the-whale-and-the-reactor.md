### TITLE
The Whale and the Reactor - Langdon Winner (1986)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Mid-1980s interdisciplinary debate in Science & Technology Studies (STS). 
 - Reaction to both technological determinism and strong social constructivist accounts of technology; part of a longer postwar critique of modernity (in conversation with Heidegger, Mumford, Ellul).
 - Cultural moment: intensifying scale of infrastructures, Cold War technopolitics, rising environmental and civic-tech concerns.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Technologies are not neutral tools; they embody and reproduce specific forms of power and political order. The key theological problem reframed: how do human dominion, moral responsibility, and communal formation change when authority is embedded in technical systems rather than in persons or institutions?

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Collection of essays arguing two linked claims:
 - **Artifacts have politics.** Some technological arrangements require or are strongly compatible with particular political relationships (centralized vs. decentralized, authoritarian vs. democratic).
 - **Society sleeps through technology.** Modern societies practice "technological somnambulism" - an unreflective acceptance of technical change that obscures moral choices and communal shaping.
 - Major moves:
 - Diagnose common misunderstandings: reject simple determinism and naive neutrality.
 - Offer historical and empirical case studies (e.g., infrastructural design, industrial organization) showing how design choices instantiate political values.
 - Call for deliberate public deliberation and democratic oversight of technological choices.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Philosophical and cultural critics: Martin Heidegger, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul.
 - STS interlocutors: critics of determinism and proponents of social constructivism (Pinch & Bijker, others).
 - Policy and political theory contexts: references to modern industrial planners, designers, and engineers.

- **Doctrines treated (theological read):**
 - Not explicitly doctrinal, but implicates:
 - **Creation and Dominion:** How human stewardship exercises itself through technical mediation.
 - **Sin and Idolatry:** Technology as possible idol or locus of hubris and misplaced trust.
 - **Providence and Agency:** Questions of moral agency when agency is delegated to systems.
 - **Communion and Political Order:** Effects of technical systems on communities, liturgical rhythms, and practices.
 - **Eschatology and hope:** Implicit in critiques of "progress" and calls for alternative technological imaginations.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):**
 - Winner compels theologians to see technologies as moral agents that shape human vocation: responsible stewardship requires attending to the politics embedded in our artifacts and to the communal formations they create.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear, provocative thesis: "artifacts have politics" - design choices encode social orders.
 - Coined/ popularized **technological somnambulism** as a moral-political diagnosis of contemporary habitual unawareness.
 - Focus on the materiality of power rather than purely institutional or ideological analysis.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Against technological determinism: rejects the idea that technology imposes a single inevitable social outcome.
 - Against simplistic social constructivism: insists that social meanings do not exhaust the causal/political work of artifacts; material arrangements can shape options and constraints.
 - Extends themes from Ellul and Heidegger but situates them within pluralist democratic concerns rather than solely metaphysical critique.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Artifacts have politics," "politics of design," "technical politics," and "technological somnambulism" as portable analytic tools.
 - Emphasis on **delegation** - how tasks, responsibilities, and authority are assigned to objects and systems.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited in theology of technology, political theology, environmental ethics, and practical theology.
 - Adopted by theologians interested in stewardship, vocation, and ecclesial practices to analyze how church forms are shaped by material technologies.
 - Used as a corrective to overly spiritualized treatments of sin and virtue by redirecting attention to material-mediational contexts.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a durable framework for discussing the ethics and politics of design.
 - Useful pedagogically to bridge technical studies and theological reflection on power, responsibility, and community.
 - Stimulates concrete case-study work (infrastructure, algorithmic governance, agricultural technologies) grounded in normative concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Artifacts have politics:** Design features and arrangements can embody political relations.
- **Technical politics:** The systematic political effects emergent from technological systems.
- **Technological somnambulism:** Social habit of unthinking acceptance of technological change.
- **Delegation:** The process by which tasks and authority are assigned to non-human artifacts.
- **Material politics:** Focus on how material forms (bridges, networks, machines) structure social possibilities.
- **Infrastructures / large technical systems:** Durable, wide-ranging systems that shape public life and choices.
- **Politics of design:** Ethical-political implications inherent in design decisions.
- **Autonomous technologies:** Technologies that appear to operate beyond direct human oversight, raising questions of agency and responsibility.
- **Social constructivism (criticized):** The view that technologies' meanings and effects are entirely socially produced; Winner nuances this by reintroducing material constraints.
- **Technological determinism (rejected):** The claim that technology unilaterally determines social arrangements; Winner argues for a mediated, contestable relation.
- **Sociotechnical imagination:** A theological-ethical lens for envisioning alternative technological orders.
- **Idolatry of technology:** The theological concern that technology becomes an object of trust/authority rivaling God and communal norms.
- **Civic prudence:** A normative aim implicit in Winner - cultivating public deliberation and wisdom about technologies.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "politics of technology" in political theology and ethics courses.
- As a **polemic/tool** against naive technological progress narratives in environmental and ecclesial contexts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for case studies in liturgical, ecological, and social ethics - mapping how material forms shape practices and responsibilities.
