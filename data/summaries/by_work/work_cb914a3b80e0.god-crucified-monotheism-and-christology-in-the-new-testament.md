### TITLE
God Crucified: Monotheism and Christology in the New Testament - Richard Bauckham (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1998)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century New Testament scholarship; reaction to models that read early Christology as a gradual elevation from "mere human" Jesus to divine status.
 - Bauckham (Anglican New Testament scholar) writes within a canon-sensitive, historically informed exegetical milieu; engages Second Temple Jewish monotheism debates and contemporaneous scholars (cf. Hurtado, Dunn, Sanders).
 - **Site usage:** concentrates on the Biblical basis - OT and NT evidence for the revelation of the Trinity and the divine identity attributed to Jesus.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament portrays Jesus as the one God (Yahweh) without abandoning Jewish monotheism: earliest Christology is already **high** - Jesus is identified with God and receives worship accordingly.
 - The doctrinal problem addressed: how can devotion to Jesus be reconciled with first‑century Jewish monotheism?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of key NT corpora (Pauline letters, Johannine literature, Hebrews, Revelation) showing:
 - Titles and predicates normally reserved for Yahweh (kyrios, theos, divine functions) applied to Jesus.
 - OT passages and Yahweh texts are re‑applied to Jesus in ways that presuppose identity, not mere similarity.
 - Practices of prayer, worship, hymnic ascription in early communities directed to Jesus.
 - Interprets these phenomena as evidence that early Christians conceived Jesus as the one God who had acted in Israel - a **Yahweh-Christology** compatible with monotheism.
 - Polemically rejects evolutionary/developmental reconstructions that posit a low Christology developing into a high one only after the resurrection/ascension.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary texts: OT -> NT intertextuality (Isaiah, Psalms, etc.), Paul, John, Hebrews, Revelation.
 - Interlocutors include proponents of developmental Christology and scholars emphasizing Jewish monotheism; engages, implicitly and explicitly, debates represented by Hurtado, Dunn, and others.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (divinity of Christ, Sonship), monotheism, revelation, worship, incarnation as implied by divine identity, canonical method in theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Bauckham contends that the New Testament presents a **monotheistic** worship of Jesus in which Jesus is confessed and addressed as the one God (Yahweh) revealed in Scripture - thus early Christian faith from the start is both unabashedly christological and irrevocably monotheistic.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses continuity rather than rupture: high Christology is intrinsically consistent with Second Temple Jewish monotheism.
 - Uses a sustained **Yahweh‑Christology** thesis: Jesus is referred to and functions as the one God of Israel in NT texts.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges "low-to-high" models that see divine status as a late, Hellenizing accretion.
 - Counters readings that treat early worship of Jesus as necessarily polytheistic or syncretistic.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear framing of NT claims as *identification* (Jesus = Yahweh) not merely *adoption* or *functional parallelism*.
 - Emphasizes the role of OT citation and authorial intent in conferring divine identity on Jesus.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and academic circles; catalyzed renewed attention to early Christian worship studies (parallel to Hurtado's work).
 - Provoked methodological critique (questions about force of intertextual evidence, diversity of early Christian belief) but generally elevated the standard for arguing for early high Christology.

- **Enduring value**
 - A rigorous exegetical model for integrating OT and NT theology.
 - A resource for systematic and historical theologians defending the compatibility of monotheism and christological worship.
 - Stimulates fresh work on early Christian devotion, titles, and the doctrinal contours of the Trinity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Monotheism**
 - Bauckham: first‑century Jewish monotheism is robust but flexible enough to include divine action in and through a human figure without collapsing into polytheism.

- **Yahweh‑Christology**
 - Key label for the claim that NT authors apply Yahweh‑language and roles directly to Jesus.

- **High Christology**
 - The thesis that earliest Christians attributed full divine status to Jesus (prevalent, not later development).

- **Kyrios (Lord)**
 - Used as a divine title drawn from Septuagint usage for Yahweh when applied to Jesus.

- **Theos (God)**
 - Predicate sometimes ascribed to Jesus; Bauckham handles occurrences contextually to show identity rather than metaphorical usage.

- **OT citations / intertextuality**
 - Methodological hinge: explicit NT reuse of OT texts to transfer Yahweh‑descriptions to Jesus.

- **Worship / prayer / hymnody**
 - Liturgical evidence (prayer, doxologies, baptismal/traditional hymns) as indicators of early divine devotion to Jesus.

- **Revelation of the Trinity (OT & NT)**
 - The book contributes to the biblical basis for understanding how NT revelation of God includes the risen Jesus as the divine revealer.

- **Identification vs. Function**
 - Distinguishes identity language (Jesus = Yahweh) from purely functional or role‑based language (Jesus acting like God).

- **Incarnation / Divinity of Jesus**
 - Treats incarnation implicitly as the historical locus of divine presence in Christ in NT witness.

- **Canonical reading / theological method**
 - Uses the canon (OT->NT continuity) as an interpretive principle for doctrinal claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "christological monotheism" and Yahweh‑Christology in systematic and biblical theology.
- As a **polemic** against developmental/low‑Christology reconstructions of early Christianity.
- As an **exegetical model** for OT-NT intertextual readings that ground christological and Trinitarian claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary Trinitarian retrievals that insist on biblical continuity with Jewish monotheism.
