### TITLE
The Plan of Salvation - Charles Hodge (article)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-19th century Princeton theology; Hodge writes from classical Reformed/Presbyterian orthodoxy within the American republican and Enlightenment-influenced era. Reaction against Arminianism, revivalism, and speculative theologies; method combines biblical exegesis, systematic dogmatics, and polemic.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to set forth the biblical order and divine ground of redemption: how God alone plans and accomplishes salvation while Scripture teaches human responsibility - i.e., the relation of divine sovereignty (election, decree) to effectual calling and human faith.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - God's eternal counsel provides the foundation (decree, Covenant of Redemption as a conceptual framework).
 - The work of Christ as the central, efficacious element (penal substitution, federal headship).
 - Application of redemption proceeds in ordered stages: call (external and internal), regeneration (sovereign, immediate), faith and repentance (effects of regeneration), justification (imputation of Christ's righteousness), sanctification, perseverance, and final glorification.
 - Distinguishes common/ preparatory blessings from saving, effectual grace; rejects views that make salvation dependent on middle knowledge or human autonomous foreseen faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and Calvin as primary forebears; contemporary opponents include Arminians, Molinists (via critique of middle knowledge), and revivalist/New School theologians; Hodge dialogues with confessional Reformed standards and the biblical text.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and Scripture as norm; Trinity (especially intra-Trinitarian planning), Christology (substitutionary atonement, incarnation as necessary), federal theology (covenant of works/grace), election and predestination, effectual calling and regeneration, justification by faith, sanctification, common vs. saving grace, providence.
- **Closing line:** Hodge's Plan of Salvation centers on **God's sovereign, covenantal initiative** in redemption expressed in Christ and applied by effectual grace, preserving both divine sovereignty and human culpability without capitulating to conditional or semi-Pelagian alternatives.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **efficacy of divine decree** and the logical primacy of God's plan in redemption (often framed in covenantal language).
 - Careful technical distinction between **common/preparatory grace** and **effectual/saving grace**.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit rejection of **Molinism and middle knowledge** as inconsistent with Scripture's portrayal of absolute divine sovereignty and predestination.
 - Polemic against Arminian anticipations of prevenient grace that make salvation contingent on foreseen human choice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not novel inventions so much as **systematic clarifications**: clear bifurcation of calling into external (general) and internal (effectual), and reiterated use of federal categories to explain application of redemption.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in Princeton Seminary and conservative Reformed circles; helped shape American Presbyterian teaching on salvation and the vocabulary of effectual calling and preparatory grace.
 - Critiqued by Arminians, Molinists, and later neo-evangelicals for perceived determinism or insufficient pastoral nuance.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact, theologically rigorous model for teaching the logical order of salvation from a classical Reformed standpoint; valuable for polemical clarity and historical-theological study of 19th-century American Calvinism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Election:** unconditional, grounded in God's eternal counsel; not based on foreseen faith.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** conceptual intra-Trinitarian agreement that grounds the plan of salvation (Hodge treats it as a helpful framework).
- **Covenant of Grace:** the historical and covenantal unfolding of redemption in promise and sacraments.
- **Penal Substitution (Atonement):** Christ's vicarious death satisfying divine justice; central to Hodge's scheme.
- **Regeneration:** sovereign, instantaneous work of the Spirit producing spiritual life; precedes and enables faith.
- **Calling (external vs internal/effectual):** preaching summons vs. Spirit's inward, efficacious summons producing conversion.
- **Faith (instrumental):** a gift and the instrumental means by which justification is received; not meritorious.
- **Justification:** forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness received by faith alone.
- **Sanctification:** progressive work of the Spirit following justification; distinct from justification's forensic character.
- **Perseverance:** assured for the elect; fruit of God's preserving grace.
- **Common Grace:** non-saving benefits of God's goodness that restrain sin and sustain society; distinguished from saving/preparatory grace.
 - **Preparatory Grace:** limited, non-saving operations that dispose non-elect toward moral good but do not effect salvation.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism:** Hodge rejects the Molinist scheme (middle knowledge) as incompatible with biblical predestination and divine sovereignty.
- **Providence:** God's governance of means and circumstances to accomplish the plan of salvation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **systematic-definition source** for Reformed articulations of the order of salvation (ordo salutis) and distinctions between kinds of grace.
 - As a **polemic model** against Molinism and Arminian accounts of prevenient grace, often cited in debates over middle knowledge and conditional election.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for interpreting Pauline soteriology (election, calling, justification) within covenantal and federal theology.
