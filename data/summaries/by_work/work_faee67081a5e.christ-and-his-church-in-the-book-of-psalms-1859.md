### TITLE
Christ and His Church in the Book of Psalms (1859) - Andrew A. Bonar

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑19th century Scottish evangelical context; pastor-theologian writing for pulpit and devotional use.
 - Situated within the Reformed/Puritan interpretive tradition and a pre‑critical, typological hermeneutic of the Psalms.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Psalms are fundamentally Messianic and ecclesial: they portray Christ in both his **active** and **passive obedience** and reveal the believer's union with him.
 - Bonar aims to show how the Psalter teaches Christ's work as the ground of believers' status and experience.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Expository, psalm‑by‑psalm readings that draw prophetic interpretations: many psalms are read as direct or typical testimonies concerning Christ and his church.
 - Two interlocking emphases:
 - Christ as the obedient Servant‑King whose perfect law‑keeping (active obedience) secures righteousness for the elect.
 - Christ as the suffering Redeemer whose sufferings and death (passive obedience) accomplish penal atonement.
 - Recurrent pastorally oriented application: the believer's consolation and identity flow from Christ's accomplished obedience and suffering.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: the biblical text (Psalter); interpretive lineage in Puritan and Reformed writers (implicit debt to Owen, Sibbes, Calvinic tradition).
 - Counterpoint implicitly addressed: contemporary exegetical trends that demythologize or desacralize Messianic readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (twofold obedience, royal and suffering motifs)
 - Soteriology (atonement, imputation, justification)
 - Covenant theology (federal headship, corporate union)
 - Ecclesiology (church as bride/body, corporate reception of Christ's righteousness)
 - Typology and biblical theology (prophecy in poetry)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Bonar's Psalter reading centers on the conviction that the life, sufferings, and obedience of Christ, foreshadowed in the Psalms, are the covenantal ground of the church's forgiveness, righteousness, and consolation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistent pairing of **active** and **passive obedience** as both revealed and rehearsed in the Psalms - not merely moral example nor only suffering.
 - High corporate reading: the Psalms teach not isolated private piety but the church's shared standing in Christ.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against moralistic or purely devotional readings that reduce Messianic passages to ethical lessons.
 - Opposes emerging critical tendencies that strip the Psalms of prophetic fulfillment in Christ; reasserts their prophetic‑typological coherence.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - While not inventing terms, Bonar systematizes how Messianic prophecy in poetic form instructs doctrines of imputation, union, and obedience-treating lyrical theology as doctrinally robust.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Popular among 19th‑century evangelicals and preachers as a devotional and homiletical guide to Christ in the Psalms.
 - Less cited in modern critical scholarship but retained in Reformed devotional and pastoral literature as a classic Christocentric reading of the Psalter.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a sustained, pastorally sensitive Christ‑centred hermeneutic.
 - Valuable for teaching federal/forensic doctrines (imputation, active/passive obedience) through poetic and pastoral exegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's positive, law‑fulfilling righteousness as manifested in royal and priestly life; imputed to believers as ground of justification and sanctification.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and penal death; expiatory element emphasized in psalmic lament and passion‑predictions.
- **Typology**
 - The Psalter as prophetic types and foreshadows; Davidic and royal figures prefigure Gospel reality.
- **Messianic Psalm(s)**
 - Psalms read as directly prophetic of Christ's person and work (e.g., royal/servant motifs).
- **Union with Christ**
 - Corporate and juridical union; believers share in Christ's obedience and sufferings by covenantal representation.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of Christ's obedience (active) and righteousness to believers; recurring explanatory key for Pauline parallels.
- **Atonement / penal substitution**
 - Read into psalmic language of suffering, forgiveness, and vindication; Bonar uses Psalms to illustrate penal dimensions.
- **Covenant / federal headship**
 - Christ as federal head whose acts secure covenant blessings for the church.
- **Church as Bride/Body**
 - Ecclesiological motifs in the Psalms applied to corporate identity and consolation.
- **Royal/Servant motifs**
 - Dual motifs in Psalms that map onto Christ's kingly rule and servant suffering.
- **Psalms as prophetic**
 - The Psalter is treated as Scripture's prophetic hymnbook, not merely liturgy.
- **Exegetical piety**
 - Method that fuses careful reading with devotional preaching; exegetical ends linked to pastoral care.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: frequently cited for pastoral articulation of **active/passive obedience**.
 - Exegetical model: used as a model for Christocentric, typological reading of the Old Testament Psalter.
 - Polemic/resource: leveraged in pastoral refutations of liberal or purely moralistic interpretations of Messianic texts.
