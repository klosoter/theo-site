### TITLE
The Sabbath: A Sign of Hope - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in Pressing Toward the Mark

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed theological conversation; Gaffin writes from a conservative covenantal/Reformed milieu concerned with law-gospel relations, eschatology, and ecclesial practice. Presented in a festschrift context (Pressing Toward the Mark) addressing pastoral and doctrinal renewal.
- **Central thesis:** The Sabbath functions primarily as a covenantal *sign of hope* - a creational-covenantal sign that both grounds vocation under God and anticipates the eschatological rest realized in Christ. It therefore regulates Christian work and worship without collapsing into either mere ceremonialism or narrow moralism.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes the Sabbath's creational roots (Genesis 2) and its codification as a covenant sign (Exodus 20; Deut. material).
 - Treats Sabbath as a sign analogous to other covenant signs (e.g., circumcision): it signifies a relationship and points forward to covenant fulfillment.
 - Employs New Testament exegesis (esp. Hebrews' theme of "rest," Jesus as Lord of the Sabbath, Pauline treatments) to trace the Sabbath's fulfillment in Christ and its eschatological horizon.
 - Applies theological synthesis to vocation and the cultural/dominion mandate: Sabbath constrains and orients human work toward trust, stewardship, and hope in the coming kingdom.
 - Draws practical implications for Christian life and church ordering without insisting on a single praxis model for contemporary Sunday observance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Gen, Exod, Deut, Isaiah, Hebrews, Gospels, Paul); Reformed historical resources (Calvinian and post-Calvinian exegesis implicit); contemporary sabbatarian debates-both strict Puritan sabbatarians and those who treat the Sabbath as entirely abrogated or merely moralized.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology, creation, law (moral/ceremonial distinction), Christology (fulfillment and lordship), eschatology (rest), ecclesiology (Lord's Day), vocation and cultural mandate.
- **Closing line:** The Sabbath is a covenantal sign that disciplines vocation and cultivates hope by pointing present worship and work to the consummate rest achieved in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong integration of Sabbath theology with the cultural/dominion mandate: Sabbath is not merely negative restraint but formative of vocation and stewardship.
 - Emphasizes the Sabbath primarily as *sign* (relational, anticipatory) rather than only as legal obligation or optional pious custom.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Pushes back on two common errors: (1) reducing the Sabbath to a mere ceremonial relic abrogated by Christ, and (2) reducing it to a utilitarian moral day divorced from its covenantal and eschatological significance.
 - Mediates between strict Puritan sabbatarianism and laissez-faire Lord's Day practice by prioritizing theological function over uniform liturgical prescription.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Frames Sabbath as a governance-shaping sign that disciplines cultural labor under eschatological hope - bridging liturgy and vocation language.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued among Reformed theologians and pastors for marrying rigorous exegesis with pastoral application; often cited in discussions about Sunday observance, the law in the New Covenant, and Christian cultural engagement.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a concise model for thinking about the Sabbath that preserves biblical continuity (creation, Sinai, Christ) while yielding constructive guidance for contemporary Christian practice and cultural vocation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sabbath:** The seventh-day rest instituted at creation, codified as covenant sign; for Gaffin, a present sign pointing to eschatological fulfillment.
- **Sign (covenantal sign):** A visible token marking a covenant relationship and pointing forward to its promises (contrast with sacramentality in nuance).
- **Hope:** Eschatological expectation that the Sabbath sign evokes - trust in God's consummating rest in Christ.
- **Rest / Sabbath-rest:** Theologically layered: creational rhythm, covenant promise, and consummated rest in Christ (Hebrews 3-4).
- **Creation ordinance:** The Sabbath's grounding in Genesis that gives it universal theological weight beyond mere ritualism.
- **Covenant theology:** Framework used to read Sabbath as part of God's dealings with his people across redemptive history.
- **Law (moral/ceremonial distinction):** Gaffin navigates the distinction by seeing the Sabbath as a sign tied to the covenantal administration of law without reducing it to mere ceremony.
- **Lord of the Sabbath:** Christological claim (Jesus' authority over Sabbath) that grounds its fulfillment in him.
- **Eschatology:** The horizon that gives the Sabbath its true meaning - present practice shaped by future consummation.
- **Vocation / Dominion / Cultural mandate:** Human calling to steward creation; Sabbath orders and limits that calling so it remains covenantally oriented and hope-filled.
- **Typology:** The Sabbath as typological indicator pointing forward to Christ and the new creation.
- **Sabbatarianism (moderated):** Gaffin's approach supports a disciplined Lord's Day shaped by theological significance rather than uniform legalism.
- **Lord's Day:** New-covenant practice that inherits Sabbath theology and expresses it in Christian worship.
- **Practical theology:** Application involves church ordering and cultural ethics shaped by Sabbath-sign hope.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a covenantal, eschatologically-oriented understanding of Sabbath theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against both abolitionist and purely moralistic treatments of the Sabbath.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Sabbath texts in continuity from Genesis through Hebrews.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking liturgy/worship practice to vocation and the cultural/dominion mandate.
