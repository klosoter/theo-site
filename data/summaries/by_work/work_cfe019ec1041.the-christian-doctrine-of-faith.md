### TITLE
The Christian Doctrine of Faith - Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestantism; leader of the Ritschlian school. Reaction against speculative metaphysics (Hegelian system) and pietistic subjectivism; influenced by Kantian epistemology and historical-critical methods.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Faith is a moral-practical trust in God's redemptive purpose realized in history through Christ and sustained by the Christian community, not a metaphysical cognition or private feeling.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology must be grounded in *value-judgments* (Werturteile) about the highest good rather than speculative theorizing.
 - Revelation is historical: God acts in history (primarily in Christ); faith is a response to these historical acts.
 - Christ's work is to reconcile humanity to the moral order of God and to found a reconciled community (church) in which faith is formed and maintained.
 - The Holy Spirit functions as the power effectuating and sustaining the community's faith rather than as an ontological indwelling account independent of communal life.
 - Scripture is authoritative as the community's historical witness, not as an inerrant repository of metaphysical propositions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian categories, opposes Hegelian metaphysics, distances from Schleiermacher's pietism; anticipates critiques by Karl Barth and neo-orthodoxy; dialogues with contemporary historical-critical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Christology (mission and work of Christ), pneumatology (Spirit as communal power), soteriology (reconciliation), anthropology (psychosomatic unity), bibliology (inspiration and authority), nature and task of theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl centers faith in the communal recognition of God's historical, moral reconciliation in Christ - theology as a value-oriented science of the Christian community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Faith as ethical trust and communal praxis rather than intellectual assent or metaphysical union; theology as normative for the church's life.
 - Priority of *historical acts* of God over metaphysical descriptions of divine essence.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects forensic, metaphysical accounts of atonement and imputed juridical righteousness typical of classical Protestant scholasticism.
 - Counters Schleiermacher by moving from private feeling to communal ethical judgment; opposes Hegel by denying system-building metaphysics.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of *value-judgment* (Werturteil) as epistemic foundation for theology.
 - Reframing inspiration: Scripture as historically conditioned witness whose authority rests in its relation to the community's faith-formation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in liberal Protestantism, social-ethical theology, and historical-critical approaches; fiercely criticized by neo-orthodoxy (Barth) for reducing divine revelation to human moral categories.
 - Sparked sustained debate over the objectivity of revelation, the nature of justification, and the social locus of faith.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the social-ethical shape of faith; valuable for studies in theological method, bibliology, and the relationship of history and doctrine; a corrective to purely speculative or purely subjective accounts of faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (Glauben)** - moral trust in God's historical reconciliation; communal rather than merely individual.
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)** - normative cognitive category grounding theology; distinguishes theological knowledge from speculative cognition.
- **Revelation (historical revelation)** - God's self-disclosure primarily in historical acts culminating in Christ; contrasted with metaphysical revelation.
- **Christ as reconciler** - emphasis on Christ's moral and historical office to realize God's will and found the reconciled community.
 - Contrasts with forensic imputation and metaphysical Christologies.
- **Holy Spirit** - the power operative within the Christian community that sustains faith and life; pneumatology oriented to ecclesial function.
- **Scripture / Inspiration** - historically conditioned witness; authoritative for the community's life but not verbally inerrant.
- **Theology (task and method)** - normative, practical discipline rooted in religious value-judgments; empirical-historical orientation.
- **Anthropology (psychosomatic unity)** - rejects trichotomy; human person treated as an integrated psychosomatic agent within ethical relations.
- **General vs Special Revelation** - general gives moral orientation; special revelation is historical and Christocentric.
- **Kenosis critiques** - skeptical of speculative kenotic metaphysics; favors description of Christ's self-limitation as historical and moral expression.
- **Pactum salutis / Covenant language** - tends to reinterpret covenantal ideas morally and communally rather than as juridical covenants with legal imputation.
- **Role of spirits in Christ's ministry/resurrection** - Spirit understood as the dynamic of God's reconciling activity manifest in Christ's ministry and the church's life.

How this work is used across loci:
- Employed as a **methodological prime source** for theology defined by value-judgments and historical revelation.
- Used polemically against **forensic/inerrantist models** of justification and bibliology.
- Serves as an **exegetical-model resource** for readings that emphasize Christ's historical mission and the church's ethical witness.
