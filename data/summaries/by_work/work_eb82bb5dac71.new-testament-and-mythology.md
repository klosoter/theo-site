### TITLE
**New Testament and Mythology** (Rudolf Bultmann, 1941; in Kerygma and Myth)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Wartime Germany (1941); postliberal, dialectical theology milieu; mature fruit of form criticism and engagement with Heideggerian existentialism.
 - Published in Hans Werner Bartsch, ed., Kerygma and Myth, with responses; emblematic of mid-20th c. Protestant hermeneutics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The NT proclaims the saving act of God in Christ in mythological categories (ancient three-decker cosmos, spirits, miracles). Modern people cannot, and need not, accept that world-picture. The task is **demythologizing**: interpret the myth existentially so that the **kerygma** confronts hearers with a call to decision before God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: The NT world-picture is mythic and incompatible with modern scientific consciousness.
 - Definition: Myth speaks of transcendence in objectifying, cosmological terms; its truth is not in the picture but the existential claim it makes.
 - Proposal: Demythologizing is not subtraction but hermeneutical interpretation that uncovers the **existential self-understanding** to which the kerygma summons.
 - Christ event: The cross as historical execution confronts us, in the preached word, with God's judgment and grace; the **resurrection** is not a brute historical datum for Historie but an eschatological event disclosed in proclamation and faith.
 - Eschatology: The apocalyptic imagery points to **eschatological existence now**; the end meets the person in the present call of the gospel.
 - Faith and decision: Authentic existence arises as the Spirit uses the kerygma to free from inauthenticity (self-reliance, anxiety, guilt) to trustful obedience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Heidegger (Dasein, authenticity), history-of-religions school, form criticism (Wrede, Dibelius).
 - As foils: Classic liberal moralism (Ritschl), conservative supranaturalism/inerrancy, salvation-history syntheses later by Cullmann and Pannenberg; Barth in part (on history and objectivity).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology**: Word of God as event in proclamation; Scripture as witness needing interpretation.
 - **Christology**: The kerygma's Lord encountered in faith; preexistence and miracles de-objectified as mythic forms.
 - **Soteriology**: Justification as existential liberation by the Word; sin as inauthentic existence; grace as new self-understanding before God.
 - **Eschatology**: Realized in decision; parousia and judgment interpreted existentially.
 - **Ecclesiology/Sacraments**: Church as kerygmatic community; sacraments as enacted word rather than carriers of supernatural substance.
 - **Covenant/History**: Suspicion of Heilsgeschichte as objectifying myth; focus on existential encounter over redemptive-historical sequence.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **God addresses the person in the kerygma of the crucified-and-raised Lord, demanding faith now; demythologizing serves this offense by removing pseudo-scandal and exposing the real scandal.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Demythologizing as positive hermeneutical program, not skeptical reduction.
 - Existential interpretation of the NT as proclamation calling to authentic existence before God.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against liberal moralism: retains the scandal of the cross and the urgency of decision, not mere ethics or ideas.
 - Against supranaturalism: rejects dependence on premodern cosmology and evidentialist appeals to miracle.
 - Against salvation-history systems: resists objectifying God's act into a chain of publicly verifiable events.
 - Nuanced critique of Barth: appreciates Word-event yet disputes the stress on historical objectivity of resurrection.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Myth as world-picture vs truth as existential claim.
 - Historie vs Geschichte distinction in soteriological claims.
 - Word of God as event in proclamation; faith as decision.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Sparked the Kerygma-and-Myth debate; shaped the New Hermeneutic (Fuchs, Ebeling).
 - Reformed and evangelical responses: critical but engaged (Berkouwer on Scripture and Christology; Ridderbos on Paul; Cullmann and Pannenberg with salvation-history correctives; Moltmann and Jenson on trinitarian history; evangelical apologetics demurred on dehistoricizing the resurrection).
 - Catholic engagements (Rahner's transcendental method; Balthasar's dramatic history) offered alternative integrations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forces clarity about genre, worldview translation, and the difference between gospel's offense and antiquated cosmology.
 - Ongoing stimulus for homiletics, hermeneutics, and critical-realist discussions of Scripture and history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologizing (Entmythologisierung)**: Hermeneutical reinterpretation of mythic language to disclose existential meaning.
- **Myth**: Ancient world-picture objectifying transcendence (demons, miracles, cosmic dualism); a vehicle, not the content itself.
- **Kerygma**: The preached message in which God addresses and encounters the hearer; locus of salvation's efficacy.
- **Existential interpretation**: Reading Scripture in terms of self-understanding, decision, authenticity before God.
- **Decision (Entscheidung)**: The moment faith responds to the Word; center of eschatological encounter.
- **Faith**: Trustful openness created by the Word, not assent to premodern cosmology or historical proofs.
- **Historie vs Geschichte**:
 - Historie: critical, empirical history.
 - Geschichte: history-as-significance, event-in-encounter; locus of resurrection talk.
- **Eschatological existence**: The end realized now in the call of the gospel; judgment/grace experienced in the present.
- **Word-event**: God's act occurs in proclamation; Scripture witnesses to this event.
- **Authentic/inauthentic existence**: Heideggerian frame recast theologically; sin as inauthentic self-reliance, salvation as authenticity before God.
- **Form criticism**: Method exposing early church proclamation forms; supports demythologizing aims.
- **Heilsgeschichte**: Salvation-history construct that Bultmann resists as re-mythologizing objectification.
- **Miracle**: Interpreted as mythic idiom for God's claim, not supranatural interruption to be proved.
- **Resurrection**: Eschatological proclamation-event grounding faith, not a neutral fact for Historie to certify.
- **World-picture (Weltbild)**: Cultural-cognitive framework; mutable and not identical with revelation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Bibliology: Clarifies Scripture as witness demanding hermeneutical translation; cautions against conflating revelation with ancient cosmology.
 - Christology and Soteriology: Serves as foil and stimulus to articulate the historical objectivity and saving efficacy of Christ's work.
 - Eschatology: Provokes accounts that integrate already/not yet without collapsing into mere existentialism.
 - Ecclesiology/Sacraments: Encourages kerygmatic focus in preaching and sacramental teaching while testing claims of objective efficacy.
