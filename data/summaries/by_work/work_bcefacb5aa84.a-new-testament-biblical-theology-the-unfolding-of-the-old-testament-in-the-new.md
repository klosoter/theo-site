### TITLE
A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New - Gregory K. Beale

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century (Baker Academic, 2011); emerges from renewed canonical and intertextual approaches to Scripture and from long-standing Reformed interests in typology and covenant continuity.
 - Builds on Beale's earlier magnum opus, The New Testament Use of the Old Testament, and engages contemporary biblical-theological conversations (canonical criticism, inaugurated eschatology, "new perspective" debates).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament must be read as the unfolding and consummation of Old Testament revelation: the person and work of Christ and the life of the church are intelligible only as fulfillment, recapitulation, and transformation of OT types, promises, and structures.
 - Main polemical aim: to resist approaches that treat the OT as either largely irrelevant, merely background, or entirely superseded; to defend robust continuity mediated by fulfillment (not reductive replacement).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: sustained canonical, intertextual, and theological exegesis moving from major OT theological motifs into their NT fulfillment.
 - Major moves:
 - Survey of the OT background motifs (creation, covenant, temple, exile, kingdom, wisdom, sacrificial system, eschatology).
 - Demonstration of how NT writers intentionally read, interpret, and apply OT texts to Jesus, the church, and the new age (typological recapitulation, allusion, citation, midrashic patterns).
 - Theological synthesis: Christ as the cosmic, priestly, kingly, and wisdom figure effecting new-creation and temple-fulfillment; the church as temple/community in the in-between of inaugurated eschatology.
 - Systematic implications for soteriology, ecclesiology, and eschatology (already/not-yet realized eschatology; covenantal continuity).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with canonical critics (Brevard Childs), intertextual theorists, and exegetes in both evangelical and broader academic circles.
 - Interaction with N. T. Wright (on covenant/kingdom and continuity), various Reformed theologians (on covenant theology and typology), and literary-historical critics whom Beale challenges for minimizing OT continuity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant, Christology (cosmic Christ/mediatorial roles), soteriology, eschatology (inaugurated/new creation), ecclesiology (temple-church), typology, Scripture/intertextuality, priesthood, kingdom.

- **Closing line**
 - Beale's theological center of gravity: the New Testament is the hermeneutical apex of the Old - Christ and the church are the realized and unfolding fulfillment of OT revelation, comprehensible only through disciplined canonical and typological reading.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A detailed, conservative-evangelical canonical-intertextual method that marries rigorous exegesis with theological synthesis.
 - Strong defense of typology and recapitulation as normative exegetical moves in NT interpretation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects minimalist and purely historical-critical treatments that isolate texts from canonical and theological contexts.
 - Challenges views that over-stress discontinuity (e.g., certain liberal or radical "new covenant" readings) while refining traditional supersessionist formulations by emphasizing fulfillment rather than obliteration.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic mapping of multiple OT motifs (temple, creation, wisdom, exile) onto NT christological and ecclesiological claims in a unified theological schema.
 - Clarifies categories such as "typological recapitulation," "fulfillment as transformation," and sustained use of intertextual argumentation as normative theological method.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and Reformed circles as a standard resource for OT-NT continuity; influential in seminary curricula and biblical-theology courses.
 - Respected as a corrective by some critical scholars for its methodological rigor, though interlocutors debate degrees of continuity and theological presuppositions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a dense, exegetically rich model for reading Scripture canonically; indispensable for students wanting a theologically integrated OT-NT reading, especially in Christ-centered and covenantal frameworks.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology**
 - NT events and persons are real patterns (types) in the OT fulfilled and recapitulated in Christ; typology is normative hermeneutic.

- **Intertextuality**
 - The NT's theological content arises from deliberate engagement with OT language, imagery, and structure (citations, allusions, echo).

- **Fulfillment**
 - Not merely chronological completion but transformation and consummation of OT promises in Christ and the new covenant.

- **Recapitulation**
 - Christ re-presents and resolves OT histories and institutions (e.g., temple, priesthood, exodus).

- **Temple motif**
 - Temple as cosmological and soteriological center; Jesus as true temple and the church as temple-community in new-creation terms.

- **New creation / inaugurated eschatology**
 - The kingdom is both present (in Christ's person and work) and future (consummation); NT realizes OT creation/eschatological hopes.

- **Covenant continuity**
 - Emphasis on organic continuity of God's plans across covenants with typological fulfillment shaping development.

- **Wisdom-Christology**
 - Jesus as embodiment and fulfillment of OT wisdom traditions; wisdom motifs used to frame Christ's identity and work.

- **Sacrificial/priestly motifs**
 - Interprets Jesus' death and priestly role as the resolution and fulfillment of sacrificial systems.

- **Kingdom/kingly motif**
 - Davidic, royal expectations recast in Christ as cosmic king.

- **Midrashic sensibility**
 - NT authors employ a midrash-like reading but with theological restraint and canonical purpose.

- **Canonical theology**
 - Scripture must be interpreted within the theological-historical unity of the canon, with NT as interpretive key for OT.

- **How this work is used**
 - As an exegetical model: exemplar for careful OT-NT intertextual exegesis and typological argumentation.
 - As a definition source: clarifies technical categories (typology, fulfillment, recapitulation) for theological and homiletical use.
 - As polemic/resource: used against reductive historical-critical and radical discontinuity approaches; supplies material for Reformed and evangelical teaching on covenant continuity and Christocentric reading.
