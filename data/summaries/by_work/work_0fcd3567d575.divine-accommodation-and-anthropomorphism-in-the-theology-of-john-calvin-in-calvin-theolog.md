### TITLE
Divine Accommodation and Anthropomorphism in the Theology of John Calvin - Richard A. Muller (Calvin Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed-historical scholarship; Muller's contribution to the recovery of Calvin as a learned, scholastically aware theologian rather than a popularizer.
 - Engages modern debates over divine language, revelation, and readings of Calvin by both sympathetic and critical interpreters (including those concerned with open theism and divine condescension).

- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin affirms a robust doctrine of divine accommodation: God communicates in human terms for pedagogical ends, yet Calvin consistently distinguishes this communicative condescension from any literal attribution of human form or passibility to God. Accommodation is epistemic and verbal, not ontological.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological reconstruction of Calvin's usage: surveys Calvin's Institutes and commentaries to isolate key terms and exegetical moves.
 - Analytical distinction between types of language about God:
 - pedagogical accommodation (ad hominem revelation),
 - figurative or sensory language (anthropomorphism/anthropopathism),
 - and Calvin's insistence on analogical, not univocal, predication of divine attributes.
 - Traces Calvin's debt to patristic and scholastic categories while showing his distinctive emphasis on Scripture's pedagogical intentions and limits on speculative theology.
 - polemical correction of readings that collapse accommodation into diminishment of God's perfection or into literal anthropomorphism.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries, sermons).
 - Comparative resources: patristic exegesis, medieval scholastic vocabulary and methods, and modern interpreters (historians of doctrine and systematicians).
 - Implicit interlocutors: those who read Calvin as naive anthropomorphist or as endorsing ontological change in God (relevant to debates with open theism and "process" readings).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics of divine language).
 - Divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, incomprehensibility).
 - Knowledge of God (analogy of being / analogical predication).
 - Pastoral/ethical ends of revelation (instruction, worship formation).
 - Less centrally: Trinity and Christology only insofar as they relate to language about God and redemptive disclosure.

- **Closing line**
 - Muller's central gravity: Calvin presents divine accommodation as a disciplined theological strategy-a didactic, analogical mode of speech that preserves divine transcendence while enabling real, saving knowledge of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes Calvin's careful lexical and conceptual controls: accommodation (condescensio) is communicative and pedagogical, not a metaphysical diminution.
 - Stresses Calvin's consistent appeal to analogy (not anthropomorphism) as the safeguard for orthodox divine theology.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that portray Calvin either as a crude anthropomorphist or as a capitulator to modern anthropocentrism.
 - Contrasts Calvin with both medieval literalizing tendencies and modern theological movements that use divine condescension to justify mutable or anthropomorphic conceptions of God (relevant to critiques of open theism).

- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications**
 - Distinguishes accommodation (accommodatio/condescensio) from anthropomorphism/anthropopathism and from mere metaphor; shows Calvin's nuanced taxonomy of divine speech acts.

- **Reception & influence**
 - Important for contemporary Calvin studies and for systematic treatments of revelation and divine attributes.
 - Widely cited in debates where Calvin is appealed to as either precedent for conditional, human-shaped divine action or as defender of immutable transcendence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a reliable historical-theological template for teaching Calvin on revelation, useful for seminarians and systematicians who must navigate pastoral language about God without sacrificing classical theism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation (accommodatio / condescensio)** - God adapting speech to human weakness; didactic, not ontological.
- **Anthropomorphism** - Scripture's ascription of bodily or human features to God; for Calvin, interpreted analogically or as phenomenological language.
- **Anthropopathism** - Attributing human passions to God in Scripture; Calvin treats such language as condescending, referring to human modes of description.
- **Analogy / analogical predication** - The theological safeguard: words about God are neither univocal nor purely equivocal but analogous to human experience.
- **Incomprehensibility** - God's essence remains beyond full human grasp; accommodation does not annul this.
- **Immutability / simplicity** - Doctrinal limits invoked by Calvin to deny ontological change when God "accommodates."
- **Pedagogy of Scripture** - Calvin's conviction that Scripture intends to teach and sanctify, hence its use of human language.
- **Phenomenal language** - Descriptive speech reflecting human perspective; a key category in Calvin's hermeneutic.
- **Exegetical prudence** - Calvin's rule: weigh literal sense, rhetorical purpose, and doctrinal constraints before ascribing meaning.
- **Condescensio vs. condicio** - Distinguishes voluntary self-lowering (communication) from conditional change in being.
- **Revelation as relational disclosure** - Accommodation serves covenantal, redemptive ends: to call and instruct sinners.
- **Scriptural truth vs. human analogy** - Calvin insists Scripture's truth is not compromised by figurative language.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Calvinian accommodation in courses on revelation and hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic resource** against readings that use Calvin to justify ontological change in God (e.g., certain open theist claims).
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Reformed use of anthropomorphic language in preaching and commentary.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology discussions about how divine transcendence and communicative condescension coexist.
