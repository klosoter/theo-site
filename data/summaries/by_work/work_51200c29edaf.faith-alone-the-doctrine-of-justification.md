### TITLE
Faith Alone: The Doctrine of Justification - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical response to late 20th-21st century debates over justification (New Perspective on Paul, ecumenical dialogues such as the JDDJ, and Roman Catholic claims about faith and works).
 - Aimed at pastors, scholars, and students seeking a robust Protestant defense of sola fide grounded in biblical exegesis and historical theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Justification is a forensic, declarative act of God by which sinners are declared righteous on the basis of Christ's obedience and merit, received through faith alone; this doctrine is essential to the gospel and cannot be collapsed into sanctification or works-based righteousness.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Pauline texts (especially Romans and Galatians) to show justification as forensic and grounded in Christ.
 - Historical-theological defense: tracing Reformers (Luther, Calvin) against medieval and Roman Catholic positions (Trent) and against New Perspective proponents (e.g., N. T. Wright, E. P. Sanders).
 - Systematic corollaries: relation of justification to union with Christ, imputation vs. impartation, role of faith as instrument, and implications for assurance, perseverance, and the Christian life.
 - Practical implications: pastoral application for preaching, assurance, and ethics - works as necessary fruit and evidence, not the basis of justification.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Pauline corpus (Romans, Galatians, Philippians), Reformers (Luther, Calvin), classical theological categories (forensic, imputation).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: New Perspective scholars (e.g., N. T. Wright, E. P. Sanders), Roman Catholic theology as represented in Trent and post-Tridentine commentators, and modern evangelical critics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, union with Christ, imputation)
 - Christology (Christ's active/passive obedience as ground)
 - Doctrine of faith (nature of faith, instrumentality)
 - Assurance and perseverance
 - Brief historical theology (Trent, Reformation)

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner's work asserts that the gospel hinges on a forensic, Christ-grounded justification received by faith alone - any dilution of that forensic character undermines gospel assurance and the Reformation's core.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm insistence on forensic declaration combined with a robust account of union with Christ as the metaphysical basis for imputation.
 - Clear pastoral concern: justification's centrality for assurance and preaching, not merely for abstract doctrinal debate.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects the New Perspective by insisting that Pauline justification is not primarily covenant-membership language reducible to corporate status without forensic content.
 - Contrasts with Roman Catholic paradigms that fuse justification and sanctification or make justification contingent on infused righteousness and cooperative merit.

- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Reaffirms classical Protestant vocabulary (forensic, imputation, sola fide) while engaging contemporary biblical scholarship on first-century Judaism and Pauline usage.
 - Emphasizes faith as trust (fiducia) functioning instrumentally rather than as a meritorious work.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise, scholarly defense of sola fide.
 - Valued by pastors and seminarians for exegetical clarity and pastoral application; used less sympathetically by proponents of NPP or Roman Catholic theologians.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable exegetical resource linking Pauline exegesis to historical doctrine and pastoral practice; a go-to statement for teaching justification in confessional Protestant contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - God's declarative act by which sinners are pronounced righteous through Christ's merit.
- **Forensic / forensic declaration**
 - Legal imagery: God's verdict, not an inner infusion of righteousness.
- **Imputation**
 - Christ's righteousness credited to believers; central ground of the declaration.
- **Impartation**
 - Distinguished from imputation; pertains to sanctification and the Spirit's work in renewing the believer.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological basis that explains how Christ's righteousness is reckoned to believers.
- **Faith (fiducia / instrumentality)**
 - Trust that receives Christ's righteousness; not a human work that earns justification.
- **Works**
 - Necessary as fruit and evidence of genuine faith but not the basis of justification.
- **Active and passive obedience of Christ**
 - Christ's life of obedience (active) and atoning death (passive) together supply the righteousness imputed to believers.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Indexed as a major interlocutor; Schreiner argues NPP collapses forensic content into covenantal membership.
- **Council of Trent / Roman Catholic justification**
 - Summarized contrast: infused righteousness and cooperation vs. forensic imputation.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in the objective declaration of God and Christ's merit rather than subjective feelings or works.
- **Sanctification**
 - Post-justificatory, progressive conforming to Christ distinguished from the one-time declarative act.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for sola fide and forensic justification in Reformed syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against NPP and Roman Catholic accounts in academic and pastoral debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts on justification.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and pastoral counseling on assurance and the relation of faith to works.
