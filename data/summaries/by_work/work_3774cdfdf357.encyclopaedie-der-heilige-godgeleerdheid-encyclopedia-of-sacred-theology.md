### TITLE
**Encyclopaedie der Heilige Godgeleerdheid (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)** - Abraham Kuyper

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century Neo-Calvinism in the Netherlands; Kuyper as churchman-statesman and founder of the Free University of Amsterdam (1880).
 - Published in Dutch (1894; multi-volume); English abridgment, Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology: Its Principles (1898).
 - Written amid modernist claims of religious neutrality in science and historicist criticism of Scripture.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology is a genuine science (wetenschap) with its own principia, object, and method, grounded in special revelation and enabled by regeneration.
 - Because of sin's noetic effects, there exists an antithesis between belief and unbelief; yet, by common grace, meaningful scholarly contact remains.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines encyclopedia as the ordered overview of a discipline's organism; situates theology among the sciences without subsuming it under autonomous reason.
 - Establishes principium essendi (the Triune God) and principium cognoscendi (Holy Scripture, with the Spirit's internal witness) as theology's foundations.
 - Expounds palingenesis (regeneration) and illumination as conditions for true theological knowing; rejects religiously neutral method.
 - Orders the theological disciplines: exegetical (text, canon, hermeneutics), historical (church/historia salutis), systematic (dogmatics, ethics), and practical (apologetics, homiletics, catechetics, liturgics, pastoral).
 - Relates theology to church and university via sphere sovereignty; theology serves the church yet also stands as an academic organism under Christ's lordship.
 - Engages rival models (Schleiermacher's feeling, Kantian autonomy, Ritschlian moralism, Thomist nature-grace synthesis) and proposes a Calvinistic world-and-life-view.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Scripture; Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodox (Voetius); catholic creeds.
 - Critically: Aquinas (nature-grace), Kant, Hegel, Comte, Schleiermacher, Ritschl; modern historicism and positivism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, authority, autopistia); Trinity (as principium essendi); Christology (Christ as Lord of all spheres; Logos); Pneumatology (illumination); Soteriology (palingenesis and noetic renewal); Ecclesiology (church-theology relation); Eschatology (teleology of knowledge and consummation).

- **Center of gravity**
 - A Scripture-normed, Spirit-illumined, Christ-ruled science of God, organized as an organic whole, pursued within a Calvinistic worldview and for the church's vocation in the world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Antithesis and common grace held together: principled difference in ultimate starting points without abandoning scholarly engagement.
 - Palingenesis as epistemic renewal; theology is impossible as theology without spiritual rebirth and illumination.
 - Organic motif: theology as an organism, not a heap of specialties; disciplines interpenetrate under one principium.
 - Sphere sovereignty applied to scholarship: theology neither tyrannizes nor is tyrannized; each science has its God-given sphere under Christ.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against neutral rationalism: denies a value-free science; all inquiry is confessional at root.
 - Against Schleiermacher: resists reducing theology to analysis of pious feeling.
 - Against Thomist synthesis: rejects a hierarchical nature-over-grace ladder that subordinates Scripture's principium to philosophical prolegomena.
 - Against biblicist fragmentation: insists on a disciplined encyclopedia that orders exegesis, dogmatics, history, and practice.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Principium essendi / cognoscendi deployed with internal (Spirit/faith) and external (Scripture) dimensions.
 - World-and-life-view (Weltanschauung) as a scientific starting-point category.
 - Noetic effects of sin operationalized for method, not merely for anthropology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Set the agenda for Neo-Calvinist prolegomena; influenced Bavinck, later Van Til (presuppositionalism), and Reformational philosophy (Dooyeweerd/Vollenhoven).
 - Critiqued for risking two sciences or fideism; defended for its common-grace ballast and public-academic posture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Robust account of Scripture's authority in the university.
 - Framework for integrating theological subdisciplines.
 - Tools for engaging rival worldviews without surrendering confessionality.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Encyclopedia (of theology)**: Ordered map of theological sciences as one organism; prevents fragmentation.
- **Wetenschap (science)**: Discipline with defined object, principia, and method; theology qualifies on its own terms.
- **Principium essendi**: The Triune God as the ontic ground of theology.
- **Principium cognoscendi (externum/internum)**:
 - Externum: Holy Scripture, inspired and authoritative.
 - Internum: Spirit's witness, faith's receptivity, church's confession.
- **Autopistia of Scripture**: Self-authenticating authority of the Word; recognized by Spirit-wrought faith.
- **Palingenesis**: Regeneration that renews the knower; prerequisite for properly theological knowledge.
- **Illumination**: Ongoing Spirit-enabled understanding of revelation distinct from inspiration.
- **Antithesis**: Fundamental opposition of starting points between belief and unbelief.
- **Common grace**: Preserves creation, enables shared cultural-scientific labor despite antithesis.
- **Sphere sovereignty**: Differentiated, coordinated authority of societal spheres; applied to church, academy, state.
- **Organism**: Organic unity of theology and of the sciences; rejects mechanical compartmentalization.
- **Noetic effects of sin**: Sin's corruption of reason and perception; methodological, not merely moral.
- **Calvinistic worldview**: Comprehensive life-system centered on God's sovereignty and Scripture's norm.
- **Church and university**: Theology serves the church while legitimately housed in the academy under its own principia.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - Bibliology: Definitions of inspiration, authority, and Scripture's principia; basis for hermeneutics.
 - Theology proper and Christology: God as principium essendi; Christ's cosmic lordship frames science.
 - Pneumatology and Soteriology: Illumination and palingenesis as epistemic realities.
 - Eschatology and Ethics: Teleology of knowledge toward beatific consummation; public theology within common grace.
