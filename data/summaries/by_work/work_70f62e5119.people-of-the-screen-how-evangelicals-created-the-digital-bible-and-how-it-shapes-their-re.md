### TITLE
People of the Screen: How Evangelicals Created the Digital Bible and How It Shapes Their Reading of Scripture - John Dyer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the 2010s amid the smartphone/app revolution and rise of Bible apps (YouVersion, Logos, BibleGateway).
 - Located at the intersection of evangelical publishing, Silicon Valley design practices, and media studies; addresses late-modern evangelical devotional culture.
- **Central thesis**
 - Evangelicals were instrumental in designing the "digital Bible." The technological choices made by developers, publishers, and institutions are not neutral: they reshape how Scripture is read, understood, and embodied.
 - Digital form factors (screens, search, hyperlinks, analytics) produce distinct hermeneutical outcomes - new habits of reading, authority distribution, and ecclesial formation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical narrative of how evangelical institutions and companies created digital Scripture resources.
 - Analysis of technological affordances (interface design, search, bookmarking, notifications) and their effects on reading practices.
 - Examination of cultural and theological consequences: privatization of Scripture, verse-ism, algorithmic prominence, market logics.
 - Prescriptive reflections on how churches and theologians might attend to design, liturgy, and communal practices to counter deformations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Evangelical organizations and companies: Life.Church/YouVersion, Faithlife/Logos, BibleGateway, Olive Tree, publishers (Zondervan, Tyndale).
 - Media theorists and digital humanities perspectives (engages media theory implicitly: notions like medium theory and affordances).
 - Ethnographic and design-focused interviews with developers, church leaders, and app-makers.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority: mediation of Scripture through tech and its effects on perceived epistemic access.
 - Hermeneutics and canon: verse-ism, fragmentation vs. narrative context.
 - Ecclesiology and piety: privatized devotional practices, communal reading practices, discipleship shaped by screens.
 - Pastoral theology and mission: analytics and metrics shaping outreach and engagement strategies.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: digital mediation is formative - evangelical commitments and market/design choices together create a Scripture-shaped practice; attending to design and ecclesial formation is necessary to preserve faithful reading.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focuses on evangelical agency: not merely how culture adopted tech, but how evangelicals actively designed and monetized the digital Bible.
 - Interface-level theology: treats UI/UX decisions as theological acts with hermeneutical consequences.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on narratives that treat technology as neutral or only sociologically determined; shows deliberate theological and market choices.
 - Contrasts with purely theological critiques of modernity by grounding changes in concrete design practices rather than abstract cultural forces.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - "People of the screen" as a sociotechnical identity: readers formed by screen-mediated practices.
 - Attention to "verse-ism" and modular scripture as design artifacts that prioritize retrieval over contiguous reading.
 - Treating analytics/metrics as theological instruments shaping ministry priorities.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in digital religion and media-theology circles; cited by seminary courses on digital ministry and by ethicists concerned with tech formation.
 - Influenced conversations among Bible app developers about design ethics, communal features, and the risks of personalization.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a case study linking media studies and theology; durable framework for assessing new mediations (AR/VR, AI-driven exegesis).
 - Practical for pastors, educators, and designers seeking to recover communal, liturgical reading practices in digital contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Digital Bible**
 - The corpus of Scripture as presented through apps, websites, e-texts, with search, hyperlinks, and metadata layered onto the text.
- **People of the screen**
 - Social identity formed by habitual screen-based reading and interaction; a community shaped by devices and interfaces.
- **Interface / UI/UX**
 - Design elements (buttons, layouts, notifications) that mediate how readers encounter and prioritize Scripture.
- **Affordances**
 - What technology enables (searchability, bookmarking) and disables (linear reading, communal pauses); determines possible reading behaviors.
- **Verse-ism**
 - The cultural and hermeneutical tendency to treat discrete verses as primary units of meaning due to digital retrieval and citation habits.
- **Searchability / Hypertextuality**
 - Scripture reduced to retrievable snippets; fosters thematic retrieval over contiguous narrative reading.
- **Personalization / Algorithms**
 - Recommendation engines and tailored content that shape exposure to texts and devotional materials.
- **Metrics / Analytics**
 - Quantitative measures (clicks, reading streaks) used to evaluate engagement and influence ministry decisions.
- **Commercialization**
 - Market logics and monetization strategies embedded in app ecosystems that prioritize engagement and scalability.
- **Privatization of devotional practice**
 - Movement from communal liturgy and public reading to individualized, on-demand scripture consumption.
- **Design ethics**
 - The normative framework arguing that designers and churches should account for theological consequences of interface choices.
- **Modularity**
 - Fragmentation of Scripture into shareable, embeddable units (verses, highlights, reading plans).
- **Connected / Social reading**
 - Features enabling sharing, commenting, and communal plans - potential corrective if designed for ecclesial formation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "digital Bible" and interface theology in media-theology and digital religion studies.
 - As a **polemic/resource** for pastors and ethicists critiquing uncritical adoption of Bible apps and advocating for communal practices.
 - As an **exegetical-model prompt**: warns exegetes to account for medium effects (verse-ism, searchability) when presenting Scripture.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula on technology and ministry design, informing policy, app features, and liturgical renewal.
