### TITLE
"Scripture Speaks Truly Because God Speaks Truly" - John M. Frame, in Revelation and Reason (ed. Paul Helm), 2007.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Essay in a 2007 volume addressing the relation of divine revelation and human reason; situated in contemporary Reformed evangelical debates over biblical authority, accommodation, and the nature of divine speech.
 - Milieu: post-Enlightenment epistemological questions, revived interest in classical Reformed doctrine of revelation, dialogue with analytic philosophy of religion.

- **Central thesis**
 - The truthfulness of Scripture rests ultimately on the truthfulness of God. Because God speaks truly, his accommodated speech to human creatures is not false or misleading; accommodation is analogous to the incarnation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - God as ultimate ground of truth: divine veracity guarantees that God's communicative acts correspond to reality.
 - Definition and defense of accommodation: God condescends linguistically and conceptually to creaturely capacity without introducing error.
 - Incarnational analogy: Christ's becoming human models how the divine can communicate in finite, creaturely terms while remaining fully true and authoritative.
 - Implications for Scripture: accommodates human language and categories but carries propositional content that is reliable, infallible (properly understood), and authoritatively divine.
 - Practical hermeneutical consequences: accommodation explains anthropomorphic and culturally conditioned expressions without surrendering doctrine of inerrancy; requires careful exegesis to distinguish accommodation from doctrinal content.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on classical Reformed figures (e.g., Calvin's notion of accommodation) and modern conservative theologians (e.g., Warfieldian inerrancy themes).
 - Engages contemporary epistemological concerns; implicitly contrasts with liberal-critical readings that reduce Scripture to cultural products and with caricatures of accommodation as mere falsehood.
 - Dialogue with theologians emphasizing revelation-as-event (e.g., Barthian emphases) though Frame keeps propositional content central.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, accommodation, incarnation (as analogy), doctrine of God (veracity), Christology (incarnation used analogically), Scripture (inerrancy/infallibility), hermeneutics/epistemology.

- **Closing line**
 - The essay centers on a compact theological claim: divine condescension in speech-like the incarnation-is a faithful accommodation that preserves truth; therefore Scripture speaks truly because God speaks truly.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong identification of accommodation with the incarnation as the controlling analogy; not merely a loose metaphor but a theological model for understanding divine-language relations.
 - Integration of systematic theology (doctrine of God and Christology) with epistemology of revelation: truthfulness is grounded in God's character rather than in merely linguistic or propositional accounts.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that treat accommodation as license for error or mere human accommodation; rejects both liberal reductions and simplistic literalism that misread cultural tropes.
 - Distinguishes his approach from neither purely propositional fundamentalism nor from Barthian event-only views; defends meaningful propositional content without reducing revelation to detached propositions.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Framing accommodation explicitly as an incarnational analogue for divine speech; emphasizes "divine veracity" as an epistemic ground.
 - Uses "theological epistemology" to name the move of grounding truth-claims in divine attributes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles for clarifying accommodation debates; used in seminary instruction on revelation and hermeneutics.
 - Cited by those defending inerrancy-in-contextualized form and by apologists stressing God-centered epistemology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, teachable model linking incarnation and revelation; durable as both polemical resource and hermeneutical corrective.
 - Useful for guiding exegesis that must balance divine authority and human language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation** - God condescendingly shaping revelation to human capacity; not a watering down or falsification.
 - Contrast: accommodation vs. error (Frame denies the latter).
- **Incarnational analogy** - The model by which divine speech can be both condescending and fully true; Christology serves as the explanatory paradigm.
- **Divine veracity (truthfulness)** - God's moral/ontological attribute that grounds the trustworthiness of his speech and thus Scripture.
- **Divine speech** - The act of God communicating; the immediate source of Scripture's authority and truth.
- **Propositional content** - Frame affirms that revelation carries genuine propositional truth even when delivered in accommodated form.
- **Inerrancy / infallibility** - Scripture's truthfulness is preserved; accommodation must be interpreted so as not to undermine these doctrines.
- **Human authorship** - Human language and culture shape the form of revelation without becoming the ultimate ground of its truth.
- **Hermeneutical implication** - Exegesis must differentiate between culturally conditioned expressions and doctrinal import.
- **Theological epistemology** - Grounding knowledge claims about Scripture in theological doctrine (God's attributes) rather than exclusively in epistemic rules.
- **Condescension** - Theologically neutral term for God's lowering of mode/level of communication to creaturely capacity.
- **Anthropomorphism** - Explained as accommodated language, not literal attribution of human limitations to God.
- **Revelation-as-event vs. propositional** - Frame affirms revelatory events but insists on propositional, reliable content.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the doctrine of accommodation reframed by the incarnational analogy.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal reductionism (Scripture as merely cultural) and caricatures that treat accommodation as doctrinal compromise.
 - As an **exegetical model** guiding interpreters to discern accommodated expressions vs. core propositional claims.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theological epistemology connecting doctrine of God and biblical authority.
