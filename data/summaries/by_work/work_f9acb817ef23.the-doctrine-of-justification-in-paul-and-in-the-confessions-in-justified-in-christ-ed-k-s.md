### TITLE
The Doctrine of Justification in Paul and in the Confessions - Guy Prentiss Waters (essay in Justified in Christ, ed. K. Scott Oliphint, 2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed response (early 21st c.) to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP). Essay appears in a confessional defense volume edited by Oliphint (2007) seeking to show continuity between Pauline doctrine and Reformed confessions.
 - Milieu: evangelical-Reformed scholarship defending forensic imputation against sociocultural and covenantal reinterpretations of Pauline justification (notably E. P. Sanders, J. D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright).
- **Central thesis**
 - Paul's doctrine of justification, properly read, is essentially forensic and imputed and this corresponds to-rather than conflicts with-the confessional formulations of the Reformation (e.g., WCF, Belgic, Heidelberg).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base: close reading of Pauline texts (primarily Romans and Galatians) to establish forensic terminology and courtroom metaphors as Pauline intention.
 - Theological-historical correlation: demonstration that the confessions' language (merits, imputation, declarative act) is a legitimate theological reception and systematization of Paul.
 - Polemic: critique of NPP proposals that read justification as corporate covenant membership or as primarily a statement about covenant status and ethics rather than a forensic declaration regarding guilt and righteousness.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: articulation of how **union with Christ** supplies the ground for the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness (active and passive obedience).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Pauline corpus (esp. Romans, Galatians); secondary: Reformers (Calvin), 17th-century confessions (Westminster Confession of Faith), and modern NPP proponents (Sanders, Dunn, Wright).
 - Uses Reformation theological categories (imputation, merit, forensic declaration) and engages modern exegetical literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic imputation), union with Christ, atonement (active/passive obedience), sanctification vs. justification distinction, covenant theology (covenant of works/ grace), ecclesiology as it relates to imputed status.
- **Closing line**
 - Waters' theological center: Paul's forensic justification (grounded in union with Christ) is not only exegetically defensible but is precisely what the Reformed confessions faithfully articulate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linking of forensic imputation with union with Christ as the *ground* (not alternative) for imputation-keeping both objective legal declaration and relational union together.
 - Careful historical-theological claim that the confessions are recoveries and clarifications of Pauline forensic language, not later distortions.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to the NPP: argues NPP minimizes forensic and individual guilt/righteousness dimensions by over-emphasizing covenantal or corporate categories.
 - Reasserts the necessity of imputation (both Christ's righteousness to believers and believers' sin to Christ) against models that limit atonement to exemplar or transformative functions.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Rehabilitates classical terms (imputation, active/passive obedience) with robust exegetical warrant; resists purely sociological readings of Pauline "works of the law".
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within conservative Reformed and confessional communities as a concise defense of traditional justification doctrine; used in apologetic and catechetical contexts.
 - Less persuasive to NPP-aligned scholars but prompts renewed exegetical engagement on forensic language in Paul.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear model for connecting exegesis and confessional theology; useful for pastors and scholars teaching justification, especially where NPP debates remain current.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification (forensic)** - A declarative, legal verdict by God declaring sinners righteous on account of Christ.
- **Imputation** - The juridical crediting of Christ's righteousness to believers and the charging of believers' sin to Christ.
 - Subnote: includes both *active obedience* (positive righteousness) and *passive obedience* (penal suffering).
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological/relational bond that constitutes the ground whereby imputation is applied.
- **Forensic / Declarative language** - Courtroom metaphors in Paul (justified, acquitted, reckoned) used as central proof texts.
- **Active obedience** - Christ's perfect keeping of the law credited to believers.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering/penal substitution as the counterpart imputed for sin.
- **Covenant theology (works/grace)** - Framework for understanding merit, law, and the sinner's status; used to rebut covenantal-only readings.
- **Works of the law** - Paul's disputed phrase interpreted here as boundary-marking works (circumcision, food laws) and not meritorious works earning salvation.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - The cluster of recent proposals emphasizing covenantal nomism and corporate dimensions; primary target of critique.
- **Declarative verdict vs. transformative sanctification** - Distinction reasserted: justification is forensic verdict, sanctification is progressive renewal.
- **Merit** - Reformed account of Christ's merit as transferrable and ground for imputation.
- **Penal substitution** - Emphasized as central to passive obedience and the transfer of guilt.
- **Confessional texts** - Westminster, Belgic, Heidelberg invoked as faithful explicators of Pauline doctrine.
- **Righteousness (alien/alien imputed)** - Righteousness not intrinsic but alien (from Christ) that God credits to believers.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definitional source for Reformed articulation of justification and imputation.
 - Polemic resource against NPP readings and for reharmonizing exegesis with confessional formulations.
 - Exegetical model linking Pauline courtroom language to sustained doctrinal categories (imputation, union with Christ).
