### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Christian Life - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed evangelical theology; Frame writes as part of his broader "lordship" corpus and tri-perspectival program.
 - Addressed to pastors, seminarians, and theologians seeking a systematic account of ethics, piety, and practical theology within a confessional Reformed horizon.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life is discipleship under the comprehensive lordship of Christ; theology must connect doctrinal truth to concrete moral and spiritual formation.
 - Problem addressed: how to ground Christian ethics, prayer, worship, vocation, and sanctification theologically without collapsing into legalism, antinomianism, relativism, or pietistic privatism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Uses Frame's **triperspectival method** (normative, situational, existential) as the governing methodological framework for all loci of the Christian life.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish scriptural and covenantal norms for obedience and holiness (normative perspective).
 - Apply those norms to concrete situations and structures (situational perspective).
 - Discuss personal appropriation, growth, and experience of sanctification (existential perspective).
 - Treats fundamental ethical topics: law and gospel, virtues and vices, conscience, Christian liberty, vocation, family, church life, worship, sacraments, prayer, spiritual disciplines, suffering, death, and eschatology.
 - Emphasizes means of grace (Word, sacrament, prayer) as formative for Christian character and communal life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Conversation partners include classical Reformed writers (Calvin, Kuyper, Bavinck), Westminster confessional tradition, and modern ethicists and theologians. Recurring engagement with Cornelius Van Til (method), and frequent polemics against modern liberal ethics, situation ethics, pietism, and some streams of evangelical pragmatism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture as normative authority; Trinity and Christology as grounding for prayer, worship, and union with Christ; justification and sanctification; covenant theology and law; sacraments; providence; vocation and social life; eschatology.

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Christian life is theologically disciplined, covenantal obedience and worship under Christ's lordship, integrated by a triperspectival method that unites doctrine and practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic application of **triperspectivalism** to ethics and piety: every moral judgment and spiritual practice is to be viewed normatively (God's Word), situationally (facts and relationships), and existentially (personal appropriation).
 - Strong insistence that **Christ's lordship** governs all dimensions of life (not merely private belief or isolated morality).

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushback against both **legalism** (reducing Christianity to rule-following) and **antinomianism** (denying law's ongoing normative role).
 - Critiques situation ethics and secular moral theory for insufficient grounding in divine authority and for neglecting the existential appropriation of grace.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes triperspectival theory across pastoral and ethical loci, producing new vocabulary for analysing moral cases (e.g., treating conscience through the three perspectives).
 - Reframes vocation and calling as integrated expressions of covenantal obedience rather than mere functional roles.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries as a textbook on Christian ethics and practical theology.
 - Influential among those sympathetic to tri-perspectivalism; critiqued by some for methodological novelty, dense technical style, and strong polemical tone.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a coherent bridge between systematic doctrine and everyday Christian practice.
 - Valuable as a pedagogical tool for pastors and teachers who seek a systematic, confessional account of sanctification, worship, and vocation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Triperspectivalism** - The method that reads every theological and ethical question from three complementary perspectives: normative (God's law/Word), situational (facts/relations), existential (personal appropriation).
- **Lordship of Christ** - Christ's sovereign rule over believers' thinking, willing, and doing; the central organizing principle for the Christian life.
- **Normative / Situational / Existential** - The three poles used to analyze conscience, duty, context, and personal experience.
- **Law and Gospel** - Reformed distinction rearticulated: law governs obedience and reveals sin; gospel gives grace and grounds sanctification without abolishing moral demands.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive transformation by means of grace; treated as corporate and personal under Word and Spirit, not merely subjective growth.
- **Means of Grace** - Word, sacraments, and prayer as vehicles of God's formative presence and sanctifying power.
- **Vocation (calling)** - All legitimate social roles and labors reconceived as arenas for covenantal obedience and worship.
- **Conscience** - Functioning through the three perspectives; formed by Scripture, informed by situational facts, and internalized existentially.
- **Antinomianism / Legalism** - Two opposed errors Frame aims to correct: denial of law's role vs. reduction of Christianity to legal compliance.
- **Covenant** - The relational framework for Christian life, integrating corporate identity, sacrament, and ethical responsibility.
- **Worship & Prayer** - Practices rooted in Trinitarian theology; worship is communal conformity to God's Word, prayer is relational communion with the Triune God.
- **Common vs Special Grace** - Distinction retained for explaining cultural mandate, civil order, and the church's sanctifying life.
- **Practical theology** - Frame's linking discipline; doctrine must inform pastoral practice and ethical decision-making.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed Christian ethics and sanctification (clear, systematic categories).
 - As a **polemic** against situational ethics, secular moral theories, and pietistic privatism.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for applying Scripture to concrete moral and pastoral cases via the triperspectival grid.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating doctrine (Trinity, Christology, covenant) with everyday vocation and worship.
