### TITLE
From Shadow to Substance: The Federal Theology of the English Particular Baptists - Samuel D. Renihan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Focuses on 17th-century English Particular Baptists (mid to late 1600s), especially London circles and the formulation of the 1689 London Baptist Confession.
 - Moves within the broader milieu of post-Reformation English theology: Westminster-derived Reformed debate, Congregationalists/Independents, Presbyterians, and emergent dissenting controversies (Arminianism, Socinianism).
- **Central thesis**
 - Particular Baptists developed a robust, coherent **federal (covenant) theology** that both inheres in Reformed orthodoxy and is adapted to defend distinctive Baptist convictions (notably believer's baptism and regenerate church membership).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates textual and doctrinal continuity between Particular Baptist writings and mainstream Reformed federal theology (covenant of works / covenant of grace).
 - Traces how Baptists reinterpreted covenantal categories to refuse sacramental continuity that legitimized infant baptism while preserving theological continuity in redemptive history.
 - Shows practical ecclesial implications: membership, discipline, sacraments, and church-state relations flow from this adapted federal framework.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: leading Particular Baptist writers (e.g., Hanserd Knollys, William Kiffin, Benjamin Keach), the 1689 London Baptist Confession, later consolidators such as John Gill.
 - Interlocutors: Westminster divines and Paedobaptist writers, Congregationalists/Independents (e.g., Baxter-style mediators), and heterodox critics (Arminians, Socinians).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant theology** (works/grace; occasionally covenant of redemption), baptism and sacramental theology, ecclesiology (visible/particular church; congregational polity), justification and union with Christ, regeneration, and implications for church-state relations.
- **Closing line**
 - Renihan locates Particular Baptists squarely within the Reformed federal tradition while showing how covenant theology was reshaped to make **believer's baptism and a regenerate visible church** the substantive marks of covenant membership.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats covenant primarily as the divinely instituted relation of grace to the elect, not as an ethnopolitical instrument - this reorients signs and membership to personal profession and regeneration.
 - Strong insistence that **administration of covenant signs (baptism)** must correspond to the covenantal reality (i.e., a believing, covenantally-engaged subject).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects paedobaptist conclusions derived from continuity of covenant signs (circumcision -> baptism) while retaining continuity in covenant substance (promises, redemptive history).
 - Refutes charges that Baptists lacked systematic theological resources by demonstrating explicit use of federal categories shared with Westminster and other Reformed sources.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Distinctive framing of the covenantal "administration" vs. covenantal "substance": the sign may differ without abandoning the covenantal substance.
 - Emphasis on a regenerate, volunteering covenant community as the locus of covenant life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Rehabilitated understanding of Particular Baptists in covenant-theology studies; used by historians and theologians to show theological continuity between Baptists and Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Influential in recent Baptist historiography and in broader debates about the boundaries of Reformed tradition.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies doctrinal continuity and divergence; indispensable for teaching on the development of covenant theology, baptismal debates, and dissenting ecclesiology in Restoration England.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant theology / federalism** - central analytic grid used by Particular Baptists to organize soteriology, ecclesiology, and sacramentology.
- **Covenant of works** - retained as a theological category for pre-fall relation and the law, preserved in Baptist treatments analogous to Reformed usage.
- **Covenant of grace** - affirmed as the redemptive covenant; Baptists stress its application to the elect and its administration through faith.
- **Covenant of redemption** - sometimes presupposed in theological argument, used to ground divine intent to redeem the elect.
- **Believer's baptism (credobaptism)** - defended as the proper **administration** of the baptismal sign within the covenant community; testimony to regeneration and profession.
- **Infant baptism (paedobaptism)** - rejected on grounds that covenant sign administration requires personal faith; Baptists maintain continuity of covenant substance but deny continuity of sign to infants.
- **Visible / regenerate church** - Baptist insistence that the visible church should be composed of professing believers with evidence of regeneration.
- **1689 London Baptist Confession** - pivotal documentary locus where federal categories are explicitly reworked in Baptist form.
- **Sacrament as sign, not effectual instrument** - sacramental efficacy is not automatic; linked to covenantal reality of recipients.
- **Congregational polity** - ecclesial implications of federal thought: local, regenerate congregation as covenant community with discipline.
- **Particular redemption (limited atonement)** - compatible with their federal frame; particularism is integrated into covenant soteriology.
- **Redemptive continuity vs. administrative discontinuity** - shorthand for their stance on covenant substance vs. sign.
- **Regeneration / profession as covenant entry** - baptism follows visible profession grounded in regeneration.
- **Church-state relations** - covenantal convictions shape Baptist defense of religious liberty and opposition to coercion.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Baptist appropriation of Reformed covenant categories.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates over paedobaptism vs. credobaptism, showing principled covenantal argumentation.
- As an **exegetical-historical model** for reading 17th-century Baptist texts and the 1689 Confession.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in studies of continuity/divergence within the Reformed tradition.
