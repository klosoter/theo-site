### TITLE
Calvin's Doctrine of the Christian Life (as summarized for research use)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Sixteenth-century Reformation, Geneva as ecclesial laboratory. Calvin writes amid controversies over justification, sacraments, and Christian discipline; audience: pastors, magistrates, and laypeople seeking ordered piety.
 - Theological milieu: Augustinian soteriology renewed against Roman sacramentalism and Pelagian tendencies; dialogue with Luther and other Reformed leaders.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life is not merely moral reform but a single salvific reality: believers are **united to Christ** by the Spirit, experiencing simultaneous *mortification* of sin and *vivification* in newness of life; this union orders personal holiness, corporate worship, sacraments, and social vocation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Problem: human guilt, pollution, and death alienate humanity from God and distort life.
 - Justification and union: forensic justification is inseparable from covenantal union with Christ (imparting a real, progressive sanctification).
 - Double movement of sanctification:
 - **Mortification**: the Spirit effects death to sin; Christian duty to put sin to death.
 - **Vivification**: progressive growth in grace, love, and obedience.
 - Law and Gospel: law convicts and guides; gospel frees and empowers obedience.
 - Means of grace and ecclesial life: preaching, sacraments (esp. baptism and the Lord's Supper), discipline, and pastoral care effect the Christian life.
 - Vocation and society: everyday callings are arenas of sanctification and witness, guided by conscience and magistrates.
 - Eschatological telos: present growth toward the final consummation and resurrection.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine (primary theological ancestor), Luther (shared emphases but differences over sacramental presence and pastoral method), Roman Catholic scholasticism (contested on infused righteousness), Radical Reformers (disputed ecclesiology and sacraments).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture as norm for life; Trinity (Spirit effects union); Christology (active and passive obedience), soteriology (justification, election), sanctification (mortification/vivification), covenant, sacraments, ecclesiology, vocation, eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - At center: **participation in Christ by the Spirit**-a unified account in which justification, sanctification, and ordinary life are the one renewed existence oriented toward final glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Priority of union with Christ over abstract categories: moral life is participation, not merely duty.
 - Balanced law-gospel relation: law convicts yet remains a guiding instrument for regenerate life.
 - Strong pastoral and disciplinary concern: theology shaped for congregational formation, not only academic debate.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - To Roman Catholicism: rejects infused righteousness as grounds for justification, while still affirming real moral transformation.
 - To some Lutheran readings: more developed account of sanctification as social vocation and corporate discipline; different emphases on sacramental signs and spiritual presence.
 - To Radical Reformers: defends visible church, use of magistracy, and sacramental ordination against sectarian individualism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Prominent use of **mortification/vivification** as paired processes.
 - Emphasis on **effectual calling** and **participation** language that grounds ethical renewal.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Reformed pastoral theology, Puritan spiritual practice, and later neo-Calvinist social theology. Continues to shape modern Reformed ethics, preaching, and sacramental theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an integrated model for doctrine and piety: doctrinally rigorous yet pastorally practical; indispensable for studies in sanctification, vocation, and Reformed ecclesial identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - the ontological and relational ground of all Christian life; source of justification and sanctification.
- **Mortification** - Spirit-wrought dying to sin; ethical discipline and prayer aimed at subduing the flesh.
- **Vivification** - progressive enlivening by the Spirit into holiness and love.
- **Law and Gospel** - complementary: law convicts and instructs the regenerate; gospel frees and empowers obedience.
- **Justification (forensic)** - declarative acquittal based on Christ's work, inseparable from real transformation in life.
- **Sacraments (signs and seals)** - means of grace that apply Christ to believers, especially baptism (union) and supper (nourishment).
- **Vocation (calling)** - everyday duties as arenas of sanctification and social witness; not merely clerical.
- **Ecclesial discipline** - church-ordered correction for holiness and witness.
- **Effectual calling / election** - God's sovereign initiation resulting in real conversion and perseverance.
- **Participation / communion** - language emphasizing real sharing in Christ's life and benefits.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's obedience credited for justification (both life of obedience and death).
- **Eschatological orientation** - present sanctification directed toward resurrection and consummation.

- **Site-topic references integrated**
 - **Guilt, Pollution and Death** - Calvin locates the human predicament in guilt (forensic culpability), pollution (inherent corruption), and death (both physical and spiritual); pastoral theology treats all three: gospel removes guilt, Spirit cleanses pollution, and resurrection overcomes death.
 - **Christ and Culture in Eschatological Perspective** - Calvin frames cultural engagement as vocation under eschatological hope: culture is to be transformed by faithful witness and charity while awaiting consummation; eschatology supplies both critique of fallen structures and energy for reform.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sanctification and union with Christ.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching, discipline, and sacramental practice.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both Roman sacramentalism and sectarian individualism; also a **conceptual pivot** for Reformed social ethics and vocation.
