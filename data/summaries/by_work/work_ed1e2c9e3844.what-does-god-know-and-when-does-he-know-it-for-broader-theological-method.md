### TITLE
**Millard J. Erickson - What Does God Know and When Does He Know It?** 
(Study in divine foreknowledge and theological method; evangelical/systematic-theological treatment)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical milieu engaging contemporary philosophical theology and the rising Open Theism movement.
 - Erickson writes as a broadly Reformed, evangelical systematic theologian aiming to defend classical theism using both biblical exegesis and analytic philosophy.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The book asks how to account theologically and philosophically for God's knowledge of the future while preserving divine perfection, providence, and meaningful creaturely freedom.
 - Erickson argues for a robust traditional account of divine knowledge (God knows all true propositions, including future contingent truths) and critiques recent alternatives (especially Open Theism).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of views: classical/tenseless view, simple foreknowledge, Molinist (middle knowledge), and Open Theism.
 - Philosophical analysis of time, eternity, and the logic of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
 - Exegetical engagement with biblical texts used to support each model (e.g., prophetic certainties, divine repentance, prayer).
 - Assessment of theological consequences: providence, predestination, divine immutability, and human responsibility.
 - Synthesis: defense of a view that secures exhaustive divine knowledge without reducing genuine freedom or undermining God's providence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Historical: Augustine, Aquinas, Boethius, Molina.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Open Theists (e.g., Clark Pinnock, John Sanders), proponents of middle knowledge (Molinists like William Lane Craig), and analytic philosophers on time and modality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (omniscience, immutability, eternity), providence, foreknowledge, human freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist questions), predestination, revelation and prophecy.

- **Closing line**
 - Erickson situates the problem as central to systematic theology: correct understanding of divine knowledge is decisive for coherent doctrine of providence, human responsibility, and the character of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced methodological posture**
 - Integrates biblical exegesis, historical-theological resources, and analytic philosophical tools rather than relying solely on one discipline.
- **Defense of classical/tenseless emphases**
 - Strong commitment to the idea that God's knowledge is complete and not diminished by temporal becoming; emphasizes god's eternal perspective.
- **Constructive critique of Open Theism**
 - Systematic and exegetical refutation of the claim that God lacks exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free acts; emphasizes pastoral and doctrinal risks of denying such knowledge.
- **Measured engagement with Molinism**
 - Treats middle knowledge seriously as a candidate solution but subjects it to theological and philosophical scrutiny (esp. on grounding counterfactuals and compatibility with divine sovereignty).
- **Clarifying terminological distinctions**
 - Sharp separation of concepts often conflated: foreknowledge vs predestination; knowledge of possibilities vs certainties; tenseless vs tensed accounts of knowing.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical circles as a standard critique of Open Theism and as a clear statement of classical concerns; referenced in systematic theology courses and polemical literature.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable model for integrating disciplines, clarifying conceptual confusions, and equipping pastors and theologians to address contemporary debates about God's knowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Foreknowledge**
 - God's knowledge of future events; Erickson insists this is genuine and exhaustive.
- **Omniscience**
 - The attribute of knowing all true propositions - central explanatory category for Erickson.
- **Classical (tenseless) view**
 - God's knowledge is eternal and not located in temporal sequence; God knows past, present, and future in an eternal "now."
- **Simple foreknowledge**
 - The view that God knows future events because they will happen (without invoking middle knowledge); contrasted with Molinism and Open Theism.
- **Middle knowledge (scientia media)**
 - Knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; Erickson treats it seriously but critiques problems of grounding and theological fit.
- **Open Theism**
 - Position denying exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free acts; Erickson offers systematic and exegetical objections.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**
 - Statements about what free agents would do under hypothetical circumstances; key locus of debate between Molinists and critics.
- **Timelessness / Boethian model**
 - Concept of God's eternal perspective beyond temporal succession; used to defend how God can know temporal truths without temporal limitation.
- **Providence**
 - Divine governance; Erickson links correct account of foreknowledge to coherent doctrine of providence.
- **Libertarian freedom vs compatibility**
 - Freedom options evaluated in light of foreknowledge claims; Erickson explores whether genuine freedom is compatible with exhaustive divine knowledge.
- **Predestination**
 - Its relation to foreknowledge is carefully distinguished (foreknowledge not reducible to causal determination).
- **Exhaustive definite foreknowledge (EDF)**
 - Phrase often used to describe the claim that God knows exactly what will happen, including free choices.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a polemic and resource against Open Theism in evangelical systematic theology.
 - As an integrative model for discussing divine attributes, providence, and human freedom in classroom and pastoral contexts.
 - As a conceptual pivot in treatments of omniscience: clarifies terminology and maps the main philosophical-theological options for further research.
