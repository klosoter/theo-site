### TITLE
Commentarius in Apocalypsin (Commentary on Revelation) [fragments and notes] - Francis Turretin (Reformed scholastic, 17th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism, Geneva Academy milieu; work survives largely as lecture notes and fragments rather than a systematic, published commentary.
 - Produced amid intense post-Reformation debates over chiliastic (millenarian) readings of Revelation 20 and rising literalist and sectarian interpretations in Europe.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To defend a Reformed, non-chronological (amillennial/figurative) reading of Revelation 20: the "thousand years" is symbolic of the church age and the present spiritual reign of Christ rather than a future, literal earthly millennium.
 - To resolve tensions about the "first resurrection," the binding and loosing of Satan, and the relation of the millennium to final judgment and the general resurrection.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical close-reading of Revelation 20 (Greek terms, context within Apocalypse).
 - Doctrinal synthesis using scriptural cross-references (Pauline resurrection texts, Revelation context) and Reformed theological categories (covenant, Christ's mediatorial reign).
 - Distinction of senses: literal/historical where warranted; symbolic/typical where language and genre require it.
 - Application: pastoral and polemical refutation of chiliasm and prophetic sensationalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with Church Fathers (notably Augustine's anti-chiliastic precedent), Reformers and post-Reformation interpreters; critical engagement with contemporary chiliasm and prophetic literalists.
 - Scholastic method drawing on Scripture, patristic authorities, and Reformed dogmatics (doctrinal loci such as resurrection, last things, Christology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennium, resurrection(s), final judgment, parousia)
 - Christology (Christ's present mediatorial reign)
 - Satanology (binding and final release)
 - Ecclesiology and covenant theology (church age as locus of Christ's reign)
 - Hermeneutics of apocalyptic literature (symbolic vs. literal)
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's fragments consolidate a disciplined Reformed amillennial reading: Revelation 20 depicts the present, spiritual reign of Christ and the restrained activity of Satan during the church age, with the "thousand years" functioning as a symbolic chronometer of consummation rather than a future literal millennium.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous scholastic precision applied to apocalyptic text: fine-grained lexical and syntactical attention allied to systematic theological reconciliation.
 - Emphasis on the covenantal-historical framework: the millennium read as the church era under the covenant of grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Firm polemic against literalist chiliasm and sensational prophetic schemes; corrective to readers who force a chronological, terrestrial kingdom out of highly symbolic apocalyptic imagery.
 - Aligns with and refines Augustine's anti-chiliastic stance, but extends argumentation using Reformed sacramental-covenantal categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced distinction in the notion of "resurrection": primary spiritual/regenerative sense (the "first resurrection" as believers' union with Christ) set over against the general bodily resurrection at the final judgment.
 - Definition of "binding of Satan" as a juridical/efficacious restraint (not annihilation), enabling Gospel advancement and suppressing wholesale deception.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Important as a representative piece of Reformed scholastic resistance to post-Reformation millenarianism; used by later Reformed teachers in eschatological instruction and in controversies with premillennialists.
 - Less widely known than Turretin's Institutes, but valued in academic circles for method and hermeneutical clarity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined, confessional exegesis of apocalyptic text; valuable for teaching eschatology, hermeneutics, and for polemical clarity in contemporary Reformed debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chiliasm / chiliasmus**
 - Turretin's label for literalist thousand-year doctrines; treated critically as exegetically unwarranted.
- **Millennium (the "thousand years")**
 - Interpreted as symbolic of completeness and the present church age rather than a future, chronological reign.
- **First resurrection**
 - Primarily spiritual/regenerative resurrection of believers (union with Christ); not yet the universal bodily resurrection.
- **Second/general resurrection**
 - Final bodily resurrection at judgment; distinct from the "first" in sequence and nature.
- **Binding of Satan**
 - A divinely effected restraint of Satan's power over nations and public deception, enabling Gospel progress; temporary until final release.
- **Parousia**
 - The final coming of Christ terminates the symbolic millennium and ushers in general resurrection and judgment.
- **Covenant of grace / covenantal-historical reading**
 - Framework for placing Revelation 20 within the present economy of salvation and Christ's mediatorial rule.
- **Symbolic/figurative interpretation**
 - Methodological stance: prefer symbolic sense for apocalyptic numbers and imagery, guided by grammatical-historical rules.
- **Regeneration (spiritual resurrection)**
 - The believer's present participation in the life of Christ; central to reading the "first resurrection."
- **Historicist tendency (qualified)**
 - Uses historical-covenantal sequence to relate Revelation's symbolic chronology to the church era, but resists overly specific historical mapping.
- **Antichrist / deception motifs**
 - Read as recurring opposition during the church age rather than a single chronological epoch limited to a literal millennium.
- **Eschatological consummation**
 - Turretin's focal point: unity of present reign and final consummation under Christ's sovereign lordship.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a confessional Reformed (amillennial) reading of Revelation 20.
- As **polemic** against premillennial/chiliasm claims in theological controversy.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating disciplined balance of literal and symbolic readings of apocalyptic literature.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking eschatology to covenant theology and pastoral ecclesiology.
