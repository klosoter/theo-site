### TITLE
Barth on the Christian Life: The Practical Knowledge of God - Joseph L. Mangina (study of Karl Barth)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated in contemporary Barth scholarship that reclaims Barth as a theologian of Christian existence rather than only systematic polemic; reads Barth against 19th-20th century liberal moralism, pietism, and both Brunner/Bultmann debates.
 - Engages Barth's mature corpus (Church Dogmatics, post-war writings) with attention to ecclesial and pastoral consequences.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth reframes the Christian life not as moral self-improvement or autonomous piety but as **practical knowledge of God** - an epistemic-lived unity in which revelation shapes obedience, worship, and ethical formation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Barth's theological anthropology: human life defined by response to God's self-revelation in Christ.
 - Analysis of Word and sacrament as mediating practices that constitute the believer's knowledge of God (speech-act, encounteral model).
 - Ethical consequences: faith as active trust that issues in obedience, vocation, and love; sanctification as gift, not progressivist achievement.
 - Application to ecclesiology and sacramentology, with sustained attention to baptismal identity (infant vs believer baptism) and efficacy.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary: Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics, sermons, pastoral texts).
 - Secondary interlocutors: liberal theology (Schleiermacherian subjectivism), neo-orthodox reception (Brunner), modern ethicists and sacramental theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Word of God, Christology, Trinity (practical implications), covenant, election, faith and obedience, grace, sacraments (esp. baptism), ecclesiology, pastoral theology and Christian ethics.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - For Barth (as Mangina reads him), the Christian life is constituted by the **Word-event of God**: a continuing encounter in which the believer's practical knowledge of God shapes identity, community, and moral agency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates **knowledge as practical** - theological knowing is behavioral and communal, not merely propositional assent.
 - Strong priority of God's initiative: sanctification and sacramental efficacy are acts of God, not human accomplishment.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberalism's reduction of religion to feeling or ethics; opposes pietistic privatization of faith.
 - Contrasts with moral exemplar models by insisting that Christ's revealed action, not human imitation, grounds the Christian life.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts sacraments and proclamation as constitutive events (speech-act theology): Word and sign together make present God's saving action that forms the Christian life.
 - Frames obedience and vocation as forms of epistemic response - you know God by living under God.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in recent Reformed and ecumenical sacramental debates; used as corrective in pastoral theology and practical theology programs.
 - Mangina's portrayal has helped reframe Barth as resource for constructive ethics and formation, not only dogmatic critique.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a cohesive model linking doctrine, worship, and ethics; durable resource for debates on baptismal identity, sacramental efficacy, and ecclesial formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Practical knowledge of God** - knowing God through lived response to revelation; knowledge that shapes action.
- **Word-event (proclamation + encounter)** - God's speaking is an event that effects communion and constitutes the Christian life.
- **Faith as trust (fiducia)** - receptive reliance on God's initiative; not primarily assent to propositions.
- **Obedience of faith** - moral and vocational response that flows from being addressed by God.
- **Sacramental realism** - sacraments are means by which God acts; efficacy depends on God, not human worthiness.
 - Baptism: sign and seal of incorporation into God's covenant people; efficacy rests in God's act.
- **Baptism (infant vs believer)** - Barth (and Mangina's reading) defends **infant baptism** as legitimate covenantal incorporation; critiques a purely voluntarist/discipleship model that makes baptism contingent solely on prior personal confession.
 - Emphasizes covenantal belonging and God-initiated grace over human decision as ground of efficacy.
- **Covenant theology** - community-based identity under God's promises structures ethics and sacramental practice.
- **Christocentricity** - all theological loci read back to the person and work of Christ as constitutive of life and knowledge.
- **Dialectical method** - tension-filled relational theology resisting theological naturalism and anthropocentrism.
- **Pastoral formation** - theological knowledge aimed at the shaping of persons and congregations, not abstract system-building.
- **Grace and election** - divine initiative in salvation that grounds vocation and moral formation.
- **Church as locus of life** - the church is the community in which the Word-event forms Christian existence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for practical theology: clarifies what "practical knowledge" means in formation and ethics.
- As a **polemic** against voluntarist/discipleship-only readings of baptism (supports infant baptism's efficacy within covenant).
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Scripture and sacrament as eventful encounters rather than mere texts/signs.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrinal loci (Christology, ecclesiology, sacrament) to pastoral practice and moral theology.
