### TITLE
**The Law of the Covenant: An Exposition of Exodus 21-23** - James B. Jordan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late twentieth-century conservative Reformed/evangelical biblical scholarship with strong interest in covenant theology, canonical reading, and a corrective to pietistic or individualistic treatments of OT law. Resonates with streams later identified with Federal Vision and monocovenantal emphases without being a technical treatise in those movements.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Exodus 21-23 (the Covenant Code) is not a mere collection of primitive laws but a coherent covenant stipulation that shapes Israel's communal, cultic, and social order; proper interpretation requires reading these statutes as covenantal, typological, and canonical directives that bear on Christian ecclesial life and ethics.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Prefatory argument for a canonical, covenant-centered hermeneutic: law as covenant law, not isolated legislation.
 - Exegetical walk through Exodus 21-23:
 - Laws on servants/slavery and household order as covenantal social structures.
 - Laws on personal injury (lex talionis), property, and restitution as mechanisms for covenant justice.
 - Provisions for social justice, sabbath observance, protection of the vulnerable, and cultic concerns showing the law's integrative function.
 - Theological synthesis: law as typological pointer to Christ and organizer of corporate holiness; implications for church, family, and civil life.
 - Practical application: cautions against unrealized separation of Israel/Church and against treating the text as merely antiquarian.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Moses and the Pentateuchal tradition as primary; engages Reformed covenantal heritage implicitly (e.g., Calvinist and post-Reformation covenantal interpreters), modern critical readings that fragment law from covenant, and discussions in Federal Vision/monocovenantal debates over continuity between Israel and the Church.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant (central), law and revelation, ecclesiology (corporate/communal aspects), typology/Christology (law as foreshadowing), ethics (social and civil order), and implicit sacramental orientation to covenant life.
- **Closing line:** The Covenant Code functions as covenantal architecture - a corporate, typological law-order that binds worship, family, and polis as a single socially formative revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong canonical/covenantal hermeneutic: laws interpreted as stipulations within a covenantal matrix rather than isolated legal relics.
 - Stress on social-ordering function of the law: law organizes households, markets, courts, and cult together.
 - Typological reading: legal particulars point forward to Christ and to the Church as covenant community.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects reductionist views that privatize or spiritualize the law apart from corporate structures.
 - Pushes back against dispensational and some pietistic Reformed readings that sharply bifurcate Israel and the Church.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Embrace of a monocovenantal sensibility: one covenantal economy expressed in Israelic stipulations that find corporate fulfillment in the Church.
 - Emphasizes law as "architecture" or "grammar" of covenant life rather than merely a code of prohibitions.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued among students and ministers who favor robust covenant theology, social-ecclesial readings of Scripture, and some strands of the Federal Vision conversation.
 - Critiqued by scholars who maintain stronger distinctions between ancient Near Eastern legal genre studies or who defend sharper Israel/Church divisions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a disciplined exegetical model for relating OT law to covenantal theology.
 - Serves as a compact resource for pastors and teachers seeking to integrate social, cultic, and ethical dimensions of the law into congregational life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant Code:** The legal material in Exodus 21-23 read as covenant stipulations organizing corporate life.
- **Monocovenantalism:** The view that there is one unfolding covenant economy; Jordan's reading coheres with this by stressing continuity and corporate fulfillment.
- **Apodictic vs. Casuistic law:** Jordan highlights the covenantal texture more than technical genre debates, treating rules as binding stipulations within community.
- **Lex talionis (law of retaliation):** Interpreted as covenantal justice shaping proportional restitution and communal order, not mere revenge.
- **Servant/slave regulations:** Read as structuring household and kinship relations within covenantal ethics, with pastoral implications for church and family.
- **Social-ordering function:** Term for how law configures institutions (family, market, courts, cult) into a covenantal society.
- **Typology:** Legal particulars are read as types that point to Christ and covenant fulfillment rather than as standalone moral maxims.
- **Canonical hermeneutic:** Interpreting Exodus within the whole canon and covenant narrative rather than as fragmentary legislation.
- **Corporate holiness:** The idea that law aims at shaping the covenant community's identity and praxis, not just individual morality.
- **Restitution and compensation:** Emphasized as covenantal mechanisms for restoration and communal stability.
- **Cultic/ethical nexus:** The close relation Jordan draws between worship practices and social-ethical life in the covenant.
- **Covenantal architecture/grammar:** Phrase to capture law as structuring norms that make covenant life intelligible and practicable.
- **Continuity/fulfillment:** Concept used to argue for the church's reception of covenantal shapes without collapsing typology into identical civil prescriptions.
- **Exegetical model:** Jordan offers a model prioritizing canonical coherence, grammatical-historical reading, and typological application.
- Uses across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading OT law within covenant theology.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against sharp Israel/Church bifurcation and privatized ethics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions on Federal Vision and monocovenantal interpretations of law and covenant.
