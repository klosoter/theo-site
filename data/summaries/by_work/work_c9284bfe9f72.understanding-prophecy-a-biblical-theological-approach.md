### TITLE
Understanding Prophecy: A Biblical-Theological Approach - Alan S. Bandy & Benjamin L. Merkle

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical, redemptive-historical movement in biblical studies; responds to late 20th-early 21st century debates about prophecy, fulfillment, and hermeneutics.
 - Authors are situated in conservative Protestant seminary contexts and write for pastors, advanced students, and scholars seeking a canonical, Christ-centered reading of prophetic literature.

- **Central thesis**
 - Prophecy should be read by a coherent biblical-theological method that respects historical context, literary form, canonical placement, and the typological/Christological patterns that lead to ultimate fulfillment in Christ and the eschaton.
 - Emphasizes a multilayered fulfillment model: near historical fulfilments, canonical theological fulfilments, and final eschatological fulfillment.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Foundations: definitional work on prophecy, genres, and the role of prophets in Israel.
 - Hermeneutical principles: grammatical-historical exegesis integrated with canonical and typological sensitivity.
 - Patterns of fulfillment: distinguishes immediate historical fulfillments, intermixed future expectations, and New Testament reinterpretations.
 - Case studies: close readings of representative prophetic texts (e.g., Isa 7-12, Isa 40-66, Hosea, Joel, Daniel, Micah) and New Testament use of those texts.
 - Practical implications: preaching, pastoral application, and eschatological ethics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with canonical critics and redemptive-historical scholars (e.g., Brevard Childs, Gerhard von Rad), conservative exegetes (e.g., Walter C. Kaiser Jr.), and commentators on promise-fulfillment (e.g., G. K. Beale).
 - Engages both Old Testament prophetic scholarship and New Testament intertextual use of the prophets.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (canonical and special), covenant and promise, Christology (fulfillment motif), eschatology (already/not-yet tensions), inspiration and authority of Scripture, typology and promise-fulfillment hermeneutics.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Prophecy is integrally Christocentric and canonical: prophetic speech points forward within Israel's covenant story to Christ and the eschaton, and deserves an interpretive method that holds together historical sense and theological fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on a layered model of fulfillment that avoids simplistic one-to-one predictions or collapsing all prophetic speech into only spiritualized fulfillment.
 - Interweaves careful historical exegesis with a canonical-theological reading that tracks promise, typology, and New Testament appropriation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects excesses of both classical dispensationalism (which isolates prophetic promises from Christocentric fulfillment) and radical allegorizing approaches that erase historical referents.
 - Pushes back on purely historical-critical readings that treat prophecy as only immediate or contextual without theological-forward motion.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes distinctions such as "proximate fulfillment" (near-term, historical) vs. "canonical theological fulfillment" (theologically realized in Christ and the church) vs. "eschatological consummation."
 - Frames prophetic "sensus plenior" as a legitimate category when rigorously tied to canonical and Christological patterns rather than speculative layering.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in evangelical seminaries as a balanced model for preaching and teaching prophecy.
 - Cited in curricula that aim to integrate OT prophecy with NT Christology and eschatology; useful for pastoral hermeneutics resisting either hyper-futurism or over-allegorization.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable hermeneutical toolkit that is both exegetically responsible and theologically rich; valuable for sermon preparation, advanced exegesis, and teaching on prophetic literature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prophecy** - prophetic speech in Israel as covenantal proclamation, promise, covenant lawsuit, and future-oriented proclamation.
- **Grammatical-historical exegesis** - baseline method for establishing original sense and context.
- **Canonical reading** - discerning theological meaning from the placement and role of prophetic texts within the whole Bible.
- **Typology** - persons/events/rites in Israel as foreshadowings that find fulfillment in Christ and the church.
- **Sensus plenior** - fuller canonical senses legitimate when grounded in Scripture's own Christological readings.
- **Proximate (or immediate) fulfillment** - near-term historical realizations of prophetic words within Israel/Judah.
- **Canonical theological fulfillment** - theologically definitive realization in Christ and Scripture's ongoing narrative.
- **Eschatological consummation** - the final, ultimate fulfillment at the end of history.
- **Intertextuality / NT use of OT** - how New Testament authors cite and reinterpret prophetic texts.
- **Promise-fulfillment framework** - reading prophecy as embedded in covenant promises that progress and culminate.
- **Already-not-yet** - the tension between fulfilled reality in Christ and consummation still expected.
- **Hermeneutical vigilance** - careful criteria for distinguishing legitimate typological/Christological readings from eisegesis.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for operational terms in courses on prophecy and hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both hyper-dispensational and overly allegorical interpreters.
 - As an **exegetical model** for sermon and scholarly exegesis that connects OT prophecy to NT fulfillment and eschatology.
