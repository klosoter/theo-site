### TITLE
**Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary (contributor) - Peter A. Lillback**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Exegetical and confessional commentary on the 1646 Westminster Confession, produced within late 20th/early 21st-century Reformed recovery and confessional renewal movements. Engages both the historical Assembly context (English Civil War, Reformed Presbyterian-School theology) and modern theological concerns (biblical authority, pastoral application).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To explicate the WCF as a coherent, biblically grounded system for orthodox Reformed belief and practice, defending its formulations against modern departures while making them pastorally intelligible.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Systematic, chapter-by-chapter exposition of the Confession. Major moves: historical setting and authorship, exegetical justification for each chapter, doctrinal synthesis with Scripture and reformers, practical and pastoral implications. Emphasizes connection of doctrine (God, Scripture, covenant, Christ, salvation) to ecclesial life and worship.
 - Recurrent focus on divine sovereignty and covenantal order as organizing principles that unify disparate loci (election, law, sacraments, church government).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: the Westminster Assembly formulators, the Reformed scholastic tradition (Calvin, Bucer, the English Puritans). Secondary: modern theological interlocutors - liberal, Arminian, Roman Catholic critiques, and contemporary evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Full sweep: revelation/Scripture, God (including attributes), Trinity, creation, providence, fall and sin, covenant theology, election/predestination, Christology, justification, sanctification, law and gospel, sacraments, church and civil magistrate, eschatology.
 - Notable emphasis on **Absolute and Relative Attributes** of God and their bearing on covenant and human responsibility.
- **Closing line:** 
 - A defense of the WCF as an integrated, biblically faithful articulation of Reformed orthodoxy, oriented toward worshiping, governing, and discipling the church under the lordship of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong articulation of the covenantal structure as the key hermeneutical grid for the whole Confession; consistent linking of God's sovereignty with covenantal obligations. 
 - Clear treatment of God's **absolute and relative attributes**, using the distinction to guard both divine immutability/transcendence and God's relational work in covenant, promise, and redemptive acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushback against modern softening of divine sovereignty (Arminian tendencies) and against reductionist pietism that severs doctrine from church order and worship. Corrects liberal historicizing that downplays normative authority of the Confession.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Not so much new theology as disciplined clarification: proposes refined applications of older categories (e.g., stressing how absolute attributes ground God's being while relative attributes ground covenantal administration).
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles for pastoral and confessional use; used in seminary instruction, presbytery training, and congregational catechesis. Influential for those seeking a practiced confessionalism rather than mere historical interest.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - As a pedagogical tool linking doctrinal precision with pastoral application; as a reliable guide for reading the Confession within a covenantal, Reformed theological framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes** - traits of God that pertain to his being in himself (omnipotence, omniscience, aseity, immutability); used to ground God's sovereignty and the metaphysical basis of covenant faithfulness.
- **Relative attributes** - traits that describe God's relation to creatures (merciful, covenant-keeping, redeemer); emphasized to explain God's personal engagement and promises within the covenant.
 - Relation: commentary highlights that absolute attributes secure the reliability of relative attributes - e.g., immutability supports covenant faithfulness.
- **Sovereignty** - God's ultimate rule over all; central to chapters on providence, election, and the efficacy of grace.
- **Covenant (federal theology)** - organizing theological category; frames creation, fall, redemption, and covenantal administration of law and sacraments.
- **Scripture (inerrancy/authority)** - Scripture as the sole rule of faith and life; commentary defends propositional sufficiency against modern critiques.
- **Predestination (election/reprobation)** - taught as particular and unconditional within God's eternal decree; discussed pastorally and polemically.
- **Justification by faith** - forensic declaration by Christ's righteousness imputed to believers; central to soteriology and polemic against works-righteousness.
- **Sanctification and perseverance** - progressive, Spirit-wrought growth with assurance undergirded by union with Christ and covenant promises.
- **Law and Gospel** - distinction preserved: law as civil/ceremonial/moral functions; gospel as promise of grace - law's role in conviction and regulation of Christian life.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper)** - visible signs and seals of God's covenant; means of grace, not mere symbols.
- **Church and polity** - Presbyterian government and marks of the true church; ministry, discipline, and worship governed by Scripture and Confession.
- **Providence** - God's sustaining governance of creation in both ordinary and extraordinary ways; tied to prayer and ethical responsibility.
- **Original sin** - total corruption necessitating sovereign grace; explains need for redemption and effectual calling.
- **Free will (bondage of will)** - human will impaired by sin; freedom realized in regeneration by the Spirit.
- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for confessional formulations (seminary textbooks, ordained examinations). 
 - As a **polemic resource** against theological liberalism and Arminian deviations. 
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for applying systematic theology to preaching, catechesis, and church order.
