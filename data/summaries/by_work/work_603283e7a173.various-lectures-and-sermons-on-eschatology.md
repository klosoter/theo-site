### TITLE
Various Lectures and Sermons on Eschatology - Kim Riddlebarger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical milieu (late 20th-21st century). Material stems from pulpit sermons and conference lectures intended for pastors, students, and laypeople wrestling with millennial questions within a covenantal framework.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Argues for **historic premillennialism** as the most coherent, biblically faithful eschatological position for a Reformed/confessional theologian, contrasting it chiefly with amillennialism and dispensational premillennialism.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical focus on key eschatological loci: Revelation 19-20, Daniel 2 & 7, Isaiah and Zechariah messianic promises.
 - Hermeneutical claim: adopt a **literal-typological** reading where OT promises are fulfilled ultimately in Christ but retain future, concrete eschatological fulfillment (a literal reign).
 - Covenant-theological integration: maintain continuity between Israel and the church (no two-covenant divide), while affirming distinct future fulfillment of certain promises to the people of God.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Against dispensationalism: rejects sharp Israel/Church split, separate prophetic program, and pretribulation rapture.
 - Against amillennialism: resists reduction of the millennial promises to merely spiritual or present realities; affirms a future, earthly reign following Christ's return.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** engages classical amillennial inheritance (Augustine and later Reformed proponents), critiques John Nelson Darby/Scofield-type dispensationalists, dialogues with modern commentators on Revelation and Daniel; draws on historical premillennial voices and confessional Reformed resources.
- **Doctrines treated:** eschatology (primary), covenant theology, Christology (kingly rule), resurrection and final judgment, church identity (people of God), scriptural hermeneutics (revelation).
- **Closing line:** Riddlebarger's corpus presses a **covenantal historic premillennialism** that preserves the historic promises to God's people, rejects dispensational ruptures, and insists on a future, concrete millennial reign as the culmination of redemptive-history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Consistently frames historic premillennialism *within* covenant theology, not as an extra-Reformed innovation.
 - Employs a controlled literalism: insists on historical-grammatical exegesis but allows typological continuity between OT and NT fulfillments.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects dispensationalism by restoring covenant continuity and denying a secret pretrib rapture.
 - Challenges amillennialism for insufficient attention to the future, bodily dimensions of messianic promises.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Practical coinage of descriptive phrases that stress *reconciled continuity* (Church as continuation of the people of God) while preserving *future consummation*.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Provocative within conservative Reformed circles: welcomed by those seeking a premillennial alternative that is not dispensational, critiqued by entrenched amillennialists.
 - Used as a pastoral and pedagogical resource in churches and seminaries exploring millennial alternatives.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, pastoral exegesis of Revelation 20 and related texts.
 - Model for integrating premillennial conviction with confessional Reformed commitments, making it useful for courses on eschatology and covenant theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historic premillennialism:** The view that Christ returns, the dead are raised, and a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth follows the Second Advent; here argued from a covenantal perspective.
- **Dispensational premillennialism:** Contrasted view that divides Israel and Church, posits a pretribulation rapture and a distinct prophetic program; critiqued for covenantal rupture.
- **Amillennialism:** The view that the millennium is symbolic of Christ's present reign; critiqued for underemphasizing a future, bodily fulfillment.
- **Millennium (Revelation 20):** Treated as a future, literal (but typologically related) reign of Christ with resurrected saints.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The already/not-yet dynamic: kingdom inaugurated in Christ's first coming but consummated at His return-used to bridge present spiritual reign and future earthly reign.
- **Consummation / Second Coming:** Final eschatological act after which resurrection, judgment, and millennial reign occur in Riddlebarger's schema.
- **Covenant continuity:** Key corrective to dispensationalism: one redemptive people under unfolding administrations, not two separate peoples.
- **Literal-typological hermeneutic:** Reads promises literally where plain but recognizes typological fulfillment (OT types pointing to greater NT fulfillment).
- **Resurrection (order):** Affirms general resurrection at Christ's return rather than multiple resurrections divided by dispensational chronology.
- **Rapture / Tribulation:** Rejects a separate, secret pretrib rapture; treats tribulational language in light of first-century and apocalyptic contexts.
- **Kingdom of God (present/future tensions):** Emphasizes both present rule (already) and future, visible, earthly reign (not merely spiritualized).
- **People of God / Israel-Church relation:** Emphasizes unity and continuity; distinguishes future aspects of promise without ethnic or covenantal separation.
- **Exilic-prophetic texts (Daniel, Zechariah, Isaiah):** Read as promising future, concrete messianic rule fulfilled ultimately in Christ's return.

- Uses across loci:
 - Definition source for a **covenantal historic premillennial** position.
 - Polemical resource against both **dispensational separation** and **amillennial spiritualizing**.
 - Exegetical model for interpreting Revelation 20 and promise-texts in Daniel/Zechariah within a unified covenantal-historical framework.
