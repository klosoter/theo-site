### TITLE
On Nature and Grace (De Natura et Gratia) - Augustine of Hippo (c. 415)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed during the Pelagian controversy (early 5th century). Augustine writes against Pelagius and his chief ally Julian of Eclanum, with Faustus of Mileve as an intermediate interlocutor.
 - Milieu: North African Christianity wrestling with human freedom, original sin, infant baptism, and the moral consequences of Adam's fall.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human nature is radically wounded by Adam's sin so that moral good is impossible without gratuitous divine grace; grace precedes, enables, and must be efficacious for salvation and any genuine moral act.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: human nature after the Fall is corrupted (concupiscence, death, guilt) and inclined to actual sin.
 - Refutation of Pelagian claims that nature alone can choose the good or that infants are born innocent in moral culpability.
 - Positive thesis: grace is necessary from the outset - it is not a mere aid but the causative power that heals the will and produces faith and virtue.
 - Grace is gratuitous (unmerited) and sovereign; it is given by God's mercy, not proportionate to human deserts.
 - Augustine articulates a strong notion of imputed guilt (Adam's sin counts against his descendants) together with transmitted corruption.
 - Practical and pastoral consequences: defense of infant baptism, insistence on prevenient and efficacious grace, critique of any doctrine that makes human will the primary mover in salvation.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Opponents: Pelagius, Celestius, Julian of Eclanum, Faustus of Mileve.
 - Uses Scripture (esp. Pauline texts on Adam and grace) and appeals to earlier Fathers (notably Ambrose) while developing Augustinian axioms.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin, guilt and pollution, death as consequence.
 - Grace (nature, necessity, efficacy), prevenient vs. cooperating grace.
 - Free will: retained but weakened; freedom to sin remains, freedom to do true righteousness requires grace.
 - Baptism, regeneration, and beginnings of Augustinian soteriology (infusion of righteousness rather than mere forensic declaration).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Augustine insists that salvation is primarily an act of God's gratuitous, efficacious grace which heals a nature rendered incapable of true righteousness by Adam's sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong articulation of both **imputed guilt** and **inherited corruption**: Adam's sin affects the personhood and will of descendants, not merely their external status.
 - Emphasis on **grace as ontological and causal** - grace changes the will, not merely forgives externally.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Direct corrective to Pelagius who affirmed near-autonomy of human nature and moral ability without prior grace.
 - Moves beyond earlier mitigations that stressed human moral capacity by making grace prior and decisive.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies categories later read as **prevenient vs. efficacious grace**, and sharpens the problem of **total inability** (moral impotence apart from grace).
 - Distinguishes between the order of nature and the order of grace in a proto-federal theological grid.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Crucial source for medieval and Reformation debates on sin, grace, and predestination; appealed to by Augustineans, Lutherans, and Calvinists.
 - Controversially moderated at the Council of Orange (529) which affirmed need for grace but rejected some deterministic readings attributed to Augustine.
 - Continues to be a touchstone in discussions of original sin, infant baptism, and the nature of justification.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, polemically sharp synthesis of sin and grace that forces subsequent theology to reckon with human inability and divine initiative.
 - Pedagogically useful for demonstrating pastoral stakes of doctrinal formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Nature (natura)** - human status after creation and after the Fall; wounded, not merely impaired.
- **Grace (gratia)** - gratuitous divine aid; operative, healing, and causative in producing faith and virtue.
 - Subtlety: Augustine treats grace as both preventing and enabling; later debates split this into prevenient vs efficacious.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)** - Adam's sin as transmitted to all humanity; involves guilt and corrupted will.
- **Imputation (reatio / imputatio)** - Adam's sin counted to descendants; Augustine affirms imputation of guilt alongside transmission of corruption.
- **Concupiscence (concupiscentia)** - disordered desire inherited from Adam; marks the will's bondage to sin.
- **Total inability (infirmity of will)** - humans cannot will true righteousness without grace; distinguishes from loss of freedom simpliciter.
- **Prevenient grace (implicit in text)** - grace that precedes any meritorious act; Augustine grounds necessity for even the first act of faith.
- **Efficacious grace (gratia efficax)** - grace that infallibly effects what it intends (in Augustine's stronger formulations).
- **Infusion of righteousness** - soteriological model: grace heals and confers righteousness internally, not merely imputes legally.
- **Baptismal regeneration** - theological and pastoral rationale for infant baptism given original sin and need for grace.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - maintained as real but impaired; freedom to choose good is enabled by grace.
- **Guilt, pollution, and death** - Augustine ties moral corruption to ontological consequences of the Fall.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **doctrinal source** for articulating original sin, total inability, and the priority of grace.
 - As **polemic** against Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian positions; a benchmark for orthodoxy on grace.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline readings (Adam/Christ typology) and for pastoral theology concerning baptism and infant salvation.
