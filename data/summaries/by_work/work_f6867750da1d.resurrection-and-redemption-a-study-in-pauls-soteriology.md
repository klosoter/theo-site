### TITLE
**Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul's Soteriology** (Author unknown)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-academic milieu reacting to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) and renewed interest in Pauline eschatology and resurrection theology.
 - A mixed exegetical-theological monograph aimed at pastors, doctoral students, and seminarians within conservative Protestant circles.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's doctrine of salvation must be read through the primacy of the **resurrection**: redemption is grounded not only in forensic declaration but in the believer's participatory union with the risen Christ, which secures justification, adoption, sanctification, assurance, and final glorification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Exegesis of Pauline loci - 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 4-8; Galatians; Philippians 3 - arguing resurrection is the decisive soteriological event.
 - Part II: Theological synthesis - shows how **forensic imputation** and **participation/union** are complementary, not competing, accounts.
 - Demonstrates that Christ's righteousness is imputed because the risen Christ inaugurates a new covenant reality.
 - Argues assurance and perseverance rest on objective resurrection and subjective union.
 - Part III: Polemics and pastoral implications - critique of NPP (Wright, Dunn) and of forensic-only models; implications for preaching assurance, sanctification, and sacramental theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright (NPP), Calvin, Cranfield, F.F. Bruce; appeals frequently to patristic and Reformation readings of 1 Cor 15 and Romans.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (Impeccability; Christ in OT/NT types), **Pneumatology** (Spirit's role in resurrection/union), **Covenant theology**, **Justification** (forensic imputation and critiques), **Adoption**, **Sanctification**, **Assurance & Perseverance**, **Doctrine of Sin** (origin, corporate aspect), **Eschatology** (new creation).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The resurrection is the ontological and juridical hinge of Pauline soteriology: it grounds imputation, secures union, and renders redemption both declared and enacted.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a combined model: **resurrection-based imputation** - imputation is validated and enacted in the eschatological reality of the risen Christ rather than being merely a forensic fiction.
 - Elevates the **participatory** (union-with-Christ) language as explanatorily primary while retaining forensic language for church order and assurance.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects NPP overemphasis on covenantal/nomistic readings by reinstating objective forensic language where Scripture employs legal metaphors.
 - Critiques forensic-only models for underplaying the Spirit's role and the bodily, communal, and eschatological dimensions of salvation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Coining or persistent use of **"resurrectional imputation"** - imputation understood as inaugurated and ratified in the resurrection.
 - Stresses **impeccability of Christ** as necessary for efficacious vicarious obedience within both forensic and participatory frameworks.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest in wider academic uptake (author unknown) but influential in Reformed seminaries as a corrective text: used in advanced soteriology courses and pastoral training.
 - Cited in debates mediating between NPP proponents and classical forensic apologists.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable exegetical readings of 1 Cor 15 and Romans 8.
 - Useful integrative model for preaching assurance, articulating adoption, and teaching union with Christ without collapsing distinct theological categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection**
 - Central soteriological event; grounds both objective victory over sin/death and believer's new status.

- **Redemption**
 - Encompasses payment, liberation, and covenantal renewal effected decisively by the risen Christ.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration of righteousness; defended as real and necessary but explicated in light of resurrectional reality.

- **Imputation**
 - The transfer of Christ's obedience/ righteousness; refined as **resurrectional imputation**-authorized and actualized by the risen Lord.

- **Union with Christ / Participation**
 - Ontological incorporation of believers into Christ's life, death, and resurrection; the means by which sanctification and adoption are realized.

- **Adoption**
 - Legal and familial status conferred in the resurrection-epoch; grounds assurance and filial obedience.

- **Assurance & Perseverance**
 - Assurance grounded on objective resurrection and covenantal promises; perseverance tied to Spirit-wrought union.

- **Impeccability of Christ**
 - Affirmed as doctrineally necessary for vicarious obedience and sinlessness; interacts with temptation narratives and active obedience.

- **Faith and Repentance**
 - Faith as receptive union with the risen Christ; repentance as change consonant with new creation ethics.

- **Good Works & Merit in Covenant of Grace**
 - Good works are evidence, not ground, of covenant standing; merit language rejected except as participatory fruit of union.

- **Christ in OT and NT**
 - Typology and fulfillment: resurrection ties OT promises to NT realization; Messiah as risen Lord is decisive.

- **Nature and Origin of Sin**
 - Corporate and inherited; resurrection inaugurates reversal but does not make sin inconsequential in present sanctification.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for resurrection-centered soteriology and "resurrectional imputation."
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductive NPP or forensic-only models.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 4-8 integrating penitential, forensic, and participatory language.
