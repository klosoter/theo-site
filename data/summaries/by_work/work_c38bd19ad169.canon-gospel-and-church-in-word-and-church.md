### TITLE
Canon, Gospel, and Church (essay in Word and Church)
John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-Anglican theological renewal; Webster writing from a Barthian-Reformed horizon with strong historical-theological awareness.
 - Contributes to ongoing postliberal and canonical conversations (e.g., Brevard Childs, Hans Frei) and to debates about sola scriptura, tradition, and magisterial authority.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Scripture's canonical shape, the proclamation of the gospel, and the church's identity are inseparably related: the canon is authoritative not merely as text but as the church-formed medium in which the Word of God is mediated; the church exists to witness to and be judged by the gospel as mediated in the canonical Word.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes between the Word as the living reality (Christ) and Scripture as the church's witness to that Word; shows how neither should be absolutized apart from their mutual relation.
 - Argues that canonical status is ecclesial reception and interpretable shape: the canon is normative insofar as it is the church's recognized record of God's saving act.
 - Claims the gospel is evental and Christocentric-canonical reading must be governed by the person and work of Christ rather than by abstract propositionalism.
 - Locates the role of the church as servant-witness whose preaching, sacraments, and judgment instantiate the Word in concrete form while remaining accountable to the canon.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Karl Barth's Word theology, engages with Brevard Childs and canonical criticism, converses with Reformation resources (Calvin), patristic and medieval sources on sacrament and ministry.
 - Opposes both a privatizing biblicism (bibliolatry) and an ecclesiological absolutism that subordinates Scripture to magisterial fiat.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (Word vs. Scripture)
 - Canon and tradition (reception, normativity)
 - Christus Victor / Christocentric hermeneutic (Christology)
 - Ecclesiology (church as witness, sacramental mediation)
 - Authority, proclamation, and sacramentality

- **Closing line**
 - Webster situates the canon, the gospel, and the church in a mutual, Christ-centered accountability: Scripture as the church's canonical witness mediates the saving Word, and the church exists to receive, proclaim, and be judged by that gospel.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the ontological priority of the Word (Christ) together with the concrete mediational reality of Scripture and sacrament - not mere theory but ecclesial practice.
 - Canon is a normative *ecclesial* reality: its authority is realized in the church's reception and use, yet it retains normative critique of the church.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Protestant tendencies toward individualistic sola scriptura by reintegrating canonical reception and ecclesial mediation.
 - Checks Roman Catholic tendencies toward magisterial finality by insisting the church is servant, not originator, of the gospel content.
 - Dialogues critically with Brevard Childs: affirms the value of canonical shape while pressing for a more robust Christological and ecclesiological grounding.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tightens language around "Word vs. Scripture" so Scripture is not conflated with the living Word but is necessary and ecclesially mediated witness.
 - Frames canonality as an event-bound, recognized shape of witness rather than merely a static list.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in contemporary Reformed and Anglican circles; influential among those seeking a theologically rigorous middle path between bibliolatry and magisterial absolutism.
 - Frequently cited in discussions of theological method, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced, theologically rich account of how Scripture, gospel proclamation, and ecclesial life interrelate; indispensable for preaching, confessional theology, and ecclesial formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon**
 - Ecclesial recognition and shaping of Scripture; normative because received and used by the church.

- **Gospel (euangelion)**
 - Evental saving reality centered on Christ; not merely propositional information but the divine act to which the canon attests.

- **Word**
 - Distinguishes between the living Word (Christ) and the written Word (Scripture) while insisting on their inseparable relation in proclamation and sacrament.

- **Scripture**
 - The church's reliable and normative witness to the Word; authoritative when read in the church under the Spirit.

- **Tradition / Reception**
 - The ecclesial process by which texts become canonical and authoritative; necessary but subordinate to the gospel.

- **Authority**
 - Relational and Christ-centered: Scripture's authority functions within the church's faithful recognition and proclamation.

- **Ecclesiology (church as witness / servant)**
 - Church's identity is to serve the Word, administer sacraments, and be judged by the gospel; not the source of canonical content.

- **Sacramentality**
 - Word and sacrament as integrally mediating the gospel; sacramental practice grounds ecclesial reception of the Word.

- **Christocentric hermeneutic**
 - Canonical reading governed by Christ's person and work; theological interpretation rather than neutral historical-literary reconstruction.

- **Normativity**
 - The canon as the controlling shape for doctrine and life; norms realized in ecclesial proclamation and practice.

- **Reception history**
 - How the church's recognition over time confers canonical status and shapes interpretive tradition.

- **Proclamation**
 - The locus where Word, Scripture, and church converge; preaching enacts canonical authority.

- **Mediation**
 - Emphasizes mediated revelation (Word through Scripture, Word through church/sacrament).

How this work is used across loci:
- **Theological method / definition source:** as a model for integrating Scripture and ecclesial reception in dogmatic method.
- **Polemic / corrective:** invoked against both individualistic sola scriptura and magisterial absolutism.
- **Exegetical model / conceptual pivot:** used to justify Christocentric, canonical readings and to ground sacramental-ecclesial theology.
