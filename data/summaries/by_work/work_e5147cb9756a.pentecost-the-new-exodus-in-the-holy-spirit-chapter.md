### TITLE
Pentecost: The New Exodus (chapter) - Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑late 20th/early 21st century Reformed evangelical theology; Ferguson writes from a pastoral-Reformed vantage attentive to biblical theology, Luke‑Acts, and covenant motifs.
 - Addressed to readers negotiating classical Reformed pneumatology and modern Pentecostal/charismatic readings of Acts.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Pentecost is the inauguration of the "New Exodus"**: the Spirit‑gift marks the eschatological, covenantal deliverance ushered in by Christ - a decisive fulfillment of Joel and the exodus typology that establishes the church for mission and worship.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical opening: close reading of Luke‑Acts and Joel 2 to locate Pentecost in an Old Testament prophetic and exodus frame.
 - Typological move: Jesus as the new Moses; Pentecost parallels Sinai/Passover as covenant‑giving through the Spirit rather than law.
 - Pneumatological implications:
 - The Spirit as covenantal presence, sign, and power for repentance, forgiveness, and mission.
 - Gifts and charismatic manifestations understood within the eschatological inauguration of the new covenant people.
 - Ecclesiological and missional conclusion: Pentecost defines the church's identity and task in world mission, worship, and witness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary sources: Luke‑Acts, Joel 2, Old Testament exodus narratives, New Testament covenant texts.
 - Interlocutors: classical Reformed interpreters, Pentecostal/charismatic exegeses, and cessationist critiques are engaged by implication; Ferguson dialogues with both renewal movements and conservative Reformed pneumatology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (role, gifts, presence of the Holy Spirit)
 - Covenant theology / New Covenant
 - Christology (Jesus as new Moses / eschatological agent)
 - Ecclesiology (nature and mission of the church)
 - Eschatology (inaugurated eschatology; "already/not yet" dynamics)

- **Closing line**
 - Pentecost, as the new exodus, situates the Spirit's coming as the covenantal, Christ‑centered inauguration of God's eschatological people for worship and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong typological reading that places Pentecost not merely as a miraculous event but as **covenantal and eschatological fulfillment** - the Spirit as a corporate, covenantal gift producing a new people.
 - Integration of canonical theology (OT exodus → Joel → Luke‑Acts) rather than isolating Acts as purely "charismatic episodes."

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts with some Pentecostal readings that isolate tongues or spectacular manifestations as the primary hermeneutical key; Ferguson reframes manifestations within covenant identity and mission.
 - Corrects some cessationist tendencies that marginalize present work of the Spirit by insisting on the normative continuity of Spirit‑given renewal and empowerment for ministry while maintaining doctrinal safeguards.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the phrase or motif **"New Exodus"** for Pentecost within Reformed pneumatology, linking Sinai/Passover patterns to Spirit‑baptism.
 - Emphasizes **inaugurated eschatology** as the hermeneutical lens for understanding gifts and signs.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received among Reformed and evangelical pastors/theologians as a balanced, biblical account of Pentecost - useful for bridging cautious Reformed pneumatology and charismatic concerns.
 - Influential in conservative circles as a corrective against both uncritical charismatic excesses and restrictive cessationism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust exegetical‑theological model that is pedagogically clear for preaching and teaching; valuable for ecumenical conversation between Reformed and charismatic communities.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pentecost** - The Spirit's outpouring at Jerusalem as recorded in Acts 2; construed as covenantal inauguration.
- **New Exodus** - The central typology: Pentecost is the fulfillment and recapitulation of the exodus motif, producing a redeemed people.
- **Joel 2 (prophecy)** - Key Old Testament promise invoked as fulfilled in Acts; grounds eschatological expectations.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - "Already/not yet" framework: Pentecost as the beginning of eschatological realities.
- **Spirit as covenantal presence** - The Spirit marks the new covenant community, enabling repentance, forgiveness, and unity.
- **Gifts of the Spirit** - Varied manifestations (teaching, prophecy, tongues, power) seen as functional to the new covenant people; interpreted within ecclesial order.
 - Relation to practice: gifts are normative for mission and edification, but must be governed by doctrine and order.
- **Tongues and prophecy** - Discussed as manifestations that require interpretive/covenantal framing rather than autonomous primacy.
- **Christ as new Moses** - Christ typologically parallels Moses; Pentecost parallels Sinai as covenant‑giving through Spirit rather than law.
- **Luke‑Acts canonical theology** - Use of Luke's narrative shape to read Pentecost as programmatic for the church.
- **Covenant theology** - Frames Pentecost within new covenant promises rather than purely charismatic phenomena.
- **Continuationism vs Cessationism** - Ferguson operates as a mediated continuationist: affirms ongoing Spirit work and gifts in the church while insisting on doctrinal and ecclesial regulation.
- **Ecclesial mission** - Pentecost's primary effect is to configure the church for witness, not merely to supply private spiritual experience.
- **Worship and witness** - Spirit's gift reorients corporate worship and public proclamation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: clear, biblically grounded definition of Pentecost as covenantal inauguration for teaching and sermon outlines.
 - Polemic: a measured resource in debates on Continuationism vs Cessationism - defends ongoing Spirit activity while restraining excess.
 - Exegetical model: a canonical Luke‑Acts template for reading Pentecost within Old Testament typology and inaugurated eschatology.
