### TITLE
"The Divine Origin of the Bible" - B. B. Warfield (in Selected Shorter Writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton environment; reaction to German higher criticism, Darwinian naturalism, and rising theological liberalism.
 - Warfield writes as a conservative Reformed apologist within the New School/Old Princeton tradition; aims to defend traditional doctrines of revelation and inspiration against naturalistic and rationalistic accounts.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible is of **divine origin**: its propositions are inspired by God (verbal, plenary inspiration) and therefore authoritative and trustworthy for doctrine, ethics, and life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Rejection of naturalistic origins of religion; critique of evolutionary accounts of Scripture and doctrine.
 - Positive account: God as self-revealer; revelation is propositional and communicative - Scripture is the reliable vehicle of that revelation.
 - Union of divine and human agency: Scripture is simultaneously divine in origin and human in authorship without error in its propositional content.
 - Empirical and theological confirmations:
 - **Typology and fulfillment**: the inner coherence of Scripture's types and antitypes (see Typology And Fulfillment) argues for unified divine authorship.
 - **Christ in OT and NT**: Christ's use and fulfillment of the OT showcases the Bible's consistency (see Christ In Ot And Nt).
 - **Historicity and doctrine**: historicity of Adam undergirds original sin through federal headship - textual and theological reasons support literal/historical readings (see Historicity And Federal Headship Of Adam).
 - **Vocation and culture**: Scripture supplies the normative basis for the cultural mandate, vocation and dominion (see Vocation Dominion And Culture Mandate).
 - **Providence and theodicy**: divine foreknowledge and providence explain history's coherence and moral order without undermining moral responsibility (see Divine Foreknowledge Providence And The Problem Of Evil).

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Opposes Wellhausen-style documentary criticism, theological liberalism, and those reducing revelation to religious experience.
 - Dialogues with predecessors like Charles Hodge (alignment with conservative Princeton), and critics of verbal inspiration.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration (verbal-plenary), inerrancy, canon and authority, original sin (Adam as federal head), Christology (OT/NT continuity), providence and theodicy, vocation and cultural mandate.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's polemic reduces to this center of gravity: Scripture is a divinely-originated, verbally inspired, infallible rule that grounds doctrine (sin, Christ, providence) and praxis (vocation, culture).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous defense of **verbal-plenary inspiration** rather than a merely "dynamic" or experiential view of revelation.
 - Marries historical-critical awareness with robust doctrinal commitments; not anti-history but anti-naturalism in explaining Scripture's origin.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal reductions that make Scripture purely human or developmental; counters skeptics who locate authority solely in religious experience or community consensus.
 - Refines earlier conservative claims by grounding in a systematic account of God's communicative action rather than mere assertion of inerrancy.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasizes internal coherence (typology/fulfillment, Christ-centered reading) as evidential for divine authorship.
 - Integrates biblical authority with doctrines of providence and federal headship to show theological unity across loci.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Cornerstone for 20th-century conservative evangelicalism and the inerrancy movement; heavily cited in seminary training and confessional defenses.
 - Influenced later Reformed and evangelical defenses of Scripture, though critiqued by neo-orthodox and liberal scholars.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, systematic model connecting inspiration to core Christian doctrines (sin, Christology, providence, cultural vocation).
 - Useful pedagogically as a clear statement of classical conservative Reformed apologetics for Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration (verbal-plenary)** - God's Spirit authentically and fully inspired the words of Scripture; not merely ideas.
- **Inerrancy / infallibility** - Scripture without error in its doctrinal, historical, and moral assertions insofar as it intends to teach.
- **Revelation (propositional)** - God self-discloses in propositional truth conveyed in Scripture, not reducible to private religious experience.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - Internal biblical patterns (types/antitypes) that demonstrate theological unity and predictive-historical accomplishment (see Typology And Fulfillment).
- **Historicity of Adam** - Adam as a historical person whose federal headship explains original sin and covenantal consequences (see Historicity And Federal Headship Of Adam).
- **Christocentric hermeneutic** - Scripture's unity centered on Christ; OT promises and types find their decisive meaning in Christ (see Christ In Ot And Nt).
- **Vocation / cultural mandate** - Biblical grounding for human dominion and cultural responsibility; Scripture supplies normative ethical and societal vision (see Vocation Dominion And Culture Mandate).
- **Divine foreknowledge** - God's exhaustive knowledge of future events as compatible with human responsibility; used to secure providential order (see Divine Foreknowledge Providence And The Problem Of Evil).
- **Providence** - Sovereign governance of God affirming historical coherence and moral order in the face of evil.
- **Problem of evil / theodicy** - Warfield frames evil under providence: God's foreknowledge and sovereignty permit a coherent response without rejecting divine goodness.
- **Canon and authority** - The Bible as the divinely sanctioned canon and final rule for faith and practice.
- **Human/divine agency (concurrency)** - The theological formula describing how Scripture is both human-authored and God-breathed.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for verbal-plenary inspiration and inerrancy in systematic theology and confessional formulations.
 - As a **polemic** against higher criticism and liberal reductions of Scripture.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Christ-centered readings (typology/fulfillment) and for arguing historicity where doctrine depends (Adam, Christ).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking revelation to doctrines of sin, providence/theodicy, and the Christian cultural vocation.
