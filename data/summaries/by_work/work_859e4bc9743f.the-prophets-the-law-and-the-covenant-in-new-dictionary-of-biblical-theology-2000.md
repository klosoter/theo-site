### TITLE
The Prophets, the Law, and the Covenant - Stephen G. Dempster (New Dictionary of Biblical Theology, 2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published in 2000 in an evangelical/Anglican-oriented New Dictionary of Biblical Theology; written from a broadly Reformed, redemptive-historical perspective.
 - Engages late-20th-century biblical-theological conversations that seek to reframe canonical reading around covenantal structures rather than isolated legal or prophetic texts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The prophetic corpus must be read as an intramural voice within Israel's covenantal framework: prophets function as covenant prosecutors, interpreters, and reformers who apply the Law (especially the Mosaic stipulations) to Israel's life and history.
 - The article examines how the Law and covenantal stipulations shape prophetic speech and how prophets in turn clarify the covenant's demands and promises, including the covenant's juridical and salvific dimensions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of how prophetic rhetoric presupposes the Law: prophetic indictment regularly appeals to covenant stipulations, historical acts of YHWH (exodus/creation), and covenant curses/blessings.
 - Analysis of prophetic genres that presuppose covenantal law:
 - Covenant lawsuit (rib): accusations framed in legal terms, recalling covenant violations.
 - Covenant sermons and calls to covenant renewal/repentance.
 - Theological synthesis: prophets do not oppose the Law; they expose Israel's failure under the Mosaic covenant while holding open the horizon of restoration grounded in covenant promises (anticipatory Christological hope).
 - Concludes by situating the Mosaic covenant as having a substantial works-character (obedience stipulations) even as the prophets point toward eventual grace-fulfillment within the covenantal trajectory.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary texts: prophetic books (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Amos, Micah, etc.) and Deuteronomic law material.
 - Interlocutors: covenant theologians and critics who dichotomize law and prophecy; likely dialogue with scholars emphasizing the discontinuity between legal codes and prophetic religion.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Mosaic covenant, covenant lawsuit motifs)
 - Revelation (Law and prophetic word as complementary channels)
 - Judgment and salvation (covenantal curses and promises)
 - Typology/Christology (prophetic anticipation of covenant fulfillment in the eschaton/Christ)

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - The prophets are covenantal guardians: they read Israel's history through Mosaic covenant law, prosecute its breaches, and announce God's covenantal judgment and restoration - thereby keeping the law and promise in sustained theological tension until fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that prophetic rhetoric presupposes and enforces covenantal law rather than offering a rival ethic or theology.
 - Clear framing of many prophetic oracles in legal-covenantal categories (lawsuit, verdict, covenant renewal).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters readings that pit prophetic religion as purely prophetic/ethical and separate from legal-covenantal institutions.
 - Pushes back against approaches that minimize the Mosaic covenant's juridical/works-oriented content by emphasizing its role in the prophets' indictments.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates older covenant-law categories in redemptive-historical vocabulary: treats the Mosaic covenant as "covenant of works as to substance" while maintaining its place within the larger covenant of grace narrative.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Reformed and evangelical biblical-theological teaching as a concise corrective to bifurcated readings of law and prophecy.
 - Influential for preachers and teachers who seek to apply prophetic indictments in covenantal sermon frameworks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Helpful clarifier for linking legal texts and prophetic literature; durable for use in systematic theology, biblical theology, and homiletics as a compact mapping of how prophecy functions within covenant history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Prophets**
 - Interpreters and enforcers of covenant; function as prosecutors, seers, and covenant-renewal advocates.

- **Law**
 - Mosaic stipulations that provide the normative standard invoked by prophetic indictments.

- **Covenant**
 - The organizing theological category; narrative frame for Law, history, and prophecy.

- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - Treated as the immediate legal matrix for Israel's life; yields covenant lawsuit material and stipulates blessings/curses.

- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)**
 - Phrase used to indicate the Mosaic covenant's demanding, obedience-centered stipulations; Dempster maintains this descriptive without collapsing the Mosaic into a purely works-based soteriology.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The broader redemptive-historical covenant within which the prophets frame hope for restoration and promise-fulfillment.

- **Covenant Lawsuit (rib / "legal metaphor")**
 - Genre label for prophetic indictments that adopt the language and structure of a legal accusation.

- **Covenant Renewal**
 - Prophetic calls to repentance and re-commitment to covenant fidelity; ritual and moral dimensions.

- **Judgment and Restoration**
 - Dual themes: prophets announce covenant sanctions (judgment) while preserving the promise-sphere (future restoration).

- **Typology / Christological fulfillment**
 - Prophetic anticipations seen as pointers to final covenantal fulfillment in the Messiah.

- **Suzerain-Vassal Treaty motifs**
 - Background treaties inform prophetic language of obligations, loyalty, and curse/blessing patterns.

- **Covenantal History**
 - The narrative progression in which law, prophetic indictment, exile, and restoration play coherent roles.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise definitional source for the prophetic-covenantal relationship in biblical-theological surveys.
 - As a polemical corrective against readings that separate law and prophecy or that downplay Mosaic covenant obligations.
 - As an exegetical model for preaching: mapping prophetic oracles into covenant lawsuit and renewal homiletics.
