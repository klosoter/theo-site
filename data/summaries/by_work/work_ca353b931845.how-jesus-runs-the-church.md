### TITLE
How Jesus Runs the Church - Guy Prentiss Waters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed ecclesiology (21st century). Waters writes from a confessional Presbyterian/Reformed standpoint, addressing post-20th-century debates about covenant, justification, and church order.
 - Milieu: reaction to revisionist currents (Federal Vision, New Perspective on Paul) and renewed interest in ecclesial identity and discipline within conservative Presbyterian bodies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ governs his church personally and institutionally; this rule is exercised **by covenantal means of grace through appointed offices and ordered discipline**, not by diffuse popular sovereignty or purely spiritual charisma.
 - Problem addressed: how to relate Christ's invisible headship to visible structures (offices, courts, sacraments) without undermining either divine rule or ordered ministry.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical data for Christ's headship and the nature of his rule over the church.
 - Historical-theological defense of Presbyterian polity as a faithful ordering of Christ's rule:
 - Offices: qualifications, distinctions between ruling and teaching functions, relation of elders and pastors.
 - Courts and discipline: session, presbytery, synod as means for administering Christ's rule and protecting covenant purity.
 - Doctrinal safeguards: relationship of covenant theology, justification, and sacraments to ecclesiology - ensuring justification remains forensic and Christ-centered while union with Christ grounds sacramental participation.
 - Polemical correction of contemporary errors:
 - Against monocovenantal or Federal Vision tendencies that conflate covenant membership with salvific status.
 - Against New Perspective emphases that relativize forensic imputation or recast justification as primarily covenantal participation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary sources: Scripture, Westminster Standards, classical Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin, Westminster divines).
 - Interlocutors: proponents of the Federal Vision/monocovenantal interpretations; advocates of New Perspective on Paul (e.g., N. T. Wright implicitly); modern Presbyterian debates over offices and discipline.
 - Engages recent ecclesial controversies in North American Presbyterianism and evangelical Reformed circles.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (headship, mediatorial rule)
 - Ecclesiology (office, polity, sacraments, marks of the church)
 - Covenant theology (covenantal administration, federal representation)
 - Soteriology (justification: forensic imputation; union with Christ)
 - Pastoral theology and discipline

- **Closing line**
 - Waters locates the church's life and order under the concrete lordship of Christ: faithful polity and discipline are not human power plays but the church's obedient structuring of Christ's rule through appointed offices and covenantal means of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of Christ's personal headship with concrete, ordered Presbyterian structures-treats polity as theological, not merely practical.
 - Insists that offices and courts mediate Christ's rule without replacing or relativizing his sole mediatorship.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Federal Vision/monocovenantal tendencies that blur covenantal membership and final justification; defends a distinction between covenant administration and forensic justification.
 - Contrasts with New Perspective tendencies by reasserting imputed righteousness and forensic legal standing as central to justification while affirming the importance of covenantal union for sanctification and sacramental life.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise framing of "Christ's rule through offices" as a theological axiom linking headship + ordered means (rather than simply hierarchical control or congregational autonomy).
 - Careful lexical separation of covenantal participation (union, membership) from juridical declaration (imputation).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in confessional Presbyterian circles as a robust defense of classical polity and discipline.
 - Cited in debates over Federal Vision and New Perspective as a succinct corrective that preserves forensic justification while honoring covenantal realities.
 - Used by pastors and presbyteries seeking a theological warrant for consistent discipline and office-bearer practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, systematic bridge between Christology and polity-useful for teaching elders, pastors, and seminarians.
 - Pragmatic and theological resource for churches wrestling with discipline, sacraments, and ecclesial identity in an age of doctrinal flux.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ's headship** - The primary axiom: Christ as the sole head of the church; polity is the church's structured expression of that headship.
- **Office(s)** - Ecclesial functions (elders/rulers, pastors/teachers); offices mediate Christ's governance without supplanting his mediatorship.
- **Session / Presbytery / Synod** - Ordered courts through which Christ's rule is administered; essential for discipline and accountability.
- **Discipline** - Means of preserving covenant purity and care for souls; ecclesial, not merely social, correction.
- **Covenant (federal) administration** - Distinguishes visible covenant membership and means of grace from the finality of saving justification.
 - Contrast: **monocovenantalism (Federal Vision)** often collapses visible covenant membership into soteriological guarantees - Waters resists this collapse.
- **Justification (forensic imputation)** - Legal declaration of righteousness by faith; central and non-negotiable for Waters against NPP and Federal Vision encroachments.
- **Union with Christ** - Basis for sacramental participation and sanctification; related to but distinct from forensic imputation.
- **Sacraments as means of grace** - Efficacious within God's covenantal economy but not automatic guarantees of salvation.
- **Monocovenantalism** - Identified as a problematic emphasis in some Federal Vision strains; Waters highlights its risks to forensic soteriology.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - Treated as an interpretive challenge to forensic imputation; Waters defends classical readings of Paul.
- **Forensic vs. participatory language** - Maintains both languages but insists they are complementary, not interchangeable.
- **Presbyterian polity** - Presented as the biblical and covenantal ordering that best embodies Christ's rule.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for linking Christological headship to concrete offices and courts.
 - As a **polemic** or corrective against Federal Vision/monocovenantal conflations and NPP diminutions of imputation.
 - As an **exegetical-model** resource for pastors teaching discipline, sacraments, and office qualifications.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology courses to connect covenant theology, soteriology, and polity.
