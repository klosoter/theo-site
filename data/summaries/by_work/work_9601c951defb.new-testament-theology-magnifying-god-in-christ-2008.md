### TITLE
**Thomas R. Schreiner - New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ (2008)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2008 within late 20th/early 21st-century evangelical-Reformed scholarship; aimed at consolidating New Testament teaching into a coherent, theological synthesis with pastoral and seminary reach.
 - Moves against fragmentation of NT studies by recovering a canonical, Christ-centered reading of the New Testament.

- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament coheres around the theme that **God is magnified in Christ**; Christ is the center of revelation so that all NT theology (salvation, church, eschatology, Israel) must be read Christocentrically.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method and theological center - canonical, Christ-centered, Trinitarian orientation.
 - Part II: Systematic traversal of major NT loci (Christology, atonement, justification, Spirit, church, mission, eschatology) with close readings of canonical authors.
 - Part III: Applied syntheses tying NT teaching back to the magnification of God in Christ.
 - Major exegetical move: integration of historical-grammatical exegesis with theological synthesis, resisting reductive historical-critical or sociological-only readings.
 - Specific treatment of Romans 11 (topic cited): affirms Paul's olive-tree motif and argues for **continued covenant promises to Israel**, a corporate hardening until the fullness of the Gentiles with an eschatological restoration of a believing Israel (see Romans 11:25-27).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Extensive interaction with canonical NT authors (Paul, Hebrews, Johannine corpus, Synoptics), contemporary NT scholars across the theological spectrum, and classic Reformed theologians (Calvin et al.).
 - Dialogues with proponents of supersessionism, liberal critical reconstructions, and recent redemptive-historical scholars.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology, Trinity, Atonement, Justification, Union with Christ, Spirit, Ecclesiology, Mission, Eschatology, Covenant theology (esp. Israel-church relations).

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner's theological center of gravity: **the New Testament's message is the glory of God displayed in and through Christ, and doctrine must be read and ordered to magnify God in Christ.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Explicitly Christocentric organizing principle: every NT text is interpreted to show how God is magnified in Christ.
 - Robust integration of biblical-theological and systematic concerns - not merely history-of-religions or purely theological abstraction.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against supersessionist simplifications by affirming **covenantal continuity** with a future for ethnic Israel (exemplified in Romans 11 treatment).
 - Counterposes to liberal-critical fragmentation by insisting on theological unity and canonical reading.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The titular rubric "magnifying God in Christ" as a hermeneutical lens, rather than solely Christology or soteriology.
 - Precise use of covenantal language to mediate continuity/discontinuity debates (remnant, hardening, fullness of Gentiles).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries as a clear, readable NT theology; praised for balance of exegetical rigor and theological synthesis.
 - Critiques typically come from critical-historical and some postliberal circles that desire more socio-rhetorical nuance or different canonical priorities.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a go-to synthetic resource for pastors and students seeking an orthodox, Christ-centered NT theology that responsibly engages Romans 11 and the problem of Israel's future.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Magnifying God in Christ** - central hermeneutical principle: the NT reveals God's glory supremely in the person and work of Christ.
- **Christocentric reading** - reading all NT texts with Christ as the focal interpretive horizon.
- **Already / not-yet** - eschatological framework for inaugurated kingdom realities and future consummation.
- **Covenant continuity** - affirmation that God's covenants with Israel remain the matrix for NT promises; not fully abrogated.
- **Remnant** - theological category for faithful Israel within Paul's argument (linked to election and mercy).
- **Hardening / fullness of the Gentiles** - Pauline pattern (Romans 11) explaining present Jewish unbelief and future restoration of Israel.
- **Olive-tree metaphor (Romans 11)** - used exegetically to argue for ingrafting of Gentiles and continued place for natural branches (Israel) in God's plan.
- **Union with Christ** - soteriological center for justification, sanctification, and eschatological participation.
- **Justification** - forensic declaration tied to union with Christ and the gospel.
- **New covenant** - Christ's fulfillment and expansion of covenantal promises; continuity with OT yet eschatologically fulfilled.
- **Eschatological future of Israel** - Schreiner affirms future, corporate turning of Israel as part of redemptive-historical consummation.
- **Canonical theological method** - reading the NT as theological unity within canonical borders.
- **Atonement motifs** - penal substitutionary emphasis combined with broader covenantal benefits.
- **Ecclesiology and mission** - church as covenant people called to witness the magnified God in Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical New Testament theology and Christ-centered hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic** against simplistic supersessionism and against approaches that dislocate Christ from canonical reading.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline theology (notably Romans 9-11) showing how to integrate textual exegesis with theological synthesis.
