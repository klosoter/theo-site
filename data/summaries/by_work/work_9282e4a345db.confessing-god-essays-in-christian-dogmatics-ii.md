### TITLE
Confessing God: Essays in Christian Dogmatics II - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century English-language Reformed/Anglican dogmatics; Webster writing from Cambridge/St Andrews contexts within a churchly, confessional revival of systematic theology.
 - Moves against private-language theology, late modern reductionisms, and some forms of analytic abstraction; seeks retrieval of classical resources (Calvin, Barth, Aquinas) incarnated in contemporary scholarship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Dogmatics must confess the triune, incarnate God as known only in God's self-revelation in the Word; theological language about God (including talk of attributes) is governed by revelation, worship, and the economy of redemption rather than by detached metaphysical speculation.
 - Problem addressed: how to speak of divine attributes coherently without fragmenting God into a list of abstract properties or reducing attributes to mere analogies to creaturely predicates.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology begins with the Word (Scripture and the incarnate Word) and proceeds confessionally; theological predication is thus performative (doctrinal language as doxology).
 - Attributes are to be read through the lens of the Trinity and the incarnation - relational and economic dimensions are primary.
 - Critique of treatments that separate "absolute" (in se) from "relative" (to creatures) attributes without anchoring either in God's self‑disclosure.
 - Recovery of a disciplined dogmatic method that holds ontology, revelation, and liturgical confession together.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Close engagement with Karl Barth (adoptive and critical), Calvin and Reformed tradition, Thomas Aquinas (selective retrieval), T. F. Torrance, Hans Urs von Balthasar; selective conversation with contemporary analytic and philosophical theology regarding attributes and divine simplicity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of God (attributes, simplicity, aseity), Trinity, Christology (incarnation as hermeneutical key), revelation and Scripture, theological method (confession, language, doxology).

- **Closing line**
 - Webster insists that right doctrine of God is not primarily metaphysical taxonomy but the church's faithful confession of the triune, self‑revealing God in Word and sacrament - attributes are intelligible only within that confessing context.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Word‑centered dogmatics: revelation (Scripture and Christ) governs all predication about God.
 - Confessional and ecclesial posture: theology as public, churchly speech rather than private metaphysics.
 - Integration of Trinitarian and Christological priority for understanding attributes.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects forms of classical metaphysical abstraction that treat attributes as separable entities; resists analytic theologians who reify predicates apart from covenantal and incarnational economy.
 - Modifies Barthian emphases by insisting more strongly on the church's linguistic practices and historical doctrines as mediating revelation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the performative/doxological character of theological language.
 - Reframes the "absolute vs relative attributes" distinction so that both sorts of predication are read through revelation and Trinitarian relation rather than as autonomous ontological categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in contemporary Reformed and Anglican academic theology; used as exemplar of rigorous, confessional dogmatics.
 - Provoked engagement from analytic theologians and those committed to metaphysical theology; received praise for clarity and critique for being less formally systematic in metaphysical modeling.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to teach attributes in a way that keeps Trinity and Incarnation central.
 - Provides a robust corrective to both liberal reductionism and abstract metaphysical theology; valuable for seminaries, doctoral training, and confessional debate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God**
 - Revelation as the primary horizon for theological predication; Christ as the definitive Word.

- **Confession / Confessional speech**
 - Theology as ecclesial, public, doxological language; not private metaphysics.

- **Absolute and Relative Attributes**
 - Webster's reorientation: traditional labels (absolute = in se, relative = in relation) must be interpreted in light of revelation; attributes are never purely abstract but always intelligible within God's triune self‑relation and economy.

- **Trinity (Trinitarian priority)**
 - The relational life of Father, Son, Spirit is the frame for understanding all divine properties.

- **Incarnation (Christological hermeneutic)**
 - The Word become flesh discloses how divine attributes are manifest and to be spoken of.

- **Divine Simplicity**
 - Treated critically and carefully; warns against unqualified metaphysical readings that sever doctrine from revelation.

- **Aseity**
 - God's self‑existence is affirmed but articulated in relation to God's self‑communication.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Used to emphasize intratrinitarian relation as explanatory context for attributes.

- **Doxology**
 - Terms about God shaped by worship and confession; theological sentences function as praise.

- **Revelation vs. Metaphysics**
 - Constant tension: Webster privileges revelatory norms over abstract speculation.

- **Doctrine as Exegetical‑Systematic Practice**
 - Exegesis and dogmatics are integrated; doctrinal claims must be rooted in Scriptural witness.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for a confessionally framed doctrine of attributes and God's being.
 - As a **polemic** against metaphysical atomization of attributes and secularizing theological methods.
 - As an **exegetical‑dogmatic model** that locates theological predication in the economy (Trinity/Incarnation) and liturgical confession.
