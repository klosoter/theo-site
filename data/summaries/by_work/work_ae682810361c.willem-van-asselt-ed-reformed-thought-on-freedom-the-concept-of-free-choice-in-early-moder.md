### TITLE
Willem van Asselt, ed., Reformed Thought on Freedom: The Concept of Free Choice in Early Modern Reformed Theology - entry on **Francis Turretin** (secondary treatment). Contextualized use for the topic: **Vocation, Dominion and the Cultural Mandate**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early modern Reformed scholasticism (17th century); Turretin (1623-1687), Geneva Academy professor; work surveyed in a late 20th/early 21st-century collection edited by Willem van Asselt that recovers and compares Reformed accounts of free choice.
 - Milieu: post-Reformation controversies with Arminianism and Roman Catholic scholasticism; emphasis on precision, loci method, and reconciliation of divine sovereignty with human obligation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Turretin defends a Reformed **compatibilist** account of human freedom: human acts are voluntary and morally responsible though causally determined by motives, temperament, and divine providence. He rejects libertas indifferentiae (the power to will either contrary without decisive motive).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of will and freedom: clarifies terms (liberum arbitrium, libertas indifferentiae, moral necessity).
 - Argument against libertas indifferentiae:
 - Claims it is metaphysically incoherent and biblically unsupported.
 - Maintains that willing always follows the proximate motive and that the will is moved by the strongest inclination.
 - Positive account (compatibilist model):
 - Distinguishes physical/causal necessity from moral necessity; moral necessity does not remove voluntariness.
 - Explains human responsibility under divine providence and predestination: God ordains ends and means without violating secondary causality.
 - Applies to conversion: grace is efficacious, heals the will without introducing coercion.
 - Pastoral/practical move: relates freedom to law, duty, and the calling of believers in ordinary vocations.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Opponents: Arminians (esp. on prevenient freedom), Roman Catholic scholastics who affirm different nuances of free will, contemporary Reformed peers.
 - Uses Scripture, Augustine, Reformation confessions, and scholastic logical categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, predestination, grace (efficacious), human will and sin, moral responsibility, and practical theology of vocation/dominion.

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's theology centers on a disciplined compatibilism: human freedom is real and morally accountable but coherently subordinate to God's sovereign ordering of creation, redemption, and vocation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing kinds of necessity (physical vs moral) and kinds of freedom (voluntary vs indifferent).
 - Strong insistence that true freedom consists in voluntary action according to one's inclinations, not in metaphysical indifference.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived Arminian overreach that supposed libertas indifferentiae is necessary for moral responsibility.
 - Pushes back on any reading of Augustine or scholastics that conflates freedom with spontaneity apart from motives.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of scholastic logical distinctions to pastoral and ethical questions (e.g., how efficacious grace and human consent cohere through secondary causality).
 - Recasting freedom as a theological category integrated into covenantal and providential structures.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in later Reformed orthodoxy, and in Anglo-American confessional circles (Princeton, some Puritan receptions).
 - Frequently cited by modern compatibilist defenders and historians seeking clear articulations against Arminianism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating rigorous metaphysical distinctions with pastoral concerns (vocation, work, dominion).
 - Useful corrective to modern libertarian intuitions about autonomy; clarifies how responsibility and divine sovereignty coexist.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Libertas indifferentiae** - the alleged power to will either contrary without any determining motive; rejected by Turretin as unreal and unnecessary for moral responsibility.
- **Liberum arbitrium (free choice)** - Turretin's careful use: capacity to choose according to inclinations; voluntary though not indeterminate.
- **Moral necessity** - actions follow from a firm inclination or motive without external coercion; preserves voluntariness and responsibility.
- **Physical/causal necessity** - deterministic causation in nature; distinct from the moral necessity relevant to willing.
- **Compatibilism** - position Turretin champions: divine determinism (in providence and grace) is compatible with human moral freedom.
- **Secondary causality** - creatures genuinely cause effects; divine governance orders these causes without obliterating them.
- **Efficacious grace** - divine action that infallibly brings about conversion while respecting voluntariness.
- **Predestination / election** - theological framework within which freedom is situated; no contradiction between electing grace and responsible human consent.
- **Sin and bondage of the will** - the will is bound by sin prior to regeneration; freedom restored through efficacious grace.
- **Vocation / calling** - human callings are real moral obligations under providence; freedom here is stewardship, not autonomous license.
- **Dominion / cultural mandate** - human exercise of dominion is a responsible use of freedom under divine law and providential ordering; freedom enables duty-filled stewardship rather than unchecked autonomy.
- **Responsibility** - center of Turretin's practical ethics: freedom exists where blame and praise meaningfully attach.

- How this work (Turretin, as treated in van Asselt) is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed compatibilist accounts of freedom and critiques of libertas indifferentiae.
 - As a **polemic** in debates with Arminianism and certain libertarian readings of human autonomy.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline texts on will, grace, and responsibility.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in connecting doctrines of providence and election to practical theology of vocation, dominion, and cultural mandate.
