### TITLE
**Redeeming Sociology: A God-Centered Approach** - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed intellectual milieu; a corrective within neo-Calvinist/Kuyperian lines to the secular social sciences. Intended for Christian social scientists, pastors, and theological students seeking to integrate rigorous theology with sociological method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Sociology as a discipline must be reclaimed and reoriented under the lordship of Christ; sociological questions, concepts, and methods cannot be neutral but require theological grounding to avoid distortion by sin and secular ideologies.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: secular sociology presupposes naturalistic metaphysics, reductionist anthropology, and ahistorical teleologies.
 - Theological foundation: deploys doctrines of the Trinity, creation (including the image of God), fall, redemption (including adoption), covenant, and eschatology to reframe social analysis.
 - Methodological program: proposes a God-centered sociology that (a) uses theological categories as interpretive lenses, (b) treats institutions and cultures as fallen yet redeemable arenas of vocation, and (c) retains disciplined empirical engagement while interpreting data theologically.
 - Applied loci: ecclesiology (marks and nature of the church), church/state relations (sphere-sovereignty and vocation), dominion/culture mandate, and eschatological hope shaping social goals.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Abraham Kuyper (antithesis, sphere sovereignty), Herman Bavinck, John Calvin, Augustine, classic Reformed confessions, and contemporary sociological literature (critiqued broadly rather than by exhaustive engagement with any single sociologist). Also conversant with Christ-and-culture typologies (e.g., Niebuhr) and reformational social thought.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (as formative for social relations), creation and the imago Dei, sin and social corruption, redemption (including adoption language), covenantal social ordering, church (one, holy, catholic, apostolic), sacraments in corporate identity, eschatology (already / not-yet).
- **Closing line:** Theologically disciplined sociology reconceives social reality as created, fallen, and being restored by Christ, thereby transforming both how Christians study society and how the church exercises its public vocation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Theological presuppositionalism for social science:** theological commitments should function as constitutive interpretive lenses, not merely optional add-ons.
 - **Redemption of disciplines:** rather than rejecting sociology, Poythress urges its reformation - keeping useful methods while repudiating idolatries of autonomy and progress.
 - **Integration of adoption theology into social identity:** adoption as a model for restored social belonging and relational reconstitution within the church and society.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Against secular functionalism and positivism that abstract persons into variables.
 - Against pietistic withdrawalism that refuses cultural engagement; contrasts with naïve accommodation that absorbs secular presuppositions.
 - Develops Kuyperian antithesis with sharper theological anchors (Trinity, covenant, eschatology).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts social institutions as **vocations** and **sphere-responsibilities** under Christ rather than neutral structures; emphasizes **redeemability** of cultural practices.
 - Frames ecclesial marks and sacramental identity as social-theological diagnostics for healthy communal life.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed academic circles and seminaries for bridging theology and social sciences.
 - Influential for pastors and Christian social researchers seeking a confessional alternative to secular sociology.
 - Limited uptake among mainstream sociologists but serves as a touchstone for reformational social thought.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a disciplined template for Christian engagement with social science.
 - Useful for courses on Christian social ethics, ecclesiology in public life, and theology of vocation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered sociology:** The programmatic alternative to secular sociology; theology ordains interpretation.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Anthropological axiom grounding human dignity, relationality, and social responsibility.
- **Adoption:** Both soteriological reality and model for social belonging; used to explain transformed identity and community formation.
- **Covenant community:** Social framework for ecclesiology and public order; mutual obligations shape institutions.
- **Vocation / calling:** All social roles and institutions are vocations under Christ's lordship; resists privatization of faith.
- **Dominion / culture mandate:** Cultivation and stewardship of creation reframed as theological mandate for cultural engagement.
- **Sphere sovereignty / church-state relations:** Kuyperian-inflected ordering of authorities; church and state distinct yet accountable to Christ.
 - Emphasizes cooperation without absorption; warns both theocracy and secular absolutism.
- **Marks / nature of the church:** Reformation ecclesiology applied sociologically - unity, holiness, catholicity, apostolicity as social health indicators.
- **Sacraments as social signs:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper function as communal identity and sociological instruments of grace.
- **Redemption of disciplines:** The methodological claim that secular academic fields can be reformed under Christian doctrine.
- **Presuppositional critique of secularism:** Exposes hidden metaphysics shaping sociological categories.
- **Already / not-yet eschatology:** Shapes social hope and realistic appraisal of reform vs. restoration.
- **Social institutions:** Viewed as arenas of sin, grace, and vocation - not merely functional aggregates.
- **Common grace:** Grounds pluralism and social goods without collapsing distinctively Christian aims.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for what a theologically informed sociology entails (methodological catechism).
 - As a **polemic** against secular social-scientific presuppositions and against Christian accommodationism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for deploying biblical doctrines (covenant, adoption, imago Dei) into analyses of church life, social institutions, and public policy.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking ecclesiology, vocation, and cultural mandate for curricula in Christian social ethics and public theology.
