### TITLE
De Unitate Intellectus Contra Averroistas - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-13th century Paris disputations (c. 1270s). Written amid the Latin reception of Aristotle via Averroes and the rise of "Averroism" at the University of Paris; part of Aquinas's broader effort to integrate Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A refutation of the Averroist claim that there is one single (separate or material) intellect shared by all humans. Aquinas defends the individual, subsistent intellectual soul and the psychosomatic unity of the human person.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Denies that a universal, numerically one intellect can account for distinct individual thought and moral responsibility.
 - Argues from metaphysics: individuation requires a principle of form that is numerically distinct in each human; the intellect (as form or subsistent power) must be individualized to account for personal thought and immortality.
 - Appeals to the unity of soul and body (hylomorphism): the intellectual soul is the form of a particular body, not a detached, shared material faculty.
 - Distinguishes the active (agent) intellect and possible (passive) intellect while insisting neither entails a single shared intellect in the human community.
 - Uses scriptural, philosophical (Aristotle), and ecclesial norms to show Averroist conclusions contradict Christian teaching on individual immortality and moral accountability.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Aristotle (especially De Anima and Metaphysics), Averroes (Ibn Rushd) and his Latin interpreters, contemporary Parisian Averroists (e.g., Sigerian circle). Aquinas also presupposes patristic and ecclesiastical commitments implicitly.
- **Doctrines treated:** Human nature and anthropology (psychosomatic unity); the intellect and its powers; immortality of the soul; metaphysics of form and individuation; relation of philosophy to faith.
- **Closing line:** The treatise locates the human person as a unified, individual substance - an intellectual soul as the form of a body - thereby safeguarding personal thought, moral responsibility, and hope of immortality against the reductive universalism of Averroism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong, systematic defense of the human soul as an individual, subsistent form in a hylomorphic framework.
 - Emphasis on the coherence of personal cognition with individuation and moral accountability.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Averroes: rejects the thesis of one numerically identical intellect for all humans and the implied denial of personal immortality.
 - Refines Aristotle rather than simply repeating him: preserves Aristotelian psychology while adapting its metaphysical commitments to Christian anthropology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the Thomistic deployment of *intellectus agens* (agent intellect) and *intellectus possibilis* (possible intellect) within a doctrine of individual subsistence.
 - Articulates a thesis of the soul as a *subsistent form* that grounds individuality without reifying a Cartesian res cogitans separation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Key text in the anti-Averroist movement; pivotal for later medieval scholastics and the consolidation of Thomism at Paris and beyond.
 - In Reformed and Protestant contexts the work was less directly authoritative, but its arguments for personal immortality and psychosomatic unity influenced broader confessional anthropology debates.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of confessional philosophical theology: how to use philosophical rigor to defend theological commitments.
 - Continuing resource in debates on personal identity, mind-body relations, and the metaphysics of the person.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Averroism:** The set of doctrines (from Averroes and Latin followers) asserting, inter alia, a single universal intellect shared by all humans; target of Aquinas's refutation.
- **Unity of the intellect (de unitate intellectus):** The debated claim that intellectual cognition in humans is performed by one numerically single intellect.
- **Intellectus agens (agent intellect):** The active aspect in Aristotelian psychology - Aquinas retains the term but denies its identification with a single shared faculty that obliterates individual thought.
- **Intellectus possibilis (possible/passive intellect):** The receptive power that abstracts intelligible forms; Aquinas insists it must be individualized to ground personal thought.
- **Hylomorphism:** The doctrine that soul is the form of the body; central to Aquinas's rejection of a shared, separate intellect.
- **Subsistent form:** The notion that certain forms (notably the intellective soul) subsist and thus have individual ontological status; used to secure immortality and personal identity.
- **Individuation:** The metaphysical problem of how numeric difference arises; Aquinas argues individuality of intellect is required for distinct personal cognition.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** The Thomistic claim that human beings are unified composites of soul and body; the work defends this unity against atomizing or universalizing theories.
- **Personal immortality:** The theological doctrine that each human soul survives bodily death; Aquinas links this to the individuality and subsistence of the intellective soul.
- **Double truth (implicit critique):** The notion that philosophical truth might conflict with theological truth; Aquinas's method implicitly rejects such bifurcation by harmonizing reason and faith.
- **Moral responsibility / individual culpability:** Practical-theological concern that a shared intellect would undermine praise, blame, and salvation - central to his polemic.
- **Exegetical Aristotelianism:** Aquinas's reading of Aristotle that is faithful yet corrigible in light of Christian doctrine.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Thomistic anthropology and the metaphysics of the person.
- As a **polemic** against philosophical positions (Averroism) that threaten doctrinal claims (immortality, responsibility).
- As an **exegetical model** for reconciling Aristotle with Christian doctrine in medieval and contemporary philosophical theology.
