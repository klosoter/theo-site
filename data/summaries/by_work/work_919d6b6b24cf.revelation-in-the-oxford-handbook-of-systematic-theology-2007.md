### TITLE
Revelation - John Webster, in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology (2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** early 21st-century Anglican systematic theology shaped by post-Barthian Reformed retrieval and ecumenical engagement; contribution to a comprehensive handbook aimed at mapping loci of systematic theology for contemporary scholarship and church practice.
- **Central thesis:** Revelation is God's sovereign self-disclosure in and through Christ as a single, saving act that is normative for theology; Scripture, preaching and sacramental mediation witness to and participate in that act rather than function as autonomous sources.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Begins with a theological-practical critique of modern epistemologies that domesticate revelation into human conceptual schemes.
 - Recasts revelation as a **divine act** (not merely a set of propositions): God's address to creation culminating in the incarnation.
 - Distinguishes and relates **general** and **special** revelation:
 - General revelation: God's disclosure in creation and providence - true but insufficient for saving knowledge.
 - Special revelation: particular, saving revelation in Christ, mediated by Scripture, Spirit, and church.
 - Emphasizes the **Trinitarian** grammar of revelation: Father who reveals, Son who is revealed (the content), Spirit who actualizes reception and witness.
 - Locates Scripture as the church's normative witness to the revelation-event - authoritative because it mediates the Word, not because it replaces the living act.
- **Figures/sources/interlocutors:** engages classical sources (Scripture, Augustine), Reformation witnesses (Calvinian emphases on Word and Spirit), and modern theologians especially Karl Barth; conversant with critiques from Enlightenment natural theology and contemporary epistemology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (general/special), Trinity, Christology (incarnation as center), pneumatology (witness/actualization), doctrine of Scripture (witness and mediation), soteriology (knowledge as salvific participation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Revelation is fundamentally the triune God's saving self-disclosure in the person of Christ, which Scripture and the church faithfully witness and mediate by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Act-centered model:** Webster consistently prioritizes revelation as an event or act of God rather than a corpus of static propositions; this recovers the dynamic, interpersonal character of divine disclosure.
- **Trinitarian mediation:** Clarifies that revelation must be read through a Trinitarian lens - the Son is the content, the Spirit the one who makes that content present and effective for faith.
- **Balanced view of Scripture:** Treats Scripture as authoritative precisely because it is the church's normative **witness** to the revelatory act; resists both bibliolatry (Scripture as self-explanatory object) and voluntaristic reduction (Scripture as merely human testimony).
- **Correctives to predecessors:**
 - To Enlightenment naturalism: resists reducing revelation to mere data available to autonomous reason.
 - To some strands of propositional revelation: resists making revelation solely a set of detached propositions; insists on relational/performative dimensions.
 - While indebted to Barth, Webster refines Barthian themes by more sustained attention to ecclesial and sacramental mediation.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Language of revelation as "event-witness-mediation" triad; emphasis on the interplay of objective divine act and subjective reception by Spirit-enabled faith.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely regarded in contemporary Reformed and Anglican academic circles as a robust retrieval of classical Reformation emphases reframed for postmodern critics; influential in renewing attention to Word-Sacrament-Spirit dynamics.
- **Enduring value:** Valuable for courses on theology of revelation, doctrine of Scripture, and Trinitarian theology; aids teachers who need a theologically coherent alternative to reductionist epistemologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (act):** God's self-disclosure as an event rather than merely propositional content.
- **General revelation:** God's manifest presence in creation and providence - intelligible but non-salvific apart from special revelation.
- **Special revelation:** The particular, saving disclosure of God in Christ and mediated by Scripture, Spirit, and church.
- **Word (Verbum):** Threefold nuance - the Son as the Word (incarnate), the preached/written Word as witness, and the Spirit who actualizes the Word.
- **Mediation:** The church, Scripture, sacraments and preaching as means by which the revelatory event is borne and made present.
- **Trinitarian grammar:** Framework where Father reveals, Son is revealed, Spirit effects reception and testimony.
- **Scripture as witness:** Scripture's authority derives from its participatory role in witnessing the revelation-event, not from autonomous self-authorization.
- **Event-witness-mediation triad:** Conceptual schema for understanding how revelation occurs and is appropriated.
- **Objective/subjective relation:** Tension resolved by locating truth in God's act (objective) and faithful reception by Spirit-wrought faith (subjective).
- **Natural theology:** Treated critically as limited; useful for general knowledge but inadequate for saving knowledge of God.
- **Propositional language:** Recognized as necessary but insufficient - propositions function within the broader event/witness context.
- **Soteriological knowledge:** Knowledge of God defined by participation in the salvific relation inaugurated by Christ.
- **Authority (of theological claims):** Grounded in the triune act and the church's faithful witness.
- **Analogy of revelation:** Employed with caution - analogical language mediates finite speech about the infinite revelatory act.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for contemporary doctrine of revelation that centers the incarnate Word.
- As a **polemic** against reductive natural theology and secular epistemologies.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for doctrines of Scripture, Trinity and sacramental mediation - useful for constructing a coherent ecclesial theology of witness.
