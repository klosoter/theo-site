### TITLE
Spiritual Gifts: Five Views - Edited by Thomas R. Schreiner and C. Samuel Storms

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical debate (late 20th-early 21st century). Situated in the aftermath of 20th-century Pentecostal/charismatic renewal and the resurgence of Reformed theology; aims to map fault lines within evangelicalism over pneumatology and ecclesial practice.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Are miraculous and charismatic gifts normative for the church today? The volume does not advance a single thesis but presents and critiques five rival models about the continuation, cessation, nature, and normative use of spiritual gifts.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Each view is articulated in a self-contained defense chapter (exegesis, theology, history, pastoral/practical implications).
 - Responses from the other view proponents follow (testing coherence, scriptural adequacy, historical fit).
 - Editors supplement with synthesis/comments highlighting key convergences and irreducible disagreements.
- **Major moves common to contributors:**
 - Exegetical center: readings of 1 Corinthians 12-14, Acts 2-5, Mark 16, Ephesians 4, and Old Testament prophecy.
 - Historical theology: patristic witness, medieval and Reformation handling of gifts, and modern charismatic renewal.
 - Theological systematics: integration with pneumatology, canon/continuity of revelation, ecclesiology, and eschatology.
 - Practical pastoral ramifications: worship order, discernment, pastoral oversight, and ministry formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Broadly engages continuationist and cessationist traditions, academic exegesis, patristic and Reformation texts, and contemporary charismatic literature. Interlocutors include both conservative Reformed critics and Pentecostal/charismatic advocates (the volume is dialogical rather than monographic).
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (primary), revelation/Canon, ecclesiology (gifts in the life of the church), soteriology (relation of gifts to sanctification and ministry), eschatology (sign-gifts as eschatological markers), hermeneutics (normative vs descriptive texts).
- **Closing line:** A mapped, dialogical treatment exposing that debates over spiritual gifts hinge less on isolated texts and more on differing commitments about the nature of revelation, the present work of the Spirit, and how the church discerns and orders charismatic activity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Plural-view method:** Structured presentation of five competing theological positions with internal defenses and mutual responses; emphasizes charity and critical engagement across camps.
- **Exegetical thoroughness:** Strong insistence that debates must be settled by linguistic, canonical, and historical exegesis of key New Testament texts rather than popular anecdotes or contemporary experience alone.
- **Integration of pastoral concerns:** Avoids purely theoretical treatment; each view addresses congregational order, oversight, and the pastoral risks/benefits of endorsing or denying charismatic praxis.
- **Corrective emphases:**
 - To extreme continuationists: presses on biblical limits, misuses of prophecy/tongues, and the need for discernment/authority.
 - To extreme cessationists: presses on weight of New Testament practice and patristic references suggesting continuance of signs beyond apostolic era.
- **Conceptual aids:** Clarifies normative vs. descriptive claims about Scripture, and distinguishes between "sign gifts" (eschatological attestations) and "edifying gifts" (ongoing ministry functions).
- **Reception and influence:** Valued in seminaries for its pedagogical format; serves as a standard reference for courses on spiritual gifts, useful for pastors mediating congregational conflicts; influential in both Reformed and broader evangelical circles for framing continuation/cessation debates.
- **Enduring value:** For teaching and research: a compact, balanced survey that models civil theological exchange and supplies exegetical resources and pragmatic frameworks for church practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism:** The view that sign/miraculous revelatory gifts ceased with the apostolic age or the close of the canon; arguments focus on apostolic foundationality and normative revelation.
- **Continuationism:** The view that charismatic and sign gifts continue today; appeals include ongoing Spirit activity, pastoral utility, and certain historical claims.
- **Charismatic / Pentecostal position:** Emphasizes frequent, expectant manifestations of tongues, prophecy, and healing as normative for worship and ministry.
- **Sign gifts:** Miraculous abilities (e.g., signs, wonders, apostolic-level revelations) often argued to function as evidence in the foundational era.
- **Edifying gifts:** Non-foundational gifts aimed at church growth and sanctification (e.g., teaching, administration, helps).
- **Normative vs. descriptive texts:** Distinction used to assess whether biblical accounts prescribe practice or describe occurrences tied to a specific historical moment.
- **Discernment / testing prophecy:** Practical criteria for evaluating claimed prophetic speech or charismatic manifestations in the church.
- **Canonical finality:** The theological claim that the closure of canonical revelation limits new propositional revelation.
- **Eschatological marker:** Use of signs/wonders as indicators of the inbreaking kingdom and last-days activity.
- **Patristic witness:** Historical data from the early church marshaled variously by both sides to support continuance or cessation.
- **Hermeneutical commitments:** Underlying hermeneutics (literalist, redemptive-historical, regulative) shape conclusions about gifts.
- **Pastoral order:** Implications for worship liturgy, eldership authority, and gift use policies.
- **Soteriological integration:** How gifts relate to sanctification, spiritual maturity, and assurance.
- **Practical theology:** Emphasis on policies for testing, disciplining, and training in charismatic contexts.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** mapping typical positions in the continuation/cessation spectrum.
- As a **polemic and critique resource** - each view's responses supply concentrated rebuttals.
- As an **exegetical model** for treating disputed passages with theological humility and critical rigor.
- As a **pedagogical pivot** in seminars and pastoral training to facilitate constructive dialog and local church policy formation.
