### TITLE
Plugged In (sections on public theology) - Daniel Strange

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical context (early 21st century). Addresses pastors, theologians, and engaged laity navigating media-saturated public life.
 - Situated amid renewed interest in public theology within conservative Reformed circles seeking resources for non-triumphalist cultural engagement.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian theology must account for faithful public engagement: how the church and Christians should interpret, inhabit, and influence public life while maintaining doctrinal integrity and pastoral prudence.
 - Core problem: avoid both withdrawal/pietism and uncritical assimilation or political triumphalism.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern public life fragments meaning; secular assumptions shape imagination and norms.
 - Theological foundations: Lordship of Christ, twofold kingdom language reframed by a Reformed account of common grace, creation mandate, and the church's prophetic witness.
 - Practical theology: models for ministry, cultural critique, civic participation, and formation of Christian character in public spaces.
 - Ecclesial locus: emphasis on the local church as primary agent of public formation; ministry practices over simplistic political formulas.
 - Pastoral safeguards: confessional fidelity, catechesis, and sacramental formation as preconditions for robust public theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and modern Reformed resources (Kuyperian and post-Kuyperian motifs) alongside engagement with Newbigin, Niebuhr, and contemporary evangelical public theologians.
 - Dialogues with cultural critics and media studies indirectly, to handle the phenomenology of modern public life.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and scripture (authoritative norms for public witness).
 - Providence and creation (basis for common good and cultural mandate).
 - Ecclesiology (church's identity and role in society).
 - Ethics and political theology (law, conscience, civic responsibility).
 - Eschatology (shaping hope and critique of present powers).

- **Closing line**
 - A concise, confessional Reformed account: faithful public theology emerges from robust doctrine and ecclesial formation, equipping Christians to critique culture and contribute to the common good without capitulation or dominionism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the church as the normative training ground for public engagement rather than an external toolkit for political activism.
 - Integrates cultural critique with pastoral formation - public theology as praxis rooted in catechesis and worship.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects pietistic withdrawal by insisting on sustained public presence grounded in scripture.
 - Challenges simplistic Kuyperian political triumphalism by warning against conflating cultural influence with ecclesial fidelity.
 - Distances itself from therapeutic or consumeristic evangelical engagement; emphasizes doctrinal formation over managerial strategies.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts common themes (lordship, cultural mandate) with a greater focus on practical ecclesial formation and media literacy rather than high-level political prescriptions.
 - Treats "public theology" as intrinsically pastoral - a move that reframes academic/public theology as service to local church praxis.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Reformed seminaries and churches seeking a balanced, confessional approach to culture.
 - Cited by pastors and teachers as a corrective to both activist and withdrawalist tendencies.
 - Influential in shaping curricula that combine doctrine, ethics, and cultural engagement.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a compact, doctrine-grounded framework for training leaders in public discernment.
 - Useful as a bridge text between systematic theology, ecclesiology, and practical theology courses.

 - As a definitional and pastoral source for integrating doctrine with public engagement strategies in preaching and pastoral training.

 - As an exegetical-model adjunct: practical exercises and case studies for ecclesial formation courses and seminars on public theology.
