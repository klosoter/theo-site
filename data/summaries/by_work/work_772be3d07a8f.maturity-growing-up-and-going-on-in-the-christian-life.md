### TITLE
Maturity: Growing Up and Going On in the Christian Life - Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical milieu; addresses postmodern/therapeutic trends in evangelicalism and a revival of classical Reformed pastoral theology and Puritan resources in conservative Protestant circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian maturity is a Spirit-wrought, Christ-centered progression from infancy to full competence in holiness and service; the book diagnoses immaturity in contemporary churches and outlines biblical means and markers for "growing up and going on."
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: identifies common signs of immaturity (consumerism, superficial piety, stunted obedience).
 - Biblical anthropology and goal: maturity defined in terms of union with Christ, conformity to his image, and use of gifts for the good of the body.
 - Means of growth: Word of God, Spirit's work, sacraments/means of grace, prayer, discipline and fellowship.
 - Practical formation: church practices, pastoral instruction, and personal disciplines that foster perseverance and service.
 - Integration: argues that spiritual gifts relate to sanctification - they are ordered to the building up of believers and evidence of growth, but must be governed by love and Christian character.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy use of Scripture (especially Pauline pastoral material), classical Reformed and Puritan writers (Calvin, Owen, Boston), contemporary evangelical pastoral literature; implicit critique of both antinomian moralism and charismatic consumerism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sanctification, union with Christ, pneumatology (Spirit and gifts), ecclesiology (means of grace, church discipline), soteriology (continuing effects of justification), Christian ethics and vocation.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Christian maturity is the Spirit-enabled, Word-shaped growth of believers into Christlike character and service within covenant community, where spiritual gifts are instruments of sanctification rather than substitutes for it.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Marries classical Reformed doctrines (union with Christ, means of grace) with a strong pastoral, practical concern for measurable growth and service.
 - Treats spiritual gifts not primarily as spectacular signs but as instruments ordered to sanctification and the church's health.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals:**
 - Corrects moralistic tendencies that equate maturity with mere external rule-keeping by recentering union with Christ and grace.
 - Counters therapeutic, consumer-driven piety and unregulated charismatic excess by insisting on doctrine, discipline, and communal accountability.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses the paired phrase **"growing up and going on"** to signal both internal formation and outward mission - maturity is relational and vocational.
 - Emphasizes **progressive competence** (not perfection): maturity as steady formation in heart, judgment, and usefulness.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in Reformed and conservative evangelical seminaries and churches as a concise pastoral handbook on discipleship.
 - Influenced small-group curricula, pastoral training, and writings that seek to integrate gifts with sanctification.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, biblically rooted framework for discipleship that bridges doctrine and practice.
 - Useful for pastors and teachers seeking a balanced corrective to both legalism and dysfunction in spiritual-gift debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Maturity / Mature** - growth into Christlikeness in character, knowledge, and usefulness; measured by fruit and service rather than mere experience.
- **Growing Up and Going On** - twin motifs: inward formation (growing up) and outward vocation/service (going on).
- **Sanctification** - progressive, Spirit-worked renewal; not identical to justification but inseparably linked by union with Christ.
- **Union with Christ** - foundational lens for maturity; all growth is relationally rooted in being joined to Christ.
- **Spiritual Gifts** - God-given capacities for ministry; important for edification and evidence of maturity but subordinate to holiness and love.
 - Relation: gifts are instruments for sanctification of self and others when governed by character.
- **Means of Grace** - Word, sacraments, prayer, fellowship as primary channels for growth and gift-development.
- **Fruit of the Spirit** - moral and relational evidence of maturity that must govern gift-use.
- **Church Discipline / Accountability** - institutional practices necessary for corporate maturity and correction of misuse of gifts.
- **Prudence / Christian Judgment** - aspect of maturity involving discernment in applying gifts and doctrine to life.
- **Vocation / Service** - mature Christians are identified by faithful, sacrificial use of gifts in the body and mission.
- **Holiness** - practical ethical outworking of sanctification; not legalism but Spirit-empowered conduct.
- **Perseverance** - endurance and ongoing growth; maturity involves steadfastness, not episodic zeal.
- **Pastoral Formation** - Ferguson's emphasis on the church's responsibility to train believers in maturity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "spiritual maturity" in courses on spiritual formation and pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic** against both therapeutic/consumerist spirituality and unregulated charismatic excess, arguing for ordered gift-use.
- As an **exegetical-practical model** linking Pauline theology (gifts, fruit, maturity) to congregational discipleship practices.
