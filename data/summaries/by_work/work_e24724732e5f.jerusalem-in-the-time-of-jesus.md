### TITLE
Jerusalem in the Time of Jesus - Joachim Jeremias

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century German Protestant New Testament scholarship. Joachim Jeremias (1900-1979), a Lutheran New Testament scholar, wrote as part of a movement to reconstruct the first‑century Palestinian Jewish milieu for clearer Gospel interpretation. Work synthesizes literary, rabbinic, and archaeological data to recover everyday religious life in Jerusalem around Jesus.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reconstruct the social, cultic, and religious context of Jerusalem to clarify how Jesus and the early church understood rites and sayings - notably the Lord's Supper - within Jewish sacramental and eschatological expectations.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Reconstructs physical and social topography of Jerusalem (Temple precincts, marketplaces, houses of prayer).
 - Surveys institutions and practices: priesthood, festivals, pilgrimages, purity, sacred meals.
 - Interprets Gospel scenes (including meals, passion, and Temple actions) in light of Palestinian Jewish customs and symbolism.
 - Applies this reconstruction to the Lord's Supper: shows continuity between Jewish sacred meal idioms (Passover, messianic banquet) and early Christian Eucharistic belief and practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Josephus, Philo, the Mishnah and Talmudic traditions, archaeological reports, Gospel and Pauline texts, early patristic testimony. Engages contemporary exegetes who separated Gospel traditions from Palestinian Jewish contexts (e.g., form-critics).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (presence of the risen Lord at communal meals), sacramentology/Eucharist (institution, meaning, and presence), ecclesiology (admission and discipline around communal meals), eschatology (messianic banquet and expectation), Temple/ritual theology.
- **Closing line:** Jeremias locates the Lord's Supper and the conviction of Christ's presence within a Jewish eschatological and cultic matrix, arguing that early Christian sacramental practice is intelligible only when read against Palestinian Jewish sacred‑meal patterns.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on Palestinian Judaism as the primary horizon for interpreting Gospel meal traditions.
 - Treats the Eucharist primarily as an **eschatological, communal meal** rather than merely a later doctrinal construction.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against Hellenizing or purely symbolic readings that detach Jesus' words and early Eucharistic belief from Jewish meal theology.
 - Challenges reductive form‑critical treatments that treat meal scenes as independent literary forms divorced from social practice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the category of the **messianic banquet** as an interpretive key for understanding "presence" language in Eucharistic contexts.
 - Uses comparative analysis of Jewish sacred meals to clarify early church **fencing and admission** practices (i.e., regulated participation).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential across confessional lines: embraced as historical grounding for sacramental theology and pastoral practice.
 - In Reformed circles it is used to historicize Eucharistic debates-supporting both robust presence readings (as grounded in first‑century practice) and moderated understandings that resist later metaphysical formulations.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a methodological exemplar for contextualizing New Testament rites.
 - Remains a primary resource when discussing the Lord's Supper, the nature of Christ's presence, and early disciplinary controls on admission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological meal / Messianic banquet:** Jeremias reads the Lord's Supper as continuation/fulfillment of Jewish hopes for a future messianic feast; grounds the expectation of Christ's presence.
- **Passover background:** Links Last Supper traditions to Passover symbolism, clarifying continuity and innovation in Jesus' institution words.
- **Sacred meal (cultic meal):** Comparative category drawn from Jewish praxis to explain early Christian communal eating as ritual, not merely social.
- **Presence of Christ:** Understood as an experienced, participatory presence rooted in eschatological faith and communal remembrance rather than later scholastic metaphysics.
- **Anamnesis / remembrance:** Viewed as active, eschatological recall that makes the salvific event present to the community.
- **Institution narrative:** Examined historically within Palestinian meal patterns to assess original intent and function.
- **Fencing and admission:** Jeremias highlights parallels between Jewish restrictions on sacred meals and early Christian rules for Eucharistic participation; helps explain catechumenate boundaries and disciplinary exclusion.
- **Purity / Temple context:** Demonstrates how temple purity concepts shaped communal and sacramental behavior in Jerusalem and among Jesus' followers.
- **Communal fellowship (koinonia) at table:** Emphasizes social‑ritual unity as central to Eucharistic meaning and to claims of the risen Lord's presence.
- **Palestinian Judaism:** The methodological insistence on local Jewish sources to interpret Jesus' actions and early sacramental life.
- **Josephus & rabbinic parallels:** Used as proximate witnesses to customs and lexical usage that illuminate Gospel material.
- **Discipline & ecclesiology:** Links Eucharistic admission practices to broader norms of community order and holiness.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for historically grounded Eucharistic theology (what first‑century Christians meant by "presence").
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Gospel meal scenes within a Jewish cultic-meal framework.
- As a **polemic resource** against purely symbolic or anachronistic readings that ignore Palestinian context.
