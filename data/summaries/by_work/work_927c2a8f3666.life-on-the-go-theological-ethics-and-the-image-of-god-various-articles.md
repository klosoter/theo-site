### TITLE
Life on the Go: Theological Ethics and the Image of God (various articles) - John F. Kilner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical Protestant theological ethics and bioethics milieu.
 - Dialogue partner to contemporary debates on human dignity, biotechnology, disability ethics, and public policy in a pluralist society.
 - Kilner writes from an academically engaged, ecumenical evangelical posture with frequent interaction with Reformed and Roman Catholic resources.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of the **Image of God (imago Dei)** must be the primary theological anchor for Christian moral reasoning about human worth, public policy, and biomedical practice.
 - The challenge: offer an account of the image that is robust enough to secure universal human dignity, applicable in modern bioethical dilemmas, and faithful to biblical and doctrinal tradition.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: critiques both reductive secular accounts of dignity and narrow theological accounts that either make the image merely functional or purely ontological (substance).
 - Constructive move: proposes a **composite account** of the imago Dei integrating substantive, relational, and functional elements so the image:
 - grounds intrinsic worth (everyone bears the image), 
 - explains interpersonal and societal obligations (relational and vocational), and 
 - supplies moral criteria for evaluating technologies, policies, and treatment of vulnerable persons.
 - Applied move: translates the composite account into ethical judgments in areas such as disability, beginning/ending-of-life issues, reproductive technologies, and social justice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Biblical witness (Genesis, Pauline Christology, Wisdom literature) as primary framework.
 - Classical theologians (Augustine, Aquinas) and modern canonical voices (Karl Barth) treated selectively to show strengths/limits.
 - Contemporary ethicists, bioethicists, and philosophers of human dignity are engaged in critique and conversation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (imago Dei, personhood)
 - **Christology** (Christ as definitive image/restorer of human dignity)
 - **Hamartiology and soteriology** (damage to the image by sin; restoration in Christ; sanctification and eschatological fulfillment)
 - **Ethics** (normativity, moral status, public policy)
 - Secondary appeal to creation order, vocation, and teleology.

- **Closing line**
 - Kilner centers Christian moral reflection on a theologically nuanced, practically decisive doctrine of the imago Dei that seeks to protect universal human dignity while guiding concrete ethical decision-making.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on a **composite model** (substantive + relational + functional) rather than monocausal accounts.
 - Practical orientation: moves quickly from doctrinal claim to bioethical and public-policy application.
 - Explicit pastoral and public-theological concern for the vulnerable (disabled, unborn, dying).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely **substantialist** models that tie dignity only to capacities (e.g., rationality) because they risk excluding those with impaired capacities.
 - Counters **purely relational** accounts that risk dissolving individual dignity into social relations without securing intrinsic worth.
 - Critiques secular dignity frameworks for lacking a transcendent theological anchor that renders duties toward others binding.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the term **"composite image"** to reframe longstanding debates.
 - Emphasis on **vocational** status-image-bearing as role/responsibility in creation order, not merely attribute.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical bioethics and theological anthropology; used in debates over disability ethics and assisted reproductive technologies.
 - Influential among theologians seeking a middle path between traditional and revisionist imagistic accounts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable framework for integrating doctrine and practice; pedagogically useful in courses on Christian ethics, bioethics, and theological anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - central theological category; grounds human dignity and normative ethical claims.
- **Composite model** - Kilner's integrative proposal combining substantive, relational, and functional aspects.
 - Substantive: inherent properties (soul, rationality) that help constitute personhood.
 - Relational: capacity and call to relationship with God and others.
 - Functional: vocation/role (stewardship, dominion, service) that expresses the image.
- **Human dignity** - theological grounding for universal moral worth; distinguished from secular accounts by rootedness in creation and covenant.
- **Personhood** - theological anthropology that affirms personhood across variation in capacities and functioning.
- **Christ as Image/Restorer** - Christology used to explain damage and restoration of the image in redemption.
- **Damage and restoration** - sin diminishes the image; sanctification and eschatology aim to restore and perfect it.
- **Vocation** - image as responsibility in creation; practical axis for social ethics.
- **Disability ethics** - application area where Kilner defends inclusion and protection of dignity irrespective of functional loss.
- **Bioethics** - field where the composite imago model supplies criteria for evaluating interventions.
- **Public theology / policy** - use of imago Dei as a bridge between church teaching and civic debate.
- **Intrinsic worth vs. instrumental value** - insistence that persons are never merely means despite functional roles.
- **Eschatological fulfillment** - final restoration of the image in consummation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for a theologically coherent account of human dignity in ethics syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** against reductive secular dignity concepts and against narrow substantive-only or relational-only theological models.
 - As an **exegetical-model** applied to scriptural passages on Genesis, Christ as image, and Pauline anthropology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in bioethical debates (disability, reproductive tech, end-of-life) to argue for policy and praxis that respect imago-bearing persons.
