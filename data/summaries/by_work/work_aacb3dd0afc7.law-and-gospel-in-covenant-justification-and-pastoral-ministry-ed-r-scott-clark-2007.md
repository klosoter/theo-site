### TITLE
Law and Gospel - Michael S. Horton, in Covenant, Justification, and Pastoral Ministry (ed. R. Scott Clark, 2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed renewal; collection aimed at recovering covenantal and confessional clarity for pastoral practice.
 - Horton writes as a confessional Reformed theologian addressing pastors and academicians concerned with proclamation and doctrine.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The pastoral and doctrinal necessity of preserving the classical Reformation distinction between **Law and Gospel** so that preaching both convicts sinners and proclaims Christ-centered justification without confusion or conflation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm historical-Reformation categories: law as condemning, restraining, and guiding; gospel as promise centered on Christ's active and passive obedience and imputed righteousness.
 - Show how covenant theology supplies a hermeneutic: the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** frame both God's dealings and the uses of law and promise.
 - Apply distinction to pastoral preaching: diagnosis (law) precedes promise (gospel) in the believer's appropriation, but the ground for the promise is the accomplished work of Christ in history.
 - Defend forensic justification (imputation) against tendencies that collapse justification into sanctification or covenant performance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformation authorities (Luther, Calvin) and classical Reformed sources (Westminster/continental Reformed confessions).
 - Engages contemporary critics: Roman Catholic conflations, some evangelical and "New Perspective" tendencies that blur law/gospel or reframe covenantal categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works and grace), justification by faith, imputation, uses of the law, sanctification, preaching/ pastoral theology, Christology (active/passive obedience), soteriological order.
- **Closing line**
 - Horton locates the theological center of gravity in a covenantal, forensic gospel: law rightly condemns and drives sinners to Christ; gospel alone declares the righteousness imputed to the believer on the basis of Christ's covenantal obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of covenantal theology with the law/gospel distinction: the covenantal framework is not peripheral but determinative for how law and gospel function in proclamation and soteriology.
 - Pastoral prioritization: legal preaching as the necessary diagnostic prior to gospel proclamation, avoiding cheapened promise.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic or moralistic preaching that reduces gospel to ethical motivation.
 - Counters Romanizing tendencies that fuse law and gospel into an ethic of human cooperation; disputes New Perspective moves that relativize forensic imputation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rearticulates classic categories for contemporary pastoral practice: insists on keeping **historia salutis** (what Christ accomplished) as the ground for **ordo salutis** (appropriation by faith) while explaining how law/gospel operate in both registers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed pastoral formation for its clarity and practical orientation; used by conservative Reformed pastors and seminarians as a concise corrective to dominant evangelical muddling.
 - Cited in debates over covenant taxonomy and the proper role of Mosaic law in covenantal schema.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, teachable synthesis of doctrine and homiletics; durable resource for defending imputation and covenantal categories in pastoral contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law**
 - Condemns and reveals sin; threefold use emphasized (civil/restraining, pedagogical/convicting, normative/guide for life).
- **Gospel**
 - Promise of forgiveness and imputed righteousness grounded in Christ's obedience and sacrifice.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Prelapsarian covenant with Adam; Horton uses it to explain law's demanding character and to contrast basis of justification.
 - Relation to Mosaic question: Horton treats the Mosaic covenant cautiously - acknowledging formal resemblances to works-provision but insists on covenantal-historical distinctions so Mosaic law does not replace Christ's forensic ground.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - God's promise-structure fulfilled in Christ; the sphere where gospel operates.
- **Imputation / Forensic Justification**
 - Central to Horton: Christ's righteousness is *imputed* to believers; justification is declarative, not merely transformative.
- **Histora Salutis vs Ordo Salutis**
 - Horton emphasizes the priority of **historia salutis** (the objective, historical accomplishment of Christ) as the ground for **ordo salutis** (subjective appropriation); law convicts the conscience in the ordo while gospel proclaims the historia.
- **Mosaic Covenant (as to substance)**
 - Horton engages the debate whether Mosaic economy functions as a covenant of works *in substance*; he resists collapsing Mosaic identity into the Adamic covenant while noting its covenantal demands and typological function pointing to Christ.
- **Threefold use of the law**
 - Retained and clarified for pastoral use: civic restraint, tutor to Christ, and rule for Christian obedience (ordered by gospel).
- **Antithesis**
 - Sharp contrast between law and gospel; Horton defends maintaining the tension without mingling demands and promises.
- **Preaching / Pastoral Application**
 - Law as diagnosis; gospel as medicine - homiletical priority must both terrify and comfort according to covenantal categories.
- **Typology and Ceremonial Law**
 - Uses typology to show ceremonial/typical elements point to Christ, thus subordinated to gospel fulfillment.
- **Sanctification**
 - Distinct from justification; the law guides sanctification but does not ground justification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed law/gospel distinctions and covenantal framing in pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic** against Romanizing and certain contemporary evangelical revisions that minimize forensic imputation or blur law/gospel boundaries.
- As an **exegetical-homiletical model**: a covenant-historical template for preaching law to the conscience and proclaiming gospel rooted in Christ's historical work.
