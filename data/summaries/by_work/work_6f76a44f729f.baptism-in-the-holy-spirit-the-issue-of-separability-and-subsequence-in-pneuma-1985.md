### TITLE
Baptism in the Holy Spirit: The Issue of Separability and Subsequence (Pneuma, 1985) - Gordon D. Fee

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1980s scholarly debate within Pentecostal/charismatic and broader evangelical theology over whether Spirit-baptism is *separable* from conversion and typically *subsequent* to it.
 - Fee writes as a Pentecostal-trained New Testament scholar addressing both pastoral concerns and exegetical precision; publishes in Pneuma, the leading journal for Pentecostal scholarship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament evidence, especially Paul, does not support a universal, normative doctrine that Spirit-baptism is always a distinct, subsequent event separable from conversion. Luke-Acts describes historical subsequences, but Pauline theology treats Spirit-baptism primarily as the means of incorporation into Christ at conversion.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey:
 - Paul: treats Spirit-baptism as the once-for-all incorporation of believers into Christ (e.g., 1 Cor 12:13; Rom 6, Eph 4 themes) - normative and inseparable from salvation union.
 - Luke-Acts: narrates historical cases (Samaritans, Gentiles, the Ephesian disciples) where the reception of the Spirit appears subsequent to initial faith - descriptive of particular mission-history, not necessarily prescriptive.
 - Distinction advanced:
 - **Normative theological pattern (Pauline):** Spirit-baptism = incorporation, concurrent with becoming a Christian.
 - **Descriptive historical pattern (Lukan):** subsequence occurs in mission-history and may produce subsequent experiential signs (e.g., tongues), but this does not overturn Pauline normativity.
 - Pastoral/analytic implication:
 - Recognize legitimate varied experiences without making subsequence a doctrinal standard; beware conflating *initial evidence theology* (tongues as universal sign) with Pauline soteriology.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages the classical Pentecostal/subsequentist position (representative leaders and theologians of the movement) and evangelical critics who insist on inseparability.
 - Primary sources: Pauline epistles and Luke-Acts; secondary conversations in Pneuma and evangelical scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (Spirit-baptism, gifts, witness)
 - Soteriology (regeneration, conversion, union with Christ)
 - Ecclesiology (body of Christ, unity)
 - Hermeneutics (normative vs. descriptive use of NT narrative)

- **Closing line**
 - Fee locates the theological center: **Pauline theology makes Spirit-baptism the normative, inseparable means of incorporation into Christ; Acts supplies important historical phenomena of subsequence without displacing Pauline soteriological priority.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear methodological separation between the *normative theological* voice of Paul and the *descriptive historical* voice of Luke; avoids conflating narrative chronology with doctrinal norm.
 - Emphasizes ecclesial unity as the primary effect of Spirit-baptism rather than privileging a single experiential sign.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against strict subsequentist formulas that universalize the Lukan sequence as normative theology.
 - Counters some Reformed/evangelical critics who deny any legitimacy to subsequence by acknowledging historical subsequence as real and pastorally significant in some contexts.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deploys a useful analytic pair: **Pauline normativity vs. Lukan historicity** for handling divergent NT data on the Spirit.
 - Clarifies "separability" (ontological/philosophical separation from salvation) versus "subsequence" (chronological sequence of experience).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Pentecostal and charismatic academic circles as a measured corrective to rigid subsequence doctrines.
 - Adopted by many evangelicals as the preferred exegetical framework for reconciling Acts and Paul; shaped later discussions on initial evidence and spiritual gifts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models responsible NT exegesis tied to theological and pastoral concerns.
 - Offers a durable heuristic for teaching pneumatology without reducing spiritual life to a single experiential formula.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism in the Holy Spirit** - central phenomenon under discussion; Fee treats it primarily as the NT term for incorporation into Christ.
- **Separability** - whether Spirit-baptism is ontologically separable from conversion/regeneration; Fee argues against absolute separability in Pauline theology.
- **Subsequence** - chronological occurrence of Spirit-baptism after conversion in Acts; Fee treats as historically real but not universally normative.
- **Pauline normativity** - the principle that Paul's theological portrayal of Spirit-baptism as union with Christ should govern doctrinal formulation.
- **Lukan historicity** - Luke-Acts' narrative sequences that record varied receptions of the Spirit in mission-history.
- **Initial evidence / tongues doctrine** - the claim that tongues are the universal sign of Spirit-baptism; Fee cautions against equating tongues as normative initial evidence.
- **Incorporation / union with Christ** - Fee's preferred soteriological locus for the meaning of Spirit-baptism in Paul.
- **Descriptive vs. prescriptive** - hermeneutical distinction Fee uses to weigh historical accounts against doctrinal instruction.
- **Ecclesial unity** - effect of Spirit-baptism emphasized by Fee (e.g., one body in 1 Cor 12:13).
- **Experiential variation** - Fee acknowledges legitimate differences in believers' experiential sequence without altering soteriological claims.
- **Normative theology** - theology that prescribes belief and doctrine (here, largely Pauline).
- **Historical narrative** - Luke's reporting of events that may be contingent and informative for practice.
- **Gift phenomena** - charismata discussed as related but not identical to baptismal incorporation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** prioritizing Pauline theology when reconciling Acts and the epistles.
 - As a **polemic resource** against rigid subsequentist/initial-evidence positions within Pentecostalism.
 - As a **definition source** for teaching that Spirit-baptism is primarily incorporation into Christ, with pastoral allowance for varied experiential sequences.
