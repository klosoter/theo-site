### TITLE
When Religion Meets New Media - Heidi A. Campbell

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published in the early 21st century (first edition c.2010) amid expanding scholarship on digital culture, media studies, and religion; addresses shifts in communication technologies, social media emergence, and pastoral adaptations. Interdisciplinary location: communication studies, sociology of religion, and practical theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 New media do not simply erode or secularize religion; they reconfigure religious practice, authority, identity, and community. Theologically significant questions concern how revelation, authority, ritual, and ecclesial life are mediated in networked contexts.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Presents a mediational framework for studying religion and new media rather than technological determinism. 
 - Argues for a concept of **networked religion**: religious life that is both online and offline, intertwined across platforms and physical communities. 
 - Uses ethnographic case studies to show diversity of outcomes (reinforcement of institutional authority, lay innovation, new devotional forms). 
 - Offers practical implications for ministry, pedagogy, and ecclesiology: institutions must negotiate authority and ritual in digitally-mediated environments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Draws on media/theory figures (communication scholars and media ecologists) and contemporaneous digital religion research. 
 - Interlocutors include scholars asserting decline of religion online and those predicting radical religious transformation; Campbell positions her account as corrective, empirical, and nuanced.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Ecclesiology:** community formation, institutional authority, hybrid gatherings. 
 - **Authority and revelation:** negotiation of interpretive power in distributed networks. 
 - **Ritual and sacramentality:** reworking of ritual practice when mediated. 
 - **Identity and holiness:** formation of religious identity in mediated spaces; questions of authenticity and embodiment.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Theologically, Campbell centers a mediated ecclesiology: religious truth and communal life are negotiated through media ecologies, requiring attention to how authority, ritual, and identity persist and transform in networked environments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphasis on **mediational practices** rather than medium determinism: media shape but do not determine religious outcomes. 
 - Focus on the **online/offline continuum** and how hybridity (mixed presence) is the norm for contemporary religious practice.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Rejects simplistic decline narratives (internet destroys religion) and utopian claims (internet replaces institutional religion). 
 - Counters technological determinism by foregrounding agency of religious actors and institutional negotiation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Articulates **networked religion** as a working analytic. 
 - Highlights **vernacular religious practice** online - grassroots devotional creativity rather than elite production only. 
 - Introduces a practical vocabulary for thinking about mediated ritual, authority, and community.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely adopted in digital religion studies, pastoral theology, and practical ministry training. 
 - In Reformed circles, prompts rethinking of covenantal ecclesiology: how church polity and sacraments function across mediated spaces. 
 - Influential for curricula on digital ministry, ethics of online pastoral care, and theological reflection on mediation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides an empirical, theoretically informed model for analyzing religion and media. 
 - Useful classroom text for bridging communication studies and theology; prompts concrete ministry applications and ethical reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Networked religion:** Religious activity that spans online and offline networks; emphasizes connectivity and distributed authority. 
- **Mediated religion:** The idea that religious experience and practice are shaped through media technologies and platforms. 
- **Vernacular religion (online):** Grassroots, lay-driven religious expression and practice that emerges in digital contexts. 
- **Online/offline continuum:** Framework rejecting strict dichotomy; practices flow between embodied gatherings and digital spaces. 
- **Religious authority (negotiated):** Authority is contested and reconfigured in networked contexts; institutions and laity negotiate legitimacy. 
- **Ritual mediation:** How ritual forms are adapted, translated, or recreated when mediated (e.g., livestreamed worship, digital sacraments debates). 
- **Hybrid ecclesiology:** A church model that integrates physical and virtual practices and governance. 
- **Affordances (implicit):** The capacities and limits of specific media that enable certain religious practices and constrain others. 
- **Media ecology:** Attention to the total environment of technologies, platforms, and practices shaping religious life. 
- **Identity formation (digital):** Processes by which believers construct and perform religious identity online. 
- **Platform dynamics:** How ownership, algorithms, and design of platforms shape religious visibility and community formation. 
- **Ethics of mediation:** Questions of pastoral care, privacy, authenticity, and power in mediated ministry. 
- **Remediation:** The reworking of traditional religious forms into new media formats.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for "digital religion" and "networked religion" in theological and sociological writing. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and practical theology, informing debates on sacraments, authority, and hybrid worship. 
 - As a **methodological model** for qualitative/ethnographic study of faith communities online, and as a corrective in polemics against tech-determinist claims.
