### TITLE
Perspectives on the Doctrine of God (2008) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical engagement with analytic philosophy of religion and contemporary debates (Open Theism, Molinism, EFS).
 - A corrective to both abstract classical theism and recent libertarian-friendly revisions of divine power and knowledge.

- **Central thesis**
 - A thoroughly biblical-Reformed doctrine of God must preserve **divine sovereignty, aseity, simplicity, and immutability** while also affirming God as a personal, covenantal, condescending Lord who knows and governs history. Theology must not subordinate scriptural categories to philosophical systems.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes methodological commitments: Scripture-authority shaped by a tri-perspectival sensitivity (normative/scriptural priority but aware of situational and existential concerns).
 - Treats God's attributes in relation (incommunicable communicable) rather than as isolated metaphysical abstractions.
 - Engages specific controversies:
 - **Divine foreknowledge and providence** - defends robust foreknowledge and providential sovereignty against Open Theism's denial of exhaustive foreknowledge.
 - **Middle knowledge (Molinism)** - critically examines middle knowledge as a philosophical attempt to reconcile libertarian freedom with providence; treats it as theologically and exegetically problematic.
 - **Origin and nature of sin** - locates sin in creaturely freedom under divine decree; insists God's sovereignty is compatible with moral responsibility.
 - **Trinitarian issues (Eternal Functional Subordination)** - discusses intra-Trinitarian order with pastoral and theological caution; weighs language of eternal roles against concerns about subordinationism.
 - **Attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility)** - defends classical formulations with biblical nuance, resisting both depersonalizing metaphysics and sentimental anthropomorphism.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with contemporary proponents of Open Theism and Molinism (e.g., Clark Pinnock-style and William Lane Craig-style positions), classical theists, and Reformed predecessors (Augustine, Calvin, Warfield, Bavinck).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper (central), Doctrine of Sin, Trinity (including EFS debate), Divine Knowledge (foreknowledge, middle knowledge), Providence, Simplicity/Aseity/Immutability/Impassibility, Divine Condescension.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame centers a Reformed, scripturally anchored theology of God that insists on divine lordship and personal engagement while resisting philosophical reductions that either depersonalize God or erode his sovereignty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Scriptural-theological priority with philosophical savvy**
 - Uses careful philosophical categories but subordinates them to biblical exegesis and covenantal categories.
- **Tri-perspectival method applied to theology proper**
 - Brings normative, situational, and existential concerns to bear on attributes and debates, producing an integrated pastoral-theological approach.
- **Balance of classical and biblical emphases**
 - Retains classical attributes (simplicity, immutability, aseity) but reframes them so they do not nullify God's personal, covenantal activity.
- **Polemic posture**
 - Explicit corrective to Open Theism and to naive Molinism; insists these compromise either God's sovereignty or biblical witness.
- **Careful treatment of EFS**
 - Engages the eternal functional subordination debate with nuance: affirms distinctions of role without capitulating to ontological subordinationism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a substantive, pastorally aware resource; cited in debates over Molinism, Open Theism, and EFS.
 - Less persuasive to strict classical theists and some analytic philosophers, but influential as a teaching and polemical text.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to integrate confessional Reformed theology with contemporary analytic discussion while keeping pastoral and exegetical priorities front and center.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; Frame defends it against any view that makes God dependent on creatures.
- **Simplicity** - Theological unity of God's attributes; maintained but read through biblical relationality so as not to depersonalize God.
- **Immutability** - God's unchanging being; nuanced by God's dynamic relation to creation in providential activity and condescension.
- **Impassibility** - Defense of God not being controlled by creaturely passions, tempered by biblical claims that God experiences relational responses without moral defect.
- **Sovereignty** - Central pivot: God's absolute rule that grounds providence, foreknowledge, and theodicy.
- **Providence & Foreknowledge** - Affirms exhaustive foreknowledge and sovereign governance; resists Open Theist limitations on divine knowledge.
- **Middle Knowledge (Molinism)** - Critically examined; Frame regards it as an inadequate solution that imports problematic metaphysical assumptions into biblical theology.
- **Open Theism** - Targeted critique: seen as compromising scriptural witness to divine providence and foreknowledge.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - Treated as a contested language for intra-Trinitarian relations; Frame urges careful theological distinctions to avoid ontological error.
- **Divine Condescension** - Emphasized as a key biblical category: God stoops without losing aseity or sovereign lordship.
- **Origin and Nature of Sin** - Sin located in creaturely will under divine ordination; maintains responsibility without relativizing God's decretive sovereignty.
- **Tri-perspectivalism** - Methodological term used to balance scripture, situation, and subjectivity in doctrinal construction.
- **Personalism vs. Metaphysicalism** - Frame reads attributes to preserve God's personal engagement rather than abstract metaphysics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed formulations of divine attributes that remain pastorally readable.
- As a **polemic** against Open Theism and as a critical resource on Molinism.
- As an **exegetical-model** for integrating providence, foreknowledge, and the problem of evil within a Reformed schema.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary discussions about EFS and the relation of God's immutability to relationality.
