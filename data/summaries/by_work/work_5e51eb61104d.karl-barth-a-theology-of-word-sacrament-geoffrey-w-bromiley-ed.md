### TITLE
**Karl Barth: A Theology of Word & Sacrament** (ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley) 
Karl Barth - collected essays and lectures on proclamation, sacrament, covenant, and Christian life. Edited and translated for anglophone theology by Geoffrey W. Bromiley; representative of Barth's mid‑to‑late theological work within the neo‑orthodox/Reformed renewal.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Barthian corpus; reaction against liberal historicism and both Roman Catholic and Protestant accommodations to modernity.
 - Located in the neo‑orthodox movement: reassertion of revelation as event, Christocentric theology, renewed emphasis on Word and sacrament as God's instruments.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How do Word and sacrament mediate God's saving action without collapsing into a theology of human merit? How are good works related to covenantal standing before God?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture and preaching are the primary medium of God's self‑communication; sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper) are concrete attestations of God's covenantal action in Christ.
 - Christ alone accomplishes covenantal obedience and merit; human good works are the necessary response and witness but not a foundation for justification.
 - Union with Christ secures the believer's standing; works flow from that union as evidence and obedience.
 - Sacraments seal and proclaim the covenantal reality that precedes and grounds any human action.
 - Ethical life is thus both commanded and constituted by the Word; it is accountable to God's sovereign initiative rather than human earning.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Luther, Calvin on grace and works; critiques medieval scholastic notions of merit and contemporary Roman Catholic formulations; dialogues implicitly with liberal theologians and occasional comparisions with Emil Brunner.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word as event), Christology (Christ as decisive covenant partner), Covenant theology, Justification and election, Sacramentology, Ethics (good works), Grace and freedom of God.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth centers theology on the sovereign Word in which Christ establishes the covenant: human good works are necessary fruit and testimony but derive definitively from Christ's covenantal obedience, not from human merit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that Word and sacrament are not merely signs but real encounters with the triune God; sacraments are "word‑events" confirming divine initiative.
 - Strong Christocentrism: the covenant is decisively enacted in Christ, whose obedience is the sole nexus of covenantal merit.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both Roman Catholic merit theology (which attributes cooperative merit to believers) and liberal moralism (which grounds worth in human achievement).
 - Reframes Reformed covenant talk to insist that covenantal status is grounded in God's action, not human contribution.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Treats sacraments as speech‑acts of God (Word + visible sign), reducing any residual transactional reading of merit.
 - Reinterprets "merit" as strictly belonging to Christ; human "worthiness" becomes relational (union with Christ) rather than acquisitive.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential across Reformed and ecumenical circles for sacramentarian theology and ethics; used as a corrective to both Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian tendencies.
 - Has shaped contemporary covenantal and pastoral approaches to good works, preaching, and ecclesial practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models integration of doctrine and pastoral theology: links preaching, sacraments, and ethical formation without recuperating merit theology.
 - Useful as a teaching resource for covenantal ethics and sacramental theology in pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word as event** - proclamation is an encounter with God, not merely information.
- **Sacrament as word‑event** - visible sign united to divine promise; not a human work.
- **Covenant of grace** - relational framework centered in Christ's action; basis for salvation and life.
- **Merit (Christ's vs. human)** - **Christ** possesses covenantal merit; human merit is denied as cause of justification.
- **Good works** - necessary fruits and visible obedience, derived from union with Christ; evidential, not meritorious.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological ground of believer's standing; source of ethical capacity and sacramental reception.
- **Justification** - forensic and relational in Barth's framing, anchored in Christ's obedience and God's declaration.
- **Grace (sovereign initiative)** - God's free action precedes and enables all human response.
- **Obedience of faith** - ethical response produced by faith; patterned after Christ's obedience.
- **Testimony / witness** - function of good works in the church and world; confirms the truth of the Word.
- **Vocation** - concrete calling to live the covenant in specific life contexts; not a mode of earning favor.
- **Forensic language** - retained but reinterpreted within real union and covenantal life.
- **Reprobation / election** - presupposed within covenantal Christocentrism; judged in relation to Christ.
- **Ecclesial mediation** - church as locus where Word and sacrament enact covenantal reality.
- **Ethical formation** - shaped by preached Word and sacrament rather than ethical exemplarism alone.

How this work is used:
- As a **polemic** against doctrines of human merit and semi‑Pelagianism.
- As a **definition source** for a Christocentric covenantal account of good works and sacrament.
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** linking proclamation, sacrament, and ethical formation in congregational life.
