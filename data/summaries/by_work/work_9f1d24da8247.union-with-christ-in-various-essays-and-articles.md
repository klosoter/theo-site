### TITLE
**Union with Christ - Michael S. Horton (essays and articles, contemporary Reformed context)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed evangelical theology; Horton writes as a confessional Protestant theologian influenced by classical covenant theology, Puritan pastoral practice, and contemporary ecclesial controversies over sacramental theology and church discipline.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Union with Christ is the central theological category for understanding salvation and the sacraments; the Lord's Supper communicates Christ to believers in a *real spiritual* way and must be guarded by biblical fencing and admission practices to preserve covenant integrity and pastoral care.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Biblical-theological exegesis of Pauline language (union terminology: "in Christ," "with Christ") showing existential, juridical, and covenantal dimensions.
 - Historical-theological survey contrasting Reformed (Calvinian) account with Roman Catholic (corporeal presence/transubstantiation) and Zwinglian (mere memorialism) positions.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: Christ's hypostatic union and ascension ground a *real but non-corporeal* presence by the Spirit at the Lord's Supper; sacraments function as covenantal means of grace that objectively signify and subjectively apply Christ to believers.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial implications: communion requires visible profession and church oversight; fencing the table (admission and exclusion) protects the sacrament's integrity and the souls of communicants.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and the Reformed confessions and Puritans (for sacramental and disciplinary practice); Zwingli and Luther as antagonist reference points; contemporary evangelical sacramentalists and open-table advocates are critiqued.
- **Doctrines treated:** Union with Christ (soteriology), Christology (two natures; ascension/exaltation), sacramentology (presence, means of grace, seals), covenant theology (visible/invisible church), ecclesiology (discipline, fencing/admission), pneumatology (Spirit as applicator).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Union with Christ is the pivot of Christian identity and salvation; the Lord's Supper, rightly understood as a covenantal means of grace conveying Christ by the Spirit, demands disciplined admission to safeguard both the sacrament's truth and the covenant community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses both the *objective* reality of union (Christ accomplished for the elect) and the *subjective* appropriating work of the Spirit in sacraments.
 - Frames Eucharistic presence in distinctly *covenantal* terms - the meal as a bondal, covenantal encounter rather than only a sign or a literal bodily presence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects Zwinglian reduction of the Supper to mere memory; rejects Roman corporal presence (transubstantiation); insists on a Reformation middle path: real spiritual presence mediated by the Spirit.
 - Critiques modern "open table" practices as theologically incoherent with covenantal and ecclesial doctrine of union and communion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Prioritizes language of "fencing the table" and "admission" as ecclesial practices grounded in the doctrine of union, reframing them not merely as discipline but as sacramental stewardship.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read and used in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian contexts as a defense of traditional sacramental theology and communicant discipline.
 - Influenced pastoral guidelines, seminary curricula, and polemical responses to liberal/open-communion trends.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Integrates biblical exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral practice in a way that clarifies how soteriology and sacramentology interrelate.
 - Serves as a concise model for grounding Eucharistic discipline in doctrine rather than merely in custom or pragmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Central relational bond-objective (accomplished in Christ) and subjective (applied by the Spirit); foundation for sacramental efficacy.
- **Vital union:** The living, sanctifying aspect of union that nourishes Christian life and is strengthened by the sacraments.
- **Federal (or judicial) union:** The legal/declarative side - Christ as covenant head whose obedience and righteousness are imputed.
- **Real spiritual presence:** Christ is truly present at the Lord's Supper by the Spirit, without corporal/physical transfer.
- **Memorialism:** The view that the Supper is only a remembrance - Horton critiques this as insufficient for Pauline union-language and covenantal practice.
- **Transubstantiation:** Roman Catholic doctrine of substantial change - rejected in favor of spiritual presence and sacramental sign/seal.
- **Fencing the table:** Ecclesial practice of regulating who may partake; justified as pastoral protection of covenant means.
- **Admission (to the Supper):** The church's determinate decision to receive communicants based on profession, discipline, and evidence of union; a covenantal gatekeeping.
- **Means of grace:** The sacraments as instruments by which the Spirit applies Christ to believers, not mere symbols.
- **Visible vs. invisible church:** Distinction used to ground discipline - visible membership and profession relate to admission; invisible union is known fully only to God.
- **Seal:** Sacramental confirmation of promises (e.g., justification, union) to faith.
- **Covenant headship:** Christ as representative - explains corporate reception and communion discipline.
- **Efficacy (objective/subjective):** Distinguishes what Christ has done objectively (accomplishment) from how grace is subjectively received (by faith), with sacraments assisting the latter.
- **Ecclesial stewardship:** The church's responsibility to guard sacraments, ensuring they function as means rather than being profaned.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** in soteriology/ecclesiology courses for explicating "union with Christ" and its sacramental implications.
- As a **polemic** against memorialism, open-table practices, and non-covenantal sacramental theories.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline union language and linking it to sacramental theology and pastoral discipline.
