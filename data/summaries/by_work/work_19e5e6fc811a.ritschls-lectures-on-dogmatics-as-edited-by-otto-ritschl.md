### TITLE
Ritschl: Lectures on Dogmatics (edited by Otto Ritschl) - Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology; reaction to Enlightenment rationalism and 19th-century historical-critical scholarship.
 - Ritschl teaches at Göttingen and Halle; Otto Ritschl later edited and shaped the lecture corpus for publication and classroom use.
 - Situated within the liberal Protestant movement that privileged ethics, historical consciousness, and practical religion over metaphysical speculation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Dogmatics must be reconstructed as a system of historically grounded, ethical religious judgments that articulate the Christian "kingdom of God" revealed in Jesus Christ, not as metaphysical speculation about divine being or natural theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: theology as a critical-historical discipline producing value-judgments (Werturteile) about God's redeeming activity.
 - Arrangement:
 - General doctrine of God and revelation: God disclosed in historical acts rather than known by speculative reason.
 - Christology and soteriology: Jesus as the historical center whose person and resurrection function as the decisive ground for Christian valuation and reconciliation.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: the Church as the concrete community of value which sustains and judges the continuing reality of the kingdom.
 - Doctrines of creation, eschatology, and providence are interpreted in service of the practical-religious aim of the gospel.
 - On the **Days of Creation**: Genesis's "days" are treated as theological-pedagogical categories within revelation, not as claims to scientific chronology; Creation doctrine is retained as the affirmation of God as personal Creator ordering moral and social reality.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages critically with Kantian epistemology (limits on metaphysics), Schleiermacher (religious feeling as datum), Hegelian historicism, and orthodox scholastic forms.
 - Dialogues with contemporary historical-critical exegesis and earlier confessional dogmatics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, God, Christology, atonement, resurrection, sanctification, Church, sacraments, creation (including Days of Creation), providence, eschatology, and method of dogmatics.

- **Closing line**
 - Ritschlian dogmatics centers theological knowledge on the historical, ethical reality of the kingdom of God: doctrine serves judgment about God's saving action in history, not metaphysical description.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as normative, practical judgment (Werturteil) rooted in communal, historical faith rather than speculative metaphysics.
 - Priority of ethical-religious value: doctrines are meaningful only insofar as they guide the life of the kingdom.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects natural theology and metaphysical proofs for God; counters both rationalist deism and scholastic ontotheology.
 - Differentiates from Schleiermacher by giving historical acts (especially Christ's resurrection) greater epistemic weight than mere feeling.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic incorporation of the concept of "value-judgment" as theological epistemology.
 - Reframing of traditional loci (e.g., atonement, creation) as instruments for understanding God's practical reconciliation rather than speculative entities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in late 19th-century German and British liberal Protestantism; shaped seminary curricula and homiletics.
 - Criticized sharply by 20th-century neo-orthodoxy (notably Karl Barth) for reducing revelation to ethical appraisal and for sidelining transcendence.
 - Otto Ritschl's edition ensured sustained pedagogical use and diffusion.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined way to marry historical-critical method with doctrinal coherence.
 - Offers a robust, ethically oriented alternative to metaphysical dogmatics; useful for teaching theology that seeks to prioritize praxis and historical grounding.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Central organizing category: the ethical-religious community constituted by God's saving acts in history.
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)**
 - Epistemic act by which the believing community affirms the religious significance of historical events (esp. Christ).
- **Historical revelation**
 - Revelation occurs in specific acts and persons (not in speculative ideas); history is the proper medium of theology.
- **Personality of God**
 - God understood as willful and personal, accessible in moral claims rather than metaphysical categories.
- **Atonement / Reconciliation**
 - Emphasizes relational and representative aspects of Christ's work; opposes metaphysical explanations of penal substitution divorced from historical and ethical context.
- **Resurrection**
 - The decisive historical sign that validates Christ's mission and grounds Christian valuation and hope.
- **Church**
 - The concrete community that preserves, judges, and applies the value of revelation; locus of sacramental and moral formation.
- **Sacraments**
 - Means by which the Church sustains the practical reality of the kingdom; theological function over metaphysical mechanics.
- **Creation / Days of Creation**
 - Treated theologically as revelatory categories articulating God's ordering of moral and social reality; not a literalist scientific account.
 - Used to underline creation as the ground for providence and moral order rather than a locus for natural theology.
- **Method of dogmatics**
 - Critical-historical and ethical orientation; theology as normative interpretation of faith-history.
- **Speculative theology (negative)**
 - Ritschl's foil: metaphysical, ontological systems that claim knowledge of God apart from redemptive history.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: to define Ritschlian method (Werturteil, kingdom-centered system).
 - Polemic: as a primary target/representative in debates between liberal and neo-orthodox dogmatics.
 - Exegetical model: to justify non-literal, theological readings of Genesis (e.g., the Days of Creation) that prioritize revelation's pastoral/ethical aims.
