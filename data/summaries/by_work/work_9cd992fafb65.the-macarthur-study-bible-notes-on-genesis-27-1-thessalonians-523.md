### TITLE
The MacArthur Study Bible - Notes on Genesis 2:7 and 1 Thessalonians 5:23 (John F. MacArthur)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century conservative evangelical study Bible (MacArthur Study Bible, 1990s onward). Author John F. MacArthur: high-profile Reformed-leaning, Calvinistic pastor-theologian within an evangelical/dispensational milieu, oriented to pastoral exegesis and anti-speculative theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** These notes defend a **dichotomous** anthropology (body + immaterial life) and deny that Genesis 2:7 or 1 Thessalonians 5:23 require a trichotomous (body, soul, spirit) view of human constitution.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Genesis 2:7: Hebrew textual and lexical focus - man formed from dust and made a "living being" (nephesh chayah) by God breathing into him; MacArthur stresses this as formation of a single living creature rather than the infusion of a separable immaterial soul separate from body.
 - 1 Thessalonians 5:23: Greek lexical clarification - "spirit and soul and body" is treated as **a way of describing the whole person**, not a technical metaphysical taxonomy proving three ontologically distinct parts; context (sanctification and preservation) shows holistic concern.
 - General exegetical move: emphasize biblical usage where **nephesh/psyche** often denote life/personality and **pneuma/ruach** denote the immaterial capacity for communion with God; overlap and interchangeability undermine trichotomist proof-texting.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Implicit interlocutors: advocates of trichotomy (historical and modern), neoplatonic-influenced readings, and some charismatic/Pentecostal emphases that treat spirit, soul, body as strict parts.
 - Alignment with Augustinian/Calvinian and many conservative Protestant interpreters who favor dichotomy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Biblical anthropology, imago Dei (human origin and nature), sanctification (1 Thess 5:23 application), resurrection and preservation of the whole person.
- **Closing line:** MacArthur reads these passages to defend a biblical, anti-Platonic, **dichotomous and holistic** anthropology: human persons are an integrated body plus immaterial life (soul/spirit in functional overlap), wholly subject to redemption and sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Pastoral, anti-speculative insistence on Scripture's plain usage over philosophical systems.
 - Repeated lexical attention: MacArthur presses Hebrew/Greek semantics to show functional overlap between "soul" and "spirit."
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against trichotomy readings that treat 1 Thess 5:23 as the decisive proof-text; corrects what he views as extra-biblical metaphysical importation.
 - Contrasts with interpreters who import Hellenistic tripartite anthropology into biblical exegesis.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical terminology; rather, a disciplined reassertion of **nephesh/psyche as "living being/person"** and **ruach/pneuma as breath/spirit** with overlapping but distinct emphases.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential among conservative pastors, Bible-study leaders, and lay readers for succinct rebuttal of trichotomy and practical application of sanctification texts.
 - Criticized by some scholars who argue MacArthur simplifies complex lexical and historical debates; nevertheless used as a standard pastoral reference.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, concise exegetical model for using lexical-historical method to address theological anthropology.
 - Durable resource for preaching and catechesis on human nature, sanctification, and the resurrection of the whole person.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dichotomy:** The view that humans consist of two principal elements: body (material) and soul/spirit (immaterial life). MacArthur's preferred anthropological framework.
- **Trichotomy:** The claim that humans have three distinct parts: body, soul, spirit. Treated as an exegetical error when inferred from 1 Thess 5:23.
- **Nephesh (Hebrew):** Often translated "soul" or "living being"; MacArthur emphasizes its usage as the living, personal creature rather than a separable immaterial substance.
 - Contrast: nephesh as life/person vs. ruach as breath/spirit.
- **Ruach (Hebrew):** Breath or spirit; associated with the animating breath and relational capacity toward God.
- **Psyche (Greek):** "Soul" or life; in NT usage frequently overlaps with pneuma (spirit) in referring to the immaterial life/personhood.
- **Pneuma (Greek):** "Spirit" - breath, the immaterial faculty enabling communion with God; functional overlap with psyche.
- **Body:** The material, biological aspect; Scripture affirms bodily involvement in sin, sanctification, and resurrection.
- **Living being / living soul:** MacArthur reads Genesis 2:7 as the creation of an integrated living person, not the attachment of a separable soul to a body.
- **Imago Dei:** Human bearing of God's image; MacArthur links this to relational/functional capacities (not to tripartite metaphysics).
- **Sanctification (1 Thess 5:23):** Holistic process involving spirit, soul, and body - MacArthur reads the verse as emphasizing entire-person sanctification, not three-substance ontology.
- **Preservation and blamelessness:** Eschatological and ethical promises tied to God's action upon the whole person.
- **Anti-Platonism:** Rejection of Hellenistic dualisms/tripartite speculations imposed on Scripture.
- **Lexical-historical exegesis:** MacArthur's method - close attention to original languages and biblical-theological context.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative evangelical/dichotomous anthropology.
- As a **polemic** against trichotomy in pastoral and classroom settings.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating lexical and contextual reading of Genesis 2:7 and 1 Thess 5:23 for teaching on sanctification and human nature.
