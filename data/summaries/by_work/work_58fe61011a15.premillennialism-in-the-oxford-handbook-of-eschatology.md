### TITLE
"Premillennialism," Craig A. Blaising, in The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology (Oxford University Press). 
Entry-length survey and analysis of premillennial options within contemporary eschatological discourse.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary evangelical academic milieu (early 21st century). Positioned within a multi-author Oxford Handbook aimed at summarizing and evaluating major eschatological positions for advanced students and scholars.
 - Dialogue partner to dominant Reformed/Amillennial and Postmillennial critiques and to popular dispensational literature.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Premillennialism is a family of views holding that Christ returns prior to (and inaugurates) a future, earthly millennial reign; Blaising's article maps varieties, exegetical bases, and theological implications while clarifying internal distinctions and commonalities.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Definition and typology: distinguishes **historic premillennialism**, **classical dispensational premillennialism**, and **progressive dispensationalism**. 
 - Historical sketch: traces early patristic, medieval, Reformation, and especially 19th-20th-century developments (Darby, Scofield, fundamentalist and evangelical movements). 
 - Exegetical bases: surveys key texts (Revelation 20; Daniel; Isaiah; Psalmic promises; Pauline and Johannine eschatological passages) and the hermeneutical principles used (literal/historical-grammatical vs. typological/spiritualizing). 
 - Theological consequences: analyzes implications for covenant theology (Israel-Church relations), Christology (kingly reign and mediatorial rule), soteriology and ecclesiology, and the order/timing of resurrection(s), judgment, tribulation, and the parousia.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Historical: early church fathers, Reformation commentators. 
 - Modern: J. N. Darby, C. I. Scofield, John Walvoord, Charles Ryrie, proponents of progressive dispensationalism (including Blaising himself and Darrell Bock), and critics such as Reformed amillennialists and postmillennial advocates.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation and biblical interpretation (hermeneutics). 
 - Covenant theology and the Israel/Church relationship. 
 - Christology (eschatological kingship; mediatorial kingdom). 
 - Eschatological soteriology (resurrection(s), judgment) and ecclesiology (role of church in eschaton).

- **Closing line:** 
 - Blaising locates premillennialism theologically at the nexus of a future, literal messianic reign and contested hermeneutical commitments, offering both a descriptive map of variants and an argument that nuanced forms (notably progressive dispensationalism) moderate sharp discontinuities while retaining a future, earthly expectation for Christ's kingship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Careful typological taxonomy: stresses the internal diversity of premillennialism rather than treating it monolithically. 
 - Balanced attention to both exegetical arguments and systematic-theological consequences.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Challenges caricatures of premillennialism as uniformly literalistic or sectarian by presenting moderated positions (progressive dispensationalism) that emphasize continuity and inaugurated eschatology. 
 - Contrasts sharply with amillennial spiritualizing readings and with older dispensationalism's rigid Israel/Church separation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Highlights the "progressive" modifier as a conceptual pivot: covenant promises can be both **already inaugurated** and **not yet consummated**, permitting a more integrated hermeneutic. 
 - Uses typology to negotiate promise-fulfillment dynamics without collapsing distinctions.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued among evangelicals for clarifying intra-premillennial debates and for legitimating moderate dispensational proposals in academic theology. 
 - Used by critics and proponents alike as a reliable, concise survey and as a touchstone when discussing progressive dispensationalism.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a compact, scholarly map of premillennial variants and their hermeneutical bases, making it a standard classroom primer and reference in polemical and exegetical discussions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Premillennialism:** belief that Christ returns before a future, earthly thousand-year reign; umbrella term covering several variant systems.
- **Historic premillennialism:** older stream that affirms a future earthly kingdom but typically emphasizes covenant continuity with less rigid dispensational separations.
- **Classical/Dispensational premillennialism:** emphasizes distinct dispensations, a future national restoration of Israel, a literal millennium, and often a pretribulational rapture.
- **Progressive dispensationalism:** moderation of classical dispensationalism emphasizing inaugurated eschatology, partial fulfillment of promises, and greater continuity between Israel and the church.
- **Millennium (Revelation 20):** literal vs. symbolic readings; central exegetical battleground for premillennial claims.
- **Literal/historical-grammatical hermeneutic:** interpretive stance often associated with premillennial readings of prophetic and apocalyptic texts.
- **Israel/Church distinction:** spectrum from sharp separation (classical dispensationalism) to continuity with distinction (progressive dispensationalism) to identity (covenant theology).
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** the "already/not yet" model stressing present kingdom realities and future consummation; key to progressive formulations.
- **Parousia (Second Coming):** timed prior to the millennium in premillennial schedules; relations to rapture and tribulation debated.
- **Rapture:** terminology and timing (pretrib, midtrib, posttrib, partial) are variably affirmed within premillennial families.
- **Tribulation:** period(s) of divine judgment and testing, often linked to prophetic chronology in premillennial frameworks.
- **Typology/progressive fulfillment:** method for reading OT promises as foreshadowing and partial fulfillment in Christ with future consummation.
- **Covenant theology (contrast):** alternative framework that typically rejects a future national Israel-centered millennium.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** and taxonomy for students learning millennial options.
- As an **exegetical-model** reference that links hermeneutics to systematic consequences.
- As a **polemic and pedagogical pivot** in debates over dispensationalism, covenant continuity, and the legitimacy of progressive approaches.
