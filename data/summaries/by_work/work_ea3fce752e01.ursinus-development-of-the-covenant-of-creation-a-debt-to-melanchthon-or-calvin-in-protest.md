### TITLE
Ursinus' Development of the Covenant of Creation: A Debt to Melanchthon or Calvin? - Peter A. Lillback (essay in Protestant Scholasticism: Essays in Reassessment)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-century Reformed context; intellectual milieu of Protestant scholasticism and systematic catechesis (Heidelberg milieu).
 - Zacharias Ursinus (1534-1583), principal theological architect of the Heidelberg Catechism, writing amid post-Reformation interactions with Melanchthonian Lutheranism and Calvinist theology.
 - Lillback's essay sits in modern reassessment of origins and transmission of covenant theology within Reformed scholasticism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Lillback contends that Ursinus' formulation of the **covenant of creation** (often read as a Reformed "covenant of works"/federal structure) shows a clearer indebtedness to **Melanchthonian** formulations than to Calvin's more diffuse treatment; Ursinus systematizes Melanchthonian categories within a Reformed scholastic frame while still drawing on Calvinic emphases.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Comparative textual analysis:
 - Examines Ursinus' texts (catechetical material, sermons, commentaries) for vocabulary, canonical loci, and juridical idioms.
 - Compares those features with Melanchthon's loci/pedagogical formulations and with Calvin's Institutes and commentaries.
 - Traces the conceptual moves Ursinus adopts:
 - Adoption of dichotomy: law/promise; works/grace.
 - Forensic/legal framing of the Adamic covenant as a conditional, merit-based arrangement (the "works" aspect).
 - Integration of Christ's mediatorial role as fulfilling the covenantal conditions (federal headship).
 - Argues that the particular shape of Ursinus' federal theology (terminology, emphases, pedagogical ordering) lines up more closely with Melanchthon's systematic habits than with Calvin's dispersed but influential theological motifs.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Zacharias Ursinus, Philipp Melanchthon, John Calvin.
 - Secondary/context: Heidelberg Catechism (as locus of Ursinus' catechetical synthesis), Protestant scholastic method and later Reformed orthodoxians who transmit and refine the schema.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant of creation (Adamic covenant), covenant of works, covenant of grace.
 - Law and promise distinction, forensic/legal character of covenant obligations.
 - Federal headship, Christology (active obedience), soteriology, sacramental implications.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Ursinus' covenant of creation emerges as a disciplined, pedagogical federal schema indebted in form and terminology to Melanchthon's systematic categories, but recast within Reformed sacramental and Christological concerns - thus knitting Melanchthonian method to Calvinic substance in the Reformed scholastic synthesis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Emphasis on juridical conditionality of the covenant of creation: Ursinus frames Adam's covenant in legal/forensic terms for pedagogical clarity.
 - Pedagogical-systematic ordering (catechetical priority): covenant as organizing principle for both doctrine and devotional life.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Calvin:
 - Calvin treated covenantal themes across Institutes and exegesis; Ursinus compresses and formalizes them into a discrete covenantal schema.
 - Calvin's narrative-typological method is less scholastic; Ursinus adopts a more technical, locus-theory presentation reminiscent of Melanchthon.
 - Corrections to Melanchthon:
 - Ursinus reorients Melanchthonian categories to stronger Reformed emphases on Christ's obedience and sacramental union.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of the covenant of creation to catechesis and sacramental practice, giving covenant talk a central ecclesial and pedagogical function.
 - Precise forensic idiom applied consistently to the Adamic covenant within a Reformed doctrinal map.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influenced Heidelberg Catechism's teaching and later Reformed scholastic formulations of federal theology.
 - Shaped later Reformed expositors who read covenant theology through a scholastic-catechetical lens (confessional and pastoral deployment).

- **Enduring value**
 - Helps map the genealogy of covenant theology: shows cross-pollination between Lutheran systematic forms and Reformed substance.
 - Useful corrective to simple Calvin-vs.-later-Reformed origin narratives; clarifies the methodological sources behind Reformed federal schemata.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Zacharias Ursinus** - principal subject; catechist and systematizer of covenantal categories in Heidelberg context.
- **Covenant of Creation** - Ursinus' label for the pre-Fall covenant (Adamic ordering) framed juridically as conditional.
- **Covenant of Works** - the forensic reading of Adam's covenant as merit-based obligation; Ursinus' version shows Melanchthonian ties.
- **Covenant of Grace** - redemptive counterpart; Ursinus ties Christ's obedience as fulfillment of covenantal demands.
- **Melanchthonian influence** - methodical locus-theory, pedagogical ordering, legal-procedural vocabulary that Lillback traces in Ursinus.
- **Calvinian influence** - theological content (federal headship, soteriology, typology) that Ursinus adapts and systematizes.
- **Forensic/legal framework** - recurring idiom in Ursinus: covenant obligations, sanctions, and merits presented in juridical terms.
- **Federal headship** - Adam/Christ as covenantal representatives; Ursinus emphasizes Christ's fulfillment of covenant conditions.
- **Heidelberg Catechism** - practical locus where Ursinus' covenant schema is catechetically implemented.
- **Protestant Scholasticism** - methodological horizon; Ursinus translates covenant themes into scholastic loci for instruction.
- **Law and Promise** - structuring distinction for Ursinus' covenantal taxonomy.
- **Active obedience / Passive obedience** - Christological categories tied to covenant fulfillment in Ursinus' soteriology.
- **Typology / Sacramental economy** - covenant informs sacramental practice and ecclesial pedagogy in Ursinus' scheme.
- **Pedagogical-systematic ordering** - hallmark of Ursinus' use: covenant as organizing principle for teaching doctrine.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **genealogical definition source** for tracing the intellectual debt-lines in Reformed covenant theology (Melanchthon vs. Calvin).
- As a **polemic and corrective** to simplistic Calvin-centric origin stories of covenant theology, showing methodological hybridity.
- As an **exegetical/pedagogical model** for how covenantal schemata were operationalized in catechisms and scholastic manuals.
