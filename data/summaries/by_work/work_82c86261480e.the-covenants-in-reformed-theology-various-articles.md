### TITLE
The Covenants in Reformed Theology (various articles) - O. Palmer Robertson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century conservative Reformed context; shaped by Westminster/Scottish and North American Reformed seminaries.
 - Reaction to both 19th-20th century liberal theology and mid-20th-century dispensationalism and neonomian tendencies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The covenant structure of Scripture provides the single most reliable framework for understanding redemptive history: the **Covenant of Grace** is one covenant unfolded in successive administrations with Christ as its sole Mediator.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: covenant as a bilateral, promissory, and legal-relational bond established by God with his people.
 - Historical tracing: surveys biblical covenants (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, New Covenant) and shows their unity under the Covenant of Grace.
 - Theological synthesis: argues for a distinction between covenant of works (pre-fall, covenant with Adam) and covenant of grace (post-fall, mediated in Christ), and-where employed-covenant of redemption (intra-Trinitarian agreement to accomplish redemption).
 - Exegetical support: draws on typology and continuity of promise to justify paedobaptism, sacramental theology, and corporate election.
 - Practical consequences: ecclesiology (covenant community), pastoral care (assurance, child instruction), and soteriology (faith as covenantal response).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, the Westminster divines), Vos and the Princeton tradition; interacts critically with dispensationalists and neonomians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture as covenant-history, covenant theology, Trinity (roles in covenant), Christology as Mediator, soteriology (justification and union with Christ), ecclesiology, sacramental theology (baptism and the Lord's Supper), election and promise.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **the Covenant of Grace-one redemptive pact mediated by Christ-orders biblical interpretation, sacraments, and the identity of God's people.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on legal and promissory character of covenant language: covenants are not merely metaphors but binding legal-relational acts by God.
 - Robust unity across redemptive history: sees Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and New covenants as administrations of one saving covenant.
 - Christ as the covenantal Mediator who secures covenant blessings for the elect and institutes covenant signs.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects **dispensational** separations between Israel and the church by insisting on corporate continuity rooted in promise and seed theology.
 - Opposes **neonomian** readings that collapse covenantal promise into a new law of works; insists on grace, not new merit, as covenantal ground.
 - Pushes back against any crude typological readings that detach Christological fulfillment from concrete covenant promises.
- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications**
 - Reaffirms and sharpens distinctions among Covenant of Works, Covenant of Grace, and Covenant of Redemption, emphasizing their functional relations rather than speculative chronology.
 - Stresses the difference between **administrations** of the Covenant of Grace and separate covenants in the sense of different divine acts.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian seminaries; influenced pastoral practice on baptism, catechesis, and covenantal preaching.
 - Served as a key modern defense of classical federal theology against mid-20th-century alternatives.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for integrating exegesis and systematics; durable pedagogical model for teaching covenantal biblical theology and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant** - binding, promissory legal relationship instituted by God with a people.
- **Covenant of Grace** - the single, saving covenant established after the Fall, promising redemption in Christ across administrations.
- **Covenant of Works** - pre-fall covenant with Adam promising life for perfect obedience; serves as theological foil to highlight grace.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - intra-Trinitarian agreement in eternity to secure redemption (used to explain Christ's mediatorial role).
- **Federal Headship** - the doctrine that representatives (Adam; Christ) act for their people; union with a federal head determines standing.
- **Mediator / Mediatorial Office** - Christ as the appointed party who fulfills covenant obligations and secures covenant blessings.
- **Administration / Dispensation (in Robertson's sense)** - successive historical foldings-out of the one Covenant of Grace (e.g., Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New).
- **Sign and Seal** - sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper) as visible tokens that confirm and apply covenant promises.
- **Continuity / Discontinuity** - continuity of promise and people across covenants; qualified discontinuity in ceremonial and civil particulars.
- **Election** - God's sovereign choice expressed and enacted within the covenantal promise.
- **Promise vs. Law** - covenantal promise is the core of the Covenant of Grace, not a redefinition of law as a means of acceptance.
- **Seed / Corporate Promise** - the promise to Abraham includes corporate and messianic seed; basis for paedobaptism and covenant community.
- **Typology / Fulfillment** - Old Testament types are real anticipations that find fulfillment in Christ and covenant consummation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for classic Reformed covenant theology and terminologies.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational and neonomian positions, defending continuity and grace.
 - As an **exegetical model** for sacramental theology (esp. infant baptism) and covenantal ecclesiology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking soteriology, Christology, and sacramental practice within a covenantal framework.
