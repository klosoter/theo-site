### TITLE
Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code - Ruha Benjamin (Polity, 2019)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2019 in the context of rising public scrutiny of algorithmic bias, facial-recognition failures, and surveillance expansion.
 - Situated at the intersection of Science & Technology Studies (STS), critical race studies, and abolitionist praxis; engages contemporary debates about AI ethics, data justice, and tech industry power.
- **Central thesis**
 - Technologies do not simply fail neutrally; they often **encode and reproduce racial hierarchies** - a dynamic Benjamin terms the **"New Jim Code."** The remedy is not only technical fixes but an **abolitionist imagination** that restructures social and technological systems.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: demonstrates how ostensibly objective systems (algorithms, infrastructures, design practices) perpetuate racialized outcomes across policing, employment, health, and consumer finance.
 - Genealogy: situates algorithmic harms in historical practices of classification, segregation, and control (linking to Jim Crow legacies).
 - Case studies: predictive policing, facial recognition, healthcare algorithms, consumer scoring systems, and "smart" urban technologies.
 - Prescriptive: advances **abolitionist tools** - conceptual, design, and policy measures - that emphasize redistribution of power, transparency, collective accountability, and alternatives to carceral logics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on abolitionist thinkers (Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Kaba), critical race scholars (Michelle Alexander), and algorithmic-justice researchers (Cathy O'Neil, Safiya Noble, Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru).
 - Engages STS and technology critics (Langdon Winner, Shoshana Zuboff) and design-justice movements.
- **Doctrines / theological loci implicated**
 - Not explicitly doctrinal, but richly relevant to: **sin and structural evil**, **justice**, **human dignity/imago Dei**, **prophetic witness**, and **ethics of stewardship** over communal goods (public spaces, data).
 - Suggests a theological reading of technology as moral-political agent that calls for ecclesial and public response.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Technology is not neutral: it can naturalize oppression. An ecclesial and ethical response must join abolitionist praxis to reshape design, redistribute power, and embody imaginative alternatives to systems that treat persons as data points rather than bearers of dignity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves beyond technoskepticism to offer **abolition as design practice** - not merely protest but reconstructive creativity.
 - Centers race as constitutive of technological systems rather than an accidental output.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges reformist, compliance-driven responses (algorithmic audits, fairness-by-design) as insufficient when they fail to alter underlying power relations.
 - Contrasts with techno-optimism and "solutionism" by refusing purely technical remedies divorced from social transformation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **"New Jim Code"** - a memorable analytic linking historic racial control mechanisms to contemporary coded systems.
 - The notion of **abolitionist tools** reframes abolition from negation to generative design and policy alternatives.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited across STS, ethics in computer science, public-policy, and race studies; catalyzed collaborations between activists, scholars, and technologists.
 - Influential for theology and public religion scholars seeking frameworks for race-technology critique; some technologists push back as too politicized while many ethicists and policymakers adopt its framing.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a compact, actionable vocabulary for courses on technology and ethics, public theology, and social ethics.
 - Serves as a bridge for religious scholars to engage empirical tech debates with abolitionist moral imagination.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Jim Code**
 - Technologies and algorithms that reproduce or entrench racial hierarchies under the guise of objectivity.
- **Abolitionist tools**
 - Practices, policies, and design strategies that dismantle carceral or exclusionary systems and build alternatives.
- **Coded inequity**
 - How data, models, and interfaces embody social prejudices and distribute harms unevenly.
- **Technological solutionism**
 - The belief that technical fixes alone can resolve political and social problems; critiqued as insufficient.
- **Design justice**
 - A participatory framework that centers marginalized communities in design decisions and redistributes power.
- **Surveillance infrastructure**
 - Systems (cameras, sensors, data aggregation) that enable monitoring and social sorting; theological corollary: panopticon metaphors for social sin.
- **Predictive policing / algorithmic governance**
 - Use of models to allocate enforcement resources; exemplifies feedback loops that amplify existing disparities.
- **Facial recognition / biometric bias**
 - Examples of technologies with higher error rates for marginalized groups, illuminating design and data harms.
- **Disparate impact**
 - Outcomes that disproportionately harm protected groups even without overt intent; legal and ethical category for critique.
- **Social sorting**
 - Practices of categorizing and differentiating populations through data-driven systems.
- **Structural sin / systemic injustice**
 - Theological framing for harms embedded in institutions and technologies.
- **Counter-design / reparative imagination**
 - Generative practices to redesign systems toward dignity and equity.
- **Data as property vs. common good**
 - Tension Benjamin highlights: commodification of social data vs. public stewardship models.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in public theology and ethics to link race, technology, and structural sin.
- As a **polemic** in courses and advocacy to critique reformist techno-ethics and argue for abolitionist alternatives.
- As a **definition source** and case-study collection for interdisciplinary seminars on algorithmic justice, policy, and congregational praxis.
