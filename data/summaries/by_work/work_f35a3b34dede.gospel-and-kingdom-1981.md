### TITLE
Gospel and Kingdom (1981) - Graeme Goldsworthy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1981 amid a growing evangelical interest in biblical-theological and redemptive-historical approaches to Scripture.
 - Fits within Reformed/evangelical renewal of canonical and typological reading of the Bible; a practical corrective to both liberal allegorizing and dispensational compartmentalizing of Testaments.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible coheres around the twin motifs of **promise** and **fulfillment** in Christ: the gospel is the announcement and inauguration of God's kingdom in Jesus, and the whole canon must be read Christocentrically as promise-fulfillment-consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes a hermeneutical principle: Scripture is to be read redemptively, with Christ as the key to understanding Old and New Testaments.
 - Traces a **promise - fulfillment - consummation** pattern in biblical narrative and covenantal structure.
 - Defines "gospel" not merely as soteriological facts about individual salvation but as proclamation of the kingdom that Jesus fulfills and inaugurates.
 - Emphasizes typology and canonical continuity: OT institutions, promises, and shadows find their telos in Christ and the eschatological kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Builds on and interacts with biblical-theological traditions (notably Vosian and redemptive-historical currents), and addresses modern exegetical trends that fragment Scripture.
 - Implicitly counters dispensational separations and existentialist or pietistic reductions of the gospel.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: centrality of Christ as interpreter and fulfillment of Scripture.
 - **Covenant theology**: covenant as structuring motif for promise/fulfillment.
 - **Eschatology**: inaugurated kingdom and its consummation.
 - **Biblical revelation and hermeneutics**: canonical and typological interpretation.
 - **Soteriology** reframed within the kingdom narrative (gospel as kingdom announcement).
- **Closing line**
 - Goldsworthy's theological center of gravity: **a Christ-centered, promise-fulfillment reading of Scripture that locates the gospel within the kingdom inaugurated by Jesus and driving toward consummation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp pairing of **gospel** and **kingdom** as the controlling theology for reading both Testaments.
 - Prioritizes **promise-fulfillment-consummation** as a simple but comprehensive hermeneutical schema.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic, moralistic, or purely individualistic renderings of the gospel by re-situating salvation in the corporate, covenantal, and eschatological kingdom.
 - Challenges dispensational readings that sharply separate OT promises from NT fulfillment; insists on typological continuity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes accessible language for redemptive-historical reading: treating the gospel as intrinsically **kingdom-oriented**, not merely forensic or personal.
 - Reinforces "Christ as the key" to the whole canon in practical homiletics and theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative evangelical and Reformed seminaries and churches; cited in discussions of biblical theology, preaching, and hermeneutics.
 - Spawned further work by Goldsworthy and others developing redemptive-historical preaching and curriculum.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, teachable framework for connecting OT and NT around Christ; especially valuable for sermon formation, catechesis, and introductory biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel**
 - Not merely individual justification; the public proclamation of God's saving action inaugurating the kingdom in Christ.
- **Kingdom (of God)**
 - The reigning rule of God realized in Jesus' person and work; both inaugurated and eschatologically consummated.
- **Promise - Fulfillment - Consummation**
 - The triadic hermeneutical skeleton Goldsworthy uses to trace biblical unity.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic**
 - Reading Scripture with Christ as interpretive center and telos.
- **Typology**
 - NT fulfillment of OT types; typology is canonical, historical, and Christ-focused, not allegorical.
- **Redemptive-historical method**
 - Interpreting texts within the story of redemption rather than as isolated moral or doctrinal propositions.
- **Covenant**
 - Structural framework for unity between promise and fulfillment across the ages.
- **Eschatological inauguration**
 - The idea that the kingdom is both present (inaugurated by Christ) and future (to be consummated).
- **Canonical reading**
 - Emphasis on the unity of Scripture as a canon; use of whole-Bible coherence rather than isolated proof-texting.
- **Gospel-of-the-kingdom**
 - Phrase emphasizing content of gospel proclamation: kingship of Christ and covenant reign.
- **Fulfillment-in-Christ**
 - The claim that OT promises attain their meaning in Jesus' person and work.
- **Preaching/evangelism emphasis**
 - Practical application: preaching should present Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises and inaugurator of the kingdom.
- **Typological continuity vs literalist partition**
 - Distinguishes Goldsworthy's typological continuity from dispensational partitioning of biblical covenants.
- **Promise as theological lens**
 - Treats divine promise as the primary key to understanding scriptural progression.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: defines "gospel" in redemptive-historical and kingdom terms.
 - As an **exegetical model / homiletical pivot**: a concise guide for Christ-centered preaching and canonical interpretation.
 - As a **polemic**: theological resource against dispensational fragmentation and moralistic reductions of the gospel.
