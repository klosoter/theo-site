### TITLE
Orthodox and Modern: Studies in the Theology of Karl Barth - Bruce McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Barth scholarship aiming to re-evaluate Karl Barth (primarily mid-20th-century Protestant theology) against 19th-century liberalism, classical Reformed orthodoxy, and continental philosophy.
 - Situated in ongoing debates about neo-orthodoxy, natural theology, and the analogia entis vs. analogia fidei controversy (notably Barth vs. Brunner and premodern scholasticism).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Barth should be read as simultaneously **orthodox in doctrinal content** and **modern in method**: he reconstructs classical Reformed and patristic themes by rejecting natural-theological premises (analogia entis) and rooting theological language in the revelatory event of Christ (analogia fidei).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological recovery of Barth's sources and polemical targets (Calvin, Aquinas, Schleiermacher, Brunner).
 - Systematic exposition showing how Barth:
 - Critiques and overturns natural theology and analogia entis.
 - Re-centers theology on revelation as an event (the Word made present in Scripture and Christ).
 - Reframes doctrines (Trinity, election, Christology) within a Christocentric ontology and an epistemology of encounter.
 - Normative claim: Barth's method is critically realistic and dialectical - it preserves divine transcendence while allowing true predication through God's self-disclosure.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Karl Barth (primary subject); interlocutors include Aquinas (analogia entis), Calvin (Reformation reception), Friedrich Schleiermacher, Emil Brunner (analogy controversy), Hegel, Bultmann; McCormack also reads Barth against broader modern philosophical themes.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (event and Word), doctrine of God (transcendence, predication), analogical language, Christology, election, covenant, natural theology, method of dogmatics.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth's theology is a disciplined recovery of orthodox content reframed by a modern, event-centered epistemology that refuses creaturely grounds for knowing God (analogia entis) and insists that all true analogy flows from God's self-revelation in Christ (analogia fidei).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Close historiographical work showing Barth as a reconstructionist of Reformed orthodoxy rather than merely a reactive neo-orthodox.
 - Stress on **revelation as event** (Word-event) as the pivot for theological predication and ontology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects readings that portray Barth as irrationalist or anti-intellectual by emphasizing his critical realism and systematic rigor.
 - Contrasts Barth with Brunner and others who allowed a form of analogia entis or natural knowledge of God.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and reframes the **analogia entis vs. analogia fidei** debate: not merely negative rejection but positive re-location of analogy within the economy of revelation.
 - Treats election and Christ's person as constitutive for theological ontology (Christ as criterion of being/saying).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and academic Barth studies; used to rehabilitate Barth inside confessional Protestant theology and to inform contemporary debates on natural theology and the doctrine of revelation.
 - Provoked further work on Barth's realism, ontology of revelation, and the boundaries between dogmatics and philosophy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, source-attentive framework for reading Barth as both orthodox and modern; indispensable for courses on doctrine, Barth reception, and the analogy debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis** - "analogy of being"; classical scholastic basis for natural theology. McCormack: Barth rejects it as illegitimate ground for theology.
- **Analogia fidei** - "analogy of faith"; analogy anchored in the content of revealed faith. McCormack: Barth's positive locus for predication about God.
- **Revelation as event (Word-event)** - Revelation is a concrete divine act (Christ/Scripture) rather than merely a set of propositions or natural signs.
- **Christocentrism** - The person and work of Christ as the decisive hermeneutical and ontological center for all theology.
- **Critically realist dialectical theology** - Methodological descriptor: theology affirms a real divine object while retaining dialectical critique of human pretensions.
- **Divine transcendence** - Absolute Creator-creature distinction preserved; predicates of God derive their warrant from God's self-communication.
- **Natural theology** - Inquiry into God via creaturely signs; treated as defective unless subordinated to revelation.
- **Election** - For Barth (as read by McCormack), election is ontologically formative: Christ as electing and elected constitutes human identity before God.
- **Analogy of predication** - The way language about God can be true analogically only insofar as it is grounded in God's self-revelation.
- **Orthodoxy vs Modernity** - Categories reframed: Barth's project shows continuity with orthodoxy in content but appropriation of modern epistemological insights.
- **Theological method** - Emphasis on historically situated, scripturally governed dogmatics that do not capitulate to philosophical naturalism.
- **Creator-creature distinction** - Central safeguard ensuring that theology does not conflate God with human categories.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Barth's stance on analogia entis vs analogia fidei.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates over natural theology and the legitimacy of philosophy in dogmatics.
- As an **exegetical-model/conceptual pivot** for reading Barth's doctrines (revelation, election, Christology) within a modern-critical but orthodox framework.
