### TITLE
The Cross of Christ - John R. W. Stott (1986)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1986 amid late-20th-century evangelical retrieval of classical doctrine; Stott writes as a leading evangelical Anglican teacher, aiming to correct both liberal minimization of substitutionary language and pietistic reduction to private piety.
 - Engages post-war scholarly debates (Aulén, Anselmian and forensic readings) and the pastoral need for preaching the cross in mission and holiness.

- **Central thesis**
 - The cross is the central, decisive revelation of God's character and saving action; a comprehensive atonement must hold together multiple biblical motifs (sacrifice, substitution, victory, reconciliation) without collapsing them into a single simplistic theory.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Biblical exposition - systematic survey of New Testament images of the cross and their theological import.
 - Part II: Theological synthesis - argues for the primacy of substitutionary/penal elements while integrating Christus Victor, sacrifice, propitiation, and moral transformation.
 - Part III: Practical outworking - implications for discipleship, mission, corporate holiness, and the Spirit's role in appropriation of the cross.
 - Major moves:
 - Demonstrate the multiplicity of atonement metaphors in Scripture.
 - Defend penal substitution as central to the gospel's doctrine of justification.
 - Relate the objective work of Christ to subjective appropriation by the Spirit (including Baptism Of The Holy Spirit and union with Christ).
 - Apply the cross to social ethics and Christian living.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages New Testament writers extensively; dialogues with Anselm, Gustaf Aulén (Christus Victor), modern critics of penal substitution, and contemporary evangelical scholarship.
 - Draws on classical Protestant theology (Calvin, Reformation forensic categories) while seeking ecumenical resonance.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (suffering, obedience, lordship)
 - **Atonement** (various models and their integration)
 - **Trinity** (economic relations in redemption)
 - **Justification & imputation**
 - **Sanctification & union with Christ**
 - **Pneumatology** - practical role of the Spirit (including Baptism Of The Holy Spirit) in applying the benefits of the cross.

- **Closing line**
 - Stott centers theology on the cross as the factual, revelatory core from which justification, sanctification, mission, and Spirit-filled life coherently flow.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on an integrated model: penal substitution is central but must stand with Christus Victor, sacrificial imagery, and moral transformation - a deliberate synthetic move.
 - Strong pastoral concern: theology is to fuel preaching, evangelism, discipleship, and social responsibility.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal denials and pietistic reductions that downplay objective substitution; also resists single-model exclusivism (e.g., only moral influence or only Christus Victor).
 - Offers more biblical breadth than narrow forensic-only accounts and more doctrinal clarity than some liberal or experiential renderings.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Frames atonement in **both objective (what Christ has done) and subjective (how the Spirit applies it)** terms, foregrounding union with Christ as the hinge between them.
 - Clarifies language: distinguishes **propitiation** (satisfaction of divine wrath) from mere moral influence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in global evangelicalism; used in seminaries and by preachers as a clear, ecumenical exposition of atonement doctrine.
 - Praised for clarity and charitable engagement; critiqued by some for insufficient attention to liberationist or feminist reinterpretations and for treating complex metaphors as harmonizable.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable synthesis combining careful exegesis, pastoral application, and doctrinal fidelity; remains a go-to resource for teaching the cross across denominations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The Cross of Christ** - central event revealing God's justice and love; focal point of redemption.
- **Atonement** - the encompassing work of Christ that reconciles sinners to God; treated as multi-faceted.
- **Penal Substitution** - Stott defends this as the core legal/forensic explanation of justification; Christ bears penalty due to divine justice.
- **Christus Victor** - emphasized as the biblical motif of Christ's victory over evil powers; integrated with substitution.
- **Propitiation** - God's wrath is satisfied in Christ; Stott insists this term is biblically warranted and pastorally meaningful.
- **Expiation / Sacrifice** - language of sacrifice remains central: sin is expiated through Christ's offering.
- **Reconciliation** - relational restoration between God and humans; flows from objective work and Spirit-mediated appropriation.
- **Union with Christ** - the ontological link by which believers share in the benefits of the cross; the Spirit effects this union.
- **Justification** - declared righteous through imputation of Christ's righteousness; forensic core tied to penal substitution.
- **Sanctification** - ongoing moral transformation consequent upon the cross; practical outgrowth of union.
- **Baptism Of The Holy Spirit** - the means by which the believer is united to Christ and receives appropriation of the cross's benefits; Stott treats Spirit-baptism as indispensable to realizing atonement personally.
- **Moral Influence** - acknowledged as an aspect (renewal of the heart) but insufficient alone to explain penal aspects.
- **Victory / Power over Evil** - the cross as decisive defeat of hostile spiritual forces; grounds Christian hope and mission.
- **Objective / Subjective aspects** - key analytic pair: what Christ achieved (objective) vs. how believers receive it (subjective, by the Spirit).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical teaching on atonement that balances multiple motifs.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal minimization and narrow single-theory atonement accounts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for sermons and courses on Pauline and Johannine atonement language.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking forensic justification with Spirit-empowered sanctification and mission.
