### TITLE
**Genesis, Science, and the Beginning: Evaluating Interpretations of Genesis 1** - Todd S. Beall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written within late-20th/early-21st-century evangelical conversations over origins; addresses the surge of debate between Young Earth Creationism, Old Earth views, Framework/ Literary approaches, and Theistic Evolution.
 - Situated in a theological milieu anxious to preserve Scriptural authority while engaging modern cosmology, geology, and biology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The core task is to evaluate competing interpretations of Genesis 1 by criteria that balance **exegetical fidelity**, **theological coherence**, and **scientific plausibility**, proposing a hermeneutic that avoids both naive concordism and doctrinal capitulation to science.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of major interpretive options (literal 24-hour-days / Young Earth; Day-Age; Gap; Framework; Analogical/Functional; Theistic Evolution).
 - Exegetical analysis of Genesis 1: genre, Hebrew syntax, lexical fields (yom, bara, tohu wabohu), chronological markers, and intertextual echoes in OT.
 - Engagement with Ancient Near Eastern parallels and the implications for meaning and authorial intent.
 - Assessment rubric: how well each model does on (1) textual-historical fit, (2) theological implications (creation, providence, imago Dei), and (3) compatibility with current natural-scientific knowledge.
 - Case studies comparing models applied to specific scientific claims (age of earth, biological origins, human origins).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Major interlocutors include proponents of the Framework and Functional readings (e.g., John H. Walton), old-earth advocates (e.g., Hugh Ross), classic young-earth critics (e.g., Henry Morris), and voices advocating integration (e.g., Francis Collins, Denis Alexander).
 - Uses biblical scholars (social-scientific and literary readings), historians of ANE religion, and summaries of relevant scientific positions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical authority; hermeneutics; creation (creatio ex nihilo), providence, image of God, human origins and sin; some implications for Christology and soteriology via anthropology; ecclesial practice (education, apologetics).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Beall urges a posture that affirms Scripture's theological intent about God as Creator while employing disciplined hermeneutics and scientific humility to avoid simplistic concordism or unnecessary conflict between the Bible and natural science.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasis on a multi-criterial evaluative rubric that gives roughly equal weight to textual exegesis, theological integrity, and scientific evidence.
 - Stress on genre and ANE context as decisive for limiting the range of legitimate scientific claims read into Genesis 1.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges literalist concordism for reading modern scientific categories back into an ancient text.
 - Critiques some forms of theistic evolution for underplaying biblical theological claims (e.g., the special status of humans).
 - Balances between Walton-style functional/temple imagery and conservative commitments to creatio ex nihilo and human uniqueness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Proposes refined distinctions between "concordism" and "compatibilism" in biblical-science dialogue and operationalizes an "exegesis-first but science-informed" posture.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful across moderate evangelical circles as a tempering alternative to both Young Earth apologetics and uncritical evolutionary assimilation.
 - Adopted as a textbook/resource in seminary modules on hermeneutics and doctrine of creation; referenced in broader evangelical attempts to articulate faithful science engagement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological template for future biblical-science disputes: clear evaluative criteria, careful engagement with primary sources, and theological prioritization without scientistic avoidance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Concordism**
 - Reading Genesis so that its statements map onto modern scientific accounts; critiqued when it imposes anachronistic categories on the text.
- **Non-concordism / Compatibilism**
 - Maintaining theological agreement with science without forcing literal equivalence; Beall favors a tempered compatibilism.
- **Framework hypothesis**
 - Reads the days as a literary structure organizing theological truths rather than chronological material processes; evaluated sympathetically but tested against textual specifics.
- **Day-Age view**
 - Interprets "day" (yom) as long epoch; appraised for exegetical and scientific fit.
- **Literal 24-hour-day (Young Earth)**
 - Treats days as ordinary solar days; assessed for hermeneutical claims and clash with mainstream scientific chronology.
- **Functional/Temple reading (John H. Walton)**
 - Sees Genesis 1 as assigning functions and roles rather than material origins; influential on Beall's ANE-context arguments.
- **Accommodation**
 - The idea Scripture may use phenomenological or human-accessible language; central to hermeneutical moderation between text and science.
- **Exegesis-first rubric**
 - Priority of textual meaning, then theological coherence, then scientific integration-Beall's proposed ordering.
- **Methodological naturalism**
 - Scientific methodological constraint; discussed for its implications for dialogue with theological claims.
- **Image of God (Imago Dei)**
 - Treated as non-negotiable theological center affecting how human origins debates are evaluated.
- **Creatio ex nihilo**
 - Affirmed as doctrinal baseline regardless of interpretive model of "days".
- **Hermeneutical humility**
 - An ethical posture urging caution before forcing definitive theological settlements on contested scientific questions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating ANE context with modern hermeneutics.
- As a **polemic resource** against naive concordism and against reductionist theistic evolution that undermines imago Dei.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary courses: defining criteria for adjudicating competing Genesis 1 readings.
