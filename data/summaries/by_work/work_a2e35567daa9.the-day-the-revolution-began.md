### TITLE
The Day the Revolution Began - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in mid-2010s by N. T. Wright, Anglican New Testament scholar and public theologian; situated within contemporary debates over inaugurated eschatology, Pauline interpretation, and public Christian witness.
 - Milieu: postliberal historical-reading of Paul, reaction to both triumphalist dispensationalism and reductionist moralized readings of the cross.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus' death and resurrection inaugurate God's new-creation revolution: the decisive reversal of sin, death and hostile powers and the launching of the kingdom that restores true human life.
 - The book asks: What does Jesus' death and rising mean for ordinary human life, identity, vocation, and the cosmic order?

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Movement from the historical events of Jesus' death and resurrection to their cosmic and anthropological significance.
 - Major moves:
 - Diagnose human plight not primarily as abstract existentialism but as social/cosmic brokenness (ruling powers, creation disorder).
 - Read the cross as defeat of hostile powers and the establishment of Jesus as the true king/new Adam.
 - Emphasize resurrection as the decisive birth of new creation and the basis for Christian moral and communal life (calling, vocation, hope).
 - Practical corollaries: ethics grounded in new-creation identity; mission as participation in God's renewing project.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Paul (esp. Romans and 1 Corinthians) read historically and theologically.
 - Evangelical and liberal interlocutors: critiques of individualistic atonement models, triumphalist pietism, and reductionist readings of Adam/Genesis.
 - Reappropriates patristic, Reformation, and recent scholarly debates (e.g., on the "new Adam" motif).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: Jesus as king, warrior, and new representative head.
 - **Soteriology/atonement**: cross as cosmic defeat and establishment of covenantal newness (not confined to forensic legalism).
 - **Eschatology**: inaugurated eschatology; resurrection as first fruits of new creation.
 - **Anthropology**: new-creation identity; what it means to be human restored by Christ.
 - **Hamartiology/The Fall**: historic rupture with pervasive consequences; needs reframing in corporate/cosmic terms.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically center-gravity: the cross and resurrection constitute the launching of God's restorative revolution - a historical, cosmic, and anthropological re-creation that grounds Christian identity, mission, and ethics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that the resurrection inaugurates a concrete, bodily new-creation - not only individual immortality but communal and cosmic renewal.
 - Recasts the atonement language toward defeat of hostile powers and the reconstitution of humanity under Christ the king.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond private forensic accounts of atonement to reframe salvation in cosmic and social categories.
 - Challenges readings that privatize Christian hope or that treat the resurrection as merely spiritualized immortality.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Repeated use of "revolution" language to underline political/kingly dimensions of Jesus' work.
 - Emphasizes "new creation" vocabulary as the primary hermeneutical frame for soteriology and ethics.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received among evangelicals seeking robust historic-grammatical readings of Paul that avoid pietistic individualism.
 - Criticized by some conservative systematicians for underplaying classical forensic emphasis; welcomed by those emphasizing social-communal readings of Pauline theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to fragmented theologies that separate eschatology, anthropology, and ethics.
 - Valuable pedagogically for courses on Paul, atonement, and new creation theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Creation**
 - Central hermeneutical key: resurrection is first-fruits; God begins the restoration of cosmos and human vocation.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology**
 - "Already/not yet" stress: kingdom present in Jesus' deeds, consummation awaits final renewal.
- **Representative Headship (Jesus as new Adam)**
 - Jesus embodies a corporate reversal of Adam's failed representation; inaugurates correct human leadership.
- **Cosmic Powers / Hostile Powers**
 - Sin understood as structural/cosmic domination that Christ defeats publicly on cross and resurrection.
- **Resurrection Bodilyness**
 - Emphasizes physical, embodied renewal as normative for Christian hope and ethics.
- **Vocation / Calling**
 - Christian life rooted in new identity; ethics flow from re-created human purpose, not merely legal obligation.
- **Cross as Political Event**
 - Cross interpreted as decisive act in the cosmic political struggle - defeat of principalities, not mere private transaction.
- **The Fall (corporate consequences)**
 - Fall described as historical rupture with systemic consequences for human institutions, bodies, and relations.
- **Historicity of Adam**
 - Treated as historically and theologically significant insofar as Paul's argument presumes a representative Adam; Wright affirms corporate/historical reading against purely mythical readings.
- **Kingdom / Revolution**
 - "Kingdom" is the sphere of God's restored reign; "revolution" underscores radical change inaugurated by Christ.
- **First Fruits**
 - Resurrection as prototypical event guaranteeing fuller future renewal.
- **Righteousness (Covenantal)**
 - Tied to covenantal status within God's new-creation people rather than abstract moral quality only.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in eschatological-anthropological discussions (modeling how resurrection informs human identity).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul's Adam/Christ material (illustrating representative headship and corporate sin).
 - As a **polemic resource** against privatized atonement and reductionist accounts of the Fall and its consequences.
