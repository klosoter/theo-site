### TITLE
The Christ of Wisdom - O. Palmer Robertson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; produced within the resurgence of covenantal and biblical-theological studies in conservative Presbyterian seminary contexts. Engages both canonical exegesis and systematic-theological construction against critical and reductionist trends in Wisdom studies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The person and work of Christ should be understood as the incarnate Wisdom of God whose role and identity are integrally bound to covenantal structures - especially the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption) - making him the appointed federal head and surety who executes creation, revelation, and redemption.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of Old Testament Wisdom traditions (Proverbs, Job, and intertestamental Wisdom) to show a personal, agentive Wisdom motif in Israel's thought.
 - Exegetical tracing of Wisdom themes into the New Testament (John's Logos, Pauline wisdom language, Colossians/1 Corinthians) to demonstrate continuity and Christological fulfillment.
 - Theological synthesis linking Wisdom Christology with covenant theology:
 - Ascribes to the preexistent Wisdom the role of covenant party in the **pactum salutis**.
 - Argues Christ functions as covenant **Representative/Surety** (federal head) whose obedience/atonement secures covenant benefits.
 - Practical implications: revelation (Christ as interpretive key to Scripture), soteriology (covenantal mechanics of salvation), and sanctification (Wisdom as formed in the people of God).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (OT Wisdom corpus, Psalms, prophetic literature; NT Pauline, Johannine, and Colossian texts); patristic Wisdom receptions (e.g., Logos-Sophia motifs); Reformers and Reformed scholastics (Calvin, Vos, Turretin, Bavinck); contemporary covenant theologians and critics of direct Christological readings of Wisdom literature.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Word and Wisdom), Trinity (relations of Son/Wisdom), Christology (preexistence, incarnation, mediatorial office), Covenant theology (pactum salutis, federal headship), Atonement and soteriology, ecclesiology (church as Wisdom-community).
- **Closing line:** Robertson locates Jesus as the canonical union of Wisdom and covenantal headship: the preexistent Wisdom appointed in the pactum salutis who becomes incarnate surety to reveal, redeem, and form God's covenant people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm integration of OT Wisdom-person motifs with classical covenantal categories, treating Wisdom not merely as attribute but as covenantal agent.
 - Emphasizes the legal/relational reality of Christ's preincarnate appointment (pactum salutis) alongside the sapiential language.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on approaches that treat Wisdom literature as purely sapiential or moralistic and not inherently Christological.
 - Counters liberal-critical separations between Jewish Wisdom and subsequent Christian Christology by showing canonical continuity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses Wisdom-category language (Sophia/Logos) as a bridge term into juridical covenant vocabulary (surety, head, party) without collapsing theological distinctions.
 - Reframes the **pactum salutis** as the decisive context in which Wisdom's preexistence and mediatorial role are theologically intelligible.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminary courses on Christology and covenant theology; influential among those seeking canonical integration of OT and NT Christological data.
 - Criticized by some specialists who caution against over-dogmatic readings of Wisdom texts or who prefer more historically nuanced second-temple contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a clear model for connecting biblical exegesis of Wisdom motifs to systematic claims about Christ's person and covenant work.
 - Valuable for pastors and teachers who need a theologically coherent way to preach Wisdom texts christologically and covenantally.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ as Wisdom:** Christ identified with the personal Wisdom motif of Scripture - active agent in creation, revelation, and redemption.
- **Logos and Sophia:** Johannine Logos and OT Sophia are treated as complementary verbal/personified modes in which divine Wisdom is revealed in Christ.
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption):** The preincarnate agreement between Father and Son in which Christ is appointed the covenantal Redeemer; central hermeneutical key for Robertson.
- **Covenant Head / Federal Representation:** Christ as federal head who acts on behalf of the elect - obedience and atonement are corporate and representative.
- **Preexistence of Christ:** The Wisdom motif supports claims of the Son's preexistence and active role before incarnation.
- **Incarnation as Wisdom's Self-revelation:** The incarnation is Wisdom taking on humanity to disclose God and accomplish covenantal redemption.
- **Surety / Mediatorial Office:** Christ functions as surety in the pactum salutis; legal and relational metaphors are used to describe atonement dynamics.
- **Wisdom Literature (Proverbs, Job, etc.):** Read canonically; not merely ethical maxims but containing personified Wisdom poles that point to Christ.
- **New Testament Wisdom texts (1 Cor 1-2; Colossians; John 1):** Key exegetical loci where Wisdom language is mapped onto Christ.
- **Revelation (General/Special):** Christ as the culminating revelation - Wisdom renders divine counsel intelligible.
- **Soteriology / Redemption:** Salvation described in covenantal, judicial, and sapiential terms.
- **Ecclesial formation:** Church as the community shaped by Wisdom and covenantal solidarity under Christ.
- **Divine Counsel / Immutability:** God's plan (counsel) includes the Wisdom-Son as the unchanging covenant agent.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and exegetical source linking **pactum salutis** and Wisdom Christology.
- As a polemical resource against non-covenantal or non-Christological treatments of Wisdom literature.
- As an exegetical model for preaching and teaching OT Wisdom texts in light of NT Christology and covenant theology.
