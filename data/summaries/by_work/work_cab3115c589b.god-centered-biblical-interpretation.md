### TITLE
God-Centered Biblical Interpretation - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical context. Reaction to dominant historical-critical and secular literary approaches; conversation with canonical and redemptive-historical movements in biblical theology.
 - Interacts with Reformation hermeneutical commitments (Calvin), twentieth-century evangelical apologetics (Van Til influences), and conversations with canonical theologians (e.g., Brevard Childs) and conservative biblical theologians.

- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical interpretation must be **God-centered**: Scripture is read and interpreted under the authoritative self-revelation of God, with Christ and the triune economy as the organizing hermeneutical center. Human methodologies must submit to divine authorship and the Spirit's role in illumination.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Grounding: Scripture is God's self-attestation and carries divine authority; interpretation presupposes God's revelatory initiative.
 - Christocentric reading: The Old and New Testaments are unified by redemptive-historical fulfillment in Christ; typology and fulfillment are normative, not merely incidental.
 - Role of the Spirit: The Spirit both inspired the text and illumines interpreters in redemptive history; interpretation is ecclesial and pneumatological.
 - Accommodation & incarnation analogy: God communicates by condescending to human capacities; the incarnation furnishes an analogy for how divine speech accommodates human form and categories.
 - Methodological implications: Biblical theology and systematic theology must be in disciplined dialogue-canonical context, theological coherence, and doctrinal categories shape exegesis.
 - Application: Principles for preaching, theology, and the church's use of Scripture.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformation interpreters (Calvin), conservative evangelical hermeneuts, canonical theologians, and critics of liberal historical-critical methodology; implicitly contrasts with reader-response and purely historical-literary approaches.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture's authority and self-attestation, Covenant (esp. Covenant of Grace), Christology (eternal Sonship, incarnation and fulfillment), Trinity (Spirit's role in interpretation), typology, and the relation of biblical to systematic theology.

- **Closing line**
 - The book insists that sound hermeneutics locates God, especially Christ and the Spirit, at the interpretive center so that Scripture interprets Scripture within the church's confession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Replaces human-centered methodologies with a positive, explicit **God-centered organizing principle**, not merely negative critiques of other methods.
 - Elevates **typology and fulfillment** as hermeneutically normative: OT persons, events, and institutions are read in their telos in Christ.
 - Frames **accommodation** with the incarnation as an interpretive analogy: divine condescension explains how transcendent revelation uses finite human categories.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both liberal emancipation from Scripture and neutral, method-driven historicism by reasserting divine authorship and theological coherence.
 - Contrasts with methods that isolate literary form or historical distance from doctrinal commitments-argues for confessionally accountable exegesis.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematizes a theological hermeneutic that integrates **pneumatology (illumination)**, **covenantal typology**, and **Christ-centered canonical reading** into practical rules for interpretation.
 - Offers a working synthesis between biblical-theological description and systematic-theological ordering.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a corrective to secular hermeneutics; influential among teachers of preaching and biblical theology.
 - Adopted as a principled alternative in curricula emphasizing redemptive-historical preaching and Christocentric exegesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust, coherent framework for ministers, exegetes, and theologians who seek to keep doctrine and exegesis integrated under divine revelation.
 - Durable as a teaching text for hermeneutics that insists on ecclesial and confessional responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered interpretation** - Interpretive stance that places God's self-revelation and purposes at the center of hermeneutics.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture** - Claim that Scripture's authority rests on God's own revelation rather than human validation.
- **Christocentric reading** - Interpreting both Testaments with Christ as the fulfilment and hermeneutical key.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - OT persons/events/institutions are prophetic types whose true meaning is realized in Christ.
- **Accommodation** - Divine condescension in revelation; explained analogically by the incarnation (God speaks within human limits).
- **The Spirit in redemptive history** - The Spirit as both author and illuminator, making divine intent accessible to the church.
- **Covenant of Grace** - Overarching covenantal framework that organizes redemptive history and interpretation.
- **Biblical theology vs systematic theology** - Advocacy for disciplined interaction: biblical-theological attention to canonical context informs systematic ordering without divorcing doctrine from text.
- **Authority and presuppositions** - Emphasis on starting points: theological presuppositions (God's being and purpose) shape legitimate methods.
- **Canonical context** - The whole canon as the interpretive horizon; Scripture interprets Scripture.
- **Redemptive-historical method** - Reading Scripture as unified history of God's saving acts culminating in Christ.
- **Incarnational analogy** - Use of the incarnation as a model for how divine speech can legitimately use human forms.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a theocentric hermeneutic and for typological norms in OT-NT relations.
 - As a **polemic** against secular historical-critical and reader-response approaches, defending confessional exegesis.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching and biblical theology that centers Christ and the Spirit while maintaining canonical coherence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenantal, Christological, pneumatalogical, and bibliological commitments in hermeneutics.
