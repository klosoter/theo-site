### TITLE
Because It Is Written - Meredith G. Kline (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed-evangelical milieu; written from within the Westminster Theological tradition reacting against both liberal critical scholarship and evidentialist apologetics.
 - Addressed to pastors, scholars, and students concerned with the doctrinal status of Scripture in theology and church life.

- **Central thesis**
 - The normative authority and inerrancy of Scripture are not contingent upon extrinsic evidential proofs but rest on Scripture's status as the divinely given, self-attesting Word - summarized by the warranting formula, "**because it is written**."

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern criticisms assume that biblical claims require external corroboration, thus undermining Scripture's self-authority.
 - Positive claim: Scripture functions as divine testimony and covenantal speech-act; its truth claims are authoritative by virtue of God's reliable revelation.
 - Defense of inerrancy: Kline argues for a robust understanding of inspiration (verbal-plenary character) and inerrancy grounded in divine authorship, not merely on human criteria of historical proof.
 - Practical corollaries: theological method and preaching must begin from Scripture's self-warrant rather than attempt to secure Scripture by apologetic proofs first.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicitly engages with modernist biblical criticism and evidentialist apologetics; dialogue with classic Reformed defenders of inerrancy (e.g., B. B. Warfield) and contrasts with theological positions that relativize Scripture's self-authority (e.g., some strands of neo-orthodoxy).
 - Uses Scripture itself and Reformed confessional presuppositions as primary sources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy, authority of Scripture, hermeneutical method, covenantal theology (as background framework).

- **Closing line**
 - Scripture is to be trusted and treated as authoritative not because human reason first vouches for it, but because it is the divinely given Word: authoritative, inerrant, and self-warranting - "because it is written."

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on Scripture as a *self-attesting* divine testimony and on the primacy of covenantal speech-act in grounding biblical authority.
 - Moves the discussion from purely propositional proof to the performative-legal character of divine speech ( Scripture as God's authoritative declaration).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects purely evidentialist or verificationist approaches that treat the Bible as an object to be first validated by external standards.
 - Distinguishes from extreme fideism by insisting on rational coherence of Scripture's claims while denying that externalistic proofs are the primary warrant.
 - Distinguishes from liberal reductionism and some neo-orthodox emphases that demote propositional content or deny traditional inerrancy.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates inerrancy within a covenantal and speech-act frame: authority and truth are tied to God's covenantal faithfulness and verbal action.
 - Emphasizes a legal-forensic vocabulary for Scripture's status (testimony, witness, declaration) more than a purely epistemic vocabulary of proofs.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed circles concerned with defending biblical authority, cited by advocates of confessional inerrancy and by those advancing presuppositional or covenantal apologetics.
 - Valued as a corrective to evidentialism; used in seminarians' formation for preaching and systematic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the epistemic posture a theologian or preacher should adopt toward Scripture.
 - Supplies a concise, pastorally oriented defense of inerrancy that ties doctrine to ecclesial practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Because it is written"**
 - Formula of warrant: Scripture's claim to authority is grounded in its status as written revelation from God, not a posteriori human validation.

- **Self-attesting Scripture**
 - The idea that Scripture, by virtue of divine authorship, carries its own warrant and authority.

- **Verbal-plenary inspiration**
 - Affirmation that Scripture is inspired in its words and whole, securing doctrinal precision and trustworthiness.

- **Inerrancy**
 - The doctrine that Scripture, properly interpreted, is without error in all that it intends to affirm.

- **Covenantal speech-act**
 - Theological frame: God issues authoritative words within covenant relations; Scripture is the record and instrument of those speech-acts.

- **Testimony / witness**
 - Legal-forensic language Kline employs to describe Scripture's epistemic role in the covenant community.

- **Anti-evidentialism**
 - Rejection of the posture that Scripture must be established first by external evidences; insists on Scripture's prior authority.

- **Hermeneutical primacy**
 - Principle that theological method begins with Scriptural self-witness rather than external critiquing.

- **Divine authorship**
 - Ground of authority: the ultimate source of Scripture's truth is God as author, guaranteeing its reliability.

- **Apologetic posture**
 - A presuppositional stance: defend Scripture by presupposing its authority in theological reasoning and pastoral practice.

- **Relation to confessionalism**
 - Connects doctrine of Scripture to historic Reformed confessions as interpretive and ecclesial norms.

- **Truth vs. proof distinction**
 - Differentiates between objective truthfulness of Scripture and the human task of adducing proofs for unbelievers.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional inerrancy and for articulating what is meant by Scripture's authority.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialist apologetics and liberal critical diminutions of biblical authority.
 - As a **hermeneutical/conceptual model** for teaching preaching, systematic theology, and covenantal readings of Scripture.
