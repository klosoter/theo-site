### TITLE
Karl Barth: Theologian of Christian Witness - Joseph L. Mangina (study of Karl Barth)
Focus: Mangina's reading of Barth with special attention to Barthian use and reconfiguration of the **communicatio idiomatum** as a theological basis for Christian witness.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary secondary study locating Barth within 20th-century **neo‑orthodoxy/dialectical theology** and the post‑World War I/Reformation reaction against liberal theology.
 - Treats Barth as a thinker who returns classical Christological categories to service for ecclesial proclamation rather than metaphysical construction.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Barth (as read by Mangina) reframes the **communicatio idiomatum** not primarily as a metaphysical doctrine about ontologies of natures, but as the theological principle that secures God's self‑disclosure in the human Jesus so that theology functions as **Christian witness** (kerygma), not speculative metaphysics.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Retrieval: Barth accepts the Chalcedonian commitment to two natures in one person but reinterprets the communicatio to emphasize **personal witness**-the Word speaks truly in human words.
 - Re‑orientation: Moves communicatio from an ontological to a **proclamatory logic** (how divine and human attributes are ascribed in the one acting person).
 - Methodological consequence: Theology must prioritize **revelatory encounter** and the Church's testimony over constructing an abstract Christological ontology.
 - Practical outworking: Implications for atonement, resurrection, and ecclesiology - these are treated as events of God's self‑communication witnessed in and by the church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical landmarks: **Chalcedon**, Patristic Christology.
 - Reformation interlocutors: selective engagement with **Lutheran** and **Reformed** emphases on person/nature distinctions.
 - Modern conversation partners: critiques of liberal theology, engagement with contemporary Barth interpreters and opponents (implicitly contrasted to speculative metaphysics).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central), **Incarnation**, **Revelation** (Word of God), **Trinity** (background presupposition), **Atonement**, **Ecclesiology** (witness), **Soteriology** (as event of communication).

- **Closing line**
 - Mangina's Barth makes the communicatio idiomatum the hinge by which God's Word becomes audible in human flesh: Christology thus undergirds theology's vocation as **Christian witness** rather than metaphysical system building.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Elevates the communicatio idiomatum into a **hermeneutic and ecclesial principle**: ascription of attributes is governed by the one‑person reality of the Word‑made‑flesh and by the Church's act of witnessing.
 - Stresses the **proclamatory asymmetry**: divine self‑disclosure occurs in and through human limitation without ontological absorption.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against readings that turn communicatio into a metaphysical fusion (Hegelian or speculative systems).
 - Corrects liberal privatizing tendencies that reduce revelation to subjective experience: Barth reasserts objective, historical self‑communication in Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes traditional technical language (communication of properties) within a **logic of witness** and theological praxis rather than abstract metaphysics.
 - Deploys kenotic language functionally-emphasis on God's self‑limitation as communicative event rather than as metaphysical diminution.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Reinforced Barth's status in Reformed and broader Protestant Christology as a corrective to liberal theology and speculative metaphysics.
 - Influential for subsequent debates on how classical Christological formulas serve preaching, doctrine, and ecumenical dialogue.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Clarifies the pastoral‑hermeneutical stakes of Christology: useful in courses on Christology, doctrine of revelation, and theological method.
 - Models how to read classical dogma through the lens of proclamation and ecclesial vocation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - classical doctrine of ascribing properties of both natures to the one person; Mangina shows Barth reading this as a principle grounding God's audible self‑disclosure in Jesus.
- **Person and Nature** - Chalcedonian distinction retained; Barth insists on one person (the Word) who truly possesses both divine and human attributes without confusion.
- **Communication of attributes / properties** - how predicates (divine/human) are validly ascribed across the one person; reinterpreted functionally for witness.
- **Incarnation** - the event in which the Word assumes human existence so that God addresses humanity; centerpiece of Barth's witness theology.
- **Kenosis (self‑emptying)** - Barthian emphasis on the Word's self‑limit in the incarnation as a communicative act, not metaphysical subtraction.
- **Revelation / Word of God** - revelation is historical and personal in Christ; theology's task is to testify to that event.
- **Witness (kerygma)** - the church's communicative response and vocation; Barth centers this as theology's telos.
- **Chalcedonian formula** - doctrinal boundary condition Barth preserves while reworking its theological use.
- **Twofold state (humiliation/exaltation)** - soteriological framework for how divine and human acts are related in Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
- **Theological dialectic** - Barth's method stressing antitheses (God/creature) and their relation in revelation.
- **Ascription vs. Ontology** - key methodological contrast: ascribing predicates in the one person vs. positing new ontological categories.
- **Proclamation vs. Speculation** - operative distinction: theology's priority is ecclesial proclamation grounded in Christ's self‑communication.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a non‑metaphysical, witness‑oriented reading of communicatio idiomatum.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal theology and speculative metaphysical reinterpretations of Christology.
 - As an **exegetical/theological model** showing how classical Christological formulas can be read responsibly for proclamation and ecclesial practice.
