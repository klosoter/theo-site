### TITLE
"A Biblical View of Work" - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal (1981)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 1981 in a conservative Reformed venue (Westminster Theological Journal), during renewed Reformed interest in public theology and vocation (post-Kuyper revival).
 - Poythress writes as a Reformed systematician and exegete addressing modern fragmentation between sacred/secular and between theology and daily labor.

- **Central thesis**
 - Work is a God‑given, created good and a primary means by which humans exercise covenantal stewardship (the cultural/dominion mandate) - thus Christian work is both worship and responsible rule under God, not merely economic survival or private piety.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Genesis 1-3 establishes work as intrinsic to creation (mandate to fill, subdue, steward).
 - Diagnosis: Modern dichotomies (work as curse, work as purely secular) distort biblical teaching; the Fall modifies but does not nullify work's goodness.
 - Theological integration: Connects creation, covenantal responsibility, providence, and redemption to show Christian vocation as participation in Christ's rule and in God's ordering of creation.
 - Practical implication: Christians should pursue cultural, scientific, economic, and artistic work as faithful stewardship and witness, shaped by gospel priorities and eschatological hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformed tradition (implicitly/explicitly in line with Calvinic and Kuyperian emphases on common grace and cultural responsibility).
 - Critiques pietistic tendencies that privatize piety and secular ideologies that sacralize autonomous culture-making.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence (work as created ordinance)
 - The Fall and the corruption/distortion of work
 - Covenant and vocation (human calling under God)
 - Christology and eschatology (redemption restores and transforms the meaning and ends of work)
 - Ethics and church-world relations (implications for culture and dominion)

- **Closing line**
 - Work, properly understood biblically, is covenantal stewardship: an ongoing, redeemed participation in God's sovereign rule over creation aimed at God's glory and human flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong synthesis of Genesis-based cultural/dominion mandate with practical vocational theology - work is neither merely secular nor merely spiritual but an integral sphere of divine calling.
 - Emphasizes continuity: created goodness of work persists post‑Fall though corrupted; redemption restores work's true telos.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against pietistic separation of sacred and secular; also against secular humanism that grounds work in autonomous human flourishing apart from God.
 - Offers corrective to narrow vocational accounts that limit Christian calling to explicitly ecclesial professions.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "vocation" within covenantal stewardship and the cultural mandate - treating vocation as comprehensive (family, professions, civic life).
 - Treats dominion not as domination but as disciplined stewardship shaped by divine law and grace.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed seminary teaching and vocational ethics; cited in later vocational literature that seeks biblical warrant for cultural engagement.
 - Helped consolidate a Reformed paradigm that supports Christian involvement in arts, sciences, business, and politics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, biblically anchored rationale for Christian cultural engagement.
 - Serves as a bridge between systematic theology and practical ethics, useful for preaching, counseling, and curriculum on vocation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Vocation**
 - Broad: all spheres of life where God calls people to serve (family, church, professions); not limited to "religious" jobs.
- **Cultural mandate / Dominion mandate**
 - Genesis command to fill, subdue, and steward the earth; foundation for Christian cultural work.
- **Stewardship**
 - Responsible management of creation under God's authority; ethical limits and priorities for work.
- **Creation ordinance**
 - Work as instituted by God in creation (prelapsarian good), not merely a human invention.
- **The Fall / Curse**
 - Explains distortion of work (toil, frustration) but insists on retention of work's fundamental goodness and possibility of restoration.
- **Common grace**
 - Allows non‑Christian contributions to culture and enables kingdom advancement through ordinary vocations (often presupposed in Poythress's framework).
- **Work as worship**
 - Concept that faithful labor glorifies God when done under covenantal obedience and love of neighbor.
- **Kingly-priestly dimension**
 - Work expresses both rule (ordering creation) and service (care for neighbor), reflecting God's character.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance shapes work's meaning and contingencies; work participates in providential ordering.
- **Redemption and restoration**
 - Christ's work reorients and heals vocations; eschatology sets the telos for cultural labor.
- **Ethical constraints**
 - Work is subject to divine law (justice, love, truth) and gospel priorities (service, stewardship).
- **Public theology**
 - Orienting principle for Christian engagement in civic and cultural spheres.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for Reformed accounts of vocation and the cultural mandate.
- As a **polemic** against pietistic privatization of faith and secular exclusivity, shaping pastoral and ethical instruction.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-3 into a practical theology of work and culture.
