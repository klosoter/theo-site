### TITLE
Sanctification - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (entry in The New Dictionary of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed theology; Westminster Theological Seminary environment; conversation with post-Warfieldian, Vosian, and covenantal emphases in American Presbyterianism.
 - Written as an NDT reference entry: concise synthesis addressing contemporary pastoral and academic debates (not a monograph).
 - Interaction with two NDT topics cited here: **"Sanctification: Definitive and Progressive"** and **"Spiritual Gifts and Sanctification"**.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Sanctification must be understood primarily in terms of **union with Christ** and the Spirit's work; the proper balance of *definitive/positional* and *progressive/experiential* dimensions prevents distortions (antinomianism, perfectionism, pietism, or reduction to moralism).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirms that sanctification is grounded in objective, forensic realities (justification and union) and realized subjectively by the Spirit through the Word and means of grace.
 - Distinguishes carefully between what is already true of believers in Christ (definitive sanctification) and what is being worked out in experience (progressive sanctification).
 - Argues that spiritual gifts (charismata) must be related to sanctification without making them its equivalent or primary criterion.
 - Emphasizes the normative means (Word, sacraments, prayer, discipline) over experiential or sensational markers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed authorities (Calvin, Warfield, Vos), contemporary Reformed peers; interlocution with pietistic, Wesleyan, Keswick, and some charismatic positions that either over-psychologize or over-evidentialize sanctification.
 - Uses biblical texts (esp. Pauline union motifs) and classic Reformed doctrinal sources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification-sanctification relation), pneumatology (Spirit as agent), christology (union with Christ), ecclesiology (means of grace, discipline), and ethics (mortification/vivification).
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin centers sanctification theologically on **union with Christ mediated by the Spirit and engendered through the objective means of grace**, thereby securing both the believer's definitive standing and the reality of progressive moral formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates **union with Christ** as the interpretive key for sanctification rather than merely moral effort or inward experience.
 - Rehabilitates the language of **definitive sanctification** without collapsing it into perfectionism; treats it as an objective status that grounds progressive growth.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic and moralistic tendencies that divorce sanctification from justification/union.
 - Pushes back on theological streams that treat spiritual gifts or charismatic experience as primary evidence of sanctification.
 - Nuances critiques of antinomianism by affirming that definitive standing does not excuse ongoing sin.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful terminological clarity: distinguishes **positional/definitive** versus **progressive/experiential** sanctification and links both to union and Spirit-work rather than to isolated ethical prescriptions or charismatic indicators.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received within conservative Reformed circles as a clarifying, balanced account; influential in seminary teaching on soteriology and pastoral theology.
 - Cited in debates over charismatic practice, assurance, and pastoral care where objective union is defended against purely experiential criteria.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for correcting imbalances (either overly objective forensic accounts that ignore experience, or experiential accounts that undermine assurance).
 - Serves as a compact pedagogical resource for courses in sanctification, pneumatology, and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ**
 - Primary ontological and soteriological category through which sanctification is explained.
- **Definitive (positional) sanctification**
 - What is already true of believers in Christ by virtue of union and justification; grounds assurance and identity.
- **Progressive (experiential) sanctification**
 - The lived-out, Spirit-wrought transformation of believers; morally substantive but contingent on means of grace.
- **Pneumatology**
 - The Spirit as primary agent of sanctification, employing Word and sacraments rather than merely ecstatic phenomena.
- **Means of grace**
 - Word, sacraments, prayer, and church discipline as normative instruments for progressive sanctification.
- **Mortification and vivification**
 - Pauline categories for the believer's dying to sin and living to righteousness; practical expression of sanctification.
- **Spiritual gifts (charismata)**
 - Distinguished from sanctification proper; gifts may accompany but do not equal holiness or guarantee progressive sanctity.
 - Used to build the church; their presence is not a prima facie proof of sanctification.
- **Justification-sanctification relation**
 - Justification secures status; sanctification flows from that status in the life of union.
- **Objective vs. subjective**
 - Encourages holding both: objective (forensic/positional) truths and subjective (experiential) transformation without conflation.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in Christ's work and definitive sanctification, not reduced to felt holiness.
- **Ecclesial formation**
 - Sanctification as corporate and mediated, not merely individual devolution of piety.
- **Polemic uses / pedagogical uses**
 - Used as a **definitional source** in Reformed theology courses to clarify terms.
 - Employed **polemicallly** against both perfectionist and purely experiential/charismatic claims.
 - Functions as an **exegetical model** emphasizing Pauline union motifs.
 - Serves as a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology to integrate assurance, discipline, and growth.
