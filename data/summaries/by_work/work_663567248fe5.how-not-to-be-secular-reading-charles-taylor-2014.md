### TITLE
How (Not) to Be Secular: Reading Charles Taylor (2014) - James K.A. Smith

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published 2014 amid a growing Protestant, often Reformed, interest in cultural theology and liturgical formation. Smith writes as a philosophically minded theologian engaging Charles Taylor's A Secular Age (2007), translating its philosophical anthropology and social-imaginary diagnosis for Christian pastors, theologians, and cultural critics.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The modern "secular" is not merely absence of belief but a pervasive background imagination that shapes hearts and practices. To avoid being quietly assimilated into secular modernity Christians must address formation - liturgies and practices that re-orient desire - rather than only apologetics or social critique.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Explicates Taylor's key diagnostic categories (immanent frame, buffered self, porous self, social imaginaries). 
 - Argues that Taylor's account reframes the theological task: from proving God to cultivating practices that form a telos-aligned people. 
 - Proposes practical corollaries: renewed emphasis on liturgy, sacrament, formation of desire, and Christian imagination as means to live eschatologically within an immanent age.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary interlocutor: **Charles Taylor** (A Secular Age). 
 - Secondary: broader secularization literature (e.g., Berger), Reformed and Augustinian resources re: formation, and pastoral-theological voices seeking cultural engagement. Niebuhr's Christ-and-culture debates are implicit via the "how to be in culture" question.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Anthropology** (nature of the self and desire). 
 - **Ecclesiology and sacrament** (church as formative community). 
 - **Liturgy and spiritual formation** (practices shape belief). 
 - **Eschatology** (how hope reconfigures secular temporality). 
 - Secondary engagement: revelation and apologetics reframed as dependent on formed communities.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Christian faith in a secular age is chiefly a matter of formed hearts: the church must recover sacramental and liturgical practices that re-orient desire toward Christ and enact an eschatological alternative to the dominant immanent frame.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Places *formation* (liturgical, embodied practice) at the center of cultural engagement rather than intellectual defense alone. 
 - Reads Taylor as a pastoral resource - diagnosis before cure - offering a Christian program of counter-formation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on simple secularization-as-loss narratives by showing plural ways of being secular (various social imaginaries). 
 - Corrects apologetic-focused responses that treat unbelief as primarily cognitive error; Smith reframes it as disoriented desire.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Adopts Taylor's terms (immanent frame, buffered self, social imaginaries) and couples them with the language of "liturgies" and "cultural formation" to create a practical vocabulary for theological response.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely adopted in evangelical/Reformed circles as a model for cultural theology and pastoral practice. 
 - Influenced subsequent work on "cultural liturgies," public theology, and Christian social imagination.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a concise bridge between philosophical diagnosis (Taylor) and pastoral theology. 
 - Useful for pastors, theologians, and students concerned with how ecclesial practices shape belief and civic engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immanent frame:** Taylor's name for the modern background of meaning that confines intelligibility to naturalistic/existing-world terms; Smith uses it to explain how default unbelief/atheism functions as an ambient possibility.
- **Buffered self:** The modern self that is insulated from spiritual forces; a target for Christian formation that seeks to re-open spiritual sensitivity.
- **Porous self:** Pre-modern sense of permeability to transcendence; used contrastively to show alternative human orientations.
- **Social imaginaries:** Shared cultural narratives and practices that make certain visions of the good life intelligible; locus for theological engagement.
- **Cultural liturgies:** Smith's phrase for non-ecclesial practices that form desire (advertising, education, civic rituals); identifies sites for Christian counter-formation.
- **Formation of desire:** Central anthropological claim-belief is shaped more by habituation and imagination than by propositional argument alone.
- **Eschatological witness:** The church's vocation to embody kingdom hope that interrupts the immanent frame.
- **Apologetics reoriented:** Argument that apologetics must be nested in practices that shape the soul, not only intellectual proof.
- **Practical theology:** Emphasized as the discipline that translates diagnosis into ecclesial practice.
- **Public theology:** Use of Taylor's social-imaginary vocabulary to craft persuasive cultural witness.
- **Secular as multiple:** The claim that "being secular" admits many forms (exclusive humanism, porous, cross-pressured), complicating simple decline models.
- **Telos-orientation:** Formation aims at reshaping ultimate ends toward Christian destinations.
- **Counter-formation:** Active cultivation of alternative practices to resist assimilation into the immanent frame.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - **Definition source:** Clarifies what "secular" means for theological and cultural analysis. 
 - **Polemic:** Challenges apologetic paradigms that ignore formation and practices. 
 - **Conceptual pivot/exegetical model:** Serves as a pivot from philosophical diagnosis (Taylor) to ecclesial praxis - model for teaching cultural theology and pastoral formation.
