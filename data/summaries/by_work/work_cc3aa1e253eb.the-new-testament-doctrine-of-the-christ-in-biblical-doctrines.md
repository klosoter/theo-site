### TITLE
**The New Testament Doctrine of the Christ** - B. B. Warfield (in Biblical Doctrines)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed response to rising biblical criticism and liberal theology.
 - Part of his larger Biblical Doctrines project: systematic, exegetical defense of classical orthodoxy against modernist reinterpretations.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents Jesus as true God and true man whose redemptive work is the decisive antithesis to Adam; the historical reality of Adam and his federal headship are integral to New Testament soteriology and Christology.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical demonstration of the New Testament witness to Christ's person (deity, preexistence, incarnation) and work (atonement, resurrection).
 - Pauline theological structure: Adam as the first federal head whose sin brings condemnation and death; Christ as the second Adam whose obedience brings righteousness and life (key loci: Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15).
 - Interweaving of typology and covenantal structure: Adam as federal representative within humanity; Christ as federal representative within the new covenant people.
 - Polemical refutation of interpretations that reduce Adam to myth or that sever the Adam-Christ connection in Pauline anthropology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: New Testament authors especially Paul; appeal to patristic exegesis where useful.
 - Secondary interlocutors: contemporary higher critics and theologians who deny historic Adam or relegate Adam to legend; defenders of non-imputative theories of sin.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (preexistence, incarnation, deity), atonement (substitutionary, representative), anthropology (original sin, human constitution), soteriology (justification by imputed righteousness), covenant/federal theology, revelation and scriptural authority.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the heart of New Testament doctrine in the real, representative exchange between Adam and Christ: the historic Adam's federal headship grounds original sin and condemnation; the historic Christ's federal headship secures imputed righteousness and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Unsparing insistence on the historical reality of Adam as necessary for Pauline argument; typology is not merely rhetorical but ontologically operative (real federal representation).
 - Fusion of rigorous exegetical detail with systematic-theological claims; Christ as both ontological Lord and covenantal representative.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct correction of liberal and symbolic readings of Adam that would evacuate Pauline soteriology of its forensic logic.
 - Counter to non-imputational or moral-influence accounts of atonement by insisting on imputation and substitution grounded in representation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the application of "federal headship" language to Adam and Christ within New Testament exegesis; not an invention but a persuasive consolidation for systematic use.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Greatly influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical theology as a model of harmonizing NT exegesis with covenantal categories.
 - Frequently cited in debates over the historicity of Adam, the imputation of sin, and orthodox Christology; less persuasive to critical scholars who reject traditional historicity premises.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined, text-rooted defense of classical doctrines; valuable for teaching the interdependence of Christology, anthropology, and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ as Second Adam**
 - Christ contrasted with Adam as the representative head effecting reversal of Adamic curse.

- **Federal Headship**
 - Headship that confers legal/representative status; explains how Adam's act affects all and how Christ's act benefits all in covenant community.

- **Historicity of Adam**
 - Affirmed as a necessary premise for Pauline argument; not reducible to myth or mere archetype.

- **Imputation (of sin and righteousness)**
 - Adam's sin imputed to humanity; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers - forensic core of justification.

- **Typology**
 - Realistic typology: Old covenant persons/events legitimately foresee and participate in New covenant realities.

- **Substitutionary Atonement**
 - Penal and representative language emphasized; Christ bears the penalty as representative head.

- **Pauline Exegesis (Romans 5; 1 Cor 15)**
 - Primary loci for the Adam-Christ parallel; Warfield reads these as legal/representative arguments, not merely ethical parallels.

- **Covenant Theology**
 - Adam situated in covenantal categories (covenant of works/creation); Christ as inaugurator of covenant of grace.

- **Original Sin**
 - Corporate, inherited corruption and guilt grounded in Adam's headship.

- **Revelation and Scriptural Authority**
 - Scripture as decisive warrant for doctrine against speculative or critical reconstruals.

- **Representative Obedience**
 - Christ's obedience counted to believers as the ground of justification.

- **Ontological vs. Rhetorical Typology**
 - Emphasis that typology signifies real, not merely pedagogical or rhetorical, correspondence.

How this work is used:
- As a definitional source for orthodox Reformed Christology and the doctrine of federal headship.
- As polemic against modernist denials of Adam's historicity and against non-imputational soteriologies.
- As an exegetical model for reading Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 within covenantal and forensic frameworks.
- As a conceptual pivot connecting anthropology (original sin) and soteriology (imputation, substitution).
