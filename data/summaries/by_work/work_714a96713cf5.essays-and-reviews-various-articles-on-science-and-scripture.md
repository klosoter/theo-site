### TITLE
Charles Hodge - Essays and Reviews: Science and Scripture (Genesis 1-11)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑19th century; Princeton Theology reacting to the Anglican volume Essays and Reviews (1860), rising higher criticism, and emergent modern sciences (geology, paleontology, Darwinism).
 - Hodge writes from conservative Reformed vantage (Princeton Seminary), addressing threats to biblical authority and doctrinal cohesion.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian system requires the historical trustworthiness of Scripture, especially Genesis 1-11; modern scientific theories and critical readings that convert Genesis into myth or purely poetic material undermine core doctrines (creation, fall, original sin, redemption).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of Scripture as divine revelation and reliable historical testimony in its intended sense.
 - Explanation of how revelation and reason relate:
 - Scripture is not to be reinterpreted to fit speculative science that denies theological teaching.
 - Where scientific description conflicts with the Bible, either the scientific claim must be reexamined or the interpretation of Scripture must be reexamined-but the presumption favors Scripture for theological matters.
 - Treatment of Genesis 1-11:
 - Genesis presents real historical events (creation, Adam and Eve, fall, Cain/Abel, Flood, genealogy tradition).
 - These events function as the foundation for doctrines (original sin, federal headship of Adam, need for Christ).
 - Engagement with contemporary science:
 - Critique of materialistic or purely naturalistic readings of origins (including aspects of Darwinism).
 - Use of the accommodation principle to explain phenomenological language without surrendering historicity.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Directly or indirectly responds to contributors to Essays and Reviews and to continental higher critics; engages emerging scientific authorities (geologists, naturalists) as interlocutors.
 - Conversant with Reformation and patristic exegetical traditions and with systematic theology concerns from Augustine through Reformed scholastics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (authority, inerrancy in original autographs).
 - Creation (ex nihilo and divine causality), providence.
 - The Fall and original sin (theological dependence on historical Adam).
 - Covenantal structure and Christology insofar as they depend on Genesis history.

- **Closing line**
 - Hodge's theological center: the historical reliability and divine authority of Genesis 1-11 are nonnegotiable foundations for orthodox soteriology and systematic theology; science must be disciplined by this confessional grid.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that the literal / historical sense of Genesis carries doctrinal weight - theology cannot be built upon allegory or purely poetic readings of primeval history.
 - Strong linking of hermeneutics to soteriology: Genesis' historicity undergirds doctrines of sin, covenant, and atonement.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against liberalizing Anglican and German critics who demoted Genesis to myth or moral allegory.
 - Distinguishes between legitimate scientific hypotheses and philosophical naturalism that strips teleology and divine agency.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses an assertive form of the accommodation principle: Scripture may speak in human terms for comprehension but remains historically true in what it intends to teach.
 - Articulates a pragmatic hermeneutic that reads Genesis as historically communicative where Christian doctrine depends on it.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in American Reformed and Presbyterian circles; provided a foundational conservative template during the later fundamentalist-modernist controversies.
 - Used by conservative seminaries and apologetic writers to defend inerrancy and historicity of early Genesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust conservative engagement model between theology and the sciences: neither naive literalism nor capitulation to critical reductionism.
 - Useful as a historical exemplar of confessional resistance to literary and scientific revisionism, though its scientific assessments can date quickly.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture is free from error in the autographs; a nonnegotiable presupposition for doctrine.
- **Revelation** - God's self‑disclosure; Scripture as propositional and historical revelation.
- **Accommodation** - God's condescension in speech/description so humans can comprehend, without negating factual truth.
- **Historicity** - The claim that Genesis 1-11 reports real events that anchor theological claims.
- **Creation ex nihilo** - God as ultimate causal agent of all being; rejects purely impersonal natural origins.
- **Original sin / Federal headship** - Adam's historical fall with corporate effects; doctrine contingent on Adam's reality.
- **Phenomenological language** - Surface descriptions (e.g., "sunrise") used by Scripture without implying scientific error; reconciles common speech with truth.
- **Theistic teleology** - Purposeful design and direction in creation as opposed to blind materialism.
- **Naturalism / Materialism** - Philosophical positions Hodge opposes when proposed as final explanations for origins.
- **Hermeneutical priority of theology** - Doctrine influences how one reads biblical texts that are doctrinally foundational.
- **Science as subordinate interlocutor** - Scientific claims are engaged critically and tested against the theological commitments when they touch doctrine.
- **Higher criticism** - Modern critical methods that Hodge treats skeptically when they deny authorial intent and historicity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for conservative concepts of inerrancy and accommodation.
 - As a **polemic** against higher criticism and naturalistic readings of origins.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 1-11 as historically and theologically formative for systematic theology.
