### TITLE
Man in Revolt - Emil Brunner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Interwar European theology; Swiss Reformed context within the broader neo‑orthodox reaction to liberal Protestantism and secular modernity. Written as a corrective to optimism about human progress and to reductionist naturalism.
- **Central thesis:** Human existence is essentially a stance of revolt against God; anthropology must begin from the existential fact of that rebellion, which exposes the insufficiency of autonomous moralism and necessitates divine revelation and reconciliation in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnostic opening: modernity and the human sciences misconstrue man by abstracting him from his subjective revolt and guilt.
 - Phenomenology of revolt: Brunner analyzes human consciousness, freedom, and the experience of guilt and estrangement as existential facts that point beyond purely immanent categories.
 - Theological claim: these existential data constitute a legitimate starting point for theology (an anthropological point of contact), but they require God's self‑disclosure; human revolt cannot save itself.
 - Soteriological resolution: only divine initiative in Christ answers the condition uncovered by anthropology - reconciliation restores the true vocation of the imago Dei.
- **Figures/sources engaged:** Implicit and explicit interlocutors include liberal Protestantism, German idealism, Nietzschean and Freudian diagnoses of modernity; converses with Karl Barth (esp. over natural theology), also interacts with classical Reformed and patristic categories implicitly.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (imago Dei), sin (as revolt), freedom and responsibility, revelation (point of contact vs. revelation‑only models), Christology (reconciliation), soteriology, eschatology (restoration of human vocation), and indirect implications for covenantal thinking and theology proper.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is that anthropology begins with the reality of human revolt which exposes dependence on divine revelation and redemption - man's true identity is recovered only in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Puts the existential experience of revolt and guilt at the heart of theological anthropology rather than abstract metaphysical accounts.
 - Stresses human freedom and the moral seriousness of rebellion; sin is not merely privation but an active turning away.
- **Corrections/contrasts:**
 - Counters liberal optimism that situates hope in human progress or ethical improvement.
 - Diverges from Karl Barth by affirming a limited form of natural knowledge or "point of contact" (Anknüpfungspunkt) in human experience that theology can legitimately use, whereas Barth insists revelation must be the sole starting point.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of "revolt" as the operative category for sin.
 - Explicit framing of anthropology as prior in method to systematic soteriology while insisting on revelation's necessity for completion.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read across Protestant circles; influential in shaping mid‑20th century neo‑orthodox anthropology and pastoral theology.
 - Provoked significant debate with Barthian circles; used by evangelicals and Reformed scholars selectively (admired for anthropology, critiqued for natural theology).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Rich phenomenological description of human estrangement useful for pastoral theology and missional apologetics.
 - Provides a bridge between sociocultural critique and doctrinal recovery, making it valuable for teaching anthropology and sin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revolt:** The primary category Brunner uses for sin - an active turning against God that defines human existential condition.
- **Point of contact (Anknüpfungspunkt):** Human experience of moral demand and guilt as a legitimate theological starting place, contrasted with strict revelation‑only models.
- **Existential guilt:** The felt consciousness of estrangement that evidences sin as relational rupture, not merely legal status.
- **Freedom:** Genuine human freedom is affirmed but shown to be perverted by revolt; freedom entails responsibility and culpability.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God):** Framed dynamically - as vocation and relational capacity distorted by revolt and restored in Christ.
- **Natural theology / common grace:** Brunner allows limited, critical use of natural knowledge and moral intuition as preparatory, contested by Barth.
- **Revelation as event:** God's self‑disclosure (particularly in Christ) is decisive for resolving the condition of revolt; revelation completes anthropology.
- **Reconciliation / Christology:** Christ as the decisive answer to revolt; redemption restores true human identity.
- **Sin as power vs. act:** Emphasizes both personal acts of rebellion and pervasive power that structures human existence.
- **Anthropological method:** Starts from human experience and moves toward theological interpretation; phenomenological and existential in tone.
- **Eschatological restoration:** The final telos is the restoration of human vocation and the imago Dei in the consummation.
- **Responsibility:** Moral culpability is central - revolt carries ethical and ontological consequences.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for an experiential, pastoral anthropology emphasizing revolt and guilt.
 - As a **polemic** resource against liberal optimism and an alternative to Barthian exclusivism on starting points.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in soteriology and pastoral counsel: diagnosis (anthropology) → necessity of revelation → Christological remedy.
