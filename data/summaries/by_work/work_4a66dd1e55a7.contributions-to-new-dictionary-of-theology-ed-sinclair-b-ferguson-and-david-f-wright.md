### TITLE
Contributions by Sinclair B. Ferguson: "Sacraments as Means of Grace" (in New Dictionary of Theology, ed. Sinclair B. Ferguson & David F. Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed/evangelical setting (New Dictionary of Theology, 1988). Written amid renewed ecumenical interest in sacramental theology and evangelical reassessment of the Word-sacrament relation; shaped by Scottish Presbyterian pastoral and confessional traditions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Sacraments are divinely ordained, covenantal **means** (instrumental, not automatic) by which the promises of Christ are sealed and applied to believers through the Spirit; they are not mere signs nor magical conveyors of grace independent of Christ and faith.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Defines sacraments in classical Reformed terms: instituted by Christ, visible signs and seals of the covenant, representing and confirming gospel promises.
 - Argues for the inseparable pairing of **Word and sacrament**: sacraments do not replace proclamation but function as the visible **word** to confirm and apply the invisible promise.
 - Emphasizes the **instrumental (means) character**: God is the primary agent; sacraments are appointed channels by which the Spirit ordinarily communicates benefits.
 - Distinguishes genuine efficacy (God does what He promises) from mechanical causality (rejects ex opere operato); faith (or the Spirit's gift of faith) is necessary for appropriation of benefits.
 - Applies to specific rites: baptism as covenant sign/seal (including infant baptism within covenant theology), Lord's Supper as spiritual feeding and communion with Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and Reformed confessional tradition (Westminster, Heidelberg); contrasts with Roman Catholic (ex opere operato / sacramental system) and Zwinglian/strict memorialist positions; engages patristic and classical Reformers for continuity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology, Christology (presence of Christ in sacraments), pneumatology (Spirit's role in applying grace), ecclesiology (sacraments in the life of the visible church), soteriology (appropriation of union with Christ).
- **Closing line:** Theologically conservative and pastorally attuned, Ferguson locates sacraments as covenantal, Spirit‑mediated instruments that visibly seal and effectually confirm Christ's promises to the faithful within the covenant community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on **Word-sacrament unity**: sacraments are the "visible word" and function only within the hearing and appropriation of the proclaimed gospel.
 - Balanced insistence on **objective promise** and **subjective appropriation**: sacraments truly convey benefits when the Spirit and faith concur, preserving both God's action and human reception.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Roman sacramentalism by denying purely automatic efficacy (rejects ex opere operato).
 - Counters memorialist or purely symbolic accounts by affirming real, Spirit‑wrought benefit and Christ's true (though not corporeal) presence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes sacraments emphatically as "means" within covenantal language rather than as mere signs or isolated rites; highlights pastoral and ecclesial function.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and conservative evangelical teaching as a clear, pastorally sensitive summary of Reformed sacramental theology.
 - Useful in ecumenical dialogues for presenting a mediating Reformed position between Roman and Zwinglian extremes.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Concise, accessible synthesis ideal for seminary courses, pastoral training, and confessional instruction; durable as a summary statement of Reformed sacramental doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament:** Instituted sign and seal of the covenant by which God pledges and applies redemption.
- **Means of grace:** Instruments appointed by God (Word, sacraments, prayer) through which the Spirit ordinarily communicates saving benefits.
- **Sign and seal:** Traditional Reformed phrase-sign = visible representation; seal = confirmation and assurance of the promise.
- **Word-sacrament unity:** The principle that sacraments function as the visible or embodied word of God and must be read in continuity with preaching.
- **Ex opere operato:** Latin phrase denoting automatic efficacy; explicitly rejected in favor of Spirit‑enabled instrumentality.
- **Real presence (Reformed sense):** Christ truly present spiritually by the Spirit in the supper; distinguished from corporal or transubstantiation claims.
- **Covenant sign:** Sacraments viewed primarily as marks of covenant membership (e.g., infant baptism within covenant households).
- **Spiritual feeding / communion:** Gospel language for the Lord's Supper as nourishing union with Christ by the Spirit.
- **Efficacy vs. effectuality:** Efficacy denotes God's promise-keeping; effectuality emphasizes the Spirit's work to bring the promise into the soul.
- **Instrumental causality:** Theological term endorsing sacraments as instruments rather than independent causes of grace.
- **Infant baptism:** Affirmed on covenantal grounds-sign of inclusion in the covenant community and promise requiring covenantal nurture.
- **Administration / pastoral practice:** Emphasizes proper, ordered administration within the visible church and coupling with teaching and discipline.
- **Pneumatic reception:** The Spirit's role in enabling faith and making sacramental promises effective.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **concise definitional source** for Reformed sacramental doctrine in teaching and confessional summaries.
- As a **polemic resource** against both Romanist sacramentalism and Zwinglian memorialism, offering a mediated Reformed account.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for coupling preaching, sacraments, and pastoral care in congregational practice.
