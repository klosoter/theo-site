### TITLE
Brief Outline of the Study of Theology (Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - First ed. 1811; major revision 1830; Berlin University; post-Kantian, Romantic milieu.
 - Aimed at introductory lectures in theological encyclopedia; consolidates a university curriculum for clergy in a modern research setting.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - What makes theology a science, and how should its disciplines be ordered?
 - Thesis: Theology is a **practical, positive science** ordered to the **leadership and edification of the Christian church**; its unity lies in the life of the church grounded in piety.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Defines theology by its end: the competent care and governance of the church.
 - Divides theology into three coordinated parts:
 - **Philosophical theology**: establishes Christianity's essence and its relation to reason and other religions (apologetics; outlines of Christian ethics).
 - **Historical theology**: researches the given church realities (exegesis with philology and hermeneutics; church history incl. history of doctrine and symbolics; **dogmatics** as descriptive account of current church doctrine).
 - **Practical theology**: normative guidance for ministry (homiletics, catechetics, poimenics/pastoral care, liturgics, church governance).
 - Method: from grounding and boundary-work (philosophical) to descriptive analysis (historical) to ecclesial action (practical).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian critique of metaphysics; indebted to Romanticism (feeling, intuition, organic whole); converses with Pietism and Reformed ecclesial life.
 - Critical contrast with Protestant scholasticism and Enlightenment rationalism; aware of classical sources via historical theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: located in Christian piety and the Redeemer's founding influence on the community; mediated by Scripture and tradition.
 - **Bibliology**: Scripture as normative historical witness requiring philological-historical exegesis; inspiration tied to Christ's Spirit active in the church.
 - **Theology Proper**: God known through the **feeling of absolute dependence**, not via speculative metaphysics.
 - **Christology**: Christ as the Redeemer in whom God-consciousness is perfect and communicative for the church.
 - **Soteriology**: redemption as incorporation into the community shaped by Christ's Spirit.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: church as the locus of theology's object and end; ministerial offices as practical outcomes.
 - **Eschatology**: teleology of the church's maturation in God-consciousness and the kingdom of God.
- **Closing line**
 - Theology, as a science, serves the living church by articulating, organizing, and advancing its piety toward faithful ministry.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Theology as a **practical, positive science** whose unity is the church's life rather than a metaphysical system.
 - **Dogmatics as historical-descriptive** of what the church now holds, not a timeless metaphysic.
 - Tripartite encyclopedia integrating philosophical, historical, and practical disciplines.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Protestant scholastic prolegomena that seek certainty in natural theology; centers piety and the church.
 - Against rationalist reduction of revelation to universal reason; insists on Christianity's distinctive essence.
 - Reframes locus order: Scripture and history mediate doctrine before system; practice is not an appendix but the telos.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Feeling of absolute dependence** as the ground of God-knowledge.
 - **Christian consciousness/God-consciousness** as the matrix of doctrine.
 - **Theological encyclopedia** as curricular architecture.
 - **Statistics/Symbolics** of the church as parts of historical theology mapping current confessional states.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for liberal Protestantism (Ritschl, Harnack); catalyzed practical theology as a distinct field.
 - Provoked major critiques (Barth, Bavinck, Van Til) that re-centered dogmatics on revelation/Word rather than church consciousness.
 - Shaped seminary curricula globally through the threefold division.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies interrelations of exegesis, history, doctrine, and practice.
 - Keeps ministry and ecclesial edification in view as theology's aim.
 - Offers a durable map for curricular design and disciplinary cooperation.
