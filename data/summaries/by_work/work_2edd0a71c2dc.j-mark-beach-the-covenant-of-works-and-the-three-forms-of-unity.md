### TITLE
J. Mark Beach, "The Covenant of Works and the Three Forms of Unity"

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary (21st century) Reformed/confessional revival; conversation shaped by renewed interest in confessional identity and historic covenantal frameworks.
 - Interaction with recent scholarship on federal theology (e.g., Meredith G. Kline, recent Dutch and North American Reformed authors) and with critics who prefer alternative readings of pre-fall Adamic arrangements.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Three Forms of Unity (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort) provide a coherent confessional matrix that either presupposes or can be read to affirm a distinct **covenant of works**; Beach maps and defends that reading and clarifies its theological implications.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical and confessional demonstration:
 - Survey of key loci in the Three Forms where covenantal language concerning Adam, law, and reward appears.
 - Distinguishes between covenant of works (prelapsarian, law/merit, federal headship) and covenant of grace (promise/faith, fulfilled in Christ).
 - Traces how confessional formulations presuppose federal imputation, the representative role of Adam, and the necessity of Christ as the obedient federal head.
 - Theological mediation:
 - Shows doctrinal coherence with classical Reformed topics: original sin, imputation, atonement, Christology.
 - Addresses objections: ambiguity in confessional texts, alleged silence or contradiction, and modern reinterpretations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary confessional texts: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort.
 - Biblical anchors: Genesis (esp. 2-3), Romans (esp. 5), Galatians, Pauline covenantal texts.
 - Historical/theological interlocutors: Calvin and early Reformed scholastics, Ursinus and Olevianus (Heidelberg authors), Meredith G. Kline and other modern proponents/critics of a distinct covenant of works.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace), federal headship, imputation (guilt and righteousness), law and gospel distinction, original sin, Christology (Christ as second Adam), soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - Beach situates the covenant of works not as an optional speculation but as a formative confessional concept that shapes the Three Forms' account of Adam, law, and Christ - thereby underpinning historic Reformed soteriology and covenantal continuity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Reads the Three Forms of Unity as intentionally covenantal documents that implicitly (and at times explicitly) safeguard a distinct covenant of works, emphasizing juridical and representative structures rather than merely typological statements.
 - Stresses continuity between creational order and covenantal administration: the law given to Adam as legally efficacious, not merely moral instruction.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on readings that minimize or dissolve the covenant of works into natural law or mere probationary testing; corrects tendencies to capitulate to either purely Christocentric or purely juridical accounts that miss confessional nuance.
 - Contrasts with Klinean emphases where necessary, returning the Three Forms to their own historical-linguistic context rather than importing later covenantal schemas wholesale.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies terminology to keep distinct: "covenant of works" (legal, reward-based, representative) vs. "covenant of life" (language sometimes used in confessions) vs. "covenant of grace" (promise-based, fulfilled in Christ).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable in confessional Reformed circles for catechesis, seminary teaching, and polemical clarification; used by pastors and professors to re-anchor covenantal instruction in historic formularies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, textually attentive bridge between confessional texts and contemporary covenantal debates; useful as a corrective to anemic liturgical/catechetical practice and as a resource for systematic construction of Federal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Prelapsarian covenant where Adam, as federal head, was bound to life by obedience; breach brought condemnation.
- **Covenant of Life**
 - Confessional synonym at times used to stress the promised life/reward inherent in the covenant of works.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Post-fall covenant of promise fulfilled in Christ; contrasted with covenant of works in function and economy.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Representative principle: Adam's action imputed to posterity; Christ as second Adam whose obedience is imputed for justification.
- **Imputation**
 - Twofold dynamic: guilt of Adam imputed to sinners; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Law/Gospel distinction**
 - Law as covenantal demand (works); gospel as covenantal promise (grace); crucial for reading confessional formulations.
- **Prelapsarian / Postlapsarian**
 - Temporal-covenantal categories distinguishing Adam's original standing from the fallen state and the instituted covenantal responses.
- **Reward / Merit language**
 - Confessional stress on law's promise of life for obedience; key to understanding covenant of works as juridical.
- **Representative obedience**
 - Concept connecting Adam and Christ as heads whose obedience/disobedience has communal consequences.
- **Typology and foreshadowing**
 - How Adam/Adamic covenant functions as type for Christ and the redemptive-historical ordering in the confessions.
- **Confessional hermeneutic**
 - Methodological posture: read biblical texts through the lens of the Forms, but test confessional claims against Scripture.
- **Juridical vs. Moral readings**
 - Distinguishes readings that treat Adam's command as legally binding covenantal terms from those that treat it as general moral law.
- **Exegetical anchors**
 - Genesis 2-3 and Romans 5 serve as primary biblical centers for the confessional reading.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a confessional-definition source clarifying how the Three Forms articulate the covenant of works.
 - As a polemical resource against readings that deny a distinct covenant of works in Reformed confessions.
 - As an exegetical-model to align preaching/catechesis with historic federal categories.
 - As a conceptual pivot in systematic treatments of imputation, federal headship, and Christology.
