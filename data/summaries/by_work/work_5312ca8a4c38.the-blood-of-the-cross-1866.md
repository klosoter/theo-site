### TITLE
**The Blood of the Cross (1866) - Andrew A. Bonar**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-19th century Scottish evangelical milieu (Free Church sympathies), post-Revival piety intersecting with Reformed systematic commitments; written amid controversies over the nature of atonement and increasing liberalizing trends in biblical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the saving efficacy of Christ is grounded in His blood - understood as penal, vicarious suffering - and this efficacy requires both His **passive obedience** (suffered penalty) and **active obedience** (perfect law‑keeping), both imputed to believers for justificatory standing before God.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical exposition of biblical sacrificial language (Hebrews, Isaiah, Psalms, Romans) that identifies Christ's blood as ground of reconciliation.
 - Doctrinal distinction and defence of **passive obedience** (sufferings and death as penal substitution) and **active obedience** (fulfilment of the law as positive righteousness).
 - Systematic integration: how imputation, satisfaction, and covenantal order require both obediences for a full doctrine of justification and sanctification.
 - Pastoral application: assurance of salvation grounded in Christ's objective work, with call to faith and holy life as fruit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** primary reliance on Scripture; conversation with Reformed tradition (Calvin, Puritans, Westminster Standards); polemical stance against moral‑influence and governmental theories of atonement and against tendencies that minimize penal substitution.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, soteriology (atonement, justification, imputation), covenant theology (covenant of works/ grace and the covenant of redemption), law and gospel, sacrificial typology.
- **Closing line:** The book centrally affirms that the blood of Christ - His obedient life and vicarious death - is the necessary, sufficient, and covenantal ground of sinners' justification and reconciliation to God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Unwavering insistence on the literal, penal significance of "blood" language rather than purely symbolic or moral‑exemplar readings.
 - Careful articulation that both Christ's active and passive obediences are required and distinct yet inseparable in soteriological effect.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects moral‑influence and governmental theories that either dilute penal substitution or treat Christ's obedience merely as an example.
 - Reaffirms classic Reformed imputation against views that would convert Christ's righteousness into a subjective transformation only.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Pastoral framing that marries high forensic language (satisfaction, imputation) with devotional language (access through the blood), enhancing existential assurance without sacrificing doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; used by pastors and revivalists as a concise devotional‑theological defense of substitutionary atonement.
 - Less influence in liberal or non‑substitutionary schools, but continues as a touchstone in conservative defenses of classic soteriology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable as a compact, scripturally anchored defence of penal substitution and the double obedience schema; useful for pastoral instruction, polemical briefing, and exegetical exemplar on sacrificial texts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Blood of the Cross** - central metaphor: Christ's sacrificial, vicarious suffering effecting redemption and reconciliation.
- **Passive Obedience** - Christ's suffering and death as bearing the penal consequence of sin (substitutionary).
- **Active Obedience** - Christ's perfect fulfillment of the law, yielding a righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Penal Substitution** - doctrine that Christ bore the punishment due to sinners; Bonar defends this as scriptural and central.
- **Imputation** - forensic transfer: Christ's obedience/righteousness credited to believers; Christ's sins' bearing transferred to Him.
- **Satisfaction / Expiation / Propitiation** - language describing how Christ's blood meets God's justice and removes guilt; Bonar uses all to nuance aspects of one saving act.
- **Covenant of Redemption / Covenant Theology** - Bonar frames Christ's work within covenantal agreements between Father and Son culminating in redemptive sacrifice.
- **Justification** - declared righteousness of the sinner through Christ's imputed obedience and atoning blood.
- **Law and Gospel** - law's demand met by Christ's active obedience; gospel's promise secured by His passive obedience.
- **Sacrificial Typology** - Old Testament sacrifices as real foreshadowings of Christ's once‑for‑all sacrifice (Hebrews heavily appealed to).
- **Substitution / Vicariousness** - juridical substitution is repeatedly affirmed against moral‑exemplar readings.
- **Assurance** - pastoral consequence: objective ground (blood) provides subjective certainty for faith.
- **Forensic/Pastoral synthesis** - Bonar's hallmark: rigorous forensic doctrine presented with pastoral warmth.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed accounts of penal substitution and the double obedience of Christ.
- As a **polemic** against moral‑influence and governmental theories that deny penal satisfaction.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting sacrificial passages (Hebrews, Isaiah, Psalms, Romans) in systematic soteriology.
- As a **pastoral resource** to ground assurance and devotion in objective atonement.
