### TITLE
In Our Image: Artificial Intelligence and the Human Spirit - Noreen L. Herzfeld

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early-21st century engagement (first edition 2002) at the intersection of Christian theology, cognitive science, and computer science.
 - Responds to rising claims of Strong AI and popular/computationalist narratives that equate intelligence and personhood with information processing.
 - Moves within constructive theology of technology and religious studies of science; aimed at both academic theologians and technically literate readers.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The act of creating intelligent machines forces theological re-examination of the Imago Dei and what it means for human beings to be made "in the image" of God.
 - Counterposes a theological anthropology that resists reduction of human spirit/personhood to computational processes while acknowledging that machines provoke ethically and theologically significant questions.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Diagnostic: surveys AI research and philosophical claims (Turing test, computationalism, claims of emergent machine consciousness) to show the cultural momentum toward equating mind with mechanism.
 - Theological resources: brings classical and contemporary theological categories (Imago Dei, soul/spirit, embodiment, personhood, creation) to critique reductive accounts.
 - Constructive proposal: argues for a relational, embodied, spiritual account of human identity that:
 - respects scientific insight into cognition,
 - refuses to ontologize computational analogies as full explanations,
 - interprets human image-bearing as vocation (creative and responsible), not merely functional equivalence with machines.
 - Ethical implications: explores responsibility of creators, anthropomorphism, stewardship, and how AI challenges doctrines of sin, agency, and moral accountability.
 - Pastoral/eschatological edge: suggests AI reveals human limits and dependency on God, and can be integrated into a theology of hope rather than despaired technocratic mastery.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - AI and cognitive science figures: Alan Turing (Turing test), John Searle (Chinese Room), Daniel Dennett, Marvin Minsky, Hubert Dreyfus, Rodney Brooks.
 - Theological interlocutors: draws on biblical categories (Genesis Imago Dei), patristic and medieval notions of soul/spirit, and contemporary theologians addressing technology and ethics.
 - Cross-disciplinary scholarship in philosophy of mind, computer science, and ethics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Imago Dei**: central hinge for discussion.
 - **Anthropology**: personhood, soul/spirit, embodiment, relationality.
 - **Creation and vocation**: human creativity as derivative of divine creating.
 - **Ethics / moral agency**: responsibility of makers and machines, sin and accountability.
 - **Revelation / mediation**: technology as mediator of meaning and relation.
 - Secondary engagement: epistemology (knowledge vs simulation), eschatology (future human-technological possibilities).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Creating intelligence "in our image" compels Christians to reclaim a non-reductive, relational Imago Dei that grounds human dignity, limits technocratic dominion, and frames technological creativity as vocation-with-responsibility under God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats human technological creation as a theological mirror: human makers reflect divine creator-ness but remain creaturely.
 - Emphasizes **embodiment and relationality** as non-negotiable marks of the human spirit, resisting disembodied computational analogies.
 - Frames AI discourse not only as technical or philosophical but as a *theological crisis/opportunity* for re-articulating vocation and stewardship.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects philosophical **computationalism** (mind = program) by insisting that simulation of cognitive functions is not equivalent to human personhood or spiritual life.
 - Contrasts with techno-optimists who claim machine minds will displace human uniqueness and with technophobic views that uniformly demonize AI; advocates calibrated engagement.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts Imago Dei language to include **maker-vocation**: humans as creators who are ethically accountable to the Creator.
 - Uses "artificial intelligence" as a theological foil to bring hidden anthropological commitments into view (e.g., what counts as "intelligence").

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in theology of technology and religious studies of science; used in interdisciplinary courses on religion and AI.
 - Influential among Christian ethicists and theologians who seek a middle path between technophilia and Luddism.
 - Less influential in mainstream analytic philosophy of mind, but respected for bringing theological concerns into cross-disciplinary conversation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for integrating biblical-theological anthropology with contemporary AI debates.
 - Useful pedagogically for seminars on ethics of technology, public theology, and Christian responses to cognitive science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei**
 - Redefined as relational, embodied, vocational; basis for human dignity and creative responsibility.
- **Strong AI / Weak AI**
 - Distinguishes claim that machines *are* minds (Strong AI) from claim they *simulate* aspects of mind (Weak AI); Herzfeld argues theological anthropologies invalidate simplistic Strong AI claims.
- **Personhood**
 - Not reducible to information processing; includes relationality, moral accountability, embodied consciousness.
- **Embodiment**
 - Central to human spirit; resists disembodied computational accounts of mind.
- **Intentionality**
 - Philosophical concept examined to separate syntactic processing from semantically grounded human meaning-making.
- **Simulation vs. Replication**
 - Key analytic distinction: machines may simulate mental capacities without replicating spiritual personhood.
- **Maker-vocation**
 - Humans as created creators: ethical framework for technological practice and stewardship.
- **Anthropomorphism**
 - Critiqued as a psychological tendency that can mislead moral and theological judgments about machines.
- **Moral agency / responsibility**
 - Emphasizes creators' responsibility for machine impacts; machines do not absolve human moral accountability.
- **Technological mediation**
 - Technology as shaping human relation and perception; demands theological reflection.
- **Soul / spirit**
 - Restated in relational and relationally embodied terms rather than substance dualism.
- **Creation-creativity analogy**
 - Analogical theology: human creativity reflects but does not equal divine creation.
- **Eschatological orientation**
 - Technology must be read within hope-eschatology, not as ultimate human self-fulfillment.

- How this work is used across loci
 - **Theological anthropology / definition source**: cited when defining Imago Dei in contemporary, technologized contexts.
 - **Ethical / polemical resource**: used to critique computationalist claims and to argue for creator responsibility in AI development.
 - **Conceptual pivot**: serves as a bridge between biblical doctrine (Imago Dei) and practical ethics in tech policy and AI governance.
