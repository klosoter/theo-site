### TITLE
**Disputationes Theologicae** - Francis Turretin (Reformed scholastic disputations on Christ's active and passive obedience)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th century Reformed scholasticism (Geneva; Turretin 1623-1687). Work stems from academic disputations and his larger elenctic theology produced in the post-Reformation confessional era, responding to Remonstrants (Arminians), Socinians, Roman Catholic claims, and intra-Reformed controversies (e.g., Amyraldianism).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ rendered both a perfect active obedience (fulfilling the law) and a full passive obedience (suffering the penalty of sin); both are necessary and imputed to believers for forensic justification.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define terms precisely: active vs. passive obedience; imputation; satisfaction vs. merit.
 - Scriptural exegesis: appeal to passages such as Romans 5, Philippians 2, Matthew, Hebrews (esp. Hebrews 2-10) to show both obedience and suffering are redemptive and imputed.
 - Logical/theological necessity:
 - As federal head, Christ must obey the law perfectly to accomplish what Adam failed (covenant of works/representative solidarity).
 - As penal substitute, Christ must suffer the deserved wrath to satisfy divine justice.
 - Forensic consequences: double imputation (our sins to Christ; his obedience and sufferings to us) grounds justification and the believer's righteousness before God.
 - Polemical refutation: answers to those who deny either active or passive elements (e.g., moral influence, mere example theories, or views minimizing imputation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, Augustine, scholastic categories (meritum de condigno/congruo), Calvin and original Reformed expositors, opponents (Remonstrants, Socinians, certain Catholic scholastics), occasional appeal to patristic and medieval formulations to clarify juridical categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (including hypostatic union and federal headship), soteriology (atonement, penal substitution, satisfaction), justification (forensic imputation), covenant theology (covenant of works and covenant of grace), merit and grace, union with Christ.
- **Closing line:** Turretin centers the doctrine of salvation on a juridical, federal Christology: only the combined active and passive obedience of the incarnate Redeemer, imputed to believers, secures forensic justification and God's honor.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous scholastic precision distinguishing types of merit and the modalities of imputation.
 - Strong insistence on the necessity of Christ's active obedience as fulfillment of the law, not merely a moral exemplar.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contra Socinianism/Arminianism: defends penal satisfaction and imputation against denial or dilution.
 - Contra theological minimalism (that stresses only passive obedience): insists both obeying and suffering are salvific.
 - Clarifies and refines scholastic merit-language to prevent semi-Pelagian implications.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic pairing of federal headship and juridical categories to account for obedience/satisfaction.
 - Precise operationalization of "double imputation" within a covenantal-legal framework.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly formative for later Reformed orthodoxy and confessional teaching (including North American Reformed and Princeton circles); used as a standard reference for defending classic Reformed accounts of justification and atonement.
- **Enduring value:** Exemplifies disciplined exegetical-scholastic method; provides a compact, teachable formulation of why both active and passive obedience are essential for Protestant forensic soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience:** Christ's perfect law-keeping (merit of fulfilling God's law on behalf of believers).
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's sufferings and death as penal substitution satisfying divine justice.
- **Imputation:** The forensic transfer by which Christ's obedience is reckoned to believers and believers' sins to Christ.
- **Penal substitution:** View that Christ bore the punishment due sinners; central in Turretin's portrayal of passive obedience.
- **Satisfaction:** The making-good of divine justice; distinct from but related to merit.
- **Meritum de condigno / meritum de congruo:** Scholastic distinctions Turretin refines to explain how Christ's work is fittingly rewarded or reckoned.
- **Federal headship:** Christ as representative of elect humanity, succeeding where Adam failed; grounds active obedience's necessity.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** Framework explaining why obedience and suffering relate differently to persons pre- and post-fall.
- **Forensic justification:** Declarative acquittal before God grounded in imputed righteousness.
- **Double imputation:** The twofold reckoning (our sins to Christ; his righteousness to us).
- **Hypostatic union:** Basis for the appropriateness of Christ's obedience and suffering as meritorious for humans.
- **Expiation / propitiation:** Terms clarified in relation to satisfaction and God's wrath turned away by Christ's sacrifice.
- **Union with Christ:** The covenantal/ontological bond that makes imputation efficacious.
- **Penalty / punishment:** Emphasized as necessary to satisfy divine justice and vindicate God's law.
- **Legal-juridical language:** Turretin's preferred idiom for discussing these doctrines.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for classic Reformed formulations of active and passive obedience and double imputation.
- As polemic ammunition against Arminian, Socinian, and moral-exemplar accounts of atonement.
- As an exegetical-scholastic model for reading key Pauline and Johannine texts on justification, obedience, and substitution.
