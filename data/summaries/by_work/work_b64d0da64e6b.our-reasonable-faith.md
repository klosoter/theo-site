### TITLE
**Our Reasonable Faith** 
Herman Bavinck (Dutch Reformed; early 20th century apologetic work)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th century Netherlands (published 1908); written within the Dutch Reformed/Neo-Calvinist milieu and against the background of Enlightenment critique, liberal theology, German higher criticism, and rising positivism.
 - Bavinck writes as a confessional Reformed theologian addressing both the academy and the church, seeking a public defense of Christianity intelligible to modern minds.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity is a *reasonable* faith: it is consonant with right reason and reality because God has revealed himself in nature and history; faith and reason are complementary, not opposites.
 - Opposes both uncritical fideism and reductionist rationalism; seeks a mediating apologetic that defends the objectivity and intelligibility of revelation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrates human religious knowledge and openness to God (natural theology/common grace).
 - Shows the necessity and reality of special revelation for a full knowledge of God (Scripture, incarnation, redemptive history).
 - Establishes Christ as the decisive revelation of God (Christology) and the Spirit as guarantor and witness (Pneumatology).
 - Applies the above to soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments, and eschatology to show the coherent system of Christian doctrine that meets rational inquiry.
 - Typical movements:
 - Preface: crisis of modern thought and the need for a reasonable defense.
 - Part I: God known by nature and conscience; philosophical theism.
 - Part II: Revelation, Scripture, and Christ as historical, authoritative revelation.
 - Part III: The Spirit, faith, salvation, church and eschatological hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thinkers: Kant, Hegel, Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and the positivists.
 - Dialogues with scholasticism, medieval theologians, Reformation figures (particularly Calvin), and contemporaries such as Abraham Kuyper.
 - Utilizes biblical exegesis, philosophical argument, and historical apologetics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Scripture, Theology proper (God), Trinity, Christology, Pneumatology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, Sacraments, Eschatology, Anthropology, Creation and providence, Common grace, Covenant theology.

- **Closing line capturing the center of gravity**
 - Christianity, rightly understood, is a faith that aligns with reason because it rests on a God who both creates intelligible reality and decisively reveals himself in Christ through the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of natural theology and special revelation: neither rejected nor isolated; natural knowledge prepares and corroborates revelation.
 - Pastoral apologetic tone: aimed at both believers to strengthen faith and skeptics to show Christian truth as intellectually viable.
 - Balance between scholastic rigor and experiential/pietistic sensitivity-doctrine as both objective truth and living reality.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal theology's reduction of Christianity to ethical or religious feeling by reasserting historical, objective revelation in Christ.
 - Counters fideism by insisting on rational grounds for faith; counters rationalism by insisting on the necessity of revelation and the Spirit's role.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - The phrase and program of a "reasonable faith" as a mid-way between blind fideism and mere rationalism became a lasting rubric for Reformed apologetics.
 - Clear deployment of "common grace" and the covenantal framework to articulate how natural knowledge and redemptive revelation correlate.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed and evangelical circles as a model of orthodox apologetics; translated into English and used in seminary instruction.
 - Influenced later Reformed apologists and theologians who seek both fidelity to confessional theology and engagement with modern philosophy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a systematic exemplar of Reformed apologetics: historically grounded, philosophically aware, and pastorally sensitive; valuable for Christology, pneumatology, and public defense of doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reasonable faith** - Faith that coheres with reason because both rest on the rational Creator; the work's central label and program.
- **Natural theology** - Legitimate, limited knowledge of God from creation and conscience; prepares for special revelation.
- **Special revelation** - God's decisive self-disclosure in Scripture and especially in Christ; indispensable for saving knowledge.
- **Objective revelation** - Revelation as historical and propositional, not merely subjective experience; counter to liberal reduction.
- **Christ as revelation** - Christ is the culminating, personal disclosure of God's being and will; Christocentric hermeneutic governs doctrine.
- **Holy Spirit (witness/testimony)** - The Spirit authenticates revelation in the believer and effects appropriation of redemptive truth.
- **Common grace** - God's restraining and enabling grace that makes human knowledge and culture possible and testifies to God's revelation broadly.
- **Covenant framework** - Covenantal categories used to articulate continuity between creation, fall, and redemption.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - Used cautiously: affirms correlation between God and creatures without collapsing Creator/creature distinction.
- **Faith and knowledge** - Faith is assent grounded in divine witness and objective truth; not irrational, not merely subjective.
- **Apologetics** - Methodologically synthetic: philosophical proof, historical testimony, and experiential testimony combined.
- **Objectivity vs. subjectivity** - Maintains objective truth of Gospel while acknowledging subjective appropriation by faith.
- **Eschatological hope** - Doctrine of last things grounds the rationality of Christian ethics and promise.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source for Reformed apologetics and a pedagogical model for integrating philosophy, history, and theology.
 - Polemical tool against both liberal theology and fideism; frequently cited in debates on revelation and rationality.
 - Exegetical and doctrinal pivot for Christology and Pneumatology: exemplifies how incarnational history plus Spirit-witness secure objective faith.
