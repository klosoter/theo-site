### TITLE
The Theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg (ed. Carl E. Braaten) - notes on sanctification as **Definitive and Progressive**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th century German systematic theology; post-war theological reconstruction with strong engagement of historical-critical biblical scholarship, philosophical reflection, and the natural sciences.
 - Pannenberg seeks a public, rational theology (Wissenschaft) that places **history** and especially the resurrection at the center of doctrinal claims.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian life (sanctification) is to be understood both as a definitive reality grounded in Christ's resurrection (an eschatological act that establishes new being) and as a historical, progressive ethical formation in time. Theology must show how definitive eschatological realities relate to ongoing moral transformation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology's method: correlate biblical-historical claims with philosophical and empirical inquiry; test theological claims by their explanatory power for history.
 - Christology & Resurrection: the resurrection is the decisive historical event that grounds Christian claims about God's future and human destiny.
 - Eschatology as ontology: God's being is grasped as the "reality of the future"; this future-reality is the normative source for present human existence and sanctification.
 - Sanctification articulated:
 - **Definitive**: believers are given a new identity in the resurrection-participation in Christ secures a decisive ontological change (union with Christ, inaugurated eschatological reality).
 - **Progressive**: that ontological change issues in ongoing ethical formation and social transformation in history; the kingdom's realization shapes moral progress without collapsing into immediate perfectionism.
 - Ethics derives its normativity from eschatological hope; historical witness and ecclesial practice are measures of sanctification's unfolding.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogue with Karl Barth (critique of separation of revelation from historical verification), Rudolf Bultmann (on historical-critical method; demythologizing), Jürgen Moltmann (shared eschatological themes), Roman Catholic theology (Rahner), and contemporary philosophical/scientific discourse.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (resurrection focus), eschatology (future-as-reality), soteriology (justification and sanctification), anthropology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, doctrine of God (future-oriented), method (theology as science).

- **Closing line**
 - Pannenberg locates sanctification in the tension between **eschatological definitiveness** secured by Christ's resurrection and **historical progress** shaped by hope and communal witness: theology must make that tension doctrinally coherent and publicly intelligible.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Eschatology as primary interpretive key: the future (resurrection/kingdom) is ontologically prior for present Christian identity and ethics.
 - Commitment to theology as a rational, intersubjective discipline that engages history and empirical knowledge.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on Barthian immediacy of revelation by insisting on historical anchoring (the resurrection as verifiable event).
 - Corrects existential demythologizers by insisting the historical reality of the resurrection grants substantive content to faith and ethics.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Phrase and program: **"God as the reality of the future"** - supplies an ontological eschatology that links God's being to eschatological consummation.
 - Framing sanctification explicitly as a twofold reality: **definitive** (eschatological status) + **progressive** (ethical-historical unfolding).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence in post-war Protestant systematic theology, ecumenical dialogue, and scholarly Christology/eschatology.
 - Provoked critique from conservative evangelicals wary of historical-critical epistemology; welcomed by theologians seeking to integrate faith with modern intellectual frameworks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for linking doctrine (resurrection, eschatology) to ethical life and ecclesial practice; invaluable for courses on soteriology, eschatology, and constructive systematic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection** - the decisive historical event that grounds Christian claims about divine action, human destiny, and the reality of the future.
- **Eschatology (future as reality)** - theological paradigm: the future (consummation) constitutes present identity and normativity.
- **Sanctification: Definitive** - ontological change in believers by virtue of union with the risen Christ; the inaugurated eschatological status.
- **Sanctification: Progressive** - ongoing ethical and communal transformation in history that realizes the implications of the definitive status.
- **Theology as Wissenschaft** - theology conceived as a disciplined, public, rational inquiry engaging empirical history and philosophy.
- **Christology (historical grounding)** - Christology anchored in historical events, especially resurrection, as confirmatory of revelation.
- **Revelation (historical-verifiable)** - divine self-disclosure mediated through historical acts and documents, open to intersubjective assessment.
- **Kingdom of God** - eschatological horizon that supplies the norm for moral and ecclesial transformation.
- **Union with Christ** - soteriological locus where definitive sanctification takes place; source for progressive fruitfulness.
- **Hope (eschatological motivation)** - the dynamic that propels ethical perseverance and social witness.
- **Ontology of the future** - metaphysical claim that God's being and human destiny are defined by future consummation.
- **Methodological integration** - interplay of biblical exegesis, historical argument, philosophical critique, and scientific discourse.
- **Ethics as teleological** - moral norms are grounded in the telos constituted by God's future fulfillment.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for pairing definitive and progressive accounts of sanctification in soteriology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking eschatology to ethics and ecclesiology in systematic theology and practical theology.
 - As an **exegetical-method model** for arguments that anchor doctrine in historical events (primarily the resurrection) rather than abstract metaphysics.
