### TITLE
**Evangelical Reunion: Denominations and the Body of Christ** 
Author: **John M. Frame**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical ecumenical debates; situated in Reformed/evangelical milieu concerned with fragmentation among Protestant bodies and pragmatic/missional pressures for unity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Evangelicals ought to pursue reunion that is faithful to Christian doctrine - especially the Reformation emphases - while negotiating tensions between visible denominational diversity and the unity implied by the Body of Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Diagnosis: contemporary evangelical denominationalism reflects both theological commitments and ecclesiastical failures; unity rhetoric often collapses doctrinal distinctives. 
 - Normative criteria: proposes doctrinal and practical criteria (marks, sacraments, ministry) that any reunion must respect to preserve the church's integrity. 
 - Mechanisms for reunion: recommends staged, covenantal approaches that respect confessional commitments, accountability (discipline), and shared mission. 
 - Practical proposals: on intercommunion, mutual recognition of ministry, and federative or organic union models framed by covenant and confessional fidelity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformation theologians (e.g., Calvin, the Reformational marks), contemporary ecumenists, proponents of visible/invisible church distinctions, and advocates of Presbyterian polity and congregational models.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (nature and marks of the church, visible vs. invisible), sacramentology (baptism, Lord's Supper), ministerial office and discipline (Presbyterian polity focus), catholicity (One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church), and implied doctrinal loci (revelation, Christology insofar as headship and mediation relate to unity).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Unity must be pursued not as institutional homogenization but as confessional, covenantal reconciliation that honors the church's marks and the catholicity of Christ's body.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Frames reunion in terms of **confessional covenanting** rather than merger or mere cooperation; emphasizes mutual recognition conditioned on shared doctrine and discipline. 
 - Stresses the **practical interplay** of marks (preaching, sacraments, discipline) with visible unity; not merely abstract doctrinal agreement.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against liberal ecumenism that prioritizes institutional unity over doctrinal substance; also critiques sectarian separatism that treats doctrinal difference as irreconcilable without ecclesial accountability. 
 - Distinguishes from some evangelical alliance models that minimize polity and sacramental differences; insists polity matters for faithful unity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Articulates a working taxonomy between **federative reunion** (union by covenant with retained structures) and **organic reunion** (full institutional merger), advocating calibrated steps with confessional tests. 
 - Reframes the visible/invisible church tension by insisting visible marks be the testing ground for recognition.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Received attentively among Reformed and evangelical ecclesiologists as a constructive middle path; used in denominational conversations and by theologians addressing intercommunion and mutual recognition. 
 - Criticized by radical ecumenists for requiring too much doctrinal conformity and by strict sectarians for conceding too much to wider catholic claims.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Serves as a practical theological resource for denominations contemplating reunion; valuable for teaching ecclesiology, church order, and ecumenical polity in seminary contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Marks of the Church:** Preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and exercise of church discipline - treated as non-negotiable indicators for recognition.
- **Visible Church:** The institutional, observable community; Frame insists reunion must pay attention to visible marks.
- **Invisible Church:** The elect known to God; acknowledged but insufficient as a basis for institutional recognition.
- **Reformation Ecclesiology:** Scriptural and confessional standards drawn from Reformers used as normative benchmarks for reunion.
- **Presbyterian Polity / Offices:** Emphasizes elders, sessions, presbyteries as structures that enable accountable unity and discipline; used as a model for covenantal merger.
- **Church Discipline:** Mechanism for maintaining purity and corporate accountability; a sine qua non for legitimate reunion.
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church:** The theological horizon for reunion - catholicity understood confessional and confederative rather than purely institutionalistic.
- **Intercommunion / Mutual Recognition:** Practical sacramental agreements proposed as interim steps toward fuller reunion.
- **Federative vs. Organic Reunion:** Distinction between covenantal unions preserving structures and full institutional mergers; recommended staged approach.
- **Confessional Covenanting:** A contractual-ecclesial model insisting on shared confessions and accountability as basis for unity.
- **Sacramentology (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** Treated as crucial for recognition; agreement on sacramental theology required.
- **Accountability Mechanisms:** Structures (courts, presbyteries) and processes (appeals, admonition) necessary to sustain unity.
- **Mission and Witness:** Unity is not merely doctrinal but oriented to common mission; reunion is justified by and tested in mission.
- **Ecclesial Hospitality:** Guidelines for provisional fellowship without full corporate union.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed criteria of ecclesial recognition (marks, polity, discipline). 
 - As a **polemic and practical model** in denominational reunion talks (arguing for staged, confessional covenanting). 
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual pivot** in seminars on visible/invisible church and catholicity, linking sacramental practice to ecclesial identity.
