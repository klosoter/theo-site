### TITLE
The Problem of Evil (editor: John Hick, 1964)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century debate that fused analytic philosophy of religion and systematic theology.
 - Responds to post‑war scepticism about divine benevolence and power; anthologizes classical and contemporary treatments for classroom use.
 - Editor John Hick organizes a cross‑disciplinary exchange amid rising prominence of analytic philosophers (Mackie, Hume readings) and renewed theological reflection.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Frames the perennial question: how to reconcile **God's omnipotence and omnibenevolence** with the manifest existence of evil and suffering (moral and natural).
 - Presents multiple responses rather than a single definitive answer; highlights advantages and limits of theodicies and defenses.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic opening: distinction between the **logical** and **evidential** problems of evil; restates Mackie and Humean challenges.
 - Survey essays: classical Augustinian privation theory, free‑will‑centered defenses, and emerging soul‑making/eschatological theodicies (Hick's own trajectory).
 - Comparative critique: shows weaknesses of simple privation accounts for natural evil; develops pastoral and eschatological resources for justification.
 - Closing move: argues for a theodicy that integrates moral development, creaturely freedom, and future divine rectification (eschatological vindication).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engagement with Augustine (privation), Epicurus/Hume (challenge), J.L. Mackie (logical problem), and proto‑Irenaean formulations that Hick will popularize.
 - Interdisciplinary voices: philosophers of religion, systematic theologians, and historical sources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, human freedom, original sin, creation, eschatology, divine justice, and soteriology (insofar as evil interacts with human moral formation).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The volume centers on reframing theodicy: not merely to vindicate divine attributes abstractly, but to locate evil within a **divinely ordered moral‑developmental and eschatological economy** that preserves God's justice and goodness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Moves discussion from purely abstract logical puzzles to **anthropological and soteriological** concerns: why creatures must undergo morally significant struggle.
 - Elevates the Irenaean/soul‑making intuition as a plausible alternative to strict Augustinian privation theories.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Critiques Augustinian answers for inadequately explaining natural evil and suffering that is not clearly traceable to human sin.
 - Challenges purely deductive "incompatibility" proofs by showing the practical and theological resources for plausibility (vs. strict logical refutation).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the language of **"soul‑making"** and **"vale of soul‑making"** in mid‑20th century anglophone theology (Hick's influence).
 - Emphasizes **epistemic distance** (God's allowing of hiddenness to preserve genuine freedom and response).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in philosophy of religion syllabi and theological classrooms as a standard anthology on theodicy.
 - Provoked sustained debate: praised for breadth and pastoral sensitivity; critiqued by conservative Reformed theologians for downplaying divine sovereignty and penal aspects of sin.
 - Influenced later work in skeptical theism, developmental theodicies, and interchanges between analytic philosophers and theologians.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable teaching tool and conceptual pivot from Augustine‑centered treatments toward pastoral/eschatological models; remains a go‑to anthology for mapping options in theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodicy** - defence or justification of divine goodness in the face of evil; anthology presents multiple models.
- **Problem of evil** - the core tension between belief in God and the reality of suffering; treated as logical and evidential.
- **Logical vs. evidential problem** - distinction between formal inconsistency arguments and probabilistic/empirical challenges.
- **Moral evil** - human‑caused wrongdoing; analyzed in relation to free will and moral responsibility.
- **Natural evil** - suffering from natural processes; central challenge to privation and free‑will accounts.
- **Privation theory (Augustinian)** - evil as absence or corruption of good; critiqued for explanatory gaps.
- **Free‑will defense** - evil as a necessary byproduct of genuine creaturely freedom; assessed and qualified.
- **Soul‑making (Irenaean)** - evil as instrument for spiritual/moral growth and maturation; a key theme in Hick's contribution.
- **Eschatological vindication / divine justice** - future rectification and ultimate ordering that justifies present suffering.
- **Omnipotence / omnibenevolence** - attributes whose coherence is tested by evil; anthology explores redefinitions and limits.
- **Epistemic distance** - God's intentional withholding to preserve authentic human response.
- **Vale of soul‑making** - metaphor for the world as formative environment for character development.
- **Skeptical theism (proto‑themes)** - caution about human epistemic limitations in judging divine reasons for permitting evil.
- **Divine hiddenness** - related problem; addressed as part of preserving free human response.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source anthology** for theodicy debates in philosophy of religion courses.
 - As a **polemic and pedagogical pivot**: deployed by advocates of soul‑making theodicies and by critics defending Augustinian/Reformed alternatives.
 - As a **conceptual model** for integrating soteriology and eschatology into explanations of divine justice vis‑a‑vis suffering.
