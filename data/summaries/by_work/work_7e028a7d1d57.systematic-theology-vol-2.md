### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Anonymous, doctrinally synthetic volume reflective of confessional Protestant systematic practice; likely composed within a post-Reformation, scholastic-to-modern nexus that privileges Scripture, creeds, and Reformed categories.
 - Frequently deployed across seminary and online theological resources as a compact, authoritative reference on Christology and sin.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church's ordering of doctrine requires a Christocentric synthesis: right knowledge of God and sin is intelligible and remedial only through the person and work of Christ as covenantal representative and ground of human restoration.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Begins with an analysis of human sin and deprivation (anthropology & original sin).
 - Moves to the doctrine of Christ: person (hypostatic union), offices (prophet, priest, king), and the mechanics of atonement.
 - Develops soteriology through covenantal and forensic categories (imputation, active/passive obedience), then treats application (regeneration, justification, sanctification).
 - Concludes with ecclesiology and sacramental sign-seal relations insofar as they mediate covenant promise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary authority: Scripture. Secondary authorities: Augustine, Calvin, classical Reformed scholastics; engages pietistic, moral-influence, and liberal-critical objections.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, God (attributes and Trinity), creation, anthropology, original sin (guilt and corruption), Christology (person and work), atonement (penal/federal), justification, sanctification, covenant theology, ecclesiology, sacraments.
- **Closing line**
 - A systematic, covenantal theology that centers Christ as the federal head whose person and work resolve the problem of human sin and secure corporate restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong proclivity to integrate **federal headship** with classical penal substitution: Adam and Christ as mirror-image representatives whose legal status is imputed across covenantal communities.
 - Detailed balance of **active and passive obedience** of Christ as necessary for both fulfillment of the law and penal satisfaction.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic tendencies to privatize sin and grace by reasserting corporate, covenantal dimensions of guilt and redemption.
 - Pushes back against liberal and moral-influence atonement models by reasserting forensic categories and substitutionary language.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines language of **covenantal participation** (organic union) to explain how Christ's work is applied to believers without collapsing individual responsibility.
 - Nuances "imputation" into legal (guilt/credit) and relational (federal standing) registers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed training and online theological aggregations as a concise textbook on Christology and sin; influential as a convenient synthesis of earlier Reformed categories.
 - Criticized by some for limited engagement with contemporary philosophical theology and social-ethical implications.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable pedagogically for tracing classical Reformed answers to sin and redemption; durable as a doctrinal pivot between scholastic precision and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal headship**
 - Adam and Christ as representative heads whose acts and status are legally imputed to their respective covenanters.
- **Penal substitution**
 - Christ bears the penalty due sinners; emphasized as the central interpretation of atonement.
- **Imputation**
 - Twofold: guilt imputed to sinners (Adamic) and righteousness imputed to believers (Christic).
- **Active and passive obedience**
 - Active: Christ's perfect law-keeping credited to believers; Passive: suffering/death as penal satisfaction.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - Fuller treatment of Christ's two natures in one person; used to secure both substitutionary capacity and mediator status.
- **Original sin (guilt vs corruption)**
 - Distinguishes inherited corrupt nature from federally imputed guilt; both necessary to explain universal sinfulness.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace**
 - Covenant-structured soteriology: works principle replaced/fulfilled by Christ; grace administered by covenant promises and signs.
- **Ordo salutis**
 - Ordered application of salvation (calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification) presented with covenantal logic.
- **Representative atonement**
 - Emphasizes corporate, juridical dimensions over solely exemplary ones.
- **Organic union / federal participation**
 - Describes believers' union with Christ as the means of appropriation of benefits.
- **Total depravity**
 - Affirms pervasive effect of sin on faculties and will; grounds need for sovereign grace.
- **Sacramental sign-seal**
 - Sacraments as covenant signs that confirm promises, not independent channels of merit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed formulations (imputation, federal headship, penal substitution).
 - As a **polemic resource** against moral-influence/liberal atonement models and pietistic privatizations of sin.
 - As an **exegetical model** for covenantal readings of Pauline texts (Romans, 1 Corinthians).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula linking Christology, soteriology, and covenant theology for systematic teaching.
