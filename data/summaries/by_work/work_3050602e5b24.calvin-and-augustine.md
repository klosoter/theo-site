### TITLE
Calvin and Augustine - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton theology (Warfield), a conservatively Reformed reaction to modernism, liberal theology, and rising movements (Arminian revisionism, Pentecostal revival).
 - Project aimed at historical retrieval: establishing Calvin within the classical Augustinian stream as a corrective to claims that Calvin was novel or departed from patristic orthodoxy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** John Calvin is best understood as an Augustinian theologian in continuity rather than as an innovator; many distinctive Reformed doctrines are faithful developments of Augustinian thought, clarified by Reformation concerns.
 - Doctrinal problem: whether Calvin's formulations (on sin, grace, covenant, Spirit, sacraments, Trinity) represent rupture or faithful appropriation of Augustine.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrate textual and doctrinal parallels: Augustine => Calvin on original sin, bondage of will, divine initiative in salvation.
 - Show continuity in Trinitarian theology (including acceptance of Augustinian filioque logic) and in sacramental spirituality (spiritual real presence / means of grace).
 - Place Calvinic covenant theology (pactum salutis and Christ as covenant head) as a systematic refinement rather than a novelty.
 - Contrast Reformed pneumatology with modern charismatic claims; trace Calvin/Augustine emphases on Spirit as guarantor/illuminator rather than dispenser of ongoing revelatory gifts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine (central authority), John Calvin.
 - Opponents/sources for contrast: Pelagius and semi-Pelagianism, Arminius/Arminian revisionism, early 20th-century Pentecostal/continuationist movements, critics who see Calvin as novel.
 - Use of patristic corpus, Reformation-era texts, and contemporary theological controversies for polemic and defense.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Nature and origin of sin; sin and free will:** total depravity, bondage of the will, Augustine's account adopted by Calvin.
 - **Trinity / Filioque:** Augustinian double procession influence on Calvin's Trinitarian language.
 - **Sacraments as means of grace:** Calvin's view as Augustinian in spiritual efficacy and instrumental role.
 - **General and special revelation / Bibliology:** primacy of Scripture and divine illumination via Spirit; continuity in epistemology.
 - **Pactum salutis & Christ as covenant head:** covenantal structure grounded in Augustinian soteriology and extended by Calvin.
 - **Pneumatology / Pentecostalism / Continuationism vs Cessationism:** emphases on Spirit's normative work (illumination, regeneration), skepticism toward modern charismatic claims.

- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity**
 - Warfield's Calvin is an Augustinian theologian whose disciplined appropriation of Augustine provides the doctrinal spine of classical Reformed orthodoxy: sin, grace, covenant, sacraments and Spirit all read through an Augustinian lens that resists both novelty and reductionism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong historical-theological defense of *continuity* rather than discontinuity: Calvin as heir, not innovator.
 - Emphasizes doctrinal coherence: Calvin's systematic moves are intelligible as Augustinian refinements adapted to Reformation controversies.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects narratives that depict Calvin as a scholastic or merely novel system-builder; contrasts Calvin with Pelagian/Arminian positions and with uncritical charismatic readings of Spirit-work.
 - Reclaims Augustine as normative for Reformed sacramental and soteriological claims against modern critics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Warfield's framing popularized reading Calvin through "Augustinianism" as a hermeneutical key - a concise conceptual pivot for subsequent Reformed historiography.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in 20th-century conservative Reformed circles (Princeton-influenced seminaries); used to buttress confessional orthodoxy and cessationist positions.
 - Served as a touchstone for later work on covenant theology and the patristic roots of the Reformation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Exemplary model of combining historical exegesis with systematic theology; clarifies continuity of major doctrines and provides a polemical toolkit for defending classical Reformed positions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin / Nature and origin of sin**
 - Calvin read as accepting Augustine's doctrine of inherited guilt and corruption; Warfield stresses this continuity.

- **Bondage of the will / Sin and free will**
 - Calvin's denial of libertarian, autonomous will parallels Augustine; human will bound until divine intervention.

- **Filioque and Trinity**
 - Warfield notes Calvin's tracings of Augustinian Trinitarian logic (double procession) within Reformed formulations of the Spirit's relation to Father and Son.

- **Sacraments as means of grace**
 - Calvin's sacramental theology inherits Augustine's emphasis on instrumental efficacy: sacraments convey and seal grace spiritually.

- **General and special revelation (Bibliology)**
 - Calvin as Augustinian in affirming Scripture's primacy and the Spirit's role in illumination; Warfield insists on special revelation as normative.

- **Pactum salutis / Christ as covenant head**
 - Warfield situates the covenant of redemption and Christ's federal headship as developments rooted in Augustinian soteriology and made explicit in Calvin.

- **Pneumatology**
 - The Spirit's regenerating and illuminating office is highlighted; Warfield links Calvin to Augustine in emphasizing normative Spirit-work over extraordinary signs.

- **Pentecostalism / Continuationism vs Cessationism**
 - Warfield defends a cautious/cessationist posture: ongoing normative gifts (Scripture-inspired life) vs. extraordinary charismatic phenomena claimed by modern Pentecostalism.

- **Prevenient vs irresistible grace (contrast)**
 - Warfield situates Calvin with Augustine on strong, efficacious grace - rejecting semi-Pelagian mitigations.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for reading Calvin within an Augustinian framework (soteriology, sin, grace).
 - As **polemic** against Arminianism and modern charismatic claims (free will debates, pneumatology).
 - As an **exegetical-model** for sacramental theology and Trinitarian formulations.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching covenant theology (pactum salutis; Christ's headship) and in defending confessional Reformed continuity with the fathers.
