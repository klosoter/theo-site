### TITLE
Sixty-Seven Articles (1523) - Huldrych Zwingli

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in Zürich, 1523, as Zwingli's public statement after the 1522 reformation initiatives and the 1523 disputation before the Zürich council. Part of early Swiss Reformation efforts to codify reforms of worship, sacraments, and church order.
 - Theological milieu: anti-scholastic Humanist exegesis, reliance on Scripture as final authority, early confrontation with Roman sacramental practice and emerging Lutheran positions.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To define a reformed, scriptural pattern of worship and sacraments: sacraments are signs/pledges of Christ's promises, not meritorious works or automatic conveyors of physical grace; the church must discipline membership and gatekeep sacramental participation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Statement organizes practical reforms and doctrines into compact declarative articles addressing worship, sacraments, clergy, and discipline.
 - Major moves:
 - Affirm Scripture as norm and reject abuses (masses for the dead, indulgences).
 - Define sacraments as visible signs and pledges that presuppose and require faith rather than confer regeneration ex opere operato.
 - Clarify baptism: defended for infants as covenant sign but denied as inherently efficacious apart from faith.
 - Define the Lord's Supper: deny bodily presence / transubstantiation, argue for a spiritual/real but non-corporeal presence received by faith; insist on communion admission rules and discipline ("fencing the table").
 - Practical prescriptions for urban church governance (magistrate involvement, public order).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Roman Catholic sacramentalism and scholastic formulations; later polemically contrasted with Luther (especially on Eucharist).
 - Draws on Scripture, patristic citations, and Humanist exegetical method rather than medieval canon law.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation / Scripture as norm; ecclesiology (visible church, discipline); sacraments (baptism, eucharist); Christology (presence in Supper); covenantal language used for baptismal theology.

- **Closing line**
 - A concise programmatic formulation of an early Reformed sacramental and ecclesial theology that treats sacraments as covenantal signs requiring faith and disciplined admission, shaping Swiss Protestant identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that sacraments are **signs and pledges** (pignus) of God's promise, emphasizing cognitive and covenantal function over causal, ontological change.
 - Early and systematic articulation of **table-fencing**: sacramental admission tied to visible discipline and communal purity.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects medieval **transubstantiation** and the Mass as a propitiatory sacrifice.
 - Contrasts with Luther: refuses bodily/physical presence or ubiquity theses; frames Christ's presence as spiritual, received by faith rather than by the elements themselves.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses covenantal idiom (sign/pledge) as primary category for sacramental theology, prefiguring later Reformed seals language.
 - Frames pastoral governance in civic-ecclesial terms - the magistrate and council as partners in reform.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Formative for Swiss Reformation and a stepping stone toward Calvinist sacramental praxis, though Calvin refined Zwingli's language and mediation theology.
 - Provoked sustained Lutheran controversy over Eucharistic presence; influenced Anabaptist critiques and Reformed ecclesiastical order.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching the early Reformed method: biblical exegesis driving sacramental reinterpretation, practical ecclesiology, and the nexus of theology and civic reform.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture as sole rule** - Scripture governs doctrine and worship; tradition subordinate.
- **Sacraments: signs and pledges (signa et pignora)** - Visual tokens that confirm God's promise; symptomatic and confirmatory rather than automatically efficacious.
 - Contrast: rejects ex opere operato models.
- **Means of grace (reformed nuance)** - Sacraments are means insofar as they confirm promises and require faith; not mechanical conduits of regeneration.
- **Baptism (infant vs believer)** - Defends infant baptism as covenant sign for children of believers, while denying that baptism alone effects salvation; efficacy presupposes faith and covenant inclusion (see Sixty-Seven Articles, on Baptism).
- **Believer's responsibility** - Faith and repentance remain necessary to receive sacramental benefit; baptism and supper require faith for effect.
- **Lord's Supper - Presence of Christ** - Denies corporeal presence/transubstantiation; affirms a **spiritual** real presence apprehended by faith, not by the elements themselves (see Sixty-Seven Articles, on the Lord's Supper).
- **Fencing the Table / Admission** - Communion limited by discipline and moral/faith qualification; community gatekeeping for purity and order (see Sixty-Seven Articles, on Fencing Communion).
- **Ex opere operato (rejection)** - Explicitly denies that sacraments confer grace automatically apart from faith.
- **Visible church / discipline** - Emphasis on visible marks, public repentance, and censures as ecclesial safeguards.
- **Magistrate-church cooperation** - Civic authorities play a role in enforcing reformed order and oversight.
- **Covenant language** - Baptism as sign of covenantal incorporation, foundation for later Reformed paedobaptist arguments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for early Swiss/Reformed sacramental theology and paedobaptism (baptismal signhood).
- As a **polemic** against medieval sacramentalism and a key source in Eucharistic debates with Lutherans (presence and mode).
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for church discipline, admission to the Lord's Supper, and the pastoral framing of sacraments as covenant signs.
