### TITLE
**By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ** 
Author: Unknown

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Appears within a contemporary Reformed theological milieu attentive to Pauline exegesis and federal (covenantal) theology.
 - Situated amid debates with the New Perspective on Paul and renewed interest in the pactum salutis, sacramental theology, and classical doctrines of imputation.
- **Central thesis**
 - Paul orders salvation in Christ such that **faith is the constitutive means of appropriation**, not experiential "sight" or merit; this ordering clarifies how Christ's obedience (active and passive) functions within the covenantal economy and how original sin is dealt with by imputation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of key Pauline loci (Romans 3-8, Galatians, 2 Corinthians, Ephesians) to show faith as antecedent instrument in soterial sequence.
 - Historical-theological survey: traces Reformed treatments of covenant of works, covenant of grace, and the pactum salutis to recover a consistent federal framework.
 - Systematic synthesis:
 - Defines covenant of works "as to substance" and distinguishes it from legal typology in the Mosaic covenant.
 - Locates the pactum salutis as covenantal decree wherein Christ is appointed federal head; his active and passive obedience are the meritorious fulfillment.
 - Articulates imputation (of Adam's sin and of Christ's righteousness) as the forensic means by which guilt and righteousness are respectively dealt with.
 - Positions sacraments as means of grace that confirm and seal the faith by which believers are united to Christ.
 - Practical-theological implications: pastoral teaching, catechesis, and sacramental practice follow from this order.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformation and post-Reformation federalists (broadly represented by Calvinist sources and Westminster tradition), Paul scholarship, and critics who advance covenantal reinterpretations (including voices aligned with the New Perspective).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works; covenant of grace; pactum salutis), Christology (active and passive obedience; Christ as covenant head), soteriology (justification, union with Christ, ordo salutis), doctrine of sin (original sin and imputation), sacraments as means of grace, revelation and Scripture as normative.
- **Closing line**
 - The work's theological center of gravity: **soterial ordering is covenantal and forensic, anchored in Christ's federal headship and received by faith (not by sight), with sacraments serving to seal that faith in the life of the church.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a strict priority of faith as the instrumental means such that experiential assurance ("sight") never displaces faith as the means of justification and union.
 - Treats the covenant of works "as to substance" in a robust way: not merely pedagogical but substantively shaping the legal expectations answered by Christ.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that conflate covenant membership with works-observance or that make justification primarily corporate-status alteration without forensic imputation.
 - Offers a corrective to sacramental minimalism by restoring sacraments as genuine means, not mere signs, within the ordo salutis.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the pactum salutis discussion to emphasize *ordering* (ordo) rather than merely the decree - i.e., how Christ's active/passive work is placed within covenantal economy relative to faith and sacraments.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary Reformed classrooms and catechetical resources as a clarifying synthesis of Pauline exegesis and classical federal theology.
 - Used polemically against revisionist readings of Paul and ecumenically as a bridge between dogmatic and exegetical scholarship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as an exegetical model that integrates covenantal categories with Pauline soteriology and as a pedagogical template for preaching, catechesis, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **By faith, not by sight** - Thesis phrase: faith is the constitutive instrument of justification and union; sight/experience is subsequent assurance.
- **Union with Christ** - Central relational category: union is the ontological basis for imputation, justification, adoption, sanctification.
- **Justification (forensic)** - Legal declaration based on Christ's righteousness imputed to believers through faith.
- **Imputation**
 - Original sin: Adam's guilt/condemnation imputed to humanity.
 - Righteousness: Christ's active obedience imputed to believers.
- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)** - The substantive legal paradigm that sets the covenantal demand Christ fulfills; not merely typological or rhetorical.
- **Covenant of Grace** - The covenantal arrangement whereby Christ, as federal head, secures salvation for the elect; appropriated by faith and sealed by sacraments.
- **Pactum Salutis / Christ as Covenant Head** - The divine decree covenanting Christ to represent elect humanity; grounds Christ's assignment of active/passive obedience.
- **Christ's active obedience** - His lifelong fulfillment of covenant law meriting righteousness for imputation.
- **Christ's passive obedience** - His suffering and death as satisfaction for sin (penal substitution).
- **Mosaic Covenant** - Treated as typological and instructional; not a rival covenant of salvation but a covenant with specific national and pedagogical functions.
- **Sacraments as means of grace** - Baptism and Lord's Supper function instrumentally to confirm, seal, and strengthen faith, not merely to symbolize.
- **Ordo salutis (order of salvation)** - Reordered as: decree/pactum → Christ's work (active/passive) → imputation/union → reception by faith → justification → sacraments seal → sanctification/assurance.
- **Federal headship** - The legal-ontological role Christ plays as representative of elect humanity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for covenantal categories (covenant of works as to substance; pactum salutis).
- As a **polemic** against New Perspective and sacramental reductionism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline soteriology within a federal framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the integration of Christology (active/passive obedience) with forensic imputation and sacramental practice.
