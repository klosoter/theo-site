### TITLE
**Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith** - Wayne Grudem 
Abridged, church-oriented systematic theology synthesizing evangelical, Reformed, Baptist, and continuationist convictions.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical resurgence (Systematic Theology 1994; Bible Doctrine 1999; updated editions thereafter).
 - Aimed at church use, small groups, college intro courses; mediates academic theology to lay readers.
 - Milieu: inerrantist, conservative Protestantism; Baptist and broadly Reformed soteriology; continuationist pneumatology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is clear, sufficient, and authoritative for all doctrine and life; systematic theology should be biblically grounded, logically ordered, pastorally applied.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Method: define doctrine - survey Scripture - respond to objections - apply practically.
 - Loci: Word of God, God and his attributes, Trinity, creation and providence, humanity and sin, Christ and atonement, Holy Spirit and sanctification, church and ordinances, last things.
 - Emphasis on clarity, key texts, charts, and discussion questions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Turretin, Hodge, Warfield, Berkhof, Erickson; engages modern debates (Barth, Pentecostal/charismatic theology, egalitarianism).
 - Leans on historical confessional insights without binding to any one confession.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (inerrancy, clarity, sufficiency), theology proper (immutability, simplicity, omniscience), Trinity, creation and providence, anthropology (image of God; dichotomy), hamartiology, Christology, soteriology (calling, regeneration, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance), ecclesiology (office, discipline, ordinances), eschatology (millennial views, new creation).

- **Representative positions (per site topics)**
 - Days Of Creation: favors 24-hour days as most straightforward reading while allowing evangelical latitude; rejects naturalistic evolution.
 - Baptism Of The Holy Spirit: Spirit-baptism occurs at conversion; subsequent fillings and empowerments are ongoing, tongues not required.
 - Spiritual Gifts And Sanctification: continuationist; all gifts may continue; sanctification is definitive and progressive, not eradicationist.
 - Trichotomy vs Dichotomy: argues for dichotomy (body and soul/spirit) on biblical usage; warns against speculative trichotomies.
 - Common Grace And Preparatory Grace: affirms common grace restrains sin and bestows goods; denies universal prevenient grace that enables saving faith, yet allows that common grace can prepare providentially.

- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: the clear, sufficient Word of God forms the church in sound doctrine ordered to worship, holiness, and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Scripture-first pedagogy: heavy exegetical citation, definitions, and practical applications.
 - Continuationist yet cautious: distinguishes NT congregational prophecy (fallible, non-canonical) from Scripture-level revelation; advocates testing of gifts.
 - Baptist and believer-oriented ecclesiology: local church, ordinances as symbolic means of grace.
 - Accessible systematics: identical outline to the larger Systematic Theology with condensed argumentation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Pentecostal second-blessing theology: locates baptism in the Spirit at conversion; affirms post-conversion fillings.
 - Against strict cessationism: argues for ongoing gifts while rejecting canon-level prophecy.
 - Against day-age or framework exclusivism: 24-hour reading preferred but charitable to old-earth creationists committed to inerrancy.
 - Against trichotomy: stresses scriptural interchangeability of soul/spirit.
 - Against Arminian prevenient grace: distinguishes common grace from effectual calling.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies categories: baptism vs filling of the Spirit; prophecy vs Scripture; definitive vs progressive sanctification.
 - Popularizes continuationist exegesis within conservative, inerrantist circles.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in evangelical churches, colleges, and seminaries as a teaching text.
 - Critiqued by confessional Reformed for light confessional anchoring; by egalitarians for gender-role conclusions; by classical Pentecostals for Spirit-baptism view; by hard cessationists for openness to gifts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable entry point to evangelical doctrine; usable outlines, clear definitions, balanced tone, and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy**: Scripture in the original writings is without error in all it affirms.
- **Clarity (Perspicuity) of Scripture**: the Bible is understandable in its main teachings to ordinary believers using ordinary means.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture**: all we need for salvation and godliness is found in Scripture.
- **Creation ex nihilo**: God created all things from nothing; providence preserves, concurs, and governs.
- **Days of Creation**: six-day structure, 24-hour day preferred; rejects unguided evolution.
- **Common Grace**: non-saving divine favor to all, restraining sin and granting goods; preparatory but not salvifically enabling.
 - Contrast: **Effectual Calling** grants the ability to respond savingly.
- **Dichotomy**: humans as body and soul/spirit; opposes trichotomy as biblically unpersuasive.
- **Original Sin**: inherited corruption and guilt from Adam.
- **Justification**: legal declaration of righteousness by faith alone through imputed righteousness of Christ.
- **Sanctification**: definitive break with sin and progressive growth; no entire sanctification in this life.
- **Baptism in the Holy Spirit**: initiatory work at conversion; subsequent fillings empower for service.
- **Spiritual Gifts**: charismata for edification; prophecy, tongues, healing may continue, tested by Scripture.
- **Church Ordinances**: baptism and the Lord's Supper as commands of Christ, signs of the gospel.
- **Complementarianism**: equal dignity, distinct roles in home and church.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definition source for evangelical doctrine across loci with clear, teachable summaries.
 - As a polemic reference on Spirit-baptism, spiritual gifts, and anthropological dichotomy.
 - As an exegetical model for handling contested texts (e.g., creation days, gift texts) with pastoral application.
 - As a conceptual pivot distinguishing common grace from effectual calling in soteriology.
