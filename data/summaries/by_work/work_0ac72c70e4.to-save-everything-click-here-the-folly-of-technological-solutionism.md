### TITLE
To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism - Evgeny Morozov

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2013 amid growing public debate about big data, algorithmic governance, and Silicon Valley's cultural ascendancy.
 - Situated against the backdrop of post-2008 financial crisis politics, rapid growth of social platforms, and rhetoric of disruption as social cure.
 - Interdisciplinary audience: technology criticism, media studies, political theory; quickly adopted by ethicists and public theologians.

- **Central thesis**
 - **"Solutionism"** - the belief that every social problem has a technological fix - is intellectually shallow and politically dangerous; it privatizes politics, obscures moral trade-offs, and substitutes metrics for democratic deliberation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: identifies the rise of a techno-utopian mindset among engineers, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists who view complex social issues as engineering problems.
 - Case studies: education, charity, civic engagement, health, and criminal justice used to show how tech "fixes" bypass institutional and political solutions.
 - Critique of epistemology: algorithms and metrics often misrecognize value-laden judgments as objective problems to be optimized.
 - Political consequences: solutionism leads to depoliticization (shifts choices from public debate to private platforms), reinforces neoliberal governance, and centralizes power in opaque corporations.
 - Normative proposal: calls for politicization, democratic debate, institutional humility, and attention to unintended consequences rather than techno-salvation narratives.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Directly critiques Silicon Valley thinkers and practices rather than canonical philosophers. Engages with engineers, venture philanthropists, and prominent tech companies (implicitly and explicitly).
 - Interlocutors include contemporary tech journalists and commentators who celebrate "disruption" and measurable optimization.
 - Draws on social science literature, journalism, and historical examples of failed technocratic reforms.

- **Doctrines / theological motifs treated**
 - Not explicitly theological but engages themes resonant with theology:
 - **Soteriology / Salvific rhetoric**: "to save everything" as secular eschatology of tech.
 - **Anthropology**: conception of human agency reduced to data points and behavior to be engineered.
 - **Ethics and political theology**: questions about authority, common good, and democratic deliberation.
 - **Providence vs. control**: illusion of human mastery over social life through technology.

- **Closing line**
 - Solutionism functions as a secular pseudo-soteriology: promising technocratic salvation while eroding the political structures and moral deliberations necessary for genuine human flourishing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats tech enthusiasm as an ideological and epistemic problem, not merely a set of design or privacy issues.
 - Emphasizes **political displacement**: solutions that look like technical efficiency often remove issues from democratic contestation.
 - Focuses on the moral and institutional blind spots created by reliance on metrics and optimization.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with techno-optimists who claim innovation is inherently emancipatory; distinguishes between useful tools and ideological "fixes."
 - Pushes back on both libertarian "move fast" rhetoric and naïve progressive techno-solutionism that overlooks power asymmetries.
 - Corrects technocratic narratives by insisting social problems resist purely technical framing.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and clarified the term **"solutionism"** as a critique of technological rationality applied to social life.
 - Clarifies distinctions between **technical problems** (well-defined, solvable by engineering) and **political problems** (value-laden, requiring public deliberation).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in media studies, digital ethics, and political theory as a foundational critique of Silicon Valley ideology.
 - Adopted by some theologians and ethicists as a metaphor for secular soteriologies and as a cautionary resource in political theology.
 - Influenced debates on algorithmic governance, data-driven philanthropy, and civic tech projects.

- **Enduring value**
 - Vital for courses and research on political theology of technology, ecclesial responses to digital culture, and ethics of algorithmic decision-making.
 - Serves as a durable critique that reframes technological enthusiasm as a problem of values and civic formation rather than merely design.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Solutionism**
 - The central term: the presumption that social ills are primarily technical puzzles solvable by design and data.
- **Technocratic paternalism**
 - The transfer of decision-making from publics/institutions to experts, platforms, or algorithms.
- **Privatization of politics**
 - Shifting governance and moral decisions into private corporate solutions, reducing public accountability.
- **Metrics fetish / metric fixation**
 - Overreliance on quantifiable indicators as if they captured full moral and social value.
- **Algorithmic governance**
 - Use of automated systems to make or mediate public decisions, often opaque and unaccountable.
- **Depoliticization**
 - The process by which matters of justice and distribution are rendered technical and removed from democratic contest.
- **Techno-soteriology**
 - Secular promise that technology will "save" or perfect society; Morozov treats it as a quasi-religious rhetoric.
- **Experimentalism vs deliberation**
 - The preference for rapid experiments and pilots over slow, inclusive political deliberation.
- **Instrumental reason**
 - Treating means and ends as separable and reducible to optimization, ignoring intrinsic goods and values.
- **Social engineering**
 - Deliberate design of social arrangements via technological interventions, often with blind spots and harms.
- **Epistemic humility**
 - Recommended corrective: recognition of limits to what algorithms and technocrats can know or decide.
- **Scale fallacy**
 - Belief that solutions that work at small scale can be trivially scaled without political or ethical consequences.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "solutionism" and a taxonomy of tech-driven pitfalls.
- As a **polemic** in political theology and ethics against secular salvation narratives centered on technology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesial and civic discussions: to insist on public deliberation, moral discernment, and institutional reform prior to technological deployment.
