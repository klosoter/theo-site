### TITLE
The Trinity in Karl Barth and Karl Rahner - Robert W. Jenson (Theological Investigations, 1965)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-20th century theological reconstruction: post-war neo‑orthodoxy (Barth) and Catholic ressourcement/transcendental Thomism (Rahner).
 - Published amid intense ecumenical and doctrinal debates (pre‑ and post‑Vatican II) about method, revelation, and the relation of God's economy to God's being.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jenson reads Barth and Rahner as offering two rival responses to the same problem: how to maintain classical Trinitarian doctrine in light of modern criticism. He contends that Barth reformulates the doctrine around revelation and the Word, while Rahner attempts a transcendental re‑grounding (his "rule"), and that these moves produce divergent accounts of the immanent/economic Trinity relation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Statement of each theologian's starting point:
 - Barth: Scripture and the event of God's self‑revelation in Christ as decisive for doctrine.
 - Rahner: Transcendental-phenomenological method that seeks an a priori structure making Christian revelation intelligible to contemporary consciousness (Jenson labels this schema "Rahner's rule").
 - Analysis of implications for the immanent/economic Trinity relation:
 - Barth places priority on the economic Trinity; the immanent is knowable only in God's self‑act.
 - Rahner insists on a principled identity between immanent and economic reality, justified by his transcendental argument.
 - Assessment of theological costs and gains:
 - Barth's Christocentrism secures revelation but risks nominalism about divine being.
 - Rahner secures metaphysical continuity but risks anthropocentrism or rationalizing revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Karl Barth, Karl Rahner.
 - Secondary: classical Trinitarian tradition (Nicene formulations), Thomistic categories (analogia entis), Barthian dogmatics and Rahner's transcendental theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic vs. immanent), revelation and Word, Christology, doctrine of God, analogy of being, grace and human knowing.
- **Closing line**
 - Jenson's theological center: the Trinity must be understood in a way that preserves both the primacy of God's self‑disclosure in Christ and a robust, non‑reductive account of divine being - a tension differently handled, and differently compromised, by Barth and Rahner.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Jenson highlights method as decisive: doctrinal outcomes follow from whether one begins with God's revealed act (Barth) or with a priori conditions of human knowing (Rahner).
 - He frames Rahner's methodological move as a "rule" that domesticates revelation into a philosophical horizon.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts Barth's insistence that theological claims are accountable to the biblical event with Rahner's tendency to make doctrine intelligible on philosophical grounds.
 - Argues Barth rehabilitates the primacy of revelation at the cost of speculative metaphysics; Rahner preserves metaphysical coherence at the cost of letting human subjectivity shape doctrine.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of "Rahner's rule" as shorthand for the transcendental strategy that equates immanent and economic reality via anthropological preconditions.
 - Emphasis on the methodological "move" as the key to comprehension of each theologian's Trinitarian outcome.
- **Reception and influence**
 - The essay became a touchstone for later Trinitarian retrievals: it sharpened ecumenical awareness of method and helped orient subsequent constructive Trinitarian theologies toward bridging revelation and metaphysical account.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a concise taxonomy of two mid‑century options for doing Trinitarian theology; stimulates careful reflection about starting points and their doctrinal consequences.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed and acting in history (Barth's priority); the locus of theological knowledge of God.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God as God in Godself; for Rahner the immanent must be continuous with the economic by his methodological "rule."
- **Rahner's rule**
 - Jenson's label for Rahner's transcendental method: doctrinal claims must be justified by structures of human experience/knowledge, producing identity between economic and immanent claims.
- **Revelation as event**
 - Barth's category: God's self‑disclosure in Christ is decisive and normative for doctrine.
- **Transcendental Thomism / transcendental method**
 - Rahner's retrieval of Thomistic metaphysics through a Kantian/transcendental frame to secure theological claims.
- **Analogia entis**
 - Classical analogical account of language about God; Rahner's approach reinterprets it via transcendental conditions, Barth is critical of its unaided speculative use.
- **Christocentrism**
 - Barth's organizing principle: all doctrine, including Trinity, is governed by Christology.
- **Anthropological preconditions**
 - Rahner's emphasis on human openness to the divine as a grounding for knowledge of God.
- **Perichoresis / relationality**
 - Trinitarian intra‑divine relations; assessed differently according to method (evental-relational for Barth; metaphysical-relational for Rahner).
- **Word (Verbum)**
 - Barthian category centering God's speech/act in history as foundational.
- **Immanence/economy identity debate**
 - Central controversy over whether and how the economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity.
- **Method as determinant**
 - Jenson's recurring point: method (revelation‑first vs. transcendental‑first) determines doctrinal shape.

How this work is used:
- As a **diagnostic schema** for contrasting approaches to Trinitarian doctrine (method → dogmatic outcome).
- As a **polemic and hermeneutical resource** in debates over revelation vs. philosophical theology.
- As a **model for ecumenical engagement**, clarifying where Protestant and Catholic mid‑century theologies most deeply diverge.
