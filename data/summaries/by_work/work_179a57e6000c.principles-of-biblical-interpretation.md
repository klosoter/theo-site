### TITLE
Principles of Biblical Interpretation - Louis Berkhof

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 20th century (Berkhof, Dutch Reformed milieu; used widely in conservative Reformed seminaries).
 - Reaction to both late‑19th/early‑20th century higher‑critical and overly allegorical methods; seeks a sober, confessional hermeneutic grounded in Reformed theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Hermeneutics must secure the objective meaning of Scripture by disciplined rules that respect grammar, history, canonical unity and Christian doctrine - especially the centrality of Christ and the law/gospel distinction.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lays out first principles (inspiration, sufficiency, unity of Scripture) that constrain interpretation.
 - Proposes methodical canons: grammatical‑historical exegesis as primary; yet always read in the light of progressive revelation and the analogy of faith (Scripture interprets Scripture).
 - Treats special problems: prophecy, types and typical interpretation, parables, paronomasia, and figurative language.
 - Applies principles to vexed matters such as the **Law-Gospel** relation: distinguishes moral, ceremonial, and civil law; affirms fulfillment of ceremonial law in Christ while maintaining enduring normative force of the moral law.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Calvin, Reformed orthodoxy, and systematic theologians; counters higher criticism and theological liberalism.
 - Engages biblical genre scholars in a pre‑modern critical vocabulary (typology vs. allegory, literal vs. figurative sense).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration, canonicity, typology, covenantal reading of Scripture, Christology as hermeneutical center, and the law (moral/ceremonial/civil).
- **Closing line**
 - Berkhof advances a disciplined, confessional hermeneutic: read Scripture historically and grammatically, yet always Christocentrically and within the unity and progressive revelation of the canon.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm insistence on a balanced hermeneutic: literal (grammatical‑historical) without divorcing theology; typology and progressive revelation are legitimate but controlled.
 - Explicit integration of hermeneutics with Reformed doctrinal commitments (covenant, law/gospel, Christ as key to interpretation).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushback against two extremes:
 - Against liberal historical criticism that fragments the canon and divorces text from doctrine.
 - Against loose allegorizing that neglects authorial intent and historical sense.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic presentation of interpretive canons in a compact, pedagogical form oriented to confessional exegesis rather than purely historical‑critical categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a staple introductory hermeneutics text in Reformed seminaries; frequently cited for clear, pastoral rules for preachers and teachers.
 - Influenced mid‑20th century Reformed approaches to law/gospel and typological reading.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for pastorally oriented exegesis: clear rules, attention to Christological reading, and practical handling of law vs. gospel issues.
 - Limitations: not exhaustive in modern linguistic, literary‑critical, or socio‑historical methodologies; nonetheless foundational for confessional readers.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration / Verbal‑Plenary** - Scripture's divine origin that grounds objective meaning.
- **Literal sense** - The normal grammatical‑historical meaning; Berkhof defends a broad "literal" that allows figures where warranted.
- **Grammatical‑historical method** - Primary exegetical method; seeks authorial intent via grammar and historical context.
- **Analogy of faith** - Canonical coherence principle: interpret difficult passages by clearer doctrines elsewhere (Scripture interprets Scripture).
- **Progressive revelation** - Later revelation develops and fulfills earlier revelation; Christ fulfills the types and ceremonial law.
- **Typology** - Legitimate, controlled typological reading (persons/events/shadows prefigure Christ); distinct from arbitrary allegory.
- **Law (moral/ceremonial/civil)** 
 - Moral law: abiding normative standard (reflects God's character). 
 - Ceremonial law: typological, fulfilled in Christ. 
 - Civil law: contextual to Israel's covenant structure.
- **Law-Gospel distinction** - Critical hermeneutical category: law condemns and defines sin; gospel proclaims Christ's fulfillment and grace. Berkhof insists on distinguishing functions while maintaining unity.
- **Christocentric interpretation** - Christ as hermeneutical center; Old Testament must be read in view of fulfillment in Christ.
- **Canonicity / Unity of Scripture** - The canon's unity is a hermeneutical principle that restrains fragmentary readings.
- **Historical criticism (higher criticism)** - Treated cautiously and critically; Berkhof accepts certain historical considerations but rejects reductive assumptions that deny inspiration.
- **Parable / Prophecy rules** - Specialized canons: parables interpreted by their narrative context and canonical corroboration; prophetic language may be typical or predictive depending on context.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - Interpretive task presumes Scripture is adequate for doctrine and practice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for confessional hermeneutical canons (seminary texts and syllabi).
- As a **polemic** against liberal/excessive historical‑critical fragmentation.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching and theological exposition, especially in handling typology and the Law-Gospel relationship.
