### TITLE
The Nonviolent Atonement - J. Denny Weaver

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid renewed biblical-theological interest in the cross, influenced by peace church scholarship and postliberal critiques of classical atonement formulations.
 - Engages contemporary debates over **penal substitution** and the moral implications of depicting God as violent; dialogues with René Girard, Walter Wink, Jürgen Moltmann, and New Testament scholarship.

- **Central thesis**
 - The atonement must be understood as **God's nonviolent self-revelation in Christ**: Jesus heals and transforms human systems of violence by nonviolent identification, confrontation, and redemptive suffering rather than by inflicting divine retributive violence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Traditional violent metaphors and penal models implicitly portray God as a violent deity who requires violent satisfaction.
 - Exegesis: Careful reading of Gospel narratives, Pauline texts, and Old Testament sacrificial imagery shows the cross functioning as revelation of divine vulnerability and nonviolence.
 - Theological reconstruction:
 - Recovers **substitution** as representative, relational, and nonviolent - Jesus participates in human suffering and absorbs violence without reciprocating it.
 - Frames atonement in terms of **restoration and transformation** of relationships and social orders rather than juridical appeasement.
 - Ethical implication: Christ's nonviolent praxis inaugurates a way of life for the church oriented toward peacemaking and opposition to all forms of systemic violence.

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engages classical atonement models (Anselm, Calvin), modern defenders of penal substitution, and proponents of Christus Victor and moral influence models.
 - Dialogues with Girardian scapegoat theory and interpreters emphasizing Jesus' nonviolent resistance (e.g., Walter Wink).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: centrality of incarnational, nonviolent action of Jesus.
 - **Soteriology / Atonement**: reconstructs substitution, reconciliation, and redemption categories on nonviolent grounds.
 - **Ethics**: links atonement doctrine to Christian nonviolence and social transformation.
 - **Divine character**: argues for coherence between revelation (cross) and God's nonviolent nature.

- **Closing line**
 - The cross is best read not as divine retaliation but as the decisive disclosure of God's refusal to meet violence with violence and as the means by which God heals and transforms violent human orders.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes explicit the ethical and incarnational consequences of atonement doctrine: theology must not affirm divine violence.
 - Reframes substitution as **representative solidarity** that absorbs but does not inflict violence.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct critique of **penal substitution**: argues it morally compromises God and perpetuates cycles of violence.
 - Moves beyond simplistic dichotomies (penal vs. Christus Victor) by offering a synthesis: Christus Victor informed by nonviolence and representational substitution.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Terms and moves: "nonviolent atonement" as an integrative category, emphasis on **cross-as-revelation** (ethical and theological), and use of **restorative language** for reconciliation.
 - Reappropriates sacrificial language to mean transformative identification rather than divine appeasement.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in peace church, liberationist, and progressive evangelical circles; welcomed by scholars attentive to ethics and pastoral care.
 - Criticized by defenders of classical penal schemes for perceived undermining of divine justice and forensic aspects of justification.
 - Stimulated further work linking atonement theology to nonviolence studies and Girardian readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to readings of God as violent; fruitful for ethical teaching, pastoral theology, and contemporary hermeneutics.
 - Serves as a constructive alternative within systematic theology that insists on consistency between Christology, soteriology, and social ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Nonviolent atonement**: central phrase-atonement conceived as healing and transformation through Christ's nonviolent action.
- **Representative substitution**: substitution understood as identification and solidarity, not penal infliction.
- **Penal substitution**: targeted and critiqued model; seen as inconsistent with the cross's revelation of God's nonviolence.
- **Christus Victor (reinterpreted)**: victory over powers achieved through nonviolent exposure and defeat of violence, not by divine violence.
- **Mimetic theory / Girard**: used to explain scapegoating dynamics and how Christ breaks cycles of sacrificial violence.
- **Cross as revelation**: the crucifixion discloses God's character and method-nonviolent self-giving.
- **Restorative justice**: emphasis on repair of relationships and communities rather than retributive punishment.
- **Divine violence (critique)**: critique of theological language portraying God as violent judge.
- **Sacrifice (reframed)**: sacrificial language read as solidarity and consecration, not propitiatory payment.
- **Reconciliation (relational)**: restored communion anchored in nonviolent transformation.
- **Justification (implications)**: legal categories problematized; justification reframed in relational and eschatological terms.
- **Ethics of nonviolence**: practical outworking of the theology in ecclesial life and social witness.
- **Cross-centered hermeneutic**: method that reads Scripture through the interpretive lens of Jesus' nonviolent action.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for nonviolent readings of atonement and substitution.
 - As a **polemic** against penal substitution and the portrayal of divine retributive violence.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Gospel and Pauline studies emphasizing vulnerability, solidarity, and restoration.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics and peace theology linking doctrine to nonviolent praxis.
