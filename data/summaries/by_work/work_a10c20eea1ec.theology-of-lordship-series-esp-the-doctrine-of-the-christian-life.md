### TITLE
Theology of Lordship series - Vern Poythress (especially The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed / evangelical scholarship (late 20th - early 21st century). Written from a confessional, presuppositional vantage that integrates biblical-theological, apologetic, and pastoral concerns.
 - Moves against individualistic, antinomian, and purely ethics-centered accounts of Christian life; addresses seminary and pastoral audiences.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian life must be understood under the comprehensive **lordship of Christ**: doctrine (what God is and has done) and life (how we live) are inseparable. Theology of life is not add-on ethics but participation in Christ's reign via covenantal means.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture presents salvation as union with Christ; union grounds identity, justification, sanctification, and vocation.
 - The Christian life is mediated and sustained by **means of grace** (Word, sacraments, prayer) under the Spirit's work - not merely moral effort.
 - Epistemologically and theologically, one must reject autonomous natural theology (analogia entis) and affirm a Christ-centered analogia fidei: doctrine must be articulated in light of revealed faith.
 - Pneumatology focused on **regeneration and indwelling**: Spirit unites believers to Christ and empowers progressive conformity to his lordship.
 - Ethic and life follow from covenantal status: obligations and gifts flow from being in Christ rather than from mere moralism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed tradition (Calvin, Westminster tradition), Van Tilian presuppositionalism, contemporary Reformed writers; critiques medieval analogia entis and modern liberal moralism.
 - Dialogues with pastors and seminary curriculum concerns - draws on biblical exegesis more than speculative metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics); Christology (lordship, union with Christ); Trinity and Spirit (regeneration, indwelling); covenant and justification; sanctification, means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer); ethics and ecclesiology.

- **Site usages cited in these notes**
 - **Union with Christ** - as the ontological ground for Christian life and participation.
 - **Analogia entis vs analogia fidei** - Poythress favors analogia fidei and critiques analogia entis for importing autonomous human reason.
 - **Means of Grace: preaching, sacraments, prayer** - developed as the ordinary channels of Christ's lordship in believers' lives.
 - **Regeneration and indwelling** - Spirit's active uniting and sustaining role in sanctification.

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers theology of life on union with and submission to Christ's lordship, mediated by the Spirit through covenantal means, arguing that right doctrine and right life are two sides of one biblically grounded reality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Firm insistence that **lordship is the integrative principle**: soteriology, sanctification, and ethics cohere only if Christ's reign structures thought and action.
 - Combines rigorous doctrinal exposition with pastoral application - doctrine as formative for life.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic privatism and moralistic therapeutic deism by re-centering communal, covenantal means.
 - Opposes analogia entis (natural theology that grounds God in creaturely analogy) and champions analogia fidei (knowledge of God mediated by revelation in Christ).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on **lordship as a theological category** rather than merely an ethical demand.
 - Uses multiperspectival/tripersonal emphasis (creaturely, covenantal, redemptive perspectives) to structure doctrine and practice.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed seminary contexts and by pastors seeking integrated doctrine-ethic models.
 - Influential among those sympathetic to presuppositional apologetics and covenantal, Christocentric theology; less engagement from mainline or liberal circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how doctrine shapes discipleship; supplies a rigorous framework for preaching, pastoral care, and sacramental theology that resists reductionist ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lordship of Christ** - central organizing principle; Christ's reign defines identity and duty.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological basis for justification, sanctification, and vocation; believer's life is participation in Christ's life.
- **Analogia fidei** - theological epistemic rule: interpretation and analogies must arise from revealed faith in Christ, not from autonomous creaturely analogy.
 - Contrasted with **analogia entis** (rejected): secular or natural theology analogies that place creature-to-God correspondence prior to revelation.
- **Means of grace** - Word, sacraments, prayer as ordinary instruments by which Christ governs and nourishes his people.
 - Preaching - primary public proclamation that effects conversion and growth.
 - Sacraments - signs and seals that confirm promises and effect union.
 - Prayer - both individual and corporate participation in Christ's lordship.
- **Regeneration** - Spirit's sovereign work initiating new life; not merely moral reform.
- **Indwelling (of the Spirit)** - continuous presence that sustains union and sanctification.
- **Covenant** - relational and legal framework for obligations, blessings, and ecclesial life.
- **Sanctification** - progressive conformity to Christ rooted in union and enabled by Spirit and means.
- **Revelation / Scripture** - authoritative rule; hermeneutic governed by analogia fidei.
- **Ethic as participation** - moral life flows from status in Christ rather than abstract rules.
- **Multiperspectivalism / triperspectival angle** - use of complementary theological perspectives to avoid reductionism.
- **Kingdom / reign** - practical outworking of lordship in communal and social life.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology to connect soteriology, sanctification, and ecclesiology under Christ's lordship.
 - As a **pastoral/exegetical model** for preaching and sacraments: grounds means of grace in union with Christ and Spirit-work.
 - As a **polemic resource** against analogia entis and moralistic/individualistic accounts of Christian life.
