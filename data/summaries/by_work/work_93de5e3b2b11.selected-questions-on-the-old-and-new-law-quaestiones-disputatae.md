### TITLE
Selected Questions on the Old and New Law (Quaestiones Disputatae) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in the high medieval scholastic period (13th century) as part of Aquinas's Quaestiones Disputatae corpus; addressed to a university/monastic audience engaged in disputation and pastoral theology.
 - Situated within Dominican scholasticism, integrating patristic exegesis, canon law sensibilities, and Aristotelian-Augustinian frameworks.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To determine the nature, end, and mutual relation of the Old Law (lex veteris) and the New Law (lex nova) - what the Old Law could effect, what the New Law perfects, and how grace, merit, and covenantal continuity operate.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: distinguishes kinds of law (eternal, natural, human, divine/positive) and isolates what the Mosaic law intended (political order, moral formation, sacramental pedagogy).
 - Remedial: shows the New Law as fulfillment - it perfects moral precepts by ordering to charity and supplies sanctifying grace beyond the Old's capacity.
 - Teleological: traces law to final end (beatitude) and locates eschatological fulfillment in the resurrection and final reward.
 - Soteriological implications: treatment of original sin, concupiscence, and the necessity of grace for supernatural ends.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture (esp. Pauline arguments about law and grace), Augustine (chief patristic interlocutor), Justinianic and canonical notions of covenant/law, Aristotelian causal and teleological categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant (Old vs New), grace and merit, original sin and its effects, law typology (moral, ceremonial, judicial), eschatology (individual and cosmic aspects), ecclesiology in relation to Israel.

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers the New Law as the gracious fulfillment of the Old: law ordered to charity and the supernatural end, making covenantal continuity intelligible while preserving the radical novelty of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between the moral content of law as accessible to reason (natural law) and the New Law's orientation toward infused virtues and charity; law is not abolished but perfected in love.
 - Emphasizes pedagogical role of the Old Law (praeparatio) - a formative discipline leading to the fuller grace in Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Clarifies Augustine's stress on grace by preserving a stronger role for reason and natural law than some Augustinian readings that collapse law into mere prohibition.
 - Counters both Judaizing readings that reduce the New Law to continuity without transformation and radical antinomian readings that deny any normative residue of the Old.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise taxonomy of laws (eternal, natural, human, and divine positive) used as a hermeneutical key throughout later scholastic theology.
 - Use of pedagogical/penal categories to explain rites and sanctions of Mosaic law as provisional, disciplinary, and anticipatory.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in Catholic moral theology and sacramental theology; provided a scholastic template for later Thomistic commentaries on law and grace.
 - Reformed theologians engaged selectively: affirmed Thomistic insights on natural law and covenantal continuity but often rejected his sacramental and ecclesiological conclusions about the Church and the New Law's institutional mediation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a balanced model for distinguishing continuity and discontinuity between covenants, useful for contemporary ecumenical and covenantal debates.
 - Remains a compact manual for linking moral theology, exegesis of Pauline texts, and eschatological teleology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Law** - God's providential reason ordering all things; the first principle from which other laws derive.
- **Natural Law** - Participation of rational creatures in eternal law; moral precepts accessible to reason.
- **Divine/Positive Law** - Laws given by God (Mosaic/evangelical) as particular prescriptions beyond natural precepts.
- **Old Law (Lex Veteris)** - Mosaic covenant with ceremonial, judicial, and moral elements; pedagogical and disciplinary.
 - Ceremonial = types and figures pointing to Christ.
 - Judicial = civil order for Israel as a polity.
- **New Law (Lex Nova)** - Fulfillment in Christ given principally as grace and charity; perfects the moral order by infusing virtues.
- **Grace / Sanctifying Grace** - Supernatural gift enabling the soul for beatitude; central to the efficacy of the New Law.
- **Merit** - Participation in Christ's redeeming work by which human acts, aided by grace, can possess moral worth and reward.
- **Original Sin** - Loss of original justice and inclinations toward disorder (concupiscence); necessitates grace for restoration.
- **Concupiscence** - Disordered appetite remaining after baptism; distinguishes inclination from culpable sin.
- **Covenant** - Binding relationship involving law and promise; Aquinas reads Mosaic and evangelical covenants in continuity with telos.
- **Typology / Figure** - Old Testament rites and persons as prefigurations fulfilled in Christ.
- **Eschatological Fulfillment** - Beatific end and resurrection; the telos that makes law intelligible.
- **Israel and the Church** - Aquinas sees a providential plan: temporary hardening and eventual restoration (reading consonant with Romans 11).
- **Pedagogical / Disciplinary Role** - Old Law's function to lead to readiness for grace.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Thomistic categories of law (eternal/natural/positive).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts on law and grace (e.g., Romans).
 - As a **polemic tool** in debates over continuity vs discontinuity between covenants.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in moral theology linking virtue ethics, sacramental theology, and eschatology.
