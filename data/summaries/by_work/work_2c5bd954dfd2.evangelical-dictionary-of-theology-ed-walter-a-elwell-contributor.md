### TITLE
Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (ed. Walter A. Elwell), entry "Trichotomy" / "Dichotomy" - Wayne Grudem (contributor)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical theological milieu (Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, 1984; used widely in conservative Protestant seminaries).
 - Responds to longstanding Christian-anthropology debate within biblical-theological and philosophical frameworks against both Platonic tripartite models and reductionist materialism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Whether the Bible teaches a **dichotomous** anthropology (body + immaterial "soul/spirit" as essentially one) or a **trichotomous** anthropology (body, soul, spirit as three distinct aspects/functions).
 - Grudem's entry argues that Scripture frequently distinguishes **soul** and **spirit** in form and function, making a trichotomous reading biblically defensible and theologically useful, while avoiding Platonic dualism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lexical and exegetical survey
 - Reviews Hebrew (nephesh, ruach) and Greek (psyche, pneuma) terminologies and their scriptural distributions.
 - Examines key texts often appealed to by both sides: 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Hebrews 4:12, Genesis usage, Paul's anthropology in Romans and Corinthians.
 - Functional distinction
 - Argues that certain passages treat soul and spirit as distinguishable functions (e.g., conscience, affections, moral response often tied to "spirit"; personal identity and life functions often tied to "soul").
 - Theological precautions
 - Rejects an overly Platonic reading that posits three independently subsisting entities; affirms unity of the person (psychosomatic unity) while maintaining functional distinctions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural witnesses (Pauline corpus, Hebrews, Genesis), occasional patristic references (some Church Fathers favored trichotomy), and modern evangelical interlocutors arguing both sides (conservative systematicians who defend dichotomy and proponents of trichotomy).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropological locus (nature of human person), implications for **pneumatology** (work of the Holy Spirit in human spirit), **eschatology** and the intermediate state (what persists after death), and soteriology (regeneration and renewal of spirit/soul).
- **Closing line**
 - Grudem locates the theological center of gravity in a **biblically rooted trichotomy that affirms human unity while distinguishing soul and spirit functionally**, providing a measured corrective to both Platonic tripartition and crude materialistic reductionism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful lexical-historical analysis that prioritizes the biblical usage of psyche/psyche and pneuma/ruach rather than imposing a priori philosophical categories.
 - Balanced posture: affirms distinction without endorsing an ontology of three wholly separable substances.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects simplistic dichotomous summaries that collapse all noncorporeal reality into an undifferentiated "soul."
 - Pushes back on classical Platonic trichotomy by refusing to import Greek metaphysics wholesale into biblical anthropology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinguishes **functional trichotomy** (roles/experiences labelled "soul" or "spirit") from **ontological trichotomy** (three independent substances) - endorses the former, rejects the latter.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking a middle path: adopted by some pastors and teachers to explain experiential theology (prayer, conscience, sanctification).
 - Sparked ongoing debate with systematicians who prefer dichotomy (arguing unity of immaterial aspect) and with those emphasizing psychosomatic unity without technical trichotomy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, sober primer for students and pastors: useful for exegesis of contested texts, for clarifying pneumatological teaching, and for avoiding both Platonic excess and reductionist secularism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dichotomy**
 - Human makeup as **body + immaterial principle** (soul/spirit as one entity); often the default in classical Protestantism.
- **Trichotomy**
 - Human makeup as **body, soul, spirit** - distinct functions or aspects discerned in Scripture.
- **Psyche / Nephesh (soul)**
 - Biblically tied to life, personality, appetite, and personal identity; often the seat of emotion and will.
- **Pneuma / Ruach (spirit)**
 - Associated with communion with God, conscience, and spiritual perception; locus of regeneration and spiritual vitality.
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - The theological insistence on the unity of personhood despite distinctions of faculties.
- **1 Thessalonians 5:23**
 - Key text invoking "spirit, soul, and body" as a primary proof-text for trichotomy.
- **Hebrews 4:12**
 - "Soul and spirit" distinction used as exegetical evidence of distinction in function.
- **Ontological vs. functional distinction**
 - Ontological: separate substances; Functional: distinct roles/terminology within one person.
- **Intermediate state**
 - Discussions of what persists after death hinge on whether soul and spirit are distinct and how they relate to bodily resurrection.
- **Anti-Platonic caution**
 - Repeated warning against adopting Hellenistic metaphysical assumptions.
- **Regeneration language**
 - Uses trichotomy to nuance statements about the Holy Spirit "renewing the spirit" vs "saving the soul."
- **Exegetical model**
 - Grudem's entry functions primarily as an **exegetical model** for reading key texts that differentiate soul and spirit.
- **Polemic resource**
 - Frequently cited in debates to **counter reductionist materialism** and to nuance dichotomous positions.
- **Pedagogical tool**
 - Employed in loci on anthropology and pneumatology as a clear definitional pivot and teaching scaffold.
