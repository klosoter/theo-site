### TITLE
The Life of Faith (1631) - John Ball

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early Stuart England (published 1631) within the English Puritan/Reformed pastoral milieu. Addresses a readership formed by post-Reformation Calvinian theology, pastoral concern for experimental religion, and contemporary controversies over assurance, sanctification, and covenant fidelity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Christian life is to be understood and lived as a covenantal, Christ‑united life of faith: true faith effects both justification and progressive sanctification, and is authenticated by visible signs (mortification of sin, pursuit of holiness, use of means).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition and nature of "faith" as a living, operative trust (not mere assent).
 - Faith as the instrument of justification and the principle of union with Christ.
 - Practical outworking: mortification and vivification; duties, means of grace, and the role of the sacraments.
 - Assurance: how believers may attain and maintain certainty of salvation through covenantal promises and evidences of grace.
 - Pastoral directions for growth in faith and correction of common errors (presumably antinomian laxness and legalistic anxiety).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on the Reformed theological tradition (implicit debt to Calvinian categories), and on popular Puritan pastoral writers (theologically akin to Perkins, Sibbes, and Ames). Opposes tendencies associated with antinomianism and, implicitly, with forms of moralism and papal ritualism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Scripture as rule for life), covenant (primarily the covenant of grace), justification by faith, sanctification (mortification/vivification), union with Christ, assurance, the sacraments as means of grace, and pastoral theology.
- **Closing line:** A covenantally framed pastoral manual: faith is both the root of justification and the living power of a sanctified life, confirmed by the ordinary means of grace and concrete evidences of holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the *experiential* and covenantal character of faith - not merely forensic justification but an ongoing, practical union with Christ that shapes daily life.
 - Balances a strong doctrine of assurance with clear standards for assessing evidences of grace (aiming to avoid both presumption and despair).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects antinomian tendencies by insisting that faith issues in obedience and mortification.
 - Counters legalistic/pelagian tendencies by maintaining salvation is rooted in grace and received by faith, with obedience as fruit not ground of acceptance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integrates covenantal language into pastoral and experimental categories, making "covenant fidelity" a practical rubric for piety and assurance.
 - Emphasizes "living faith" as a technical pastoral term linking justification and sanctification.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Found readership among Puritan pastors and devout laity; used as a pastoral corrective and devotional resource rather than as systematic theology.
 - Influential mainly within local pastoral networks and later devotional compilations rather than in continental scholastic developments.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact example of seventeenth‑century Reformed pastoral theology, especially for studies of covenantal piety, assurance literature, and the interface of doctrine and devotional practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Life of Faith:** The whole pattern of Christian existence characterized by trustful reliance on Christ and active obedience.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The theological framework by which God's promises and believers' obligations are understood; grounds assurance and practical obedience.
- **Justification by Faith:** Forensic acceptance of the believer through Christ, received by faith - repeatedly affirmed as the doctrine's pivot.
- **Sanctification (mortification & vivification):**
 - Mortification: deliberate putting to death of sin.
 - Vivification: renewal and flourishing of spiritual life.
- **Union with Christ:** Communal and mystical bond that explains both legal standing and ethical transformation.
- **Assurance:** Confidence of salvation founded on covenant promises and confirmed by observable evidence of grace.
- **Means of Grace:** Word, sacraments, and prayer as ordinary instruments through which faith is nourished and tested.
- **Experimental Knowledge:** Practical, heart‑felt awareness of God's work in the soul (distinct from mere intellectual assent).
- **Obedience as Fruit:** Obedience seen as the necessary fruit and evidence - not the ground - of justification.
- **Anti‑antinomian Praxis:** Pastoral strategies and criteria to guard against licentious interpretations of grace.
- **Pastoral Application:** Aim to bridge doctrine and daily practice with concrete rules for growth and assurance.
- **Watchfulness/Watchful Care:** Ongoing vigilance in spiritual disciplines as the means to preserve and deepen faith.
- **Sacramental Use:** Emphasizes sacramental participation as sign and seal within the covenantal economy.
- **Covenantal Piety:** Habitual life formed by covenantal commitments and markers.

How this work is used:
- As a concise pastoral articulation of covenantal piety and assurance (definition source for pastoral usage of covenant language).
- As a polemical and corrective model against antinomianism and moralistic distortions (practical polemic).
- As an exegetical-pastoral model for linking Reformed doctrinal loci (justification, sanctification, sacraments) to everyday Christian practice.
