### TITLE
**Love, Power, and Justice: Ontological Analyses and Ethical Applications** - Paul Tillich (1954)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century postwar theological reconstruction; Tillich writing as a leading Protestant existential theologian in the North American and European milieu.
 - Conversation with existentialism, historicist social theory, and emergent political-theological questions about authority, law, and social renewal.
 - Site usage in this dossier: six focused references mapped to six topics - Human Nature (psychosomatic unity), Church and State relations, Church and Kingdom, Theodicy/divine justice, Imago Dei, Vocation/Dominion & culture mandate.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ethical concepts (love, power, justice) are not merely moral categories but ontological structures rooted in the ground of Being; Christian revelation reinterprets and heals their distortion in human existence and social institutions.
 - The problem addressed: how finite human existence mediates and misapplies these structures; how theology can rearticulate them for personal, ecclesial, and cultural renewal.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Ontological analyses - defines love, power, and justice as existential structures tied to Being-itself (God) and shows how they become estranged in sin and cultural forms.
 - Part II: Ethical applications - translates ontological insights into moral critique and constructive guidance for personal life, church practices, and social institutions (state, economy, culture).
 - Major moves:
 - Conceptual unpacking of each category (what love, power, justice mean ontologically).
 - Diagnosis of modes of distortion (idolatry, domination, injustice).
 - Christological and ecclesial solution: reintegration through the revelation of God as ground of Being, realized in Jesus and embodied in the church's vocation.
 - Practical implications for vocation, authority, and social order.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly: classical Christian sources (Scripture, patristics), modern philosophers (Hegelian and existential currents, e.g., Kierkegaardic existentialism, Heideggerian ontology), social theorists (Marxian insights on power and structure), and contemporary Protestant theology.
 - Dialogues with liberal moralism and legalism, and with secular social-scientific reductions of moral categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper (Being-itself; God as ground), Anthropology (psychosomatic unity; imago Dei), Christology (reconciliatory center), Ecclesiology (church as sign and agent), Ethics (moral structures), Theodicy/divine justice, Vocation and cultural mandate.

- **Closing line**
 - Tillich's center of gravity: Christianity reinterprets love, power, and justice ontologically - the revelation of Being reconciles and transforms human structures so the church can enact a redeemed vocation in culture and state.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats moral categories as ontological structures rather than merely prescriptive norms; ethical theology grounded in existential ontology.
 - Strong insistence on psychosomatic unity of human nature - moral life integrates bodily and spiritual dimensions.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both pietistic voluntarism (reducing ethics to inner piety) and secular political reductionism (reducing ethics to power calculus).
 - Contrasts with classical natural-law schemas by making justice and love intelligible only in relation to Being rather than abstract reason alone.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Rearticulation of "power" in theological terms: distinguishes fallen domination from redemptive power rooted in Being.
 - Treats "justice" as relational ordering that presupposes participation in the ground of Being; justice is not mere punitive balance but restorative ordering.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential across neo-orthodox, mainline Protestant, and political-theological streams; used in ethical theology, church-state discourse, and liberation critiques of domination.
 - Criticized by some conservative theologians for ontological abstraction and by some Marxists for insufficiently radical socio-economic critique.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust conceptual bridge between systematic theology, social ethics, and practical ecclesiology.
 - Durable pedagogical resource for teaching about the interpenetration of doctrine (God, Christ, imago Dei) and public theology (state, vocation, culture).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Being-itself (Ground of Being)** - God as ontological ground; the source that gives meaning to love, power, and justice.
- **Love (agape as ontological acceptance)** - unconditional acceptance rooted in Being; contrasted with eros or possessive affection.
- **Power** - twofold: corruptive dominion (potestas) vs. redemptive ontological power (potentia); Tillich redefines power as capacity to realize being, not merely to control.
- **Justice** - ordering and participation in the ground of Being; restorative rather than merely retributive.
- **Estrangement (alienation)** - the ontological condition producing distorted love, coercive power, and unjust structures.
- **Psychosomatic unity** - human nature as integrated body-soul unity; moral agency is embodied, resisting dualist reductions.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - human capacity for participation in Being; grounds vocation and responsibility in culture and dominion.
- **Vocation / Dominion (culture mandate)** - human calling to participate in creative stewardship; requires ethical forms shaped by ontological love and justice.
- **Church (sign and agent)** - the ecclesial community as bearer of reconciled love, a mediator between God and social structures (church vs. kingdom distinction clarified).
- **Theodicy / Divine justice** - Tillich reframes theodicy: suffering and evil as consequences of estrangement; divine justice is interpretive and restorative within Being.
- **Law vs. Gospel dynamic** - law diagnoses estrangement; gospel reorients powers toward redemptive being.
- **Authority / Church-State relations** - analyzes legitimate authority as rooted in ontological structures; critique of state absolutism and theological claims to total control.
- **Redemption as structural transformation** - salvation not merely inner but transforms social orders and cultural mandates.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for **anthropology and imago Dei**, emphasizing psychosomatic unity and participatory being.
 - As a polemic and analytic model in **church-state and ecclesiology** debates: supplies categories to critique domination and to argue for the church's prophetic vocation.
 - As a conceptual pivot in **theodicy and social ethics**, offering an ontology-based reconstruction of love, power, and justice for theological ethics and cultural engagement.
