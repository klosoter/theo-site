### TITLE
For Calvinism: Recovering the Objectivity of Salvation - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed revival (early 21st century). Horton's work responds to late-20th/early-21st-century evangelicalism marked by therapeutic religion, pietistic subjectivism, and fragmentation over sacramental and ecclesial identity. Written within confessional Reformed and covenantal theology streams, engaging modern evangelical culture and ongoing intra-Reformed debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The gospel has become unduly subjective and privatized; Horton argues for recovering the *objectivity* of salvation - Christ's accomplished work, covenantal union, and public means (Word and sacraments) as the basis for justification, assurance, and ecclesial identity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose modern distortions: individualistic, feeling-centered faith; separation of justification and ecclesial means.
 - Reaffirm classical Reformed categories: forensic justification, union with Christ, covenantal promise, and sacramental means of grace.
 - Apply to doctrine and practice: assurance rooted in objective promises and union, perseverance as the fruit of divine faithfulness, and a robust doctrine of the church as one, holy, catholic, apostolic.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and classical Reformers (Calvin, Owen), Kuyperian and neo-Reformed thinkers (Kuyper, Bavinck), contemporary evangelical interlocutors and critics (Arminian and pietistic tendencies), and intra-Reformed debates (Federal Vision controversies implicitly engaged).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and the preached Word; covenant theology; justification and imputation; union with Christ; sanctification and perseverance; sacraments as means of grace; ecclesiology (one holy catholic apostolic church; marks of the church).
- **Closing line:** Horton centers the Reformed gospel on the objective, covenantal work of Christ as publicly administered in Word and sacrament, securing assurance and perseverance within the one church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **"Objectivity of salvation"** as a corrective slogan: stresses that salvation is a real, accomplished act (Christ's work and covenant promise) rather than merely a felt experience.
 - Strong integration of *forensic* justification with *real* union - assurance flows from declared righteousness and continuing participation in Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against pietistic and therapeutic evangelicalism that privileges inward religious experience over covenantal promises.
 - Counters strains that privatize assurance or minimize sacraments as mere symbols.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes common pastoral categories (assurance, perseverance) in covenantal-objective language to reorient pastoral care and catechesis.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian education and pastoral formation as a concise restatement of confessional priorities.
 - Provoked dialogue with both those advocating stronger sacramental theology (to clarify non-sacerdotalism) and those emphasizing personal experience (to debate assurance).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, usable articulation of how objective gospel claims ground pastoral practices (preaching, sacraments, assurance).
 - Serves as an accessible bridge between historical Reformed doctrine and contemporary pastoral challenges.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Objective gospel:** Salvation as an accomplished, public reality in Christ; Horton's central corrective to subjectivism.
- **Union with Christ:** The relational bedrock linking justification, sanctification, assurance, and perseverance.
- **Justification (forensic):** Declarative righteousness imputed to believers; for Horton this remains the gospel center.
- **Imputation:** Legal transfer of Christ's righteousness; distinguishes justification from inner moral change.
- **Covenant:** The framework for salvation promises, application of grace, and ecclesial belonging.
- **Sacraments (Word and sacrament):** Objective means of grace that signify and seal Christ's promises; real but not sacerdotal channels.
- **Assurance:** Confidence grounded primarily in God's promises, union with Christ, and the visible signs of covenantal life (preaching, sacraments), not merely subjective feelings.
 - Relation to perseverance: assurance is sustained by divine faithfulness demonstrated in Christ and mediated by covenantal means.
- **Perseverance of the saints:** The necessary outworking of union and election; Horton's view stresses divine preservation rather than human effort.
- **One holy catholic apostolic church:** Affirmed as both visible and invisible realities; Horton defends church unity, catholicity, apostolic faith, and public marks.
- **Nature and marks of the church:** The Word rightly preached, sacraments rightly administered, and biblical discipline - Horton's normative marks against sectarianism and privatized church models.
- **Visible vs. invisible church:** Horton preserves the tension - public administration and membership (visible) grounded in elect union (invisible).
- **Assurance and perseverance texts (exegetical model):** Horton uses classic Pauline and covenantal exegesis (e.g., Romans, Hebrews) to argue for objective grounds of assurance.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "objective gospel" and covenantal assurance in pastoral theology and catechesis.
- As a **polemic** against pietistic subjectivism and privatized evangelical practice; also used in intra-Reformed debates over sacraments and church marks.
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for grounding assurance and perseverance in union with Christ and public means of grace.
