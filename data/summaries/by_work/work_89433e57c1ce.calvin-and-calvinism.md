### TITLE
**Calvin and Calvinism** (B. B. Warfield)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th to early 20th century, Old Princeton theology; Reformed-evangelical apologetic amid liberal Protestantism and historical revisionism.
 - Addressed to disputes about the relation of Calvin to later Reformed orthodoxy (the so-called Calvin vs. the Calvinists thesis).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvinism is not a betrayal of Calvin but the mature, coherent expression of his God-centered evangelical theism.
 - The true center is the majesty and sovereignty of God in grace, not a predestinarian fixation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Clarify Calvinism: theism come to its rights, or evangelical religion consistently thought out.
 - Establish historical continuity: from Augustine to Calvin to the confessional Reformed tradition.
 - Distinguish axes: monergism vs. synergism; Scripture-and-Spirit vs. ecclesiastical mediation; God-centered teleology vs. man-centered religion.
 - Engage caricatures: rationalism, determinism, antinomianism, and the alleged scholastic drift.
 - Show doctrinal breadth: theology proper, Trinity, revelation, sin and grace, church and sacraments, providence and decree.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - For: Augustine, Calvin (Institutes, Commentaries), Reformed confessions (Dort, Westminster), Turretin, the Hodges.
 - Against or in dialogue: Arminius and Wesleyan synergism, Roman sacerdotalism, Socinian/Unitarian rationalism, liberal historicism, Amyraldian mediations.
 - In conversation with Kuyper on Calvinism as a life-system, yet stressing exegetical and soteriological core.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology proper: aseity, sovereignty, decree, providence; God as end of all things.
 - Trinity: Nicene orthodoxy; personal distinctions grounded in revelation; worship directed to the triune God.
 - Bibliology: authority, sufficiency, inspiration; Scripture as principium externum with the Spirit as principium internum.
 - Anthropology and sin: created dignity under divine rule; total inability through the fall; need for regenerating grace.
 - Soteriology: monergistic grace; election; union with Christ; justification by faith alone.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: church as the community under the Word; sacraments as signs and seals; anti-sacerdotal.
- **Closing line**
 - The gravitational center is the glory of the triune God magnified in sovereign grace through the Word and Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Calvinism as comprehensive theism ordered to God's glory; predestination derivative of a larger doctrine of God.
 - Evangelical at heart: grace alone received by faith alone; monergistic regeneration grounding assurance and worship.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rebuts the Calvin vs. the Calvinists narrative; asserts confessional Reformed continuity with Calvin's exegesis and aims.
 - Opposes sacerdotal mediation and synergistic soteriology as compromising divine sovereignty and the gratuity of grace.
 - Corrects the charge of rationalism: Calvinism is exegetically driven and pious, not speculative determinism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Theism come to its rights: God's Godness governs doctrine and devotion.
 - Principium pair: Scripture (external) and Spirit (internal) secure certainty without ecclesial infallibilism.
 - Monergism vs. synergism as a master key across loci (revelation, regeneration, worship).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped 20th-century Reformed self-understanding; frequently cited in defenses of confessional continuity and of inerrancy.
 - A foil for Kuyperian expansions; a resource for evangelical Calvinism and churchly catechesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Diagnostic clarity on what makes Calvinism distinct.
 - Portable criteria for evaluating doctrinal systems by God-centeredness and grace-consistency.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity**: God's self-existence and independence; grounds absolute sovereignty.
- **Sovereignty**: God's exhaustive rule in creation and redemption; the organizing horizon of Calvinism.
- **Decree**: Eternal, wise plan of God; predestination as a particular within the decree.
 - Supralapsarian/infralapsarian debates treated as intra-family, not essentials.
- **Providence**: God's preserving and governing of all things; comfort and responsibility held together.
- **Monergism**: God alone effects regeneration; faith is a gift, not a human contribution.
 - Contrasted with synergism (cooperation), which Warfield deems unscriptural.
- **Total inability**: The sinner's incapacity to turn to God without grace; safeguards sola gratia.
- **Scripture as principium**: Inspired, authoritative, sufficient norm for theology; paired with the Spirit's internal witness.
- **Evangelical vs. sacerdotal**: Salvation by grace through faith vs. grace mediated by priestly power.
- **Trinity**: Nicene confession as non-negotiable frame for God-centered theology and worship.
- **Union with Christ**: The nexus of election, justification, sanctification; grace applied by the Spirit.
- **Means of grace**: Word and sacraments as appointed instruments; signs and seals, not ex opere operato.
- **Glory of God**: The chief end ordering creation, redemption, and church life.
- **Confessional continuity**: Reformed symbols as faithful codifications of Calvin's exegetical theology.
- **Sense of God**: Calvin's seed of religion, purified and secured by revelation and grace.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for Calvinism's center in theology proper and grace.
 - As a polemic against synergism, sacerdotalism, and the Calvin vs. Calvinists thesis.
 - As a methodological model: Scripture-and-Spirit principia guiding systematics and ecclesiology.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking decree, providence, sin, and salvation to the triune God's glory.
