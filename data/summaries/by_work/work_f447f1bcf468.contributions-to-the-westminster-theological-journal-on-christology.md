### TITLE
Contributions to "The Westminster Theological Journal" on Christology - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (focus: Impeccability of Christ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑20th century Reformed academic milieu; pieces appear in The Westminster Theological Journal within a confessional, evangelical-Reformed framework.
 - Responds to both historic Reformed scholasticism and several modern theological moves that re-evaluate Christ's freedom and capacity to sin.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defend the classical Reformed claim of the *impeccability* (sinlessness and non‑possibility of sin) of the incarnate Son while accounting for genuine temptation, freedom, and responsibility.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Establish biblical warrant for Christ's sinlessness (exegesis of temptation and confessional texts).
 - Clarify categories: peccability vs. impeccability; distinguish *non posse peccare* (not able to sin) from *posse non peccare* (able not to sin).
 - Argue that the hypostatic union does not render Christ peccable; his human will is truly free but not oriented toward sin because of the union with the divine person.
 - Show theological necessity: impeccability required for credible active obedience and representative atonement.
 - Address pastoral and theological anxieties about freedom and the reality of temptation; explain how real temptations and suffering are consistent with non‑possibility of sin.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed confessions and scholastics (implicit and explicit appeal to historical Reformed categories).
 - Scriptural witnesses (Gospels, Hebrews, Pauline texts) for temptation and sinlessness.
 - Engagement with modern theologians who advocate various accounts of Christ's freedom/peccability (broadly: some existential and neo‑orthodox impulses).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two wills), soteriology (active obedience, representative atonement), anthropology (temptation and freedom), Trinity (personhood of the Son as decisive for peccability).
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin locates the theological center of gravity in a confessional, Scripture‑rooted Christology that upholds the Son's sinlessness as both exegetically warranted and theologically indispensable for salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the coherence of genuine human freedom with non‑possibility of sin in the incarnate Son rather than treating impeccability as a metaphysical curtailment of freedom.
 - Emphasizes covenantal and representational functions of Christ to ground the necessity of impeccability.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against theological proposals that make Christ peccable to preserve an undiminished notion of freedom or genuine moral risk.
 - Corrects readings that conflate temptation with propensity to sin; insists temptation can be real without entailment of peccability.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful deployment and clarification of classical Latin loci (non posse peccare / posse non peccare) within biblical theology rather than purely scholastic taxonomy.
 - Nuances the relation between the divine person and human faculties in the hypostatic union to avoid both Nestorian and monophysite errors on freedom/sin.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed scholarship and seminaries as a clear, confessional defense of classical impeccability.
 - Has shaped ongoing debates about Christ's freedom, especially in courses on Christology and systematic theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models exegetical restraint married to confessional conviction; valuable for students needing a rigorous defense of sinlessness that attends to pastoral and soteriological concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability**
 - The doctrine that Christ did not and could not sin in his incarnate state.
- **Peccability**
 - The view that Christ could have sinned (often advanced to preserve a certain notion of moral risk).
- **Non posse peccare**
 - "Not able to sin" - classic Reformed formulation defended by Gaffin as theologically coherent.
- **Posse non peccare**
 - "Able not to sin" - acknowledged but insufficient alone to capture Christ's representational role.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - The personal union of divine and human natures in the Son; central to explaining how impeccability coexists with real human faculties.
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's perfect fulfillment of the law; Gaffin argues this requires impeccable human action to be validly representative.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death; treated in tandem with active obedience in soteriological argument.
- **Temptation**
 - Real assaults upon Christ's human faculties; Gaffin emphasizes their genuineness without implying peccability.
- **Freedom (genuine human freedom)**
 - Differentiated from libertinism; Christ's freedom is real but not a freedom to sin.
- **Representative/federal head**
 - Christ functions as covenant head for believers; impeccability necessary for valid representation.
- **Scriptural exegesis**
 - Used as primary warrant (e.g., temptation narratives, Hebrews), not merely as a foil to philosophical speculation.
- **Confessional alignment**
 - Read in light of Reformed confessions and historical theology rather than novel theological systems.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: authoritative, concise articulation of classical Reformed impeccability for systematic theology.
 - Polemic: deployed against contemporary peccability proposals that emphasize hypothetical sinning to protect freedom.
 - Exegetical model: exemplifies careful Scripture‑first reading of temptation and sinlessness passages for Christological claims.
