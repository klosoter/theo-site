### TITLE
De Spiritualibus Creaturis - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** mid-13th century Scholasticism (Dominican intellectual milieu). Written within Aquinas's broader Aristotelian synthesis of Christian doctrine and metaphysics (contemporary with Summa Theologiae; draws on Augustine, Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** systematic account of non-corporeal beings (angels) and the human soul: their ontological status, origin, powers, relation to body, and role in salvation history. Key practical debates addressed: **Creationism vs Traducianism** (origin of the soul and transmission of sin) and the analytic contrast often posed as **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy** of human nature.
- **Core argument / structure:** deployed by metaphysical moves grounded in act/potency and hylomorphism.
 - Establishes angels as pure intellectual substances (simple, immaterial, created directly by God).
 - Treats the human soul as an immaterial **substantial form** that gives life and identity to the human body (soul is not a separable body nor a third substance composing a person).
 - Argues for direct creation of each rational soul by God (creationism): the immaterial soul cannot be generated from material parents because it is not a material composite and cannot be in potency to bodily generation in the same way.
 - Distinguishes faculties (vegetative, sensitive, rational - intellect and will) functionally without committing to ontological trichotomy; insists on the unity of person (hylomorphic composite).
- **Figures / sources engaged:** Aristotle (metaphysics, De Anima), Augustine (on soul, sin, and creation), Pseudo-Dionysius (angelology), Boethius and medieval commentators; Aquinas often positions himself against contemporary theses favoring traducian explanations or Platonic separability.
- **Doctrines treated:** creation (creation ex nihilo of spiritual substances), angelology, anthropology (soul, powers), immortality of the soul, original sin and its transmission, providence, implications for personhood and eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Aquinas centers the work on a Thomistic conviction: spiritual creatures are created intelligences and the human soul is an immaterial substantial form directly created by God, grounding personal unity, moral agency, and immortality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Systematic application of Aristotelian hylomorphism to human nature: the soul as the form of the body (not a separable third "part" of human substance).
 - Detailed metaphysical defense of creationism: soul's immateriality and form-status make transmission by parental seed metaphysically incoherent.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors / rivals:**
 - Counters traducian models that explain soul transmission biologically and counters Platonic pre-existence or strict separability (trichotomist ontologies).
 - Clarifies Augustine's pastoral assertions by supplying a metaphysical justification rather than merely an appeal to authority.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Careful technical deployment of "substantial form" and the agent/intelligible distinction in the intellect (agent intellect / possible intellect) to account for human knowledge and immortality.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - In Catholic theology: foundational for later scholastic and post-Tridentine anthropology and angelology; used as the standard metaphysical defense of creationist anthropology.
 - In Reformed and Protestant contexts: mixed reception - some Protestants (notably Lutheran and several Reformed writers) preferred traducianist accounts, while others adopted Thomistic metaphysical tools selectively; Aquinas' clarity remained an influential resource for Protestant scholasticism despite doctrinal disagreement.
- **Enduring value:** provides a rigorous metaphysical framework for debates on soul origin, personhood, and the ethics/eschatology of human nature; invaluable as a conceptual toolkit for teaching classical Christian anthropology and responding to modern reductionisms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spiritual creatures:** beings without matter (primarily angels); treated as simple, immaterial substances created by God.
- **Angel:** a purely intellectual substance; simple, subsistent intellective beings with will, ordered providentially.
- **Substantial form:** the soul as the form that makes a living human; not an accidental property but the principle of life and identity.
- **Hylomorphism:** doctrine that corporeal substances are composites of matter (hyle) and form (morphe); central to Aquinas's rejection of ontological trichotomy.
- **Body-soul composite:** the human person as a single substance composed of matter informed by soul (unity of personhood).
- **Agent intellect / possible intellect:** Thomistic distinction explaining how the intellect abstracts intelligible species; crucial for discussing immaterial cognition and immortality.
- **Immateriality / immortality:** arguments that the soul's immateriality grounds its subsistence after bodily death.
- **Creationism (of the soul):** thesis that each rational soul is immediately created by God; Aquinas's position and a major polemical target of the treatise.
- **Traducianism (rejected):** doctrine that souls are derived from parents along with bodies; Aquinas argues this is metaphysically untenable for immaterial souls.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy (functional vs ontological):**
 - Aquinas distinguishes faculties (vegetative/sensitive/rational - a functional tripartition) but denies ontological trichotomy (no three separate substances).
 - He thus prefers a hylomorphic "dichotomy" in the sense of body + soul as the single human substance.
- **Act and potency:** metaphysical framework underpinning change, creation, and the immutability of simple substances.
- **Original sin transmission:** discussed as tied to the soul's origin; Aquinas explains how guilt and concupiscence are transmitted while maintaining creationism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Catholic anthropology (soul as substantial form; angels as intellectual substances).
- As a **polemic** against traducianism and against ontological trichotomy, supplying metaphysical counterarguments.
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for reading Scripture on death, resurrection, and personhood while interfacing with natural philosophy.
