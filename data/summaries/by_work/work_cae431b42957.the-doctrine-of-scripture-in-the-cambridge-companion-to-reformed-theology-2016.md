### TITLE
The Doctrine of Scripture - Stephen Williams, "The Doctrine of Scripture" in The Cambridge Companion to Reformed Theology (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed retrieval (early 21st c.); aimed at summarizing confessional Reformed convictions for a broader academic readership.
 - Responds to modern critiques from historical criticism, neo-Orthodoxy (Barth), and populist fundamentalism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture must be understood as the **accommodated Word of God**, analogous to the Incarnation: transcendent divine revelation made intelligible in ordinary human language and historical form while remaining authoritative and true.
 - The problem addressed: how to hold divine transcendence and human mediation without collapsing into either deism (God absent in Scripture) or idolatry (Scripture as mere human artifact).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm classical Reformed loci (revelation, inspiration, authority, canon) but reframe them through an **incarnational analogy**:
 - Revelation is personal and propositional, yet mediated through human authors and cultural forms.
 - Inspiration does not obliterate human voice; divine accommodation explains Scripture's variety and occasional cultural "imperfections".
 - Authority rests on God as the ultimate speaker while Scripture is the normative witness to Christ and covenant life.
 - Practical corollaries: hermeneutics must read Scripture as both divine message and historically situated text; pastoral theology must guard biblical confidence without simplistic literalism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: **Calvin** (accommodation), Westminster tradition (confessional norms), and modern figures such as **Karl Barth** (Word-event emphasis) and evangelical inerrantists.
 - Engages historical-critical scholarship as a necessary tool, but criticizes methodological approaches that prescind from ecclesial and doctrinal commitments.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, canonicity, authority, perspicuity, illumination, covenant theology, Christology (as analogy), and hermeneutics.
 - Cross-cutting: doctrine of God (transcendence and immanence) and pastoral implications for preaching and catechesis.

- **Closing line**
 - Williams locates the doctrinal center of gravity in a **Reformed incarnational model of Scripture**: the Bible is the true, authoritative Word precisely because God graciously accommodates divine speech in human words to reveal Christ and covenant life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prominent use of the **incarnational analogy** to explain accommodation: Scripture as Word made "flesh" in language and history.
 - Balances propositional truth with mediated, historical form-avoids flat literalism and non-biblical mystification of "Word-events."

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies in **barthianism** that marginalize the Bible as mere witness to the Word-event, insisting Scripture itself is a primary locus of revelation.
 - Critiques **fundamentalist inerrantism** for ignoring the mediated, culturally conditioned features of biblical text; instead defends a robust infallibility grounded in divine authorship via accommodation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic appropriation of **accommodation + incarnational analogy** as a hermeneutical and dogmatic principle rather than only a Calvinistic rhetorical move.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed academic and pastoral circles for giving a crisp, theologically coherent alternative to polarized views.
 - Used as a bridge text in classrooms introducing confessional bibliology alongside contemporary hermeneutical challenges.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how Reformed confessional commitments can engage historical criticism without capitulation.
 - Serves as a pedagogical model linking Christology and bibliology for preaching, catechesis, and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation**
 - God condescending to human capacities in revelation; explains plainness and particularities in Scripture.
- **Incarnational Analogy**
 - Theologically frames accommodation: just as Word became flesh, divine speech becomes human language and form.
- **Revelation**
 - Personal, covenantal disclosure centered on Christ; mediated through Scripture.
- **Inspiration**
 - Divine guidance of human authors such that Scripture reliably conveys God's saving truth without erasing human style.
- **Authority (normativity)**
 - Scripture is normative for faith and life because it is the God-given witness to Christ and covenant.
- **Inerrancy / Infallibility**
 - Retained in a Reformed, theologically nuanced sense: Scripture is trustworthy for salvation and doctrine; textual/formal differences do not undermine its truth.
- **Canon**
 - Ecclesial and doctrinally recognized corpus that functions as rule and measure for doctrine and life.
- **Perspicuity**
 - Scripture's essential clarity for the gospel and salvation, while acknowledging that not every passage is equally plain.
- **Illumination**
 - Holy Spirit enabling understanding of Scripture within the covenant community, distinct from inspiration.
- **Witness to Christ**
 - Scripture's ultimate end: to point to and bear witness to the incarnate Christ.
- **Hermeneutics**
 - Method shaped by incarnational accommodation: historical-critical tools plus theological reading within church tradition.
- **Typology**
 - Covenantal and Christ-centered reading of Old Testament in service of canonical coherence.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: clarifies confessional Reformed definition of Scripture as both divine and mediated.
 - Polemic: calibrates critique against Barthian anti-biblicism and fundamentalist literalism.
 - Exegetical model / conceptual pivot: supplies an incarnational hermeneutical principle for preaching, dogmatics, and formation.
