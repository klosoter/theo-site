### TITLE
**"The Lord's Supper" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, New Dictionary of Theology (1988)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelically oriented reference work; written within a post-Reformation, confessional Protestant milieu seeking pastoral clarity amid renewed ecumenical and sacramental debates.
 - Ferguson writes as a Conservative Reformed theologian addressing both doctrinal precision and pastoral practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper is a divinely appointed sacrament that truly communicates Christ to believers, not by physical presence in the elements but by real spiritual nourishment and fellowship through the Holy Spirit; it must be guarded by proper admission and discipline.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: Sacrament as a sign and seal instituted by Christ.
 - Presence: Rejects corporeal or local bodily presence (Roman Catholic and Lutheran claims) and rejects thin memorialism; affirms a real, spiritual presence effected by the Spirit.
 - Purpose and effects: Communion with Christ and the church, strengthening of faith, assurance of benefits of the covenant.
 - Fencing and admission: Necessity of examination, catechesis, and discipline to protect sacramental integrity and the covenant community.
 - Pastoral implications: Liturgical order, preaching, and catechetical preparation as indispensable partners to sacramental administration.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages primarily with Reformation figures (Calvin, Zwingli, Luther), the Westminster tradition, and contemporary evangelical and ecumenical positions.
 - Implicit polemic against Roman Catholic transubstantiation and against purely symbolic memorialism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scriptural warrant for the sacrament), Covenant theology (meal as covenant sign/seal), Christology (the manner of Christ's presence), Pneumatology (Spirit as agent of communion), Ecclesiology (church discipline, unity), Sacramentology, Soteriology (assurance, strengthening of faith).

- **Closing line**
 - The Lord's Supper is a covenantal means of grace in which Christ is truly received by faith through the Spirit; fidelity to its doctrine and guarded practice preserves both its comfort and holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on a middle way: the supper is more than memorial but less than a change in the elements - a **real spiritual feeding** by Christ mediated through the Spirit.
 - Pastoral stress on **fencing the table**: sacramental administration must be accompanied by examination, instruction, and discipline.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Lutheran notions of local corporeal presence.
 - Also corrective to reductionist memorialism that evacuates objective efficacy from the sacrament.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not novel vocabulary but a clarifying synthesis: frames sacramental presence primarily in covenantal and pneumatological terms rather than metaphysical speculation about the elements.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles for clear, pastorally oriented summary of classical Reformed sacramentology.
 - Used as a concise reference in theology courses, preaching resources, and church order discussions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Endures as a compact, balanced articulation linking doctrine, biblical exegesis, and pastoral discipline; especially valuable for churches seeking confessional fidelity without polemical excess.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper**
 - The Christian sacramental meal instituted by Christ as sign and seal of the covenant.

- **Sacrament (sign and seal)**

- **Covenant fellowship**
 - The Supper as a communal meal marking belonging and mutual participation in covenant blessings.

- **Fencing the table**
 - Pastoral practice of protective admission: examination, instruction, and exclusion to preserve holiness and truth.

- **Admission / examination**
 - Requirements for worthy partaking: catechesis, self-examination, and pastoral oversight; not a works-righteousness test but protection of the sacrament.

- **Discipline / excommunication**
 - Use of exclusion when members persist in unrepentant sin to maintain covenant integrity.

- **Pneumatological mediation**
 - Emphasis that the Holy Spirit is the immediate agent by whom Christ is received in the Supper.
