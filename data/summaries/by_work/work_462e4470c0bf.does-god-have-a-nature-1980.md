### TITLE
Does God Have a Nature? (1980) - Alvin Plantinga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion; reaction against both naive theism and some strands of classical theism that rely on Aristotelian/Thomistic metaphysics.
 - Engages analytic metaphysics, modal logic, and traditional theological doctrines from a Reformed-analytic perspective.
- **Central thesis**
 - Plantinga challenges the intelligibility and theological desirability of saying that God "has a nature" in the same metaphysical sense that creatures do. He contends that speaking of God as a bearer of a determinate set of properties (a nature) leads to theological and philosophical problems; instead we should reconceive how divine attributes are ascribed.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify the target: what philosophers mean by a "nature" (a set of essential properties, a metaphysical profile that explains and grounds behavior and identity).
 - Show problematic consequences of ascribing such a nature to God:
 - threatens divine simplicity (if God is a composite of properties),
 - risks making God a contingent object or subject to dependence,
 - may make God unintelligible as an ultimate explanatory ground.
 - Offer a corrective: paradigmatically treat God as a personal, sui generis being; speak of divine attributes in ways that avoid treating them as exemplified properties in a standard creaturely sense.
 - Apply the re-conception to theological loci (omnipotence, omniscience, goodness) and to philosophical issues like modal grounding and knowledge.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with classical theists (Aquinas, Augustine), modernists who toy with property-theoretic descriptions, and analytic philosophers of religion concerned with divine attributes.
 - Intersects debates in contemporary modal metaphysics and discussions about divine simplicity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Attributes of God (omniscience, omnipotence, goodness); aseity and simplicity; implications for providence and divine knowledge.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: God should not be conceptualized as a creaturelike bearer of a fixed metaphysical "nature"; doing so distorts divine personhood and undermines key doctrines.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes a *personalist* reading of divine talk over a straightforward predicate-exemplification model familiar from metaphysics of ordinary objects.
 - Treats the notion "has a nature" as philosophically loaded and theologically dangerous, rather than innocuous shorthand.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on Thomistic/Aristotelian tendencies to treat God as a metaphysical substance with a determinate essence composed from properties.
 - Contrasts with reductive property-ontologies that would analyze divine attributes just as instanced universals.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Encourages reframing divine attributes to avoid naive exemplification language; underscores the distinct ontological category God occupies relative to created beings.
 - Tightens the analytic vocabulary for discussing divine simplicity without capitulating to metaphysical composites.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Stimulated renewed analytic attention to divine simplicity, aseity, and the grammar of divine-attribute ascriptions.
 - Widely cited in debates about the coherence of classical theism and in subsequent discussions of divine knowledge (including middle knowledge), freedom, and providence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise philosophical provocation: useful as a corrective against careless transposition of creaturely metaphysics onto God and as a springboard for refined accounts of God's attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Nature (of God)** - the contested notion of God possessing a determinate set of properties or essence in the creaturely/metaphysical sense.
- **Divine simplicity** - the classical doctrine that God is not composite; Plantinga stresses problems that arise when "nature" is read simpliciter.
- **Exemplification (property-instantiation)** - the standard metaphysical relation Plantinga argues is ill-suited to divine predicates.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; central to the argument that God is not a dependent bearer of a nature.
- **Personhood (of God)** - Plantinga emphasizes a personalist reading to avoid depersonalizing God via nature-talk.
- **Omniscience** - discussed as an attribute whose intelligibility is affected by how one conceives God's ontological status (relevant to discussions of middle knowledge).
- **Middle knowledge / Molinism** - related topic: how one construes God's mode of being and knowledge bears on the intelligibility and metaphysical grounding of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
 - Plantinga's move supports careful attention to whether God is ontologically constrained in knowing counterfactuals; it is often invoked in Molinist debates about whether "nature-talk" forces a particular view of divine knowledge.
- **Modal grounding / essentialism** - concerns about whether a divine "nature" would unduly fix modal profiles or make God a less than ultimate ground.
- **Impassibility / providence** - implications flow from rejecting creaturely nature-talk for how God relates to creatures.
- **Predicate theology** - the methodological arena Plantinga criticizes when predicates are treated as ordinary metaphysical properties.
- **Composite vs. sui generis being** - contrast highlighted to avoid assimilating God to created entities.
- **Theological grammar** - Plantinga stresses revising the grammar of attributions to God to avoid category mistakes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition-source / conceptual pivot**: to justify alternative semantics for divine-attribute language (useful for philosophical theology courses).
- As **polemic**: deployed against Thomistic or classical-theist arguments that presuppose creaturelike exemplification of properties.
- As a **heuristic** in debates about divine knowledge (including middle knowledge/Molinism), showing how metaphysical presuppositions about God's being shape positions on divine foreknowledge and counterfactuals.
