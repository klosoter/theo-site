### TITLE
**Covenant Theology: Biblical, Theological, and Historical Perspectives** 
Editors: **Ligon Duncan, David W. Hall**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century conservative Reformed revival; produced within evangelical Reformed and Presbyterian academic and pastoral networks seeking to restate classical covenant theology against resurgence of dispensationalism and newer "non-federal" covenant proposals.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** A comprehensive defense and exposition of **classical Reformed (federal) covenant theology**, arguing that Scripture presents redemptive history as structured by covenants (works, grace, and intra-Trinitarian covenant), and that this framework yields coherent doctrine and faithful church practice.
- **Core argument / structure:** Multi-author treatment moving from biblical exegesis to systematic formulation and historical development.
 - Biblical-theological chapters: survey covenant motifs in Pentateuch, Prophets, Gospels, and Pauline corpus; emphasize promise-fulfillment and typology.
 - Systematic chapters: define and analyze covenant of works, covenant of grace, covenant of redemption; relate covenants to election, Christ's mediatorial offices, justification, sanctification.
 - Historical chapters: trace development from Augustine → medieval precursors → Reformers (especially Calvin) → Puritans/Westminster → modern articulations and disputes.
 - Pastoral/sacramental chapters: apply covenant theology to baptism, Lord's Supper, preaching, family religion, and ecclesial identity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin, Owen, Rutherford, the Westminster divines, contemporary Reformed scholars; primary polemics directed at dispensationalists and various post-Reformed alternatives (e.g., New Covenant Theology); sustained engagement with biblical texts and classical Reformed confessions.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Scripture as covenant witness), covenant (works/grace/redemption), Trinity (intra-Trinitarian covenant), Christology (mediator/federal head), soteriology (election, justification, imputation), sacraments (paedobaptism, eucharist), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church), eschatology (continuity vs discontinuity).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Scripture's narrative is covenantal - God orders redemption through covenants centered on Christ as covenant head, and this framework best preserves biblical unity, orthodox soteriology, and consistent ecclesial practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Emphasis on covenant unity and continuity:** Reasserts a covenantal hermeneutic that reads redemptive history as one saving plan, avoiding sharp Israel/Church bifurcation.
- **Clarifies internal covenant distinctions:** Distinguishes carefully between covenant of works, covenant of grace, and covenant of redemption (intra-Trinitarian pact), resisting conflations common in popular treatments.
- **Pastoral and sacramental focus:** Connects covenant theology directly to baptismal practice, household catechesis, and Lord's Supper theology; argues for covenantal implications of infant baptism and covenant children's place in the visible church.
- **Corrective to rivals:** Counters dispensational fragmentation of promises and critiques New Covenant or "two-covenant" proposals that undercut federal headship and imputation.
- **Terminological precision:** Pushes for clearer operational definitions (e.g., what constitutes a covenant vs. administration/dispensation), reducing equivocation in debates.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in conservative Reformed seminaries, presbyteries, and pastoral training; valued as a multi-perspective, confessional restatement though critiqued by some for confessional narrowness and limited engagement with postliberal and ecumenical scholarship.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a compact, defensible reference for teaching classical Reformed covenant theology, especially for pastors and students needing grounded exegesis tied to doctrinal and sacramental application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** Pre-fall covenant between God and Adam; obedience promised life, disobedience brought death; explains human failure and need for a mediator.
- **Covenant of Grace:** God's redemptive covenant after the Fall by which Christ secures salvation for the elect; unity across Testaments with progressive administrations.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Eternal, intra-Trinitarian agreement in which Father, Son, and Spirit covenant the plan of salvation; grounds Christ's mediatorship.
- **Federal headship / imputation:** Christ as federal head whose obedience/righteousness is imputed to believers; Adam as federal head whose sin is imputed to humanity.
- **Continuity / Discontinuity:** The degree to which promises, law, and covenantal status carry over from Israel to the church; book argues for substantial continuity in promise and covenantal institutions.
- **Typology / Promise-fulfillment hermeneutic:** Reading Old Testament persons/events as covenantal types fulfilled in Christ; hermeneutical backbone of their biblical case.
- **Administration / Sacramental economy:** Distinguishes between the one covenant and its varied historical administrations (sacramental practices, polity, ceremonial aspects).
- **Paedobaptism:** Infant baptism defended as covenantal sign for covenant children, analogous to circumcision in the OT.
- **Visible / Invisible Church:** Ecclesiological distinction retained; covenant membership pertains to visible church whereas final election pertains to invisible church.
- **Redemptive-historical reading:** Interprets Scripture as unified redemptive story centered on Christ's covenant work.
- **Mediator / Mediatorial offices:** Christ's roles (prophet, priest, king) as central to covenant fulfillment and application.
- **Promise / Fulfillment:** Covenant promises (land, seed, blessing) read Christologically and ecclesiologically rather than as ethnic/territorial only.
- **Republication theory (if addressed):** Treatment of Mosaic law as republication of the covenant of works for pedagogical ends - noted and critiqued where raised.
- **Double imputation:** Doctrine that both Christ's righteousness is reckoned to believers and believers' sin is reckoned to Christ in atonement schema.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source:** A standard concise articulation of classical Reformed covenant categories for seminary courses and confessional instruction.
 - **Polemic:** Resource for pastors and theologians opposing dispensationalist or non-federal frameworks.
 - **Exegetical model:** Provides a covenantal hermeneutic for preaching and biblical theology, especially in OT-NT continuity passages.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Used to justify sacramental practice (paedobaptism) and covenantal pastoral care (family catechesis, covenant nurture).
