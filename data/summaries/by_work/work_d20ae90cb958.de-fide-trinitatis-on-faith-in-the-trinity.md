### TITLE
De Fide Trinitatis (On the Faith in the Trinity) - Anselm of Canterbury (late 11th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed in the Norman-English scholastic milieu (c. 1090s). Early Anselmian work written after his return from Bec and during tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury; reflects monastic scholastic method moving toward systematic theology.
 - Engages the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and patristic authorities within Latin theological practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate how Christians may coherently confess the Trinity: one divine essence with three persons, preserving unity of God while accounting for personal distinctions and origins.
 - Secondary aim: to show that the Trinity is a matter of faithful confession that can be clarified by reason (faith seeking understanding).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins from the creed as received truth and asks what must be meant by "one God in three Persons."
 - Discriminates key categories: essentia/substantia (essence/substance), persona (person), relatio (relation) - relations are the principia of personhood.
 - Explains personal distinctions by principles of origin (principium): the Father as origin of the Son (begetting) and of the Spirit (procession), the Son as begotten, the Spirit as proceeding.
 - Uses analogical reasoning to show how human language can predicate unity and distinction without equivocation.
 - Applies scriptural and patristic citations (especially Augustine, Gregory, Hilary) to validate terms and show coherence with creed.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy reliance on Augustine for Trinitarian method and terminology; also cites Greek Fathers, Western exegetes, and Boethian metaphysical categories.
 - Implicit interlocution with both patristic ambiguity and emerging Eastern-Latin disputes (the work anticipates later Filioque debates).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation and creedal reception, analogical knowledge of God, relation and origin within divine life, predicate language about God.
 - Implications for ecclesial confession (use of the Creed) and for rational theology (relationship to proofs of God's being).

- **Closing line**
 - Anselm's center of gravity: the Trinity is to be confessed as one divine essence in three relational principles; this mystery is groundable in both faithful reception of revelation and disciplined rational clarification - faith illumined by reason.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic use of metaphysical categories (essentia, persona, relatio, principium) to make the creed speak with conceptual precision.
 - Strong insistence that relations (not merely roles) are constitutive of personhood in the Godhead.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Moves beyond loose patristic analogies by insisting on principled accounts of origin: the Father as source, the Son as begotten, the Spirit as proceeding - a formulation sympathetic to Latin clarifications (see Filioque considerations below) while trying to avoid subordinating divinity.
 - Contrasts with simplistic modalist or tritheist readings by prioritizing ontological unity together with real personal relations.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Rigorous linking of relational origin (processio/spiration) to personal distinctiveness, using philosophical categories to secure orthodox paradoxes.
 - Operational model: creed as starting datum; analytic theology as service to faithful confession (a hallmark of "fides quaerens intellectum").

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly regarded in medieval Scholastic development as a bridge between patristic Trinitarianism and later systematic theology.
 - Influential on later Latin treatments of the procession of the Spirit; cited in medieval disputations over the Filioque and in manuals for teaching the creed.
 - Reformed tradition: valued for methodological clarity and emphasis on scripture/creedal primacy; less emphasis on speculative ontological proofs in some Protestant receptions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined way to treat paradoxical doctrine: start with received confession, then use reason to clarify terms without dissolving mystery.
 - Useful in ecumenical teaching as an exemplar of how Latin theology sought to stay faithful to creed while engaging rational exposition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Essentia / Substantia** - the single divine being shared by Father, Son, Spirit.
- **Persona** - the real personal "who" in the Godhead; not mere mask or mode.
- **Relatio** - relational property; Anselm makes relations the principle of personal distinction.
- **Principium (principle of origin)** - the source or origin (begetting, procession) that grounds personhood.
- **Processio / Spiratio** - procession/spiration of the Spirit; Anselm explains procession in relational terms (relevant to Filioque debates).
 - Use: defends coherence of Latin formulae while stressing monarchy of the Father as origin.
- **Begetting (generatio)** - eternal begetting of the Son from the Father; grounds Son's personhood.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God in himself (focus on relations of origin); Anselm seeks to talk about immanent distinctions responsibly.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's self-revelation in salvation history; creed links economic confession to immanent reality.
- **Analogia / analogical predication** - language about God is analogical, not univocal; preserves true predication without equivocation.
- **Fides quaerens intellectum (faith seeking understanding)** - operative methodological motto: confession first, reason to follow.
- **Creedal authority (Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed)** - starting datum for theological analysis and polemic.
- **Filioque (from the Son)** - Anselm treats procession language in a way congenial to Western addition while attempting to respect the Father's monarchy.
 - Use: deployed apologetically to defend Latin formulation against charges of innovation.
- **Knowability / demonstrability of God** - Anselm connects confession to rational knowledge; while other works (Proslogion) offer ontological arguments, here he stresses that God can be spoken of analogically and rationally clarified.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for medieval conceptual vocabulary on persona, relatio, and principium.
 - As a **polemic and pedagogical model** in Filioque and creed disputes - an attempt to reconcile Latin formulae with orthodox patristic categories.
 - As an **exegetical-conceptual pivot** for teaching the relationship between creed, revelation, and rational theology (useful in Trinitarian loci and in discussions of divine knowability).
