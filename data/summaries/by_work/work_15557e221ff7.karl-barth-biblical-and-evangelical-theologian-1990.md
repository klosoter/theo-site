### TITLE
**Karl Barth: Biblical and Evangelical Theologian** - Thomas F. Torrance (1990)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century reassessment of Karl Barth within Reformed and ecumenical theology; Torrance (a Scottish Reformed theologian) writes to reclaim Barth as properly *biblical* and *evangelical*, not merely modern dogmaticist.
 - Dialogue occurs against post-war neo-orthodoxy, ongoing Catholic-Protestant exchanges (e.g., Rahner), and debates over natural theology and modern liberalism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth should be read as a theologian whose *primary commitment is to Scripture and the evangelical proclamation of Jesus Christ*; his radical reformulations (including his reply to Rahner's Rule) aim to secure the Trinity, revelation, and Christology against anthropocentrism and natural theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defence of Barth's biblicality: Barth's use of Scripture is neither fundamentalist nor merely historical-critical but scriptural-theological and Christocentric.
 - Christocentric ordering of dogmatics: Jesus Christ is the *normative* disclosure of God; doctrine of God must be formed from the economy of revelation.
 - Engagement with Rahner and others:
 - Presents Rahner's Rule ("the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity") as a starting point.
 - Explains Barth's reformulation that preserves the priority of revelation in Christ - the immanent life of God is intelligible only through the self-revealing act in history.
 - Methodological claim: dogmatic realism grounded in the event of revelation; repudiation of autonomous natural theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Karl Barth (primary), Karl Rahner (explicit interlocutor via "Rahner's Rule and Barth's Reformulation"), Reformation theologians (Luther, Calvin), patristic resources, opponents in liberal theology and 19th-century Protestantism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and the Word of God; Trinity (economic/immanent relation); Christology (incarnation as revelation); election; atonement; Scripture and its authority; critique of natural theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Torrance locates Barth at the intersection of biblical fidelity and evangelical dogmatics: theology must begin with the self-revealing God in Christ, so that doctrine of God is shaped by the economy of revelation rather than by human speculation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that Barth is fundamentally *biblical* and *evangelical*, not merely dialectical or anti-historical.
 - Prioritizes the *event* of revelation (Christ) as ontologically decisive for theology.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Reframes Barth against Rahner: while Rahner universalizes the economic/immanent equation, Barth insists on revelation's priority - the immanent Trinity is known only through the economy; Torrance highlights Barth's corrective to anthropocentric theologies and speculative natural theology.
 - Counters liberalism and Schleiermacherian reductions by recovering the objective initiative of God.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on the Word as personal and eventful (not merely propositional).
 - Use of Christocentric dogmatic ordering to reconfigure classical loci.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Helped consolidate Barth's reputation within contemporary Reformed and evangelical circles; influenced ecumenical debates about revelation and natural theology.
 - Read widely by theologians seeking a robust doctrine of revelation and a Christ-centered dogmatics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies a non-reductive way to read Barth as a constructive, biblical theologian; valuable for doctrine, systematic method, and ecumenical dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The heuristic that the economic Trinity (God as revealed in salvation history) corresponds to the immanent Trinity (God in God's own life).

- **Barth's reformulation**
 - Torrance's reading: Barth re-orders Rahner by insisting revelation in Christ is determinative - we know the immanent Trinity only through the economic.

- **Revelation (event)**
 - Revelation is a historical, personal act in Jesus Christ that discloses God's being; epistemic priority over speculative theology.

- **Word of God**
 - The living, personal Word (Jesus Christ) and Scripture as witness to that Word; central norm for theology.

- **Christocentrism**
 - Doctrine and method arranged around the person and work of Christ as the decisive disclosure of God.

- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity**
 - Economic = God's external self‑communication in history; Immanent = inner life of God; Torrance explains Barth's insistence that the economic grounds any legitimate speech about the immanent.

- **Natural theology (critique)**
 - Rejected in its autonomous form; human reason cannot construct the immanent Trinity apart from revelation.

- **Dialectical theology**
 - Method emphasizing divine otherness and paradox; Torrance nuances this, stressing Barth's constructive biblical commitments rather than pure negativity.

- **Election**
 - Viewed Christocentrically: election is God's loving choice realized in Christ for humanity.

- **Scriptural primacy**
 - Scripture as authoritative witness to the Word; not a mere source among others but the formative medium for dogmatics.

- **Atonement / reconciliation**
 - Central theological consequence of revelation in Christ; grounds doctrine of God and human salvation.

- **Dogmatic realism**
 - Theology as faithful articulation of revealed truth, not speculative metaphysics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for reading Barth as a genuinely evangelical, Scripture-centered theologian.
- As a **polemic** in theological-method debates (against Rahnerian reductionism and liberal theology).
- As an **exegetical model** for doing dogmatics: order doctrine by Christological revelation rather than abstract speculation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical discussions about the relation between economic and immanent Trinity.
