### TITLE
Princeton Theological Seminary Lectures (archival material) - Charles Hodge: Kenosis Theories and Critiques

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Princeton Seminary milieu; conservative Reformed response to German critical and speculative theology. Lectures delivered in an era of growing kenotic proposals (continental Protestant circles) and rising historical-critical methods. Hodge writes within Princetonian common-sense realism and confessional Calvinism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The kenotic interpretation of Phil 2:5-11 and related texts, which claims the Son emptied himself of certain divine attributes in the Incarnation, is a theological error that confuses economic accommodation with ontological change in the person and nature of the Son.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirm the classical distinction between *person* (hypostasis) and *nature* (ousia): the Second Person assumes a human nature without loss or change in the divine nature.
 - Defend divine immutability and impassibility as essential attributes incompatible with any real subtraction of deity.
 - Reinterpret kenotic texts as expressions of voluntary self-limitation in function and prerogative (economy), not metaphysical divestiture of attributes.
 - Exegetical moves: close reading of Phil 2, Luke and John passages; emphasize Christ's human experiences as genuine but not indicating loss of deity.
 - Practical-theological point: deny that kenosis safeguards genuine humanity at the cost of undermining atonement, mediatorial efficacy, or divine perfection.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Continental kenotic proponents (e.g., early Thomasius-type thinkers generically named), German speculative theologians and liberal exegetes; classical patristic and Reformation witnesses invoked for orthodoxy; Scripture and systematic theological categories primary authorities.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (incarnation, two natures), Trinity (economic vs. immanent relations), divine attributes (immutability, impassibility, omnipotence, omniscience), revelation and accommodation, soteriology implications (mediatorship and atonement).
- **Closing line:** Hodge centers the lectures on a classical Reformed insistence that the Incarnation involves the Son's addition of true humanity while preserving full and unaltered deity; perceived "emptying" is economic condescension, not ontological loss.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous application of person-nature metaphysics to protect the unity of the person of the Son while guarding the immutability of the divine nature.
 - Stress on the difference between *functional limitation* (Voluntary self-limitation in action) and *ontological subtraction* (loss of attributes).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit corrective to kenotic formulations that posit real divestiture of divine attributes; contrasts these with patristic-Reformation readings that maintain divine fullness.
 - Challenges modernizing exegetical tendencies that privilege experience or ethics over metaphysical categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not highly innovative; rather, Hodge refines and systematizes existing Reformed categories (e.g., economic/ontological distinction) and clarifies "emptying" as accommodation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential within Princeton and conservative Reformed circles; became a standard anti-kenotic reference in Anglo-American theology.
 - Served as a touchstone for 19th-20th century orthodox responses to liberal Christologies and later ecumenical debates about divine attributes and the incarnation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of disciplined exegetical-theological method combining Scripture, dogmatic categories, and pastoral concern.
 - Useful as a concise representative of classical Reformed resistance to kenotic hypotheses and as a pedagogical exemplar in Christology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis:** Greek for "emptying" (Phil 2); Hodge reads it as voluntary self-humbling and economical condescension, not loss of divine attributes.
- **Hypostasis (person):** The personal subject - the Second Person who assumes humanity; central to Hodge's defense against ontological kenosis.
- **Ousia (nature):** Divine and human natures; Hodge insists these remain distinct and unconfused in the one Christ.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Communication of properties - used to explain how divine and human predicates apply to one person without entailment of attribute-transfer or subtraction.
- **Immutability:** Divine unchangeableness; a non-negotiable attribute in Hodge's critique of any ontology that implies divine alteration.
- **Impassibility:** Freedom from suffering as an essential divine attribute that kenotic schemes risk compromising if they posit real subtraction.
- **Economic Trinity vs. Immanent Trinity:** Hodge emphasizes economic actions (roles, self-limitation) without altering immanent being; kenosis conflates economic function with ontological change.
- **Accommodation:** God's condescension in revelation and incarnation - Hodge's key category to reinterpret "emptying."
- **Humiliation (Christology):** The kenotic motif reinterpreted as Jesus' experience and function in the economy, distinct from divesting deity.
- **Philippians 2:5-11 (exegesis):** Central text; Hodge reads it christologically and liturgically, emphasizing voluntary humility, not metaphysical deprivation.
- **Mediatorship:** The efficacy of Christ's work depends on retained deity; Hodge warns kenosis undermines atonement if divinity is diminished.
- **Voluntary self-limitation:** Phrase used to capture what Hodge thinks "emptying" denotes - choice of functional restraint, not attribute loss.
- **Analogy of faith:** Methodological principle to interpret difficult texts in coherence with the whole Scripture and doctrine.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source/polemic**: canonical anti-kenotic statement used in Reformed polemics.
 - As an **exegetical-model**: guides readings of Phil 2 and incarnation texts emphasizing economy over ontology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: deployed in formulations preserving divine attributes in systematic theology and in soteriological argumentation.
