### TITLE
The Myth of Religious Violence - William T. Cavanaugh (Oxford University Press, 2009) 
Author: William Cavanaugh, Catholic political theologian; situated in late‑modern debates on secularism, post‑9/11 discourses, and political theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid post‑9/11 public debates about "religion" as the principal cause of violence and the rise of the "clash of civilizations" narrative.
 - Engages contemporary secularization theory, colonial history, and political theology; dialogues with scholarship by Talal Asad, Mark Juergensmeyer, Samuel Huntington, and Girardian sacrificial analysis.
 - Part of a broader move in theology to interrogate the category "religion" as a modern construct tied to state formation.

- **Central thesis**
 - The common claim that religion is uniquely prone to violence is a modern *myth*. The category "religion" itself is politically constructed by modern states; attributing violence to "religion" misidentifies the social and political sources of violence - notably state and imperial projects.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Genealogy of the category "religion":
 - "Religion" as a private, separable sphere emerges with European state formation and the project of establishing sovereign monopolies on legitimate violence.
 - Demythologizing religious violence:
 - Historical case studies show that many episodes labeled "religious violence" are better explained by political, economic, and imperial dynamics.
 - Critique of secular exceptionalism:
 - The secular state claims a monopoly on legitimate violence while presenting itself as nonviolent; this framing masks secular sources and forms of organized violence.
 - Constructive alternative:
 - Reframe analysis in terms of competing social orders and rival claims on people's allegiance; highlight liturgy and the Eucharist as a non‑sovereign, non‑sacrificial social ordering that resists state violence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Talal Asad (construction of "religion"), Samuel Huntington/Karen Armstrong (popularizers of religion‑as‑cause thesis), Mark Juergensmeyer (religious terrorism studies), Weber/Foucault on power and modernity, Girard on sacrificial violence.
 - Utilizes historical examples from European Reformations, colonial encounters, and modern wars.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology:** church as alternative social body; sacramental social ontology.
 - **Political theology:** sovereignty, state formation, legitimate violence.
 - **Sacramentology/Eucharist:** liturgy as formative, non‑violent social practice.
 - **Anthropology and sin:** sacrificial logic, idolatry of political order.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Cavanaugh reframes the problem of violence: theologically, the decisive contrast is not "religious" versus "secular" but between rival orders of social life - the Eucharistic, non‑sacrificial community of Christ and the sovereign political orders that legitimize violence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats "religion" as a modern political category rather than an ancient or neutral descriptive term.
 - Locates much large‑scale violence in secular political projects (state, empire) that portray themselves as nonreligious.
 - Elevates liturgy/Eucharist to central explanatory status for social formation and nonviolent community‑building.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters the "religion‑causes‑violence" trope popularized in mass media and some social science; opposes Huntington/Armstrong simplifications.
 - Contrasts with approaches that secularize violence by isolating religion as an explanatory variable; instead reads historical conflicts through political sovereignty, property, and empire.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Myth of religious violence" as a diagnostic phrase: myth = explanatory style with political function.
 - Emphasis on **social ontology** of worship: liturgy constitutive of social bonds rather than mere private belief.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in political theology, peace studies, and religious studies; influential in critiques of secularism and in ecclesial discussions about public witness and nonviolence.
 - Adopted in Catholic and ecumenical conversations about church/state relations; provoked debate among historians and social scientists about category usage.

- **Enduring value**
 - Forces theologians and historians to question categories and to trace political interests behind explanatory frameworks.
 - Provides a constructive ecclesiological vision linking liturgy to social ethics and resistance to oppressive sovereignties.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Myth of religious violence** - the claim that religion uniquely causes violence; understood as a politically useful explanatory myth.
- **Religion (as modern category)** - a constructed, privatized sphere arising with modern state sovereignty; not a timeless category.
- **Secularism / secular state** - treated not as neutral but as an order that legitimates its own forms of violence while denying their religiosity.
- **Sovereignty** - modern political principle that monopolizes legitimate violence and defines public/private divisions.
- **Sacrificial logic** - the mechanism by which rival social orders create enemies and legitimize violence (Girardian resonance).
- **Liturgy / Eucharist** - formative practices that create a non‑sovereign social body; proposed as antidote to sacrificial, state‑based order.
- **Religious freedom (privacy of religion)** - modern invention that privatizes religious claim-making and thus protects state sovereignty.
- **Colonialism / imperial violence** - analyzed as often secular projects mislabeled or misread as religious conflict.
- **Political theology** - framework employed to analyze how theological categories shape and are shaped by power.
- **Social ontology** - liturgy and rituals as constitutive of communal identity and social ordering.
- **Pluralism** - surface description; Cavanaugh urges deeper analysis of competing allegiances and juridical claims.
- **Idolatry (political idolatry)** - theological term applied to the elevation of state or nation as ultimate loyalty.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against common media/social‑science narratives that isolate "religion" as the root cause of violence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in political theology and ecclesiology to recast liturgy as social formation and to critique secular sovereignty.
 - As a **methodological exemplar** for genealogical critique of categories (useful in historical theology and religious studies).
