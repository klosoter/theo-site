### TITLE
COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST AND SECOND EPISTLES TO THE THESSALONIANS - Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Presbyterianism; produced within the Princeton theological milieu (conservative, confessional Reformed scholarship).
 - Hodge writes as pastor-theologian: exegetical commentary with pastoral application, resisting both sensational popular millenarianism and loose allegorizing.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Exposition of Paul's pastoral responses to Thessalonian anxieties about the return of Christ: clarifying the nature and timing of the Parousia, the resurrection, judgment, and the reality of apostasy culminating in a future antagonist (the "man of lawlessness"/Antichrist).
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close verse-by-verse exegesis grounded in the Greek text and in Reformed dogmatics.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish Pauline authorship and pastoral context: persecution, confusion about dead believers and the Day of the Lord.
 - Affirm the objective, future Parousia and bodily resurrection as the locus of Christian hope and consolation.
 - Explicate 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12: the necessity of a future apostasy, the revelation of a personal "man of lawlessness," and the role of a present "restraining" power whose removal precedes full manifestation.
 - Apply eschatology to ethics: sanctification, patient endurance, and ecclesial order in expectation of Christ's return.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Paul and the Thessalonian church (primary).
 - Engages patristic and Reformed commentators, and contemporary exegetes of the 19th century; dialogues implicitly with popular millennialists and spiritualizers.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (Second Coming, Parousia, Day of the Lord), soteriology (resurrection, consolation of believers), ecclesiology (discipline, order), pneumatology (restraining influence), inspiration and Pauline authorship.
- **Closing line**
 - Hodge's commentary centers biblical consolation upon a sober, future, bodily return of Christ, coupling rigorous exegesis with pastoral exhortation to holiness while awaiting final vindication.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Firm insistence on a literal, future Parousia and bodily resurrection as the primary interpretive key for Thessalonian texts.
 - Pastoral-analytic method: doctrinal exposition proceeds from and serves pastoral needs (comfort, order, hope).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Over-optimistic sensational millenarian schemes that collapse chronology or spiritualize prophetic figures.
 - Hasty preterist or purely allegorical readings that deny future fulfillment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear delineation of the "man of lawlessness" as a future personal antagonist and of the "restrainer" as a present restraining agency whose removal permits greater apostasy - argued prudently rather than dogmatically about its precise identity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in 19th-century and later Reformed circles as a reliable, conservative exegetical resource on Thessalonians.
 - Influenced Princeton exegesis and pastoral preaching on eschatology; frequently cited in polemics against speculative end-time schemes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of disciplined, text-centered Reformed commentary: valuable for its balance of exegesis, doctrinal clarity, and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia (Second Coming)** - treated as imminent in expectation but future in fulfillment; the primary hope and doctrinal center.
- **Day of the Lord** - eschatological day of final judgment and vindication; not yet accomplished.
- **Resurrection of the dead** - bodily, general resurrection is affirmed and explained as ground for comfort.
- **Man of lawlessness / man of sin** - presented as a future, personal antagonist whose appearance follows apostasy.
 - Hodge rejects the view that this figure was already revealed in Paul's day.
- **Restrainer** - a present agency or power that restrains the full development of lawlessness until removed; Hodge treats its identity cautiously (practical restraint rather than speculative identification).
- **Apostasy (falling away)** - a necessary antecedent condition to the revealing of the man of lawlessness.
- **Wrath and judgment** - tied to final vindication; used to exhort holy living.
- **Imminence vs. sequence** - Hodge stresses both the imminence of Christ's return for believers' hope and the real sequence of events (apostasy, revealing) before final consummation.
- **Comfort (paraklesis)** - pastoral function of eschatology: to console grieving communities with doctrinal certainty.
- **Apostolic authority / tradition** - Hodge defends Pauline authority and instruction as normative for church order and hope.
- **Inspiration and exegetical method** - literal/grammatical-historical reading within Reformed doctrinal commitments.
- **Sanctification / ethics** - eschatology drives ethical exhortation: watchfulness, diligence, and charity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for conservative, text-driven commentary on Pauline eschatology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both speculative futurism and over-spiritualizing/preterist readings.
 - As a **definition source** in Reformed teaching for the "man of lawlessness" and the pastoral role of eschatology.
