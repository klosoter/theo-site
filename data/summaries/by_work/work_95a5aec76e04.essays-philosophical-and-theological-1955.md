### TITLE
Essays Philosophical and Theological (Rudolf Bultmann, 1955)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar Germany (1950s); Bultmann writing at the intersection of New Testament scholarship and existentialist philosophy. Responds to modern philosophy (notably Heidegger), historical-critical methods (form criticism), and contemporary theological debates (Barthian dialectical theology, neo-orthodoxy).
 - A collection aimed at clarifying methodological ties between philosophy and theology and to press a programmatic hermeneutic for New Testament proclamation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must "demythologize" the mythological worldview of the New Testament without abandoning its kerygmatic center; the task is to translate the early Christian proclamation into existential categories intelligible for modern persons while preserving its salvific claim.
 - Doctrinally, this raises questions about the ontological status of Trinity, Christological assertions, sacraments, and the Church when historicist/metaphysical assumptions are suspended.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: modernity has invalidated myth-metaphysics; theology cannot simply repeat mythic language as literal description.
 - Hermeneutical move: employ form criticism and existential hermeneutics to distinguish kerygma (proclamation) from mythical cosmology and to grasp the event-character of revelation.
 - Constructive move: reconstrue doctrines (Trinity, Christology, sacraments, ecclesiology) as communicative, existential events rather than primarily metaphysical descriptions.
 - Emphasizes encounter and faith as the locus of theological truth.
 - Seeks to preserve historical-critical rigor while defending the church's proclamation as existentially authoritative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophical interlocutors: Heidegger (existential ontology), Kierkegaardic emphases on faith and existence.
 - Theological interlocutors: Barth (dialectical theology), traditional formulations of Trinity and sacraments, and Reformation ecclesiology (especially visible/invisible church distinctions).
 - Methodological interlocutors: form critics and historical-critical scholars.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation as event vs. propositional content; Christology (kerygmatic Christ as event); Trinity (economic vs. ontological formulations); Pneumatology (personhood and activity of the Spirit in proclamation); Ecclesiology and sacraments (Lord's Supper presence, admission/fencing); Church-state relations; sin understood existentially.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Theology's primary task is to re-present the kerygma as an existential, eventive revelation intelligible to modernity - preserving salvific claim while abandoning mythological ontology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong programmatic linking of form criticism with existentialist hermeneutics: biblical texts are primarily kerygmatic forms that demand existential appropriation.
 - Emphasizes the event-character of revelation and sacraments: presence is primarily an encounter of faith, not a metaphysical immanence.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Barthian metaphysical insistence on divine transcendence by stressing existential encounter over ontological speculation.
 - Moves beyond liberal historicism by refusing to reduce proclamation to mere historical reportage or ethical teaching.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitation of the term "demythologization" as a constructive theological method rather than mere dismissal of myth.
 - Rearticulation of the ontological/economic Trinity distinction as a hermeneutical tool: doctrine must be judged by its kerygmatic function.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in mid-20th-century Protestant theology, biblical studies, and the demythologizing movement; galvanized debates with conservatives (who accused relativizing historicity) and with Barthian critics (on the place of metaphysics).
 - Stimulated renewed attention to hermeneutics, form criticism, and the theological meaning of rites and ecclesial structures.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for reading NT proclamation in modern contexts; valuable for teaching methods, for theological retrieval without naive literalism, and for disciplined engagement with modern philosophy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologization**
 - Method of translating mythological language into existential categories while retaining kerygmatic content.
- **Kerygma**
 - The early Christian proclamation as the central theological locus; primary object of hermeneutics.
- **Myth / Mythical world-picture**
 - Cosmological elements of NT narrative to be reinterpreted rather than dismissed wholesale.
- **Existential hermeneutics**
 - Interpretation informed by existential ontology (Heidegger/Kierkegaard) focusing on decision, guilt, and authentic existence.
- **Form criticism**
 - Historical-critical method used to isolate forms of proclamation and their original social use.
- **Ontological vs Economic Trinity**
 - Distinction used to argue that doctrine should arise from the economy of revelation (what God does) rather than speculative metaphysics about God's being.
 - Bultmann stresses economic account as the proper theological starting point.
- **Eternal generation and spiration**
 - Treated cautiously: doctrine must be retained insofar as it serves kerygmatic expression, not pursued as speculative ontology.
- **Visible / Invisible Church**
 - Retrieval of a Reformation-type distinction: ecclesial existence has a visible form but true church is defined by eventive encounter with Christ through proclamation.
- **Lord's Supper: Presence and Admission**
 - Eucharist understood principally as proclamation-event; presence of Christ is existentially mediated in faith rather than metaphysical local presence; discipline/fencing should serve proclamation and faith-appropriation.
- **Church and State Relations**
 - Emphasizes church's vocation as proclamation-community with pastoral autonomy, though forms of public order require negotiated stance.
- **Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit**
 - Pneumatology grounded in the Spirit's role in enabling existential appropriation of the kerygma.
- **Doctrine of Sin**
 - Existential anthropology: sin as estrangement and refusal of authentic existence; not reducible to legal categories.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **hermeneutical model** for preaching and biblical interpretation (kerygma-centered).
 - As a **polemic and pivot** in debates over historicity, sacraments, and Trinitarian ontology - deployed both by critics and reformers to argue method and limits.
 - As a **definition source** for demythologization and existential approaches to doctrine in modern theological curricula.
