### TITLE
**The Eschatology of the New Testament Church** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (essay in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed apologetic/theological conversation; contribution to a collected critique of theonomy and related contemporary movements.
 - Situated within renewed Reformed interest in biblical theology, covenantal continuity, and critiques of both dispensational futurism and radical "realized" eschatologies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents the Christian eschaton as both already inaugurated in Christ (resurrection/ascension/Spirit) and still future in final consummation; the apparent paradox of the *delay of the Parousia* must be understood in this "already/not‑yet" framework.
 - The apostolic witnesses reframe imminent expectation without abandoning hope, supplying theological and pastoral resources for life in the interim.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of NT texts that affirm present eschatological reality (resurrection, Spirit, kingdom signs) - these constitute the *inauguration* of the eschaton.
 - Exposition of NT warnings, prayers, and promises that maintain an objectively future consummation (parousia, final judgment, consummated new creation).
 - Discussion of the *delay of the Parousia*: theological causes and pastoral effects
 - Delay is not a failure of prophetic prediction but a deliberate providential interval that extends mission, calls for perseverance, and tests fidelity.
 - Apostolic literature interprets delay as a moral and ecclesial opportunity: exhortations to holiness, patience, proclamation, and stewardship.
 - Polemic against extremes:
 - Rejection of full "realized eschatology" that collapses the future into the present.
 - Critique of eschatologies that privatize or temporize the kingdom (dispensational separation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Pauline corpus, Johannine writings, Petrine epistles, synoptic eschatological sayings.
 - Secondary: interlocution with modern scholarly positions on realized eschatology and futurism (implicitly engaging Doddian and Schweitzerian lines and contemporary formulations).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (resurrection and enthronement as eschatological center), Pneumatology (Spirit as present eschatological agent), Covenant and kingdom theology, revelation (apostolic interpretation of eschatological promise), ecclesiology (church in the interim), soteriology and ethical ramifications (sanctification, perseverance).
- **Closing line**
 - The NT church lives under the decisive inaugurated reign of Christ while awaiting a true, objective consummation; the *delay of the Parousia* is providential and formative, calling the church to faithful witness and holy living in patient hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong articulation of *inaugurated eschatology* as the hermeneutical key: the eschaton is both present in Christ and not exhausted until the Parousia.
 - Emphasis on the *probative and providential* character of the delay - delay as a salvificly meaningful epoch for mission and sanctification.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects over-realized readings that spiritualize away future hope; counters futurist/dispensational isolationism that denies present eschatological reality.
 - Restores apostolic pastoral strategy as normative for dealing with delay: interpretive reframing plus ethical exhortation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tightening of the language around "inauguration" and "delay" to keep theological tension without collapse into paradox or contradiction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed circles as a concise defense of classic "already/not‑yet" schemata. Frequently cited in discussions about the relation of kingdom realities to future expectation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies pastoral implications of eschatological tension; serves as a compact bridge between exegetical detail and systematic application for preaching and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia** - the future, final coming of Christ; retained as the decisive eschatological event.
- **Delay of the Parousia** - the temporal interval between inaugural fulfillment and final consummation; treated as providential, not accidental.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - doctrine that the eschaton has begun in Christ (resurrection/ascension/Spirit) but awaits consummation.
- **Already/not‑yet** - shorthand for the twofold temporal reality of salvation: present possession and future fulfillment.
- **Realized eschatology** - tendency that Gaffin critiques when it removes future consummation from theological horizon.
- **Futurism/dispensationalism** - positions critiqued to the degree they separate present kingdom realities from Christ's present reign.
- **Kingdom of God** - understood both as present reign (inaugurated) and future consummated realm.
- **Resurrection and Ascension** - central Christological events marking inauguration of eschatological reality.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit)** - Spirit as the present agent of eschatological presence and guarantee of future consummation.
- **Covenant continuity** - the motif that the eschatological promises are fulfilled in Christ without radical discontinuity.
- **Mission and witness** - the church's activity commissioned into the delay period as purposeful.
- **Perseverance and holiness** - ethical demands grounded in present eschatological status and future hope.
- **Eschatological hope** - sustained forward-looking trust anchored in Christ's completed work and promised return.
- **Apostolic hermeneutic** - the way NT writers reinterpret prophetic imminence for communities living through delay.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise exegetical-model for reading NT texts within an inaugurated eschatology framework.
 - As a polemic resource against both over-realized and over-futurist eschatologies.
 - As a definitional source in Reformed teaching for the theological meaning and pastoral significance of the parousia's delay.
