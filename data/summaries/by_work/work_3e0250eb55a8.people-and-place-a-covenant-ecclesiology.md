### TITLE
**People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology** - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 2000s Reformed retrieval, amid postliberal and communio ecclesiologies, evangelical pragmatism, and culture-war politics.
 - Fourth volume in Horton's covenantal dogmatics (following Eschatology, Christology, Soteriology), offering an ecclesiology shaped by covenant and eschatology.
- **Central thesis**
 - The church is the **covenant people** gathered by the **Word and Spirit** in specific **places** through **ordinary means of grace**, as an **embassy of the heavenly kingdom** journeying as a **pilgrim people** until consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - From **revelation to assembly**: God's speaking creates a people; Scripture norms and forms the church.
 - **Covenant identity**: oath-bound promises make the church; baptism and Supper as covenant signs and seals.
 - **Marks and ministry**: preaching, sacraments, and discipline define the church's essence and mission.
 - **Offices and order**: Christ rules his church by ordained ministry for public Word-and-Sacrament service.
 - **Presence and place**: ascended Christ present by the Spirit; church as temple-in-pilgrimage, an embassy of the age to come.
 - **Two kingdoms and mission**: distinguish church's redemptive ministry from common cultural callings; resist ecclesial politicization and consumerism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic and Reformation: Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Bucer; confessional standards (Heidelberg Catechism, Westminster).
 - Dialogues and contrasts: Rome and Eastern Orthodoxy (communio, sacramentality), Anabaptist and free-church traditions, Barth and postliberalism (actualism, narrative), Zizioulas (eucharistic ontology), Hauerwas, Radical Orthodoxy, evangelical revivalism and pragmatism.
 - Covenant theology stream (Klinean influence) and classic Reformed scholastic categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology**: Scripture's primacy in constituting and regulating the church; preaching as divine address.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit's agency in uniting to Christ through Word and sacrament; gifts ordered to edification.
 - **Soteriology**: union with Christ, justification and sanctification in ecclesial context; covenant of grace and election in relation to the visible church.
 - **Christology**: ascension, session, and real presence by the Spirit in the Supper.
 - **Covenant theology**: people and place as covenantal categories; signs and seals; discipline as covenant nurture.
- **Closing line**
 - The church is where the **ascended Christ addresses and feeds his covenant people by the Spirit through Word and sacrament**, forming a pilgrim embassy of the world to come.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Covenant-structured ecclesiology**: identity arises from God's oath and promise, not from sociological or liturgical ontology.
 - **Word precedes church**: the canon creates the congregation; preaching is constitutive.
 - **Ordinary means** as strategy of mission: God's presence and power are tethered to public Word and sacraments.
 - **Ascension-centered presence**: Christ localizes his presence by the Spirit in the assembly, not by spatial localization of his flesh.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - To **eucharistic or communio ontologies**: resists collapsing the church's being into the sacrament; insists on covenantal and promissory grounding.
 - To **evangelical voluntarism and consumerism**: rejects programmatic activism, celebrity leadership, and ritual minimalism; retrieves offices, discipline, and confessional catechesis.
 - To **transformationist or ecclesiocratic politics**: upholds a Reformed two-kingdoms distinction; cautions against politicizing the church's ministry.
 - To **individualism**: emphasizes membership, catholicity, and the church as mother of believers.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - **Embassy of the kingdom**: the church as a representative outpost of the heavenly city.
 - **Pilgrim people and place**: eschatological tension shaping worship, mission, and discipleship.
 - **Oath-signs and seals**: sacraments as promissory, covenant-making acts, not mere symbols nor automatic causes.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries for ecclesiology and sacramentology; a touchstone for **ordinary means** and **two-kingdoms** conversation.
 - Engages broader ecumenical debates; appreciated for clarity even by critics of its two-kingdoms posture.
- **Enduring value**
 - A concise, confessional map for pastors and students linking ecclesiology to revelation, Christology, and eschatology; a corrective to both high-church ontologizing and low-church pragmatism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word creates the church**: God's speech, inscripturated and preached, brings the church into being and orders its life.
- **Ordinary means of grace**: preaching, sacraments, and prayer as the divinely instituted conduits of Christ's presence and gifts.
- **Covenant of grace**: the promissory framework establishing the church as God's people across redemptive history.
- **Signs and seals**:
 - **Baptism**: initiatory sign of incorporation into Christ and his covenant community.
 - **Lord's Supper**: nourishing sign of participation in Christ by the Spirit; real presence without localizing Christ's body.
- **Marks of the church**: pure preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and exercise of discipline.
- **Visible / invisible church**: empirical assembly and the elect known to God; held together by covenant administration.
- **Ascension and session**: Christ's heavenly reign grounds his mediated presence and the church's pilgrim posture.
- **Two kingdoms**: distinction between Christ's redemptive rule in the church and his providential rule in common culture.
- **Offices and keys**: ordained ministry, with Word and discipline as Christ's instruments to bind and loose.
- **Catholicity and apostolicity**: unity across time and space under apostolic doctrine and common worship.
- **Temple and place**: church as eschatological temple, gathered in concrete locales as anticipations of the heavenly city.
- **Pilgrim people**: identity and mission marked by already/not yet, patience, and hope.
- **Means over methods**: principled critique of technique-driven ministry; reliance on instituted means.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Bibliology**: to argue that Scripture norms and constitutes ecclesial life; preaching as divine address.
 - **Pneumatology**: to frame the Spirit's agency as tethered to Word and sacrament.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: as a definition source for marks, offices, and sacramental presence.
 - **Public theology**: as a conceptual pivot for two-kingdoms distinctions and the church's pilgrim mission.
