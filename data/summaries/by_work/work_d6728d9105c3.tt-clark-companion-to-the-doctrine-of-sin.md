### TITLE
T&T Clark Companion to the Doctrine of Sin - Adam J. Johnson (editor)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** A 21st‑century, ecumenical companion aimed at consolidating recent advances in hamartiology within systematic theology, biblical studies, ethics, pastoral theology, and interdisciplinary conversation (philosophy, social theory). Situated amid renewed interest in social and structural accounts of sin and in retrievals of classical resources (Augustine, Calvin) alongside feminist, liberation, and analytic critiques.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To reconceive and map the doctrine of sin so it addresses both traditional loci (original sin, culpability, imputation, concupiscence) and contemporary concerns (structural sin, social injustice, gendered and ecological harms), holding together biblical exegesis, historical retrieval, and constructive systematic reflection.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: Biblical and exegetical foundations - Genesis, Pauline anthropology, wisdom literature, prophetic indictments of communal sin.
 - Part II: Historical theology - major formulations from patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern debates (Augustine/Pelagius, Anselm/Aquinas, Luther/Calvin, later Protestant and Catholic developments).
 - Part III: Systematic and philosophical analysis - models of human nature, agency, culpability, and the metaphysics/epistemology of moral failure.
 - Part IV: Contextual and constructive moves - social/structural sin, feminist and liberation critiques, pastoral theology, penitential and restorative practices.
 - Concluding essays synthesize hamartiology with soteriology, ecclesiology, and ethics, proposing plural but integrated categories for contemporary confession and praxis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Pelagius, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Barth and other moderns, alongside contemporary interpreters in feminist, liberation, postcolonial, and analytic theology; engagement with social theorists where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated:** Hamartiology (sin), anthropology, original sin, free will and depravity, imputation/representation, grace, Christology (atonement and the undoing of sin), soteriology, ecclesiology (sin, discipline, sacraments), ethics and social justice, pastoral care.
- **Closing line:** A capacious, ecumenical resources volume that reframes sin not merely as individual guilt but as relational, structural, and theological reality demanding integrated biblical, historical, and practical responses.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Integrates **individual and structural** accounts of sin rather than pitting them against each other.
 - Stresses the necessity of **biblical exegesis** to ground ethical and systematic claims about sin.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against reductive forensic models that isolate sin solely in legal terms, while retaining their pastoral and doctrinal utility.
 - Challenges purely privatized modern views of sin by foregrounding communal and institutional dimensions emphasized in prophetic and social theology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Promotes layered language: **personal sin, corporate sin, structural/constitutive sin**, and **sin as relational rupture** (disordered love or broken covenant).
 - Encourages clarity between **peccability/impassibility** debates, **imputation vs representation**, and **ontological vs forensic** descriptions of human depravity.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Adopted as a standard reference in seminary hamartiology courses across traditions; especially useful in Reformed contexts for rearticulating doctrines of original sin and covenant headship in light of modern ethical concerns.
 - Influential beyond Reformed circles for bringing analytic precision to pastoral and liberationist critiques.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable as a teaching anthology that pairs historical retrieval with contemporary constructive proposals.
 - Functions as a bridge between exegesis, doctrinal history, and applied ethics - suited for advanced seminars and faculty reference.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hamartiology:** The study of sin as a theological locus; the volume supplies scriptural, historical, and systematic frames.
- **Original sin:** Treatment includes Augustinian formulations, Reformation emphases, and modern critiques; distinctions between corruption, privation, and inherited guilt.
- **Imputation vs representation:** Clarifies forensic accounting (imputation) and relational/mediatorial models (federal headship and representation).
- **Total depravity (scope vs degree):** Discusses what "total" means - pervasive effect on faculties, not absolute annihilation of ability to respond to grace.
- **Concupiscence:** Explored as inclination/disorder of desire and its place in medieval and Protestant accounts.
- **Personal sin:** Individual moral failures, culpability, repentance, and confession.
- **Corporate/structural sin:** Social institutions and practices that embody and reproduce injustice; demands systemic repentance and reform.
- **Sin as disordered love:** Augustinian motif recovered and balanced with social-ethical readings.
- **Forensic vs ontological categories:** Distinguishes legal/declarative status from ontological condition of the person.
- **Peccability/impassibility:** Debates about human susceptibility to sin pre- and post-fall; implications for Christology and pastoral care.
- **Repentance and penitential practice:** Practical theology section linking doctrine to discipline, reconciliation, and restorative justice.
- **Redemption/atonement link:** How doctrines of sin shape and are shaped by theories of atonement (satisfaction, Christus Victor, penal substitution, restorative models).
- **Social theory resources:** Uses sociological and philosophical tools to analyze structural sin and moral responsibility.
- **Ecumenical retrieval:** Synthesis of diverse confessional vocabularies for shared doctrinal conversation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for nuanced hamartiological terms in systematic theology and exegesis.
 - As a **polemic and corrective** resource against privatized or overly forensic accounts of sin.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis, Pauline anthropology, and prophetic social critique in tandem.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking sin doctrine to atonement, ecclesial discipline, and public ethics.
