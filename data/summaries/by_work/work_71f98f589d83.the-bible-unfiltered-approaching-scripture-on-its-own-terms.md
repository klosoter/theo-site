### TITLE
The Bible Unfiltered: Approaching Scripture on Its Own Terms - Michael S. Heiser (Lexham Press, 2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Popular-evangelical biblical-theology intervention in the 2010s. Written for pastors, students, and informed laity reacting against modernizing or naturalizing readings of Scripture. Draws on advances in ANE studies, Septuagint scholarship, and online engagement culture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Read Scripture according to the worldview embedded in the texts themselves (the ancient Israelite/early Jewish and early Christian supernatural framework), not through modern filters that neutralize its supernatural claims. This has direct consequences for how OT and NT data bear on the doctrine of God (including plurality language) and Jesus' identity.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):**
 - Method: adopt the Bible's own ancient Near Eastern/Second Temple categories; avoid anachronistic theological impositions.
 - Descriptive survey: identify texts that presuppose an "unseen realm" (divine council language, "gods," angelic figures, the Angel of Yahweh, Psalm 82, Genesis 1:26).
 - Comparative evidence: consult the Septuagint, Ugaritic and other ANE parallels to clarify idiom and categories.
 - Canonical reading: show how NT writers assume and reframe OT categories, culminating in revelation of Jesus and the Spirit without forcing modern creedal categories onto earlier texts.
 - Theological implications: reconfigure angelology, monotheism, and doctrine of revelation in light of the Bible's own trajectory toward the fuller revelation of the triune God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Uses OT texts (Genesis, Psalms, Exodus), key passages (Psalm 82, Genesis 1:26, appearances of the Angel of the LORD), Septuagint renderings, and ANE parallels. Interacts broadly with modern conservative scholars and popular interpreters who secularize or allegorize texts.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, divine ontology (divinity language in OT/NT), angelology/divine council, Christology, implicit issues touching on Trinity and monotheism.
- **Closing line:** 
 - Heiser insists that letting Scripture speak in its own ancient supernatural categories reorients theology: the Bible reveals a divine plurality within a monotheistic framework that the NT progressively clarifies in the person and work of Jesus and the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The "unseen realm" and **divine council** are central heuristic devices - not exotic additions but integral to many biblical texts when read on their own terms.
 - Strong corrective against modern demythologizing: Heiser privileges literal reading of supernatural claims where the text plainly intends them.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges scholars/readers who read Genesis 1:26, Psalm 82, and OT "gods" as purely rhetorical, metaphorical, or later theological corruption.
 - Contrasts with strict monotheistic filters that erase or reinterpret references to other divine beings, arguing instead for a hierarchical divine plural reality under Yahweh's supremacy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes "unseen realm" phrasing for pedagogical use; reframes "gods" (elohim) and "sons of God" language in canonical, polyvocal context rather than modern monotheistic assumptions.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and lay circles; helped normalize divine-council readings in churches and Bible studies. Scholarly reception mixed: praised for invigorating attention to ANE contexts, critiqued by some for overstating certain textual connections or popularizing contested reconstructions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - As a methodological corrective and mnemonic for taking biblical supernatural language seriously; a practical bridge between ANE scholarship and congregational teaching; useful for re-evaluating how OT categories inform Christology and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Unseen realm** - shorthand for the biblical portrayal of a supernatural world of divine beings and spirits that interact with human history.
- **Divine council** - assembly of heavenly beings (attested in Psalm 82, 1 Kings 22, etc.); read as a real, hierarchical institution under Yahweh.
- **Elohim** - plural-form divine term; Heiser stresses canonical context to discern when it refers to Yahweh, other divine beings, or human judges.
- **Psalm 82** - flagship text for divine-council argument; Heiser treats its "gods" and their judgment as central evidence.
- **Genesis 1:26 ("Let us make")** - read as internal plurality language connected to the divine council idiom, not necessarily anachronistic Trinitarian proof-text but part of the Bible's progressive disclosure.
- **Angel of the LORD** - a Christophany/mediating divine figure in several OT theophanies; important for understanding early christological readings.
- **Son(s) of God / divine plurality** - terms applied to heavenly beings and, in the NT, to Jesus and believers; traced as a conceptual trajectory in revelation.
- **Septuagint (LXX)** - used as evidence for early Jewish interpretive tendencies and to clarify how Hebrew terms were understood in Hellenistic Judaism.
- **Monotheism vs. henotheism** - Heiser argues for a functional monotheism (one sovereign God) that acknowledges other created divine beings without making them ultimate rivals.
- **Progressive revelation** - the Bible's movement from implicit plurality language in the OT to clearer revelation in the NT concerning Jesus and the Spirit.
- **Revelation of the Trinity** - Heiser resists imposing Nicene categories on the OT while affirming that the NT reveals God in Father, Son, Spirit; his method emphasizes trajectory and canonical reading.
- **Exegetical model** - literal/canonical reading guided by ANE context and LXX; avoids both allegorization and modern naturalism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for divine-council and unseen-realm vocabulary in biblical-theological teaching.
 - As a **polemic** against de-supernaturalized readings of OT/NT texts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating ANE data with canonical theology, especially in discussions of divine plurality and the OT background to Trinitarian revelation.
