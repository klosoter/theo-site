### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 18th-early 19th century Germany: post-Enlightenment, Romantic movement, rise of historical-critical scholarship and modern university theology (Wissenschaft des Christentums).
 - Schleiermacher mediates Kantian and Romantic currents; pastor-theologian writing in reaction to both Enlightenment rationalism and pietistic formalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Religion is rooted primarily in immediate religious consciousness - the "feeling of absolute dependence" (German: Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit) - not in propositional metaphysics or moral argument.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reorients theology: start from human **religious experience** → reconstruct doctrines as expressions/reflections of that experience.
 - Major works shape argument:
 - Reden über die Religion (1799): religion as feeling; apologetic toward cultured skeptics.
 - Glaubenslehre (1811-1835): systematic doctrinal formulation grounded in religious self-consciousness (doctrine of faith as descriptive rather than merely dogmatic).
 - Hermeneutical and philosophical writings situate theology within language, culture, and communal life.
 - Theological moves:
 - Describe the structure of religious consciousness (immediacy, feeling, self-awareness).
 - Show how church, sacraments, Scripture, and Christ function as the historical and communal realization of that consciousness.
- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages Kant (epistemology), Fichte (self-consciousness), Hegel (systematic metaphysics), Pietism, Enlightenment critics, and contemporary Romantic thinkers.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (recast as immediate consciousness of God), Christology (Christ as perfect God-consciousness and exemplar), Trinity (experiential and doxological expression), covenant (communal and ethical realisation), sin and redemption (pathos of dependence and restoration), anthropology and creation (finite human consciousness in relation to the Absolute).
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher relocates the center of theology from propositional metaphysics to the communal, historical articulation of a foundational human religious feeling - theology as reflective description of God-consciousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Primacy of **feeling** and immediate consciousness as theological starting-point; theology as a descriptive discipline of religious life.
 - Strong integration of liturgy, church life, and culture into systematic theology (religion as lived community).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Correction of Enlightenment rationalism: rejects proof-based apologetics as insufficient for religion's essence.
 - Contrast with classical Reformed covenantal/objective emphases: Schleiermacher relativizes propositional revelation and covenantal juridical categories, prioritizing subjective religious experience.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Religion" defined ethically-experientially rather than doctrinally; doctrine as analytic reconstruction of consciousness.
 - Recasting Christology: Christ as the paradigmatic God-consciousness and normative center of the religious life.
 - Methodological move toward historical-critical, cultural, and hermeneutical theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major architect of modern liberal Protestant theology; shaped 19th-century university theology, homiletics, and modern biblical studies.
 - Provoked neo-orthodox reactions (notably Karl Barth) who accused Schleiermacher of subjectivizing revelation; yet his method remained a persistent interlocutor for later constructive and methodical theologies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Vital corrective to purely abstract doctrinalism and to reductionist positivism; indispensable for studies in theological method, religious experience, pastoral theology, and the interplay of culture and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence (Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit)** - foundational human religious state; starting-point for theological description.
- **Religious consciousness / God-consciousness** - the immediate awareness that theology must elucidate; Christ as its fullest realization.
- **Religion as feeling, not doctrine** - religion primarily experiential; doctrines function as reflective expressions.
- **Glaubenslehre** - Schleiermacher's systematic theology framed as "doctrine of faith" (descriptive, reflective).
- **Reden über die Religion** - programmatic apologetic aimed at cultured skepticism; introduces experiential thesis.
- **Revelation as self-consciousness** - revelation understood as God's presence given and apprehended in human consciousness and community, not merely propositional deposit.
- **Christ as exemplar / perfect God-consciousness** - Christology that emphasizes normative human-divine awareness rather than metaphysical incarnation formulas.
- **Ecclesiology / liturgy as realization** - church and sacraments realize and cultivate the feeling that grounds religion.
- **Hermeneutical method** - historical, linguistic, and cultural exegesis that reads doctrine as expression of experience.
- **Subjectivizing tendency** - critiqued label: theology risks centering the human subject over divine objective revelation.
- **Romantic organicism** - church, doctrine, and culture seen as organic, interrelated expressions of communal life.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "religion" in contemporary theology and for re-evaluating religious experience.
 - As a **polemic** target in Reformed/neo-orthodox critiques of subjectivism and for defense of objective revelation/covenantal categories.
 - As an **exegetical and methodological model** for theology that integrates culture, pastoral practice, and historical-critical scholarship.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on theological method, modern theology, and the transition from confessional to modernist thought.
