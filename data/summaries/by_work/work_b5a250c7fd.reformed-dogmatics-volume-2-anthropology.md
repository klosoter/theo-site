### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology - Geerhardus Vos** 
(Princeton biblical-theological context; early 20th century Reformed scholarship)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated within late 19th / early 20th century Princeton/Reformed scholarship; Vos as a leading figure in biblical theology reacting to German liberalism and speculative metaphysics.
 - Method shaped by redemptive-historical exegesis: theology must be built from Scripture's progressive revelation and covenantal development.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human nature and destiny must be understood in light of redemptive history: the image of God, fall, sin, and restoration are covenantally structured and fulfilled in Christ; anthropology is eschatologically oriented.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical-historical analysis of Old and New Testament texts on humanity.
 - Diagnosis: original righteousness (Imago Dei) and federal headship of Adam; the origin, nature, and effects of sin (corruption, guilt, concupiscence).
 - Pneumatology and soteriology intersect: regeneration, union with Christ, sanctification, and ultimate resurrection are integral to human destiny.
 - Eschatological consummation: true anthropology culminates in bodily resurrection and participation in the new creation, not in Greek-style innate immortality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformation (Calvin), Augustine (on sin and original guilt), and contemporary Reformed voices (Kuyper, Bavinck) while polemicizing against liberal anthropology and Hellenistic dualism.
 - Strong reliance on Scripture as primary source; uses patristic and medieval traditions selectively for contrast.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Imago Dei, original righteousness, original sin (nature, guilt, transmission), federal/representative headship, body-soul relation, death (spiritual and physical), resurrection, union with Christ, regeneration, sanctification, eschatological human destiny.
- **Closing line**
 - Vos locates true human identity not in abstract metaphysics but in covenantal relation to God realized historically and consummated in Christ: anthropology is fundamentally redemptive-historical and eschatological.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Anthropology embedded in biblical-historical and covenantal narrative rather than abstract metaphysical anthropology.
 - Strong stress on federal headship (Adam/Christ) as the structural key to original righteousness, sin, and redemption.
 - Primacy of resurrection hope over philosophical notions of innate immortality.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Enlightenment and liberal reductionisms that locate human dignity in autonomous reason or moral capacity; rejects speculative ontologizing of the soul divorced from Scripture.
 - Challenges Platonic/Hellenistic dualism by insisting on embodied, eschatological personhood and the centrality of bodily resurrection.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Integrates redemptive-historical categories into systematic anthropology (e.g., reading Imago Dei as covenantal original righteousness rather than merely rational capacity).
 - Uses federal theology systematically to explain both the transmission of sin and the basis of justification and restoration.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in shaping 20th-century Reformed biblical theology and subsequent Reformed systematic treatments of anthropology.
 - Valued by pastors and scholars for exegetical rigor and covenantal framing; less influential among scholars rooted in existentialist or liberal theologies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for anchoring theological anthropology in Scripture's narrative and covenantal structure; useful corrective to both speculative metaphysics and reductionist modern anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - Understood primarily as original righteousness and covenantal status, not merely intellectual or functional capacity.
- **Original righteousness**
 - The positive state of Adam prior to the Fall; normative for human vocation and life.
- **Original sin**
 - Comprised of corruption (depravity), concupiscence (inclination), and guilt; transmitted via federal headship.
- **Federal headship (representative headship)**
 - Adam as representative humankind; Christ as the restorative federal head - key to explaining sin and salvation structurally.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central to restored human identity; the locus of justification, sanctification, and eschatological life.
- **Regeneration / vivification**
 - Spirit-work that reconstitutes human life toward communion with God; intimately tied to covenantal promise.
- **Death: spiritual vs. physical**
 - Fall introduces spiritual death (alienation) and physical mortality; ultimate defeat of death in resurrection.
- **Resurrection / eschatological consummation**
 - The definitive hope for embodied persons; secures true human destiny and refutes Greek immortality as the Christian telos.
- **Body-soul relation**
 - Emphasizes unity of psychosomatic personhood with an emphasis on future bodily continuity.
- **Total depravity / corruption**
 - Not annihilation of faculties but pervasive sin affecting all dimensions of human life and will.
- **Guilt and imputation**
 - Guilt is real and imputed through federal relation to Adam; justification reverses imputation via Christ.
- **Covenant anthropology**
 - Human identity and vocation are best read through covenantal roles and obligations.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source: clarifying classic Reformed terms (Imago Dei, federalism, original sin) in covenantal categories.
 - As a polemical resource: resisting liberal, existentialist, and Gnostic dualist anthropologies.
 - As an exegetical model: exemplifying redemptive-historical method for deriving theological loci from Scripture.
 - As a conceptual pivot: linking systematic loci (sin, soteriology, eschatology) through the category of covenantal human identity.
