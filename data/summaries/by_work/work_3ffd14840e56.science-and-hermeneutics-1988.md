### TITLE
**Vern Poythress, "Science and Hermeneutics" (1988)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical-Reformed engagement with philosophy of science and hermeneutics; responds to rising influence of Kuhn/Popper-style philosophy of science and contemporary hermeneutical theory.
 - Addressed to scientists, theologians, and pastors seeking principled relations between Scripture and scientific claims.

- **Central thesis**
 - Hermeneutical presuppositions determine how Christians relate scientific theories to biblical texts; proper interpretation of Scripture (its genre, intention, and canonical role) establishes the normative constraints within which scientific models must be judged.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: identifies the modern tendency to read science and Scripture as competing epistemic authorities because of unexamined methodological assumptions in both disciplines.
 - Descriptive: analyzes how different hermeneutical approaches (literalist, concordist, non-concordist, phenomenological) produce divergent readings of key biblical loci.
 - Normative: argues for a Reformed, grammatical-historical-canonical hermeneutic that recognizes Scripture's theological purpose while allowing legitimate scientific inquiry in its own domain.
 - Application: shows implications for specific controversies (see site usages):
 - **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy** - examines how hermeneutics affects anthropological formulations and defends reading Scripture to support a functional unity (leaning toward dichotomy) rather than speculative tripartite ontologies.
 - **Days of Creation** - argues the interpretation of "day" language depends on genre and canonical placement; resists simplistic forced concordism with contemporary cosmology.
 - **Science and Scripture (Genesis 1-11)** - presents a model where Genesis 1-11 supplies theological foundations (origins, covenant, fall) without demanding that Scripture function as a scientific textbook.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophy of science: Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper (on paradigms, falsifiability).
 - Hermeneutics: contrasts modern critical and continental hermeneuts (e.g., Gadamer) with evangelical exegetical tradition.
 - Theological interlocutors: conservative exegetes and those practicing concordism; engagement with Reformed confessionally-minded interpreters.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/inspiration, creation, anthropology, sin (Fall), providence, and the authority and sufficiency of Scripture.

- **Closing line**
 - **Hermeneutics governs the interface of faith and science: correct interpretation of Scripture secures theological truth while delimiting legitimate scientific claims.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats science and biblical interpretation as reciprocal disciplines mediated by presuppositions rather than as simply empirical vs. textual authorities.
 - Prioritizes canonical and grammatical-historical reading while acknowledging the autonomy and methodology of empirical science.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on naive concordism that forces Genesis to mirror current scientific hypotheses.
 - Critiques absolutizing scientific method as episteme that can displace Scripture when hermeneutical reflexes are weak.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames the conflict not primarily as data vs. text but as interpretation vs. interpretation - scientific theories are interpretive frameworks like hermeneutics.
 - Emphasizes the role of theological categories (creation, fall, covenant) in constraining scientific philosophy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and evangelical scholars grappling with science-theology dialogue; used in ASA-type circles and theological seminars.
 - Seen as a bridge between rigorous exegesis and responsible engagement with science; often cited by later Poythress works and conservative hermeneutical critiques.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating biblical authority with scientific reasoning without capitulating to either literalist concordism or scientistic reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutical presuppositions** - foundational interpretive commitments that shape reading of texts and data.
- **Grammatical-historical-canonical method** - Poythress's recommended interpretive stance: words, historical intent, and canonical theology in tandem.
- **Concordism** - the attempt to make biblical statements map directly onto contemporary scientific claims; critiqued.
- **Non-concordist / theological reading** - reads Genesis for theological meaning first; allows scientific models to address material processes.
- **Phenomenological language** - language describing appearances (e.g., "sunrise"); used to defuse forced conflicts with astronomy.
- **Dichotomy vs Trichotomy** - anthropological categories:
 - Poythress shows hermeneutical choices affect which model is favored; argues Scripture's language supports a functional unity (practical emphasis on dichotomy).
- **Days of Creation / "day" (yom)** - discussed as genre-sensitive; Poythress resists treating "day" as automatically 24-hour without attending to literary and canonical context.
- **Scientific paradigms** - borrowed from Kuhn; scientific theories function as interpretive frameworks akin to hermeneutical lenses.
- **Authority of Scripture** - normative for theological claims; hermeneutical method secures its interpretive primacy.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - Scripture supplies theological ground-rules for doctrinal claims about origins and human nature.
- **Interpretive authority** - concept that Scripture's meaning governs theological conclusions and sets boundaries for scientific inferences.
- **Genesis 1-11 as theological foundation** - these chapters provide covenantal and teleological categories rather than technical scientific descriptions.
- **Inerrancy vs. method** - distinguishes doctrinal inerrancy from methodological demands of science; protects doctrine without endorsing scientific literalism.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for clarifying hermeneutical categories in science-theology curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against concordism and scientism in evangelical debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for treating Genesis 1-11 theologically while permitting disciplined scientific inquiry.
