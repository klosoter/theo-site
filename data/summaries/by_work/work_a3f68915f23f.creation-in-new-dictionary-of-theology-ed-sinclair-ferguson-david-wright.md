### TITLE
Creation - John M. Frame (entry in New Dictionary of Theology, ed. Sinclair Ferguson & David Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Entry in a contemporary Reformed theological reference (early 21st century). Reflects evangelical-Reformed concerns: faithfulness to Scripture, engagement with modern science and hermeneutical options, and systematic integration.
 - Author John M. Frame: Reformed, analytic, and presuppositional approach; often brings his broader tri-perspectival method and prolegomena to bear implicitly or explicitly.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of creation primarily testifies to God as sovereign Creator who brings all things into being by his Word; disagreements about the **Days of Creation** (literalist, day-age, framework) must be adjudicated by theological, exegetical, and ecclesial commitments rather than mere scientific preference.
 - Creation is the theological foundation for revelation, Christology, ethics, and covenant life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical data: Genesis 1-2 as canonical, the motif of divine speech/fiat, Sabbath institution, and New Testament affirmations (Colossians 1, John 1, Hebrews).
 - Doctrinal synthesis: creation ex nihilo, goodness of creation, creaturely dependence, image-bearing of humans, human fall and corruption.
 - Practical hermeneutics: distinguishes levels of explanation (theological meaning vs. scientific description), argues for the primacy of theological claims in Scripture while allowing honest scientific inquiry.
 - Brief treatment of interpretive options for the **Days of Creation**:
 - Notes strengths and limits of literal 24-hour reading, day-age and gap theories, and the framework hypothesis.
 - Urges that the church's confession should preserve divine authorship and theological intent rather than resolve all scientific questions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical and medieval (Augustine) and Reformers (Calvin) are marshalled for exegetical tradition.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include young-earth and old-earth evangelicals, and proponents of the framework view; also engages scientific perspectives at a theological level.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as normative for creation doctrine)
 - Trinity (Creator God understood as triune)
 - Christology (Christ as agent/Word of creation)
 - Providence, anthropology (image of God), sin/Fall, eschatology (new creation), Sabbath/eschatological rest.

- **Closing line**
 - The doctrine of creation, centered on God's sovereign, word‑creating activity, grounds the church's worship, Christology, and moral life; disputes over the Days of Creation require exegetical humility and theological priority to God's revealed purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the primacy of theological meaning over scientific minutiae: creation doctrine functions first as doctrine about God and covenantal ordering.
 - Integration of classical theism with contemporary analytic precision-clear distinctions between Creator and creature and careful conceptual definitions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both scientistic readings that subordinate Scripture and literalist readings that force scientific claims onto the text.
 - Contrasts with purely concordist approaches by stressing the Bible's theological aims (e.g., Sabbath, divine speech) as the hermeneutical center.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Application (implicit or explicit) of Frame's tri‑perspectival sensibility: normative (God's law/word), situational (created order), existential (creaturely response), offering a way to evaluate the Days discussions across loci.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clarity and pastoral sensitivity; used as a balanced entrypoint in conservative seminaries and by pastors navigating creation/science tensions.
 - Influential among those seeking an approach that upholds Scripture without crude literalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to keep doctrine of creation theologically central while engaging contemporary scientific debate; useful for systematic, exegetical, and pastoral work.

### KEY TERMS & USES

 - As a **polemic** against both scientism and crude literalism-useful in pastoral guidance over Days of Creation debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** that privileges theological intent of Genesis while engaging scientific questions responsibly.
