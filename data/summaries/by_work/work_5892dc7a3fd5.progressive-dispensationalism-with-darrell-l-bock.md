### TITLE
Progressive Dispensationalism - Craig A. Blaising & Darrell L. Bock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Emerged in late 20th century evangelical milieu as a corrective within dispensationalism; principal publication by Blaising and Bock (1993) consolidates the movement. Responds to rigid classical dispensationalism and to covenantal critiques within Reformed and evangelical circles.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Preserve the dispensationally grounded distinctions between Israel and the church while recovering theological continuity and the progressive character of revelation so that promises to Israel are not abandoned but are understood as progressively inaugurated in Christ and the church.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Hermeneutic principle: historical-grammatical literalism qualified by progressive revelation - promises can be inaugurated without being fully realized.
 - Upholds a future, eschatological role for ethnic Israel based on covenant promises (land, Davidic throne) while affirming that many of those promises find present, partial fulfillment in Christ and the church.
 - Presents a middle path: continuity (fulfillment pattern, covenants retain force) + discontinuity (distinct future program for Israel, distinct dispensations).
 - Articulates an **inaugurated eschatology**: kingdom realities are present in seed form and will be consummated in the future (premillennial consummation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: classical dispensationalists (e.g., John Walvoord, Charles Ryrie), covenant theologians and replacement critics.
 - Uses biblical exegesis (notably Pauline texts such as Romans 9-11), Old Testament covenantal promises, and patristic/modern theological categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics, covenant (Abrahamic, Davidic, new covenant), ecclesiology (Israel/church relations), eschatology (millennium, kingdom), Christology as fulfillment agent of promises.
- **Closing line**
 - Progressive Dispensationalism centers on a calibrated balance: maintain literal promise-keeping to Israel while framing fulfillment as progressive and inaugurated in Christ, culminating in a future, distinct consummation for Israel and the nations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Progressive fulfillment**: promises can have typological/initial fulfillments now and fuller, literal fulfillment later. Emphasizes stages rather than an either/or.
 - **Moderated separationism**: rejects rigid segregation of Israel and church programs; allows overlap and shared blessings without collapsing the distinct future role of ethnic Israel.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - To classical dispensationalism: criticizes sharp dispensational barriers and the tendency to minimize continuity; rejects absolute future/strict dualism.
 - To covenantal / progressive covenantalism: resists full replacement of Israel by the church; affirms enduring force of certain ethnic-covenantal promises to Israel.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Moves from "two separate peoples of God" rhetoric toward language stressing **distinct but related** programs, and a staged or **inaugurated-consummative** model of fulfillment.
 - Clarifies categories such as "already/not yet" kingdom within a dispensational frame.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative evangelical seminaries and among dispensational scholars; provided a viable alternative that softened polarities and invited further dialogue with covenant theologians.
 - Criticized by hard-line dispensationalists as capitulation and by covenant theologians as insufficiently dispossessing Israel of covenantal promises.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable pedagogically for demonstrating how to do careful biblical-theological synthesis across Testaments and for training students in nuanced eschatological and covenantal thinking.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Progressive revelation / progressive fulfillment** - God progressively discloses and fulfills promises; early or partial fulfillment anticipates fuller future realization.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - Kingdom realities are present in principle in Christ and the church but await consummation.
- **Continuity and discontinuity** - Balanced hermeneutical principle; continuity in promise and typology, discontinuity in program and future consummation.
- **Literal/historical-grammatical hermeneutic (qualified)** - Insists on literal reading but allows typological and progressive senses as historical revelation unfolds.
- **Israel and the church** - Distinct historical programs with relational overlap; church participates in certain blessings yet does not replace ethnic Israel's covenantal destiny.
- **Davidic covenant / messianic promises** - Retained as having future, literal aspects fulfilled ultimately in the messianic reign.
- **Romans 11 model** - Uses Paul's argument to affirm Israel's partial hardening, the mystery of Gentile inclusion, and a future national restoration (Israel's future).
- **Millennial / eschatological posture** - Premillennial in outcome: anticipates a future earthly kingdom centered on Christ's literal reign where Israel's promises reach consummation.
- **Programmatic vs. Partial fulfillment** - Distinguishes between initial, programmatic fulfillment (inauguration) and future, full fulfillment.
- **Two-stage consummation** - Emphasizes present inaugurated stage and later consummative stage for promises.
- **Ecclesial participation** - Church participates in kingdom blessings now but as a distinct participant, not as the complete terminus of Israelite promise.
- **Hermeneutical bridge-terms: already/not yet, inaugurated/consummated**

How the work is used across loci:
- **Exegetical model**: Frequently cited for interpretation of Romans 9-11 (Israel's future, partial hardening, future restoration).
- **Polemic and definition**: Serves as the definitional statement against both classical dispensationalism and replacement covenantalism - often used in debates on covenant and Israel-church relations.
- **Conceptual pivot for eschatology**: Adopted in discussions of millennial views to articulate a moderated premillennial position that integrates inaugurated eschatology with future literal fulfillment.
