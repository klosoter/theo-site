### TITLE
**Fred Sanders, The Trinity** in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Early 21st-century retrieval of classical trinitarianism within an ecumenical, Scripture-attentive milieu (Oxford Handbook, c. 2007). Sanders writes as an evangelical committed to patristic and scholastic grammar rearticulated for systematic theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** The one God is eternally Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the **economic missions** reveal, and are grounded in, the **immanent processions**. Classical trinitarian grammar (one essence, three persons; inseparable operations; relations of origin) is necessary to read Scripture theologically and to confess the gospel rightly.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Begins from the biblical economy and the churchs rule of faith; baptismal and doxological patterns norm trinitarian confession.
 - Rehearses Nicene-Constantinopolitan settlement: homoousios; hypostatic distinctions by relations of origin (generation and spiration).
 - Articulates the pro-Nicene rules: divine simplicity; inseparable operations; appropriations; missions-from-processions.
 - Engages 20th-century proposals (Rahner, Barth, Moltmann, LaCugna, Zizioulas; social trinitarianism), retrieving strengths while warning against collapsing immanent into economic or projecting creaturely society into God.
 - Clarifies terminology: economic vs immanent Trinity; person/hypostasis; perichoresis; the place of filioque in West-East discourse.
 - Treats pneumatology: **the Holy Spirit as fully divine and personal**, identified in Scripture and worship as God, proceeding from the Father (and, in Western construal, from the Father through the Son).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture; Athanasius, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa; Augustine; Aquinas; Calvin; Bavinck; moderns: Barth, Rahner, Jenson, Moltmann, LaCugna, Zizioulas.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and economy; divine simplicity; processions and missions; inseparable operations; appropriation; Christology and soteriology as trinitarian acts; pneumatology; worship and doxology.
- **Closing line:** The **missions of Son and Spirit introduce creatures into Gods eternal trinitarian life**, grounding the churchs confession, salvation, and worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** Dogmatics begins from the God who acts ad extra and reads those acts by the classical grammar that safeguards Gods unity and triune distinctions; systematic clarity about missions-from-processions; pastoral payoff in worship and Scripture reading.
- **Corrections / contrasts:** 
 - Resists two-Trinities talk; upholds Rahners Rule with guardrails to avoid either modalism or historicism.
 - Pushes back on over-social models that import creaturely society into the divine life.
 - Re-centers inseparable operations against tritheistic tendencies; keeps appropriations as pedagogical, not ontological.
- **Conceptual innovations:** Fresh formulation of how **missions reveal processions**; tight linkage of economy, exegesis, and dogmatic grammar; crisp restatement of person/nature and relations of origin for contemporary readers.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely cited in evangelical and Reformed retrievals; used as a map of the field and as a standard for economic-immanent clarifications; valued across traditions for accessible precision.
- **Enduring value:** A compact, reliable digest of pro-Nicene rules and their modern handling; equips teachers to avoid category mistakes and to integrate Trinity across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic vs Immanent Trinity**: One God known in two aspects; economy is Gods acts in salvation history, immanent is Gods eternal life. The economy truly reveals but does not exhaust or manufacture the immanent life. [Topic: Ontological vs Economic Trinity]
- **Processions and Missions**: Eternal relations of origin (generation of the Son; spiration of the Spirit) ground temporal sendings of Son and Spirit; missions manifest who persons eternally are.
- **Relations of Origin**: The persons are distinguished only by their relational properties (begetting, being begotten, proceeding), not by essence or parts.
- **Divine Simplicity**: God is not composed; therefore operations ad extra are inseparable and the one divine essence is fully possessed by each person.
- **Inseparable Operations**: What God does outside Himself, the three do together, though with fitting personal manifestations.
- **Appropriation**: Attributing certain works to a person to illuminate Scripture and catechesis without dividing the single operation.
- **Homoousios**: Son and Spirit are of one essence with the Father; safeguards full deity and worship of the Son and Spirit.
- **Perichoresis**: Mutual indwelling of the persons, expressing unity-in-distinction without confusion or separation.
- **Person/Hypostasis vs Nature/Essence**: Who vs what; three whos, one what; avoids both modalism and tritheism.
- **Filioque**: Western claim that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (often clarified as from the Father through the Son); deployed with ecumenical care to preserve Fathers monarchy and the Spirits consubstantiality.
- **Rahners Rule**: The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa; valid when read as epistemic and revelatory, not as identity of history with Gods inner life.
- **Pneumatology: Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit**: Scripture ascribes personal agency and divine names/operations to the Spirit (e.g., Acts 5; 2 Cor 13:14; baptismal formula), grounding the Spirits full deity and worship. [Topic: Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit]
- **Rule of Faith**: Early creedal matrix that channels biblical reading toward trinitarian confession.
- **Doxology and Worship**: Lex orandi, lex credendi; trinitarian doctrine arises from and returns to worship.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - **Definition source** for economy/immanence, processions-missions, and inseparable operations.
 - **Polemic** against social trinitarianism, modalism, and subordinationism.
 - **Exegetical model** for reading missions as revealers of processions.
 - **Conceptual pivot** integrating Trinity with Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology.
