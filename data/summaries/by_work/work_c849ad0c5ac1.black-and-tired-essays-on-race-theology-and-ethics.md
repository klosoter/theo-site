### TITLE
**Black and Tired: Essays on Race, Theology, and Ethics** 
Anthony B. Bradley, 2018 (IVP/Christianity Today Books). Short-form essays and lectures gathering Bradley's public theology on race, moral formation, and public life from a conservative Reformed vantage.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published in the late 2010s amid renewed national conversations on race, policing, identity politics, and the role of the Black church. Bradley writes as a Black conservative Reformed ethicist responding to both secular progressivism and left-wing Black theology.
 - Theological milieu: conservative Reformed evangelicalism intersecting with Black church pastoral concerns and public theology; engaged with contemporary political discourse (welfare, education, markets).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The moral and spiritual crises in Black America cannot be reduced to either only systemic structures or only individual failure; theology must account for sin, culture, institutions, and the formative role of the church. Bradley argues for a posture of moral accountability, faithful preaching, and civic formation that resists both victimhood narratives and technocratic state solutions.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Essays arranged thematically: critiques of identity politics and victimhood; diagnosis of cultural and moral disintegration (family, education, leisure); theological resources (sin, redemption, sanctification); institutional prescriptions (church renewal, civic virtue, market engagement).
 - Major moves:
 - Distinguish structural injustice from cultural pathologies without denying either.
 - Re-center the church as primary agent of moral formation and reconciliation.
 - Offer a conservative ethic that emphasizes virtue, responsibility, and subsidiarity over state paternalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit and explicit dialogue with Black liberation theology (e.g., James H. Cone), secular racial justice advocates, progressive identity politics, and conservative thinkers advocating personal responsibility (modern commentators in politics and cultural critique).
 - Reformed theological resources inform Bradley's hermeneutic: classical doctrines of sin, covenant, and ecclesial formation.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Sin and depravity** (diagnostic lens for social maladies); **imago Dei** (basis for human dignity and rights); **soteriology and sanctification** (church's role in moral renewal); **ecclesiology** (church as moral and communal educator); **ethics and public theology** (civic virtues, subsidiarity).
 - Less emphasis on Trinitarian theology or systematic dogmatics beyond how doctrine grounds ethics.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - Bradley's theology insists that authentic racial justice is theological and moral formation enacted by the church-anchored in doctrines of sin, redemption, and covenantal community-rather than merely programmatic or political reform.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - A sustained conservative Black theological voice that insists on moral formation, personal responsibility, and the primacy of church institutions while acknowledging structural wrongs.
 - Frames "fatigue" as moral and spiritual exhaustion among Black Christians needing ecclesial care rather than solely political remedy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects what he sees as the excesses of liberation theology and identity-driven approaches by reasserting sin-centered anthropology and the necessity of virtue formation.
 - Contrasts with secular progressivism by rejecting state-centered solutions and dependency-producing welfare models.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes common public-theology categories (e.g., "justice," "reconciliation") through a pastoral-formation lens that privileges character and local institutions.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Received positively in many conservative and Reformed circles as a much-needed Black conservative perspective; criticized by some progressives and liberation theologians for minimizing structural critique or for promoting individualist remedies.
 - Increasingly cited in evangelical discussions on race, policing, education policy, and the role of the Black church.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Valuable as a model of public theology that integrates pastoral concern, scriptural doctrine, and policy critique; useful in courses on Christian ethics, race and theology, and ecclesial renewal.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Black fatigue** - spiritual, moral, and civic exhaustion in Black communities that requires pastoral and ecclesial remedies.
- **Victimhood narrative / victimology** - Bradley critiques overreliance on narratives that locate identity primarily in oppression, arguing they can impede moral agency.
- **Personal responsibility** - ethical emphasis on individual and communal accountability as part of Christian formation.
- **Structural racism** - acknowledged as real, but treated alongside cultural factors and sin; not the sole explanatory category.
- **Moral formation / virtue** - central therapeutic aim; church practices and preaching as primary means of renewal.
- **Subsidiarity** - preferencing local institutions (family, church, civil society) over expansive state intervention.
- **Imago Dei** - theological grounding for dignity and prophetic critique of injustice; also basis for restorative approaches.
- **Sanctification** - long-term process through which repentance and communal discipline reshape habits and social outcomes.
- **Reconciliation** - ecclesial and ethical work entailing repentance, restitution where appropriate, and restored communal bonds.
- **Civic virtue** - public ethic stressing work, education, family stability, and participation in civic life.
- **Welfare-state critique** - argument that dependency-producing policies often undermine moral agency and community resilience.
- **Cultural pathology** - habits, family breakdown, and educational deficits considered alongside structural causes.
- **Pastoral public theology** - Bradley's method: theology that moves from pulpit and parish into public policy critique without abandoning ecclesial priorities.
- **Market engagement** - positive valuation of markets as spaces for flourishing and agency, tempered by moral constraint.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a definition source for a conservative, church-centered approach to racial ethics. 
 - As a polemic against liberation-theology excesses and welfare-state dependency in discussions of race and public policy. 
 - As a pastoral-exegetical model for integrating doctrine (sin, sanctification) with practical prescriptions for church renewal and civic formation.
