### TITLE
Selected articles in De Heraut - Abraham Kuyper (on Communicatio Idiomatum)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-century Dutch Reformed periodical engagement. De Heraut functioned as Kuyper's organ for polemical and pastoral-theological argument amid the rise of theological liberalism, historical-critical exegesis, and debates over modern Christology in the Netherlands and wider Reformed world.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to confess and explicate the **communicatio idiomatum** (the transfer or ascription of predicates between the divine and human natures) without collapsing the Chalcedonian distinction of natures or yielding to modernist kenotic and functional reductions.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Affirm the **real, personal union (hypostatic union)**: one Person (Christ) subsists in two natures, so ascriptions of attributes may be made to the Person while respecting the properties proper to each nature.
 - Defend a disciplined communicatio: distinguish **communicatio attributorum** (attributes), **communicatio operationum** (operations), and the ascription of actions to the one Person as mediator.
 - Reject both modalistic flattening and naturalistic merging (no confusion or change of natures); criticize liberal/kenotic readings that relativize divine immutability or omnipresence in the incarnation.
 - Apply to pastoral and sacramental questions (e.g., Christ's presence and efficacy in sacraments, the efficacy of atonement): the Person unites divine efficacy with human obedience without transferring ontic properties between natures.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Chalcedonian formulations, patristic appeals, Calvin and later Reformed scholastics, contemporary liberal theologians and kenotic theorists; Kuyper often situates argument against modern German and Dutch critics.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Christology** (person/natures, hypostatic union), **incarnation**, soteriology (atonement and mediation), sacramental theology (presence, efficacy), and implications for revelation and the communicative action of God in history.
- **Closing line:** Kuyper centers the confession that Christ is one Person in two unconfused natures, so that predicates may be aptly ascribed to the Person (enabling atonement and sacramental efficacy) while strictly guarding the ontological integrity of each nature.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on an **organic personal union**: the union is not an external association but a true personal hypostasis that grounds ascription without ontological commingling.
 - Practical and ecclesial focus: doctrinal precision is tied to preaching, sacraments, and pastoral assurance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against **kenotic** theories that depersonalize or diminish divine attributes in the incarnate Son.
 - Critique of liberal reductions that treat communicatio as merely rhetorical or functional rather than grounded in real personal union.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses neo-Calvinist philosophical vocabulary to articulate the union's mediation of attributes and operations without endorsing ontological mixture.
 - Emphasizes the mediatorial significance of the Person as the locus where communicative ascription occurs (a pastoral-philosophical tightening of the traditional categories).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within Dutch Reformed circles and among students of Kuyperian neo-Calvinism; used to shore up confessional Christology against liberal trends.
 - Served as a polemical resource in late-19th/early-20th-century debates on incarnation, sacraments, and atonement.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies the practical stakes of communicatio idiomatum for worship, soteriology, and ecclesial life.
 - Provides a model for defending Chalcedonian balance while addressing modern philosophical challenges.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The ascription of predicates between Christ's natures; Kuyper treats this as rooted in the one Person, not as physical mixing of natures.
- **Hypostatic union:** The personal union of divine and human in Christ; Kuyper emphasizes its reality and organic character.
- **Communicatio attributorum:** Transfer/ascription of attributes; must be handled so divine attributes are ascribed to the Person, not transfused into the human nature.
- **Communicatio operationum:** Shared operations of the one Person; explains how divine efficacy can be present in human acts of Christ.
- **Physis / Hypostasis:** Nature (physis) vs. person (hypostasis); Kuyper reiterates Chalcedonian distinction-two natures, one person.
- **Chalcedonian criteria:** "Without confusion, change, division, separation" - the boundary conditions Kuyper repeatedly invokes.
- **Kenosis:** Theories of divine self-emptying; Kuyper critiques kenotic reductions that undermine divine immutability and omnipotence in the incarnate Son.
- **Mediatorial office:** The Person as mediator who unites efficacy and obedience; the locus for communicative ascriptions.
- **Sacramental presence:** Use of communicatio idiomatum to ground Christ's real presence and efficacy in sacraments without collapsing natures.
- **Extra Calvinisticum (related concern):** The tension about whether divine Word is wholly confined to the human nature-Kuyper safeguards the divine freedom and omnipresence while affirming union.
- **Attributional restraint:** Kuyper's methodological rule: ascribe predicates primarily to the Person; specify whether an attribute is due to the divine or human nature when necessary.
- **Pastoral implications:** Doctrinal distinctions serve assurance, preaching, and sacramental confidence.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition-source** and clarifying exposition of communicatio idiomatum for Reformed instruction.
 - As **polemic** against kenotic and liberal Christologies that relativize divine attributes.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** for ascribing actions and predicates to Christ in preaching and sacramental theology.
