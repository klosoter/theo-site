### TITLE
**Robert Bellarmine - De praedestinatione et reprobatione (Disputationes)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 16th / early 17th century Counter-Reformation theology. Part of Bellarmine's Disputationes de controversiis christianae fidei (published 1586-1593). Composed amid controversies over grace, free will, and the Congregatio de Auxiliis debates between Jesuits (Molina) and Dominicans (Thomists). Trialogue context: pastoral concern for orthodoxy after Trent and polemic against Protestant determinism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To articulate a catholic, orthodox doctrine of election and reprobation that preserves both **God's sovereign causality** in predestination and **genuine human liberty** and moral responsibility-while denying that reprobation is a positive divine decree to sin.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Distinguishes kinds of divine knowledge and prescience to preserve God's priority without making Him contingent on creatures.
 - Affirms gratuitous, efficacious predestination of the elect grounded in God's free will and efficacious grace (not in foreseen merits).
 - Denies double predestination as a positive willing of some to eternal condemnation; reprobation is explicated as **permissive and judicial**, not productive of sin.
 - Engages competing accounts (strict Thomist/physical premotion; Molinaean scientia media; simple foreknowledge models) and argues for a model that safeguards both divine causality and human freedom.
 - Offers exegetical appeals (Pauline texts on election, Romans) and canonical-Tridentine commitments to support Catholic orthodoxy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Luis de Molina and the Jesuit Molinists (scientia media).
 - Thomists / Dominicans (physical premotion, De Auxiliis controversies).
 - Scripture (esp. Romans, Ephesians), Augustine and Aquinas, Council of Trent formulations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Predestination, reprobation, grace (efficacious vs. sufficient), divine knowledge (foreknowledge, middle knowledge), providence, freedom and merit, original sin, justification.
- **Closing line:** Aims to conserve **God's gratuitous predestinating will and efficacious grace** while rejecting both fatalistic determinism and the idea that reprobation is a direct divine production of sin-maintaining a theologically balanced account of sovereignty and responsibility.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the *gratuitousness* of election: predestination is an act of free divine benevolence, not merited by creatures or reducible to mere foreknowledge.
 - Carefully qualifies reprobation as **permissive-judicial**, which avoids imputing the origin of sin to God's positive decree.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against strict Thomists who appear to make God the immediate cause of every contingent act (via physical premotion), Bellarmine resists rendering human freedom illusory.
 - Against simple foreknowledge or purely natural knowledge accounts, he resists making election derivative or collapsing divine causality into creaturely contingency.
 - Engages Molina: critical of grounding predestination solely on scientia media insofar as it risks subordinating divine will to creaturely foresight.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced use of categories (efficacious vs. sufficient grace; permissive vs. positive reprobation) to thread a middle path between determinism and deism of providence.
 - Operational vocabulary to distinguish different modes of divine causality without capitulating to deterministic consequences.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in Catholic orthodoxy as a major articulation post-Trent; frequently cited in later Catholic systematic treatments of election.
 - In Reformed contexts, read polemically: Reformed theologians used Bellarmine to sharpen their own articulations of double predestination or to contrast Protestant determinism with Catholic emphases on grace and freedom.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies a careful, juridical Catholic approach to predestination that preserves pastoral sensitivity.
 - Serves as a key historical interlocutor for Molinism/Thomism debates and for contemporary discussions on compatibilism vs. libertarian freedom under divine sovereignty.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination (praedestinatione):** God's free, efficacious decree to bestow eternal life on the elect; gratuitous and not based on foreseen merits.
- **Reprobation (reprobatione):** Not a positive decree to sin; rather a permissive/judicial passivity whereby God allows and judicially condemns sin.
- **Efficacious grace:** Grace that infallibly brings about the effect willed by God (real causal role in conversion), distinguished from sufficient grace.
- **Sufficient grace:** Enables the possibility of salvation but does not ensure its actualization without efficacious operation.
- **Foreknowledge (praescientia):** Divine knowledge of future contingent acts; Bellarmine parses its relation to predestination.
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge):** Molina's notion that God knows what free creatures would do in any hypothetical-Bellarmine engages critically, wary of making God dependent on creaturely counterfactuals.
 - Relation: Bellarmine critiques its sufficiency for grounding predestination without undermining divine freedom.
- **Physical premotion:** Thomist notion of a divine causal move ordering will; Bellarmine resists any formulation that collapses human liberty.
- **Permissive will vs. decretive will:** Distinction used to explain how God permits sin without directly causing it.
- **Gratuitousness:** Emphasizes election as free benefaction, not merit-based.
- **Judicial reprobation:** Reprobation as God's just condemnation after permissive allowance.
- **Divine causality:** Bellarmine maintains God's primacy without deterministic reduction of creaturely agency.
- **Tridentine orthodoxy:** Reference point for his soteriological commitments and polemical boundaries.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Catholic distinctions (efficacious vs. sufficient grace; permissive vs. positive reprobation).
- As a **polemic** against both deterministic Thomism and unqualified Molinist reductions-modeling a mediating Catholic response to middle-knowledge debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts on election in a way that balances divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
