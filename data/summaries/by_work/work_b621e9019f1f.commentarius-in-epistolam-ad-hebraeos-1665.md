### TITLE
Commentarius in Epistolam ad Hebraeos (1665) - Johannes Cocceius

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1665 in the Dutch Reformed environment of the Dutch Golden Age. Cocceius (1603-1669) writes as leader of the Cocceian school, reacting against scholastic/Voetian methods and promoting a biblical-historical, covenantal reading of Scripture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Hebrews must be read as a sustained exposition of Christ as the antitype of the Old Testament cultus within the progressive unfolding of God's covenantal administration; Christ's priesthood and sacrifice effectually inaugurate the New Covenant and fulfill all types.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical walkthrough of Hebrews, arguing for a Christological/priestly centre: Christ superior to angels, Moses, Aaron, and the Levitical order.
 - Typological method: Old Testament rites, tabernacle, and priesthood are *types* whose fulfillment and meaning are historically realized in Christ (the antitype).
 - Covenantal framing: the epistle is read through successive administrations of the one Covenant (Covenant of Redemption, Covenant of Grace), showing progressive revelation culminating in Christ.
 - Practical and pastoral application: faith, perseverance, and the assurance of salvation under the New Covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Hebrew text and patristic/early Reformed interpretations; dialogue (often implicit) with scholastic Reformed theologians, notably the Voetian school.
 - Draws on Reformed confessional vocabulary (covenant language) while reshaping some terminologies for a redemptive-historical exposition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (progressive/historical), Covenant (redemptive covenant structure), Christology (mediatorial priesthood and sacrifice), Soteriology (once-for-all atonement), Ecclesiology and Sacramentology (signs/seals within covenant administration), Eschatology (already/not-yet inauguration of the eschaton), Typology and Biblical Hermeneutics.
- **Closing line:** Cocceius reads Hebrews as a covenant-historical manifesto: the Levitical order was a pedagogical series of types designed to point to Christ, whose heavenly priesthood inaugurates and secures the New Covenant.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong redemptive-historical (progressive revelation) hermeneutic rather than abstract scholastic categories.
 - Covenantal framing as the primary theological grid for Hebrews: pre-temporal Covenant of Redemption and the administering Covenant of Grace through successive economies.
 - Emphasis on the heavenly, ontologically superior priesthood of Christ as the hermeneutical key to all cultic texts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on static scholasticism that abstracts doctrines from their historical-covenantal setting; criticises Voetian legalism and overly syllogistic exposition.
 - Moves beyond simple allegory by insisting on historically grounded typology: types are real covenantal institutions with intentional design pointing forward.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses "administrations" (dispensations) of the Covenant of Grace language as a way to account for continuity and diversity in covenantal signs and rites.
 - Refines the Covenant of Redemption motif as exegetical lens for Hebrews' high-priest Christology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential within the Cocceian school and broader Dutch Reformed circles sympathetic to redemptive-historical theology.
 - Controversial among Voetians and scholastically inclined Reformed theologians; prompted methodological debates on hermeneutics and covenant theology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a rigorous early-modern model of covenantal exegesis of Hebrews.
 - Valuable for students of federal theology, typology, and the history of Reformed hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Pre-temporal pact between Father and Son setting the plan of salvation; used to explain Christ's mission as covenantal necessity.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The unfolding administration by which salvation is applied across redemptive history; Hebrews is read as the climactic revelation of this covenant.
- **Administration(s) of the Covenant:** Successive historical economies (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Christ) that mediate the one covenantal promise.
- **Typology (type/antitype):** OT institutions are intentional types; Christ is the antitype fulfilling and superseding them.
- **Heavenly Sanctuary:** The eschatological reality of Christ's priestly ministry; the true cultic locus validating the tabernacle type.
- **High Priest (Christology):** Emphasizes mediatorial, once-for-all priesthood that completes sacrificial efficacy.
- **Progressive Revelation:** Scripture's theological content unfolds historically; interpretive priority lies in redemptive-historical sequence.
- **Sacraments as seals/signs:** Rites function as covenantal seals within administrations; not purely mechanical but sacramentally participatory.
- **Perseverance and assurance:** Pastoral consequences drawn from covenantal certainty secured by Christ's priesthood.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic:** Methodological commitment shaping exegesis - history of salvation as the governing axis.
- **Contrast to scholastic method:** Moves from text-history to doctrine rather than from abstract axioms to biblical prooftexting.
- **Confessional consonance:** Uses Reformed confessional covenant vocabulary but reorients exposition toward historical fulfillment.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for covenantal categories (esp. Covenant of Redemption/Grace).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading typology and priesthood in Hebrews.
 - As a **polemic resource** in methodological disputes with scholastic/Voetian theology.
