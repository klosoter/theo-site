### TITLE
"The Mosaic Law and the Christian: The Case for Continuity" - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal (1995)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1990s Reformed academic milieu; engagement in ongoing debates over law and gospel within post-Reformation covenant theology and the "new covenant" / antinomian controversies.
 - Addresses pastoral and systematic concerns about how Christians relate to the Mosaic legis­lative corpus in the wake of Christ's fulfillment.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Mosaic law, properly understood, continues to bind Christians morally; Christ's fulfillment secures continuity rather than abolition of the moral exigences of the law.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary exegetical claim: biblical data (esp. New Testament) present Christ as fulfilling the Law, not negating its moral normative force.
 - Theological move: distinguish types of law (moral/ceremonial/civil) yet stress the unity and continuity of the moral law as expressive of God's character.
 - Christology deployed: Christ's **active obedience** (perfect law-keeping) and **passive obedience** (atonement) together ground both justification and the ongoing normative claim of the law on believers.
 - Practical-theological consequences: the law functions for Christians as mirror, guide, and curb in sanctification without functioning as the ground of justification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Reformed confessionalism and canonical exegesis; implicitly opposes antinomian and radical discontinuity readings.
 - Conversant with covenantal vocabularies (covenant of works/grace) and with NT teaching on "fulfillment" (e.g., Matthew, Paul).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (law as revelation of God's will/character), covenant theology, Christology (active/passive obedience), justification, sanctification, and ecclesial ethics.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Christ's obedient life and atoning death secure both the believer's righteousness and the continuing moral authority of the Mosaic law insofar as it reflects God's eternal will.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates Christ's active obedience into the continuity argument: Christ not only dies for sin (passive obedience) but fulfills the law actively, thereby preserving the law's moral force for believers.
 - Presents the law primarily as revelatory of God's character rather than a mere covenantal artifact to be discarded.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects antinomian tendencies that treat Christ's fulfillment as vacating the law's moral demands.
 - Offers a more restrained alternative to both extreme theonomists (who blur civil/ceremonial boundaries) and radical discontinuity advocates (who treat all Mosaic precepts as abrogated).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on a Christ-centered continuity: "fulfillment" is read as both terminative (ceremonial/civil transformation) and perpetuating (moral normativity retained through Christ's obedience).
 - Nuanced framing of threefold law categories without allowing the categories to sever the moral law from covenantal continuity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clarifying law-and-gospel relations; frequently cited in pastoral and academic debates on Christian ethics.
 - Used by teachers to counter both antinomian and overly legalist readings; influential in discussions that foreground Christ's obedience in ethical theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, Christocentric template for arguing continuity that is both exegetically attentive and theologically integrated-useful for systematicians, pastors, and advanced students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic law**
 - The Torah as a mixed corpus (moral, ceremonial, civil) with differing post-Christ statuses.
- **Continuity**
 - The claim that essential moral obligations disclosed in the Mosaic law persist for Christians.
- **Fulfillment**
 - Christ's work reconfigures ceremonial/civil elements while upholding moral imperatives through his obedience.
- **Moral law**
 - The portion of the Mosaic law that directly reflects God's eternal righteousness and remains normative.
- **Ceremonial and civil law**
 - Elements fulfilled and transformed in Christ; illustrative and typological rather than perpetually prescriptive.
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's perfect law-keeping; grounds the positive righteousness imputed to believers and supports the law's continuing claim.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and atonement; secures justification and removes the penalty, complementing active obedience.
- **Imputation**
 - The forensic exchange: Christ's righteousness (active obedience) imputed to believers; central to Poythress's link between Christology and law continuity.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace**
 - Frameworks used to explain continuity: law's demands reflect God's covenantal standards upheld and fulfilled in Christ.
- **Typology**
 - Ceremonial/civil provisions function as types fulfilled in Christ, informing but not dictating Christian ethics.
- **Uses of the law**
 - Mirror (conscience), curb (restraint of sin), guide (sanctification) - retained in pastoral practice for Christians.
- **Antinomianism**
 - Opposed as a theological error denying the continuing moral authority of the law.
- **New Covenant (discontinuity) positions**
 - Engaged critically where they overstate abolition of law's moral norms.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological continuity claims linking law and gospel through Christ's obedience.
 - As a **polemic resource** against antinomian and radical discontinuity readings.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading "fulfillment" passages Christocentrically, and a **conceptual pivot** in courses on law, covenant, and Christology.
