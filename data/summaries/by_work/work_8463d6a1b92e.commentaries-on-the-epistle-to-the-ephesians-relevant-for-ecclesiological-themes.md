### TITLE
Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians - Charles Hodge (Princeton theological exposition emphasizing ecclesiology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century American Reformed context (Princeton School). Hodge writes as a conservative Presbyterian exegete reacting against liberal criticism and speculative theology, seeking to apply historic Reformed dogmatics to Pauline theology and pastoral instruction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Ephesians presents the doctrine of the Church grounded in union with Christ by the Spirit; Hodge reads the epistle as systematic instruction on how corporate and individual Christian identity, order, and holiness arise from that union.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical pattern follows the epistle: doctrinal exposition (chaps. 1-3) establishing election, union, and the riches of grace; hortatory application (chaps. 4-6) showing effects in unity, holiness, and order.
 - Major moves:
 - Demonstrate the objective basis of the Church in Christ's headship and redemptive acts.
 - Locate personal and corporate sanctification in the Spirit-mediated union with Christ.
 - Derive marks, offices, sacraments, and discipline from the apostolic instructions for the visible church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages Reformation authorities (Augustine and Calvin implicit in Reformed categories), the Anglican and Presbyterian confessional tradition, contemporary German philological critics (often critically), and standard patristic and Protestant commentaries.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (church as body; unity and catholicity), Christology (headship of Christ), Pneumatology (Spirit as agent of union and unity), Soteriology (election, union with Christ, justification as ground of ecclesial status), Sacramental theology (baptism and Lord's Supper as visible signs), visible/invisible church distinction; also ethics and church order.
- **Closing line:** Hodge centers Ephesians as a Pauline synthesis: the Church is ontologically and morally constituted by union with Christ through the Spirit, yielding a visible body marked by doctrine, sacraments, and order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **objective, covenantal elements** (Christ's headship, sacraments, ordinances) as constitutive of the Church, alongside subjective appropriation by faith.
 - Careful linking of **pneumatology to ecclesial unity**: the Spirit is both the bond and the power for the Church's life.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Polemical correction of Roman Catholic sacramentalism by maintaining sacraments as signs and seals rather than ontologically constitutive.
 - Correction of speculative or vague Romantic conceptions of the Church by insisting on biblical categories and Reformed marks.
 - Critique of higher criticism where it undermines apostolic authority and doctrinal coherence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not so much novel vocabulary as systematic application of Reformed covenant and forensic categories to Pauline ecclesiology in a popular yet theological register.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in 19th- and early 20th-century American Presbyterianism and Princeton instruction as a standard conservative exegetical resource on ecclesiology.
 - Influenced later Reformed treatments of the Church, especially concerning visible/invisible distinctions and the relation of sacraments to union with Christ.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of integrating careful exegesis with confessional Reformed theology; valuable for courses on Pauline ecclesiology, Reformed sacramentology, and the doctrine of the Church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Body of Christ** - primary metaphor: the Church as an organic whole with Christ as head; unity and interdependence emphasized.
- **Headship of Christ** - Christ as governing and formative center of the Church, doctrinal and practical.
- **Union with Christ** - central soteriological concept; grounds corporate identity and sanctification.
 - **Mystical/Forensic balance:** Hodge preserves a real "mystical" communion while situating it within forensic and covenantal terms.
- **Spirit as bond** - the Holy Spirit effects and sustains union and unity; operative principle for ecclesial life.
- **Visible Church** - instituted congregation with sacraments, ministry, and discipline; distinguished from the invisible church of elect souls.
- **Invisible Church** - the body of the elect known fully only to God; Hodge maintains the tension without denying visible corporate obligations.
- **Marks of the Church** - preaching of the Word, administration of sacraments, and exercise of church discipline as evidences of a true church.
- **Sacraments (Baptism and Lord's Supper)** - signs and seals of covenant grace, not meritorious; instrumental to the believer's assurance and the Church's polity.
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church** - Hodge affirms the creedal elements while reinterpreting "catholic" and "apostolic" within Reformed content (orthodoxy, apostolic succession of doctrine).
- **New Man / Reconciliation** - formation of a new social reality (Jew and Gentile united) as model for ecclesial unity.
- **Election & Predestination** - theological backdrop that grounds corporate calling and the Church's perseverance.
- **Ecclesial order/authority** - ministerial offices and government derive from apostolic instruction and Christ's headship.
- **Holiness and ethics** - ethical life flows from doctrinal union and corporate calling.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for linking Pauline text to doctrinal loci (especially ecclesiology and pneumatology).
- As a **definition source** for Reformed positions on visible/invisible church, marks, and sacraments.
- As a **polemic tool** against Roman sacramentalism and liberal critical approaches.
- As a **teaching resource** to illustrate the practical outworking of union with Christ in church life and order.
