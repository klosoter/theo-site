### TITLE
**Bruce A. Ware, The Man Christ Jesus: Theological Reflections on the Humanity of Christ (2012)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2012 within conservative evangelical theological circles; Ware writes from a broadly Reformed-complementarian milieu deeply engaged in contemporary Trinity and Christology debates.
 - Responds to renewed interest in the full implications of the incarnation for Christology amid debates over intra‑Trinitarian relations, especially the **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** controversy.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ware argues that a robust, biblically grounded account of the humanity of Christ must affirm both the **fullness of his genuine human experiences, growth, and obedience**, and their coherent relation to his divine personhood (the hypostatic union).
 - He addresses how the Son's incarnational submission and human limitations are compatible with divine equality in essence, and how this bears on debates over eternal role‑relations in the Trinity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-linguistic and biblical exegesis of key texts (e.g., Luke, John, Philippians, Hebrews) showing the reality of Christ's humanity:
 - growth in wisdom, prayer life, experiential knowledge, emotions, fatigue, hunger, and death.
 - Doctrinal synthesis anchored in Chalcedonian and post‑Chalcedonian resources:
 - Maintains two natures united in one person without confusion or separation.
 - Employs communicatio idiomatum to explain how divine and human attributes are spoken of in the one person.
 - Theological resolution of tensions:
 - Distinguishes **voluntary self‑limitation (kenosis)** and genuine human dependence from any ontological diminution of the Son.
 - Locates Christ's human obedience and filial submissions in both the **economic** and the **eternal** relations between Father and Son, arguing for ordered relations compatible with ontological equality.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical patristic and Reformation authorities (Athanasius, Chalcedon, Reformed confessions) for doctrinal scaffolding.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include scholars on Christology and those engaged in the EFS debate (both proponents and critics); engages exegetical literature on Luke, John, Philippians, Hebrews.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, kenosis, communicatio idiomatum)
 - Trinity (economic/ontological relations, role/order)
 - Anthropology and soteriology insofar as they relate to Christ's real humanity and redemptive work
 - Revelation (Christ as God's self‑disclosure in human form)

- **Closing line**
 - Ware centers the work on the claim that the Son's authentic human life-its limitations, obedience, and dependence-must be confessed as real and yet fully compatible with his eternal divine status, a claim with direct implications for how one understands relational order within the Trinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the *reality* of Christ's human experiences (cognitive, volitional, affective) without reducing them to mere appearances or divine accommodations.
 - Systematic linking of incarnational obedience to intra‑Trinitarian relational order: incarnational submission is neither accidental nor merely temporal but rooted in the Son's relational role.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters both the docetic minimization of Christ's humanity and any view that collapses his human limitations into divine properties.
 - Pushes back on critics who think role‑subordination implies ontological inferiority by clarifying ontological equality + functional ordering.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reaffirms and nuances traditional terms (kenosis, communicatio idiomatum) and rearticulates "submission" and "obedience" in ways that aim to protect divine immutability and unity while affirming role differentiation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among conservative evangelical and Reformed theologians as a detailed, pastoral, and polemically useful account of Christ's humanity.
 - Provoked further interaction in EFS debates: supporters cite Ware's linking of eternal role relations to incarnational obedience; critics press for sharper distinctions to avoid perceived trinitarian subordinationism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching Christology where the interplay of human experience and divine personhood is central.
 - Serves as a clear corrective to both docetism and reductionist "functionalism" that undermines Chalcedonian balance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - two natures (divine, human) united in one person; Ware uses this as the primary framework to explain genuine human experience without ontological change.
- **Kenosis / voluntary self‑limitation** - Christ's self‑emptying is real and expresses genuine human limitation; not an ontological loss of divinity.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - the language and logic by which properties of both natures are predicated of the one person; used to account for sayings like "God died" and "the Son is obedient."
- **Filial obedience** - the Son's human obedience to the Father in the incarnation; emphasized as both real and rooted in the Son's relational role.
- **Experiential knowledge** - Christ's human knowledge as acquired/exercised in time (growth in wisdom), distinguished from divine omniscience yet compatible through communicatio.
- **Volition / human will** - affirmation of real human willing (dyothelitism), integrated with the divine person without ontological division.
- **Eternal functional subordination (EFS)** - Ware treats the Son's functional subordination as a theological category bearing on how incarnational obedience is understood; he argues for ordered relations compatible with ontological equality.
- **Ontological equality** - equality of essence of Father and Son; Ware insists this is nonnegotiable while allowing ordered functional roles.
- **Economic Trinity** - the roles ascribed in the work of redemption; Ware uses this to connect incarnation and intra‑Trinitarian relations.
- **Analogical predication** - method for speaking of divine and human attributes of Christ without category error.
- **Sinlessness / temptations** - Christ's real temptation and sinlessness are treated as genuine human experiences confirming authentic humanity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a conservative, Chalcedonian account of Christ's humanity in systematic theology courses.
 - As a **polemic resource** in the EFS debates to justify linking incarnational submission with ordered intra‑Trinitarian relations while safeguarding ontological equality.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading key Gospel and Pauline texts about Christ's growth, knowledge, and obedience.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for courses on Christology and Trinity that need an integrated treatment of human experience and divine personhood.
