### TITLE
Fides et Ratio (Thomist treatment of Faith and Reason) - attributed here to **Thomas Aquinas** as primary interlocutor in modern Thomist scholarship; key text-cluster: Summa Theologiae, Sentences commentary, and related disputations.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - High medieval scholasticism (13th century) in the Latin West; recovery of Aristotelian philosophy, translations from Arabic/Greek, rise of universities.
 - Thomas Aquinas synthesizes Christian doctrine with Aristotelian metaphysics under Dominican scholastic method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Faith and reason are complementary cognitive faculties: **reason can discover truths about God and creation**, but certain salvific mysteries surpass natural reason and require supernatural faith.
 - Theological task: to show both the proper autonomy of reason and the necessity of grace for certain truths.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Preliminary: distinction of modes of knowledge (sensory, imaginative, intellective, infused).
 - Natural theology:
 - Reason can reach true propositions about God via effects (causal inference, metaphysics of being).
 - Demonstrations (e.g., five ways) provide probable/rigorous knowledge of God's existence.
 - Supernatural theology:
 - Revelation supplies mysteries (Trinity, Incarnation) that exceed natural speculative capacity.
 - Faith is assent to revealed truth aided by grace and the authority of God.
 - Epistemic relations:
 - Faith and reason do not conflict because they have distinct objects and principles; where apparent conflict arises, proper interpretation/ordering resolves it.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Aristotle (metaphysics, causality), Augustine (grace, illumination), Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius; medieval Latin commentators and Islamic/Jewish thinkers (Averroes, Avicenna, Maimonides) as situational rivals.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, natural theology, epistemology, doctrine of God (divine simplicity, causality), Trinity and Incarnation as instances of mysteries, grace and infused virtues, analogy of being.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **a disciplined synthesis that affirms reason's reach into first causes while locating salvific truth in the ordered primacy of revealed faith and grace.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong metaphysical realism: being (ens) is the primary intelligible datum; analogy of being (analogia entis) mediates talk of God.
 - Clear hierarchical ordering: natural reason prepares and serves supernatural faith (ratio subordinate but not subverted).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against radical Augustinian fideism: Aquinas grants robust autonomy to natural reason.
 - Against Averroist strictures: he denies the eternity of the world and the unity of intellect that would obliterate individual knowledge and Christian doctrines.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinction between demonstrative knowledge (scientia), probable philosophical knowledge (philosophia), and theological knowledge (theologia) as infused and authoritative.
 - Systematic use of analogy (not equivocation or univocity) in theological predication.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Reformed thinkers accept some natural theology but critique Thomistic metaphysics (e.g., divine simplicity, analogy) and emphasize scriptural primacy; Calvinists more cautious about speculative metaphysics.
 - Modern revival: Neo-Thomism, papal endorsements (notably John Paul II's encyclical titled Fides et Ratio), analytic Thomism, and contemporary natural theology debates draw heavily on Thomistic frameworks.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a paradigmatic model for integrating philosophy and theology; invaluable for courses on natural theology, doctrine of God, and medieval scholastic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (fides)** - assent to divinely revealed truth, mediated by authority and grace; not irrational but supra-rational.
- **Reason (ratio)** - discursive intellective power that reaches causality, metaphysical principles, and natural law.
- **Natural theology** - knowledge of God attainable by reason from created effects (e.g., Five Ways).
- **Supernatural theology** - knowledge derived from revelation (Trinity, Incarnation); requires grace for assent and understanding.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - predication about God based on proportionate similarity, avoiding univocity and equivocity.
- **Divine simplicity** - God is not composed; attributes identical to essence; used to ground causality and aseity.
- **Infused virtues / theological virtues** - grace-enabled dispositions (faith, hope, charity) that orient intellect and will beyond natural capacity.
- **Demonstrative knowledge (scientia demonstrativa)** - syllogistic, causal knowledge of first principles and effects.
- **Active intellect / agent intellect** - Aristotelian-Thomistic account of intellectual abstraction; basis for universal knowledge.
- **First cause / Unmoved mover** - metaphysical ground established by causal arguments for God's existence.
- **Revelation vs. reason boundary** - distinction limiting reason's reach and legitimizing revealed mysteries.
- **Authority of Scripture and Magisterium** - while reason can corroborate, faith ultimately appeals to divine authority.
- **Analytic vs. synthetic theology** - method: logical argumentation integrated with doctrinal exposition.
- **Natural law** - moral-philosophical application of reason rooted in created order; bridge between ethics and theology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **source for definitions** of natural theology and the relation of faith and reason.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both fideism and rationalist reductionism.
 - As a **model for theological method** in systematic theology, apologetics, and doctrinal formulation.
