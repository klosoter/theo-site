### TITLE
Of the Integrity and Purity of the Hebrew and Greek Text - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-17th century English Puritan / Reformed milieu (post-Westminster Confession era). Owen writes as a leading Puritan theologian addressing controversies about scriptural authority and textual reliability amid confessional conflicts with Roman Catholics, rising textual criticism, and Protestant polemics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, as the linguistic carriers of divine revelation, have been providentially preserved with sufficient integrity and purity to secure the Church's doctrine and faith; Scripture self-attests and does not require ecclesiastical fiat for its authority.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation that God who inspired the Scriptures also providentially preserves the words necessary for doctrine and life.
 - Distinction between divine inspiration of autographs and the providential preservation of subsequent textual witnesses; affirmation that the church possesses reliable texts in Hebrew and Greek.
 - Appeal to internal evidences (coherence, efficacy, testimony of the Spirit) as grounds for Scripture's self-attestation and saving authority.
 - Response to objections: critique of claims that textual variants undermine doctrine; rebuttal of appeals to ecclesiastical authority (Romanist position) or radical skepticism.
 - Practical conclusion: confidence in reading, translating, preaching, and defending the text for doctrine and practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** implicit opponents include Roman Catholics (appeal to Church infallibility), radical skeptics over textual corruption, and early critics of received texts; uses patristic testimony, Hebrew (Masoretic) and Greek textual tradition evidence, and Reformed confessional principles.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, inspiration, inerrancy (in principle), preservation, canonicity, authority and sufficiency of Scripture, role of the Spirit in testimony, limits of ecclesiastical authority.
- **Closing line:** Owen centrally insists that Scripture, in its original divine intent and in a providentially preserved textual form, is self-authenticating and sufficiently pure to ground Reformed doctrine and the Christian life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong coupling of *inspiration* with *providence of preservation* - God not only gave the words but preserves them for the church's use.
 - Emphasis on *self-attestation* (internal witness) as normative for authority, not the institutional church.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Romanist appeals to ecclesial magisterium by arguing Scripture's authority does not depend on church declaration.
 - Counters radical textual skepticism by distinguishing between incidental variants and the doctrinally decisive content that remains stable.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear working distinction between the autographs (original inspired documents) and the providentially preserved copies/editions - allowing confidence without claiming absolute perfection of every extant manuscript.
 - Use of paired categories **"integrity"** (wholeness, continuity of revelation) and **"purity"** (freedom from doctrinal corruption) as technical descriptors of the text-state needed for faith and practice.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly regarded in Reformed and Puritan circles as a robust defense of biblical reliability and a model of confessional apologetics.
 - Influenced later conservative approaches to textual reliability and the doctrine of preservation; less influential for modern critical textual methodologies, but frequently cited in polemical contexts defending Scripture's sufficiency.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a theological framework balancing confidence in the text with realistic engagement of textual variation.
 - Useful pedagogically for teaching the doctrine of Scripture, apologetics against ecclesiastical or skeptical challenges, and pastoral assurance about the Bible's trustworthiness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Integrity:** The continuity and wholeness of revelation across Scripture; God preserves the intended deposit so doctrine remains intact.
- **Purity:** Freedom of the text, as transmitted, from corruptions that would alter essential doctrine or faith.
- **Autographs:** The original inspired writings; acknowledged as the primary locus of inspiration though not extant.
- **Providential preservation:** The doctrine that God has preserved the essential words of Scripture in the textual tradition accessible to the church.
- **Self-attestation (internal witness):** The Bible's own capacity, aided by the Spirit, to confirm its divine origin and authority to believers.
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit:** The experiential and cognitive confirmation by the Holy Spirit that Scripture is divine and saving.
- **Canonicity:** The recognition and delimiting of books as Scripture; Owen treats canon as historically attested and the basis for textual trust.
- **Inspiration:** Divine authorship of Scripture; Owen maintains inspiration of the originals and a derivative authority for preserved texts.
- **Textual variants:** Differences among manuscripts; Owen distinguishes between non-essential variants and stable doctrinal core.
- **Received Text (practical reliance):** The presently available Hebrew and Greek texts that the church may confidently use for doctrine and worship.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture:** Scripture contains all that is necessary for faith and life; preserved texts suffice for this purpose.
- **Ecclesiastical authority vs. Scripture:** Owen rejects the notion that the church's declaration creates scriptural authority.
- **Masoretic/Hebrew and Greek texts:** Owen treats the original language tradition as authoritative carriers of revelation.
- **Translation/vernacular use:** Emphasis that faithful translations are legitimate heirs of preserved texts for the church's use.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **doctrinal definition source** for preservation, authority, and self-attestation in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against claims that ecclesial authority or textual skepticism nullifies biblical trust.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for balancing textual-critical awareness with confidence in the Bible's doctrinal sufficiency.
