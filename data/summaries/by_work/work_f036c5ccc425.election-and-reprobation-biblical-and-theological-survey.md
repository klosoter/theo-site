### TITLE
Election and Reprobation: Biblical and Theological Survey - Thomas Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical environment; aimed at seminarians, pastors, and scholars engaged in debates among classical Calvinism, Arminianism, and Molinism. Rooted in exegetical, biblical-theological method rather than purely systematic theology.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** Scripture teaches divine election and reprobation as expressions of God's sovereign saving purpose and righteous judgment; these doctrines must be understood in ways that are exegetically faithful, theologically coherent, and pastorally responsible.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of key Old and New Testament texts (e.g., Deut/Isaiah themes of election; Romans 8-11, Ephesians 1, John 6) to establish biblical data.
 - Theological synthesis defending sovereignty of God in election while upholding human responsibility and moral accountability.
 - Critical engagement with rival views (foreknowledge-as-basis, Molinist middle knowledge, simple foreknowledge, and various libertarian accounts of freedom) and articulation of a compatibilist framework.
 - Distinction between different kinds of divine will (decretive vs. permissive) and between election to salvation and reprobation to judgment.
- **Figures/sources/interlocutors:** Frequent engagement with Augustine, Calvin, key Reformers, Arminius, Molina, and contemporary theologians representing both Calvinist and non-Calvinist positions; heavy reliance on canonical biblical exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (election, predestination, justification), divine sovereignty and providence, human will and responsibility, the problem of evil and divine justice, covenant theology contours, Christology as ground of election (election centered in Christ).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Schreiner locates the theological center of gravity in a biblically grounded, Reformed affirmation that divine election is an act of sovereign grace rooted in God's eternal purpose in Christ, coherently framed with human responsibility and God's justice regarding reprobation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Exegetical emphasis over abstract systematics:** Schreiner privileges close readings of canonical texts (notably Romans 9-11 and Ephesians 1) as the decisive theological horizon, resisting speculative theological constructions untethered to Scripture.
- **Balanced compatibilism:** Affirms divine determinative will in accomplishing God's purposes while maintaining genuine human culpability; resists both fatalistic determinism and libertarian indeterminacy.
- **Pastoral restraint and careful language:** Avoids sensationalized formulations (e.g., crude double-predestination caricatures) and insists on sober, pastoral categories-God's sovereignty is proclaimed alongside the call to faith and evangelism.
- **Corrective to non-Reformed accounts:** Explicitly critiques explanations that ground election merely in foreseen faith (foreknowledge-as-causation) and the Molinist middle-knowledge solution, arguing these undermine God's gracious initiative and biblical texts that portray election as God-originated.
- **Terminological clarity:** Distinguishes between election, predestination, foreknowledge, and reprobation with attention to Greek/Hebrew usage; clarifies theological consequences of conflating terms.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical contexts as a concise, scripturally driven primer; valued for teaching, preaching, and as a corrective to popular misunderstandings of predestination.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a compact, principled model for integrating exegesis and systematic concerns; valuable as a starting point for further study in Pauline theology, covenantal frameworks, and pastoral applications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Election:** God's choosing of persons or a people for salvation; for Schreiner, primarily an act of divine grace grounded in Christ and Scripture.
- **Predestination:** The eternal decree by which God determines the certain future of the elect; linked to God's foreordaining purpose.
- **Reprobation:** God's judicial passing over or condemnation of the wicked; affirmed as just and grounded in divine holiness.
- **Foreknowledge:** Distinguishes simple foreknowledge (God's prior knowledge of future events) from views that make foreknowledge the basis of election; Schreiner resists the latter.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism):** The Molinist claim that God elects based on knowledge of counterfactuals; critiqued as undermining divine grace and biblical portrayals of election.
- **Compatibilism:** The view that divine sovereignty and human responsibility are compatible; Schreiner uses this to account for human culpability without denying God's sovereign decrees.
- **Decretive vs. permissive will:** Decretive will = what God ordains to happen; permissive will = what God allows though not ordained; used to explain God's role in sin and reprobation.
- **Corporate vs. individual election:** Notes corporate dimensions (Israel, the church) and the reality of individual election; emphasizes Christocentric grounding of God's electing purpose.
- **Romans 9-11:** Central exegetical locus; Schreiner reads these chapters as key to understanding God's sovereign election and the place of Israel.
- **Ephesians 1:** Used to demonstrate predestination as rooted in God's will and the cosmic scope of election in Christ.
- **Human responsibility:** Affirmed as real and biblically attested; not eliminated by the doctrine of election.
- **Divine justice and mercy:** Reprobation is presented as consistent with God's righteousness; election as an expression of mercy.
- **Pastoral use:** Schreiner's work models how to preach and teach election without fatalism or spiritual insensitivity.

How this work is used:
- As a succinct exegetical-model for teaching Romans/Ephesians on election.
- As a definitional resource in Reformed curricula to distinguish election, foreknowledge, and reprobation.
- As a polemical touchstone against foreknowledge-as-basis and Molinist accounts.
- As a conceptual pivot for integrating doctrine of God, Christology, and soteriology in pastoral theology.
