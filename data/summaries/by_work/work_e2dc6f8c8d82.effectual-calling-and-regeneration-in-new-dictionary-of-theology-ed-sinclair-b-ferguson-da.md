### TITLE
**Effectual Calling and Regeneration** - Sinclair B. Ferguson, New Dictionary of Theology (ed. S. B. Ferguson & D. F. Wright), 1988

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed theological consolidation; evangelical and Reformed revival of confessional theology. The article functions within a compendium intended for pastors and students seeking concise, doctrinally careful definitions and guidance.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To define and defend the classical Reformed understanding that **effectual calling** and **regeneration** are distinct but inseparably related works of the Holy Spirit in bringing the elect to salvation - countering both semipelagian/Arminian and hyper-Calvinist distortions.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define terms: external/general call (preaching, gospel offer) vs effectual/internal call; regeneration as the Spirit's sovereign imparting of new life.
 - Scriptural warrant: appeals to key texts (e.g., John 6; Romans 8; Ephesians 2; Titus 3) to show divine initiative and the Spirit as principal agent.
 - Logical and pastoral order: explains how regeneration (ontological renewal, new heart) relates to and typically precedes or accompanies faith, enabling a genuine response; effectual calling is the Spirit's efficacious summons that results in repentance and faith.
 - Pastoral implications: assurance, evangelistic zeal, and care to avoid both fatalism and moral passivity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Classical Reformed authorities (John Calvin, John Owen, Westminster Confession/Divines).
 - Opponents: Arminian/semi‑Pelagian emphases on human ability/prevenient grace; also responses to hyper‑Calvinist misuse of "irresistible."
 - Biblical exegesis rather than extended church-historical argumentation; appeals to confessional formulas.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (ordo salutis), Pneumatology (work and agency of the Holy Spirit), Election, Faith and repentance (as gifts/fruit), Scripture as normative witness; covenant theology is present as background presupposition.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Effectual calling and regeneration are the Spirit's sovereign, gracious, and saving interventions that transform the elect into newness of life, making the external call effectual and securing a faith-formed response in union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precision in distinguishing **external call** (general, universal proclamation) from **effectual call** (particular, Spirit-wrought), while refusing to divorce them theologically.
 - Stress on **ontological character of regeneration** (not merely moral insight or decision) - a real impartation of life.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects Arminian tendency to make human will decisive by stressing monergistic divine action.
 - Counters hyper-Calvinist complacency by affirming the continued necessity and responsibility of gospel proclamation.
- **Conceptual/terminological notes:**
 - Careful use of terms like "irresistible grace" - defended in effect but nuanced pastorally to avoid deterministic caricature.
 - Distinguishes causal sequence (regeneration enabling faith) from absolute chronological precision (often simultaneous in experience).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, pastoral account of calling and new birth.
 - Functions as a go-to concise exposition in seminary syllabi and pastoral handbooks.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models how to combine biblical exegesis, confessional fidelity, and pastoral sensitivity in treating contested soteriological topics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Effectual calling:** The Spirit's inward, sovereign summons that inevitably results in conversion for the elect; distinct from but enacted through means (preaching).
- **External (general) call:** The universal proclamation of the gospel which may be resisted; the ordinary means by which God issues his invitation.
- **Regeneration (new birth):** A real, inward renovation of the sinner (new heart, new life) effected solely by the Spirit.
- **Monergism:** Doctrine that God alone is the effective agent in regeneration and conversion; human will is enabled, not decisive.
- **Prevenient vs efficacious grace:** Distinguishes semipelagian/prevenient formulations from Reformed claim that saving grace is efficacious for those whom God effectually calls.
- **Ordo salutis (order of salvation):** Framework for relating regeneration, calling, faith, justification; Ferguson treats order functionally and theologically without rigid chronological demands.
 - Regeneration often prior to or concurrent with faith in Reformed schema.
- **Union with Christ:** The relational ground in which calling and regeneration bear saving fruit; brings believer into Christ's life and righteousness.
- **Irresistible grace:** Historic Reformed label for effectual calling; defended but explained to avoid mechanical fatalism.
- **Repentance and faith:** Fruit and gift enabled by regeneration; not grounds of election but the Spirit-wrought response.
- **Holy Spirit as agent:** Central actor; author of new life and the one who applies Christ's redemption.
- **Election:** Sovereign basis for effectual calling and regeneration; shapes pastoral tone but not invitation.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral corollary - true effectual calling and regeneration open the way to biblical assurance through visible fruit and union with Christ.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for Reformed doctrine on calling and new birth.
- As a **polemic resource** against Arminian/semipelagian readings and against reductive hyper‑Calvinism.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading key texts on calling, regeneration, and John 6.
- As a **pastoral-theological template** for preaching, catechesis, and assurance teaching.
