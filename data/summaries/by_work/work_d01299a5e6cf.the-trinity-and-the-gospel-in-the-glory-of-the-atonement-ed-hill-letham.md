### TITLE
The Trinity and the Gospel - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (in The Glory of the Atonement, ed. J. I. Packer, J. Letham & S. Hill)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed retrieval of classical Trinitarianism in soteriology; contribution to an ecumenical volume on atonement that seeks doctrinal clarity for preaching and systematic theology.
 - Moves within conservative Reformed scholarship reacting to functionalist and "economic-only" accounts of the Trinity in contemporary theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Gospel (particularly the doctrine of atonement) presupposes and discloses the Trinity; the economic distinctions in the economy of salvation must be grounded in real, personal relations within the Godhead (the ontological Trinity). Soteriology collapses or distorts if the Son is treated merely as a role or function.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exposition: biblical texts (especially Johannine and Pauline material) present the Father sending the Son and the Spirit in ways that display personal relations, not mere modes or functions.
 - Historical-theological appeal: the classical tradition (Athanasius, Augustine, the creeds) and the Reformed confessions safeguard the connection between the eternal relations and the divine acts in salvation.
 - Critical diagnosis: contemporary models that privatize the immanent Trinity or reduce persons to economic roles undermine the personal authorship of redemption and the unity of divine action.
 - Constructive proposal: affirm the **inseparable operations** of the one God while maintaining real personal distinctions - the Son personally accomplishes the work of redemption in the economy because he is personally Son in the ontology of God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical patristic and conciliar sources; major Reformed theologians; contemporary theologians who separate economic and immanent Trinities or emphasize functional subordination (treated critically).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (ontological vs economic), Christology (person and work of the Son), Incarnation, Atonement (obedience, substitution), Revelation (self-disclosure of triune God), divine agency and operations.
- **Closing line**
 - Properly grasped, the Gospel is intrinsically Trinitarian: the atonement testifies to and depends on the real, personal relations of Father, Son, and Spirit rather than on mere functional distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that the economic Trinity is a disclosure of the ontological Trinity - not a merely pragmatic or temporal role-playing of God.
 - Emphasizes the personal authorship of redemption: the Son's obedience, suffering, and resurrection are the acts of the divine Son himself, not of an anonymous or merely human agent.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects reductionist "economic-only" or role-based Trinitarian accounts that risk making the Son merely a function; counters social-Trinitarian tendencies that can fragment divine unity or make persons into quasi-autonomous centers.
 - Reclaims classical Reformed categories (inseparable operations, communication of operations) against modern bifurcations of ontology and economy.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Reworks familiar terms (mission, sending, obedience) to highlight personal subsistence rather than temporary function.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a corrective to functionalist Trinitarianism; used in confessional Trinitarian and soteriological apologetics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise model for linking doctrinal Trinity and practical proclamation of the Gospel; helpful for preachers, systematic theologians, and those defending classical Christology against modern revisions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ontological Trinity**
 - The internal, eternal relations and personal subsistences of Father, Son, Spirit - real distinctions that ground who God is.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed in history in the works of creation, redemption, and sanctification; the self-disclosure of the triune God.
 - Gaffin: economic revelations disclose, not invent, ontological reality.
- **Inseparable operations**
 - The one divine action of God in which each person participates; used to maintain unity of divine works while preserving personal distinctions.
- **Sending / Mission (missio)**
 - The Father sending the Son (and Spirit); emphasized as personal mission rooted in eternal relations, not a mere functional role.
- **Personal obedience of the Son**
 - The Son's active and passive obedience in atonement is the work of his person; crucial for substitutionary, covenantal soteriology.
- **Functionalism / economic-only model**
 - The view criticized: persons are primarily roles; risks undermining personal identity and the unity of divine action.
- **Perichoresis / relationality**
 - Mutual indwelling and relational life of the persons; used to explain unity without confusion.
- **Communication of properties / operations**
 - Reformed theological tool to account for the divine works as the acts of the triune God without collapsing persons.
- **Revelation as personal**
 - Revelation is not impersonal information but the self-giving of triune persons in salvation history.
- **Atonement as Trinitarian event**
 - Atonement involves Father-sending, Son-obedience, Spirit-application - integrated as the one saving act of God.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** linking Trinitarian ontology to soteriology in systematic treatments.
 - As a **polemic** against functionalist/social-Trinitarian reductions and against any account that detaches the Gospel from personal Trinitarian authorship.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Johannine and Pauline texts that present sending, obedience, and participatory divine action as mutually revealing.
