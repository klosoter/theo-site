### TITLE
**Alvin Plantinga, "The Free Will Defense" (in The Problem of Evil, ed. Adams & Adams, 1990)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion; reaction to classical formulations of the logical problem of evil (Mackie) and to evidential arguments (Rowe).
 - Plantinga builds on and refines earlier essays (1960s-1980s) using modal/possible-worlds analysis prominent in analytic metaphysics and epistemology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The existence of gratuitous or intense moral evil is logically compatible with an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God when one grants libertarian creaturely freedom and certain metaphysical constraints on what God can create.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Restatement of the "inconsistent triad" (God omnipotent/omniscient/omnibenevolent vs. existence of evil).
 - Move 1: Distinguish a *defense* (showing logical compatibility) from a full *theodicy* (an explanation that cites God's reasons).
 - Move 2: Argue that free will is a great good, and that God could not create free creatures who never choose evil without violating the very freedom that makes them morally significant.
 - Move 3: Introduce the modal notion of possible worlds and the concept of **transworld depravity**: for some creatures, in every feasible world in which God creates them, they commit at least some morally wrong actions.
 - Move 4: Conclude that it is possible (and thus the logical problem fails) that God could not actualize a world with significantly free creatures who nonetheless refrain from moral evil.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary targets: J. L. Mackie (logical problem of evil), William Rowe (evidential problem), classical theists (Augustine, Leibniz) and Humean skeptics.
 - Engages analytic theologians concerned with freedom, omnipotence, and modal metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence (limits and structure of divine governance), divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence), human free will (libertarian freedom), moral responsibility.
 - Less emphasis on soteriology or Christology; focuses on metaphysics and ethics as they bear on theodicy.

- **Closing line**
 - Plantinga's theological center of gravity: the logical problem of evil is defanged once one recognizes that God's admission of morally significant libertarian freedom plausibly entails the possibility (or necessity) of moral evil.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Uses modal/possible-worlds language to show mere *possibility* suffices to defeat the logical impossibility claim.
 - Emphasizes the intrinsic value of libertarian freedom as a theologically weighty good.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Mackie's claim of logical inconsistency by offering a straightforward countermodel rather than seeking to reconcile all good-making reasons.
 - Distinguishes sharply between showing compatibility (defense) and offering God's reasons (theodicy), avoiding overreach.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and clarified **transworld depravity** as a way of articulating why even an omnipotent God might be unable to actualize a morally flawless free world.
 - Systematized "defense" vs "theodicy" distinction in contemporary discussion.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential across analytic theology and philosophy of religion; considered a decisive reply to the logical problem of evil.
 - Provoked sustained debate: defenders of the evidential problem press for probabilistic arguments; Molinists, Calvinists, open-theists and skeptics offer contrasting accounts of divine foreknowledge/providence.
 - Adopted, critiqued, and refined in Reformed and broader Christian circles; became standard in graduate instruction.

- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches careful mapping of metaphysical possibilities before inferring logical impossibility; indispensable for courses on the problem of evil, divine attributes, and philosophical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free Will Defense**
 - A strategy showing logical compatibility of God and moral evil by appeal to libertarian freedom.
- **Logical Problem of Evil**
 - The claim that God's existence is logically incompatible with any evil; Plantinga aims to refute this.
- **Theodicy vs Defense**
 - *Defense*: shows possible compatibility. *Theodicy*: offers actual reasons God has for permitting evil.
- **Transworld Depravity**
 - The claim that some possible persons would do wrong in every feasible world in which they exist free.
- **Possible Worlds (modal analysis)**
 - Tool for assessing whether a state of affairs (God + no evil) is metaphysically possible.
- **Libertarian Free Will**
 - Freedom understood as genuine alternative possibilities not determined by antecedent states.
- **Omnipotence / Omniscience / Omnibenevolence**
 - Classical divine attributes whose mutual compatibility with evil is under scrutiny.
- **Counterfactuals of Freedom**
 - Statements about what free agents would do under hypothetical circumstances; central to transworld arguments.
- **Greater-Goods Defense**
 - Related move: some evils may be permitted because they enable higher goods (e.g., morally significant persons).
- **Providence (limits)**
 - Plantinga reframes divine providence as constrained by respect for creaturely freedom.
- **Evidential Problem (contrast)**
 - While Plantinga defeats logical inconsistency, he concedes (implicitly) that evidential/probabilistic arguments require separate response.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional pivot** in discussions of "Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, and the Problem of Evil": it provides the standard model for reconciling providence with libertarian freedom and clarifies limits on divine control.
- As a **polemic and conceptual resource** in "Theodicy and Divine Justice": used to rebut logical impossibility charges and to reframe justice questions in terms of moral responsibility and the value of freedom.
