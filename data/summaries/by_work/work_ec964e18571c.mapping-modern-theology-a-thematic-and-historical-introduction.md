### TITLE
Mapping Modern Theology: A Thematic and Historical Introduction - Kelly M. Kapic & Bruce L. McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary introductory textbook (21st century) aimed at seminary and advanced undergraduate audiences; written in the context of renewed interest in mapping the plurality of "modern" theological responses to Enlightenment, Romantic, and post-Enlightenment intellectual shifts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Modern theology is best grasped as a set of diverse, historically situated responses to the epistemic and cultural conditions of modernity (e.g., autonomy of reason, historicism, rise of critical biblical scholarship). The book argues for a thematic-historical mapping that neither flattens diversity nor isolates doctrines from their intellectual contexts.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: intellectual and cultural roots of modernity (Enlightenment, Romanticism, Idealism, Pietism).
 - Part II: major methodological shifts (historicism, correlation, demythologization, existential hermeneutics).
 - Part III: treatment of central loci - revelation and Scripture, doctrine of God and Trinity, Christology, soteriology, sin/anthropology, ecclesiology, sacraments, and ethics.
 - Part IV: 20th-century reactions and movements (dialectical theology/Barth, Bultmannian existentialism, neo-orthodoxy, liberation, feminist, and constructive retrievals).
 - Each chapter ties a doctrinal locus to its philosophical and cultural interlocutors and then evaluates enduring theological implications.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Schleiermacher, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard; 19th-century liberal theology; Rudolf Bultmann; Karl Barth; Emil Brunner; Tillich; Bonhoeffer; Pannenberg; Moltmann; Rahner and von Balthasar; modern Protestant and Catholic trajectories; selected contemporary constructive theologians. Philosophical interlocutors include Kantian and German idealist streams, Romanticism, and existentialism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, doctrine of God and Trinity, Christology, sin and anthropology, soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments, theological method and hermeneutics, ethics, theology and modern culture.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The work functions as a cartography of modern theological options: it maps how changing intellectual contexts shaped doctrines and how theology must negotiate fidelity to tradition and intelligibility in modernity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uses a deliberate cartographic metaphor: theology as terrain to be mapped rather than monolith to be defended or demolished.
 - Integrates historical and systematic concerns so readers see doctrines in dynamic relation to cultural-philosophical shifts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes beyond simple "liberal vs. conservative" binaries by showing internal pluralities within liberal, neo-orthodox, and existential strands.
 - Challenges teleological narratives that present modern theology as linear decline or straightforward progress.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes "mapping" and "navigation" as methodological tools-focus on loci as nodes in wider intellectual networks.
 - Highlights methodological vocabularies (correlation, demythologization, existential interpretation) as keys to reading theological moves.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used as a classroom textbook and reference: valued for clarity, breadth, and balanced critical evaluation.
 - Praised for ecumenical scope; critiqued by some for breadth at expense of depth in specialist treatments.
 - Influential among Reformed instructors for providing accessible engagement with Barthian and post-Barthian currents (McCormack brings Barthian sensitivity).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Excellent roadmap for students encountering the pluralism of modern theology.
 - Provokes constructive reflection on method: how to read theological claims in their intellectual contexts without collapsing doctrinal truth into cultural expression.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Modernity:** Cultural-intellectual horizon defined by autonomy of reason, historicism, and secular critique; background condition for modern theology.
- **Enlightenment:** Philosophical movement emphasizing reason and critique that reconfigured authority claims for theology.
- **Romanticism / Idealism:** Intellectual sources that reshaped conceptions of religion, feeling, and the absolute (important for Schleiermacher and post-Enlightenment theology).
- **Historicism:** The conviction that knowledge is historically conditioned; impacts biblical criticism and doctrinal development.
- **Correlation method:** Theological method (e.g., Rahner, Tillich) seeking dialogue between Christian doctrine and contemporary questions.
- **Demythologization:** Bultmannian program to reinterpret New Testament language in existential terms.
- **Dialectical theology / Neo-orthodoxy:** Movement emphasizing divine transcendence and discontinuity with culture (Barth as central figure).
- **Revelation vs. Scripture:** Distinct loci-revelation as divine act/event; Scripture as normative witness-debates over inspiration, inerrancy, and hermeneutics.
- **Christology (modern):** Debates over historicity, kerygmatic vs. metaphysical accounts, and the relation of resurrection to existential faith.
- **The doctrine of God / Trinity:** Modern challenges to classical theism (immanence vs transcendence, relational models, metaphysical reconstructions).
- **Theological anthropology & sin:** Shifts from optimistic Enlightenment anthropology to tragic or existential accounts in 19th-20th centuries.
- **Ecclesiology and sacraments:** Responses to privatized religion and institutional critique; ecclesial identity in secular contexts.
- **Mapping/cartography (method):** Analytic principle-locating doctrinal moves within networks of philosophical, cultural, and hermeneutical commitments.
- **Use in loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for identifying and differentiating modern movements and methods.
 - As a **pedagogical roadmap** for courses in modern theology, history of doctrine, and doctrinal loci.
 - As a **critical resource** for constructive theologians to locate their own proposals within historical trajectories.
