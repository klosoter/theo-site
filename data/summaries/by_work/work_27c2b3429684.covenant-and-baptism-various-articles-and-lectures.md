### TITLE
Covenant and Baptism (articles and lectures) - Gregg Strawbridge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical milieu (late 20th-21st century). Spoken/written as a programmatic defense of paedobaptism within covenantal theology and pastoral ministry; addresses debates with credobaptist scholarship and with variant covenant views (e.g., New Covenant Theology).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Baptism is the covenantal sign and seal of the promise of the covenant of grace, properly administered to covenant households (including infants). Its theological status must be held between two errors: reduction to mere symbol (purely memorial) and identification with automatic regeneration.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Biblical-theological exegesis:
 - Continuity of signs: baptism as the new-covenant counterpart to circumcision; household baptisms in Acts and Pauline references support infant inclusion.
 - Scriptural criteria for covenant membership emphasize promise and seed language, not exclusively personal profession.
 - Theological construction:
 - Distinguish sign, seal, and instrumentality: baptism is a sign/seal of the promise, not necessarily the instrumental means of justification; but it normally accompanies covenantal nurture and the Spirit's work.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial implications: baptism marks covenant identity and grounds discipleship and catechesis for children.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Responds to credobaptist insistence on believer-only baptism by challenging their exegesis of household texts and weakening of covenant continuity.
 - Counters sacramentalizing tendencies that attribute automatic regeneration to the water.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Reformed confessional tradition (Westminster, Heidelberg) and classical expositors on circumcision/baptism typology.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include credobaptist scholars and ministers, as well as advocates of various covenant modifications (e.g., NCT).
 - Uses Scripture as primary warrant, supported by patristic and Reformed precedent.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (covenant of grace, promise/seed), sacramentology (signs and seals), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, covenant households), soteriology (regeneration, promise and faith), pastoral theology (child training, catechesis).
- **Closing line:** The work centers the baptismal question within covenantal continuity: baptism functions primarily as the covenantal sign/seal of Gods promise to his people and their seed, warranting infant inclusion and pastoral obligation without collapsing into either ritual magic or mere symbolism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the *promissory logic* of covenant membership: children of believing parents are included under the promise unless explicitly shown otherwise.
 - Carefully parses **efficacy** language: baptism as a declarative sign that normally accompanies (but does not mechanically produce) the Spirit's covenant work.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against credobaptists: tightens the typological continuity between circumcision and baptism and re-reads household baptisms as ecclesial, not merely family or incidental.
 - Against sacramental maximalists: resists the view that baptism is ex opere operato (automatic regeneration), reaffirming forensic and covenantal priorities.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes common categories around *covenantal incorporation* and *signal vocation* rather than strictly sacramental instrumentality or symbolic memorial.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed circles as a concise defense of paedobaptism for pastors and students.
 - Used in polemical exchanges with Baptist writers; less persuasive to those outside covenantal presuppositions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact, pastorally sensitive model linking theology, exegesis, and parish practice; valuable as a classroom primer on covenantal sacramentology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism (sign and seal):** The visible sign and confirming seal of the covenant promise; marks covenant status and warrants catechesis.
- **Covenant of grace:** The unifying framework: Gods promise to his people and their seed, which baptism signifies.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology:** Baptism as the new-covenant counterpart to circumcision; used to argue for infant inclusion.
- **Paedobaptism (infant baptism):** Defended as the normative implication of covenant continuity and household baptisms.
- **Credobaptism (believer baptism):** Treated as the principal opposing position; critiqued on exegetical and covenantal grounds.
- **Efficacy (instrumental vs declarative):**
 - Instrumental: whether baptism is a means by which God effects regeneration (the author resists strong instrumentalist claims).
 - Declarative/confirmatory: baptism certifies and seals the promise, normally attendant to the Spirit's work.
- **Mode (sprinkling/affusion/immersion):** Practical/secondary concern; theological emphasis placed on sign function rather than exclusive mode.
- **Covenantal incorporation:** The concept that baptism places individuals within the covenant community for nurture and discipline.
- **Visible vs invisible church:** Distinction used to justify administering baptism to covenant children while recognizing faith is ultimately heart-work of the Spirit.
- **Household baptisms:** Key exegetical locus (Acts, 1 Cor) argued to indicate inclusion of children.
- **Promise/seed language:** Scriptural motif used to ground infant inclusion.
- **Regeneration vs marking:** Clarifies that baptism marks expected covenantal regeneration without guaranteeing it.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for paedobaptist sacramental language and covenantal categories in classroom and pulpit.
- As a **polemic** tool against credobaptist readings of household texts and against over-sacramentalizing accounts.
- As an **exegetical model** for treating household baptisms and the circumcision-baptism analogy.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology: grounds infant baptism while insisting on catechesis and covenantal discipline.
