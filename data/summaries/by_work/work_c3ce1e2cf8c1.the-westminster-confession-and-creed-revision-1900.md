### TITLE
**The Westminster Confession and Creed Revision (1900) - B. B. Warfield**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Turn-of-the-century American Presbyterianism; Princeton theological conservatism confronting internal calls to modify creedal subscription in face of modernist pressures.
 - Debate occasioned by attempts within Presbyterian bodies to revise or relax subscription to the Westminster Confession as a response to new biblical-critical and doctrinal currents.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Warfield defends the theological sufficiency and ecclesial necessity of the Westminster Confession against revisionist impulses, arguing that revision threatens the coherence of Reformed doctrine - especially the covenantal framework that undergirds systematic theology.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of the Confession as a faithful distillation of Scriptural truth, not a mere historical artifact or optional formulary.
 - Identification of revisionist motives (accommodation to modern opinion, theological vagueness) and critique of their method (pragmatic, non-doctrinal).
 - Defense of confessional subscription as essential to denominational identity and doctrinal fidelity; insistence that alterations erode the interlocking system of doctrines (notably covenant theology).
 - Positive restoration: clarifies how the Confession correctly orders doctrine (Scripture, Trinity, Christ, covenant, sacraments, church) and so must be preserved.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit interlocutors: denominational revision committees and modernist theologians pressing for looser subscription.
 - Primary sources: Westminster Confession and catechisms, Scripture, patristic and Reformed precedent as cited to vindicate the Confession.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture, confessional subscription, covenant theology (including the Covenant of Redemption as theological substratum), Trinity, Christology, soteriology (predestination), church polity and sacraments.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the Confession as the doctrinal hinge of Reformed orthodoxy: to tamper with its terms is to unsettle the covenantal system that constitutes genuine Presbyterian theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats confessional revision not merely as administrative housekeeping but as a theological fault-line: revision undermines the covenantal architecture (esp. Covenant of Redemption/Covenant of Grace) that gives coherence to doctrine.
 - Emphasizes the Confession's role as a theological instrument that shapes pastoral practice and ecclesial identity, not an optional philosophical summary.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with revisionists who prioritize adaptability or broad latitude of belief; offers a conservative corrective emphasizing continuity with Reformation and Westminster Assembly intentions.
 - Reasserts the legitimacy of strict/real subscription against looser, purely declaratory approaches.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts the dispute in contractual/covenantal language: revision as a rupture in the church's covenantal fidelity rather than a neutral editorial change.
 - Links confessional fidelity to the metaphysical reality of the covenantal relationship between the Father and the Son (Covenant of Redemption) as grounding soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among early 20th-century conservative Presbyterians and subsequent Reformed orthodox circles; used as a touchstone in subscription controversies.
 - Cited in later conservative retrenchments as an exemplar of intellectual and ecclesial resistance to theological liberalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching confessional theology, for demonstrating a principled defense of confessions, and for modeling how doctrinal systems interlock (particularly covenant theology) against fragmenting tendencies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession**
 - The primary confessional standard defended as faithful to Scripture and crucial to Reformed identity.
- **Confessional Subscription**
 - The practice and degree of assent required of ministers/members; Warfield defends robust subscription.
- **Creed Revision**
 - Proposed changes to confessions; analyzed as theologically consequential, not merely textual.
- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - The intra-Trinitarian pact by which the Father and Son agreed on the plan of salvation; Warfield treats this as the doctrinal substructure that the Confession safeguards.
 - Used to explain the unity of Christology and soteriology in the Confession.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The historical administration of salvation through Christ across ages; central to Warfield's argument about sacramental and ecclesial continuity.
- **Authority/Inerrancy of Scripture**
 - Scripture as normative ground for the Confession; assaults on this authority drive calls for revision.
- **Theological Realism**
 - Warfield's posture that doctrines correspond to objective divine realities (e.g., covenant); confessions map these realities.
- **Predestination**
 - Treated as an integral and coherent doctrine within the Confession's system, not to be eased by revision.
- **Subordinate Standards**
 - The Confession as subordinate to Scripture but binding as ecclesial standard; Warfield clarifies the relationship.
- **Ecclesiastical Polity**
 - Connexions between doctrine and church governance; revision threatens ecclesial stability.
- **Sacraments as Seals**
 - Reformed sacramental theology defended as consistent with covenantal structure.
- **Doctrinal Integrity**
 - The unity and mutual support of doctrines; key criterion against piecemeal alteration.
- **Historical Continuity**
 - The Confession's fidelity to Reformation and patristic streams; rationale for preservation.
- **Subscription (strict v. loose)**
 - Distinction between requiring full assent and permitting exceptions; Warfield favors principled strictness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessionalism and confessional subscription in Presbyterian studies.
 - As a **polemic** against theological liberalism and revisionist tendencies.
 - As an **exegetical-model** resource for linking covenant theology (including Covenant of Redemption) to systematic loci.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over the ecclesial function of creeds and the proper relation of Scripture and subordinate standards.
