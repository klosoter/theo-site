### TITLE
"The New Testament Terminology of the Second Advent" - B. B. Warfield (in Selected Shorter Writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theological milieu; conservative Reformed apologetics in response to liberal biblical criticism and modernist doubts about literal eschatology. Warfield writes as a systematic theologian-philologist defending historic evangelical readings of NT eschatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The NT employs a consistent set of Greek terms (parousia, epiphaneia, apokalupsis, etc.) that, when properly understood, sustain a literal, future, and public Second Advent; alleged "delay" does not force reinterpretation into purely spiritual or non-eschatological categories.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Lexical and contextual survey of principal NT terms for "coming" and "revelation."
 - Distinction of semantic ranges (visibility, manifestness, judgment, blessing) and their canonical distribution (Pauline, Petrine, Johannine, Synoptic).
 - Theological synthesis showing these terms cohere to a single future, decisive divine intervention - the Parousia - whose postponement is addressed within NT theology (purpose: mercy, probation, covenant faithfulness).
 - Polemical rebuttal of critics who read delay as doctrinal failure or as evidence that early Christianity spiritualized its eschatology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary exegesis of Jesus, Paul, Peter, Johannine literature; interlocution with contemporary critics of his day (broadly: higher critics and liberal theologians who minimized or reinterpreted eschatological language).
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology (Second Advent, Day of the Lord), Christology (role and mode of Christ's coming), soteriology (eschatological judgment and salvation), revelation (apokalupsis as unveiling), and the theological purpose of delay.
- **Closing line:** Warfield frames NT terminology as converging on a single, future, public Parousia whose temporal postponement is a providential occasion for mission and repentance, not a defeater of literal hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precision in Greek lexical theology combined with dogmatic concern: terms are not interchangeable synonyms but form a network of related emphases (manifestation, presence, unveiling).
 - Emphasis on the visible, bodily, and judicial dimensions of the Advent in contrast to purely mystical or realized readings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Challenges liberal readings that treat delay as evidence of theological collapse or re-interpretation; instead asserts theological reasons for delay within apostolic discourse (divine patience, mission).
 - Rejects overly spiritualized allegorizing popular among some modern interpreters.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Moves beyond mere lexical listing to show theological function: how different terms shape eschatological expectation and pastoral ethics in the NT.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly regarded in conservative Reformed and confessional circles as a model of conservative exegetical theology.
 - Influenced mid-20th-century evangelical treatments of eschatology and remains a frequent citation in apologetic defenses of a future, visible return.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact exemplar of combining philology and dogmatics; valuable for clarifying NT vocabulary and for polemical contexts addressing "delay of the Parousia."

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia** - "coming/presence"; central Pauline term denoting the Lord's public, manifest arrival; implies both presence and authoritative visitation.
- **Epiphaneia** - "manifestation" or "appearance"; stresses the visible disclosure of Christ, often in glory and judgment.
- **Apokalupsis** - "unveiling/revelation"; denotes the disclosure of heavenly realities, especially the eschatological revelation of Christ and his kingdom.
- **Phanerosis / Phaneroo** - "making manifest"; often overlaps with epiphaneia but with nuance toward effect - bringing into view what was hidden.
- **Parousia vs. Epiphaneia** - Warfield distinguishes functional nuance: parousia denotes the event of arrival, epiphaneia the mode of manifestation or glory associated with that arrival.
- **Delay (of the Parousia)** - not a doctrinal embarrassment; theological reasons given in the NT include divine patience, opportunity for repentance, and the unfolding of redemptive history.
- **Imminence vs. Postponement** - Warfield preserves NT tension: expectation of imminent return (ethical urgency) coexists with recognition of postponement providentially ordained.
- **Day of the Lord** - eschatological day of divine intervention incorporating judgment and consummation; lexical overlap with parousia vocabulary.
- **Coming of the Lord** - a composite phrase capturing juridical, salvific, and consummative aspects emphasized across NT corpora.
- **Visible/Bodily Return** - Warfield stresses corporeal and public dimensions, countering spiritualized or purely symbolic readings.
- **Judgment and Salvation** - Terms frequently hover between punitive unveiling (apokalupsis) and soteriological consummation (epiphaneia as blessedness).
- **Presence vs. Presence-as-Event** - careful distinction: parousia is presence realized in a decisive eschatological act, not merely spiritual indwelling.
- **Canonically situated semantics** - emphasis on how term usage across authors yields a coherent doctrine rather than isolated senses.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Employed as a **definitional lexicon** for NT eschatological terminology in systematic and biblical theology.
 - Used **polemic**ally to rebut liberal/revisionist claims about the "failure" or spiritualization of eschatological expectation.
 - Serves as an **exegetical model**: shows how lexical and contextual analysis can inform dogmatic conclusions on the Second Advent.
