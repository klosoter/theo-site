### TITLE
**A New Way of Seeing? A Response to the Critics of Federal Vision** 
Steve Schlissel (various essays and online articles). 
Site usage: 1 reference - topic: **Federal Vision / Monocovenantalism**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Mid-2000s to 2010s polemical and pastoral context within Reformed denominations-responses to formal denominational critiques of the Federal Vision (FV) movement. Primarily circulated as online essays and responses to position papers and public critiques.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Defend core FV emphases (notably monocovenantalism and covenantal objectivity) against charges that FV undermines Reformed teaching on justification, imputation, and the efficacy of the sacraments. Argues critics misunderstand FV's categories and pastoral aims.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Clarify FV terminology and distinguish varieties within the FV movement (avoid straw-man conflations). 
 - Re-state a single covenant of grace (monocovenantalism) as the hermeneutical key for understanding Israel/church continuity. 
 - Reconcile forensic doctrines (justification, imputation) with covenantal and sacramental realities by emphasizing corporate union with Christ and objective covenant status. 
 - Defend sacramental efficacy (particularly baptism) as real entry into the covenant community without reducing justification to works. 
 - Offer pastoral implications: covenantal assurance, church discipline, and catechesis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary critics are denominational committees and Reformed theologians who authored public condemnations. Scriptural exegesis of covenantal texts (OT covenant promises, NT union with Christ passages) and engagement with classic Reformed figures by appeal rather than sustained historical reconstruction.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Covenant theology (monocovenant vs. bicovenant models), justification and imputation, union with Christ, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), ecclesiology (covenant membership), election and perseverance, grace and works.
- **Closing line:** 
 - Schlissel frames the issue as perceptual: a **reframing of covenant and sacramentality** that seeks to preserve forensic justification while insisting on the objective, public, and communal realities of covenant membership.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on **monocovenantal continuity** between Israel and the church as corrective to bifurcated covenant schemes. 
 - Emphasis on **objective covenant status** (entrance and privileges of covenant membership are not merely subjective promises but ecclesial facts marked by sacraments).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against readings that isolate justification from covenantal incorporation; resists critics who equate FV with antinomianism or outright denial of imputation. 
 - Contrasts with stricter forensic-only models by weaving forensic declarations into a broader covenantal-soteriological framework.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clarifies and retools common categories (e.g., "covenant status," "federal headship as objective union") to highlight corporate identity rather than merely legal standing.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Controversial reception: influential among FV sympathizers as a corrective and clarifier; regarded skeptically or rejected by many in mainstream Reformed bodies who authored critical reports. Contributed to reshaping denominational debates and ongoing scholarly discussion of covenantal theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Useful as a concise, polemical primer for understanding FV responses; valuable for teaching the interplay of covenant, sacraments, and forensic doctrines and for training pastors on pastoral-covenantal practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal Vision (FV):** umbrella term for a cluster of covenantal emphases; Schlissel defends its central claims and distinguishes legitimate variants.
- **Monocovenantalism:** the claim that there is one covenant of grace throughout redemptive history; used to argue Israel/church continuity and sacramental continuity.
- **Covenant of grace:** the single covenant that frames salvation history; Schlissel emphasizes its public, corporate administration.
- **Covenant status:** objective standing of persons as members of the covenant community (entry marked by sacraments), distinct from final justification.
- **Union with Christ:** treated as the relational reality grounding both forensic declarations and covenant privileges; described as corporate and objective.
- **Justification / Imputation:** affirmed in forensic terms yet integrated into a covenantal account that sees imputation connected to union and public declaration.
- **Sacramental efficacy (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** sacraments effectual as signs and seals that bring persons into covenant life without supplanting faith or forensic justification.
- **Corporate election:** election discussed primarily in corporate, covenantal terms rather than simply individual forensic language.
- **Perseverance / Covenant faithfulness:** perseverance framed as covenantal fruit and evidence of covenant standing; pastoral emphasis on discipline and catechesis.
- **Works and faith:** rejects simple antithesis; presents works as covenantal obedience that flows from and evidences faith.
- **Covenantal nomism (heuristic):** used descriptively to signal law/obligation within covenant life without implying legalistic salvation.
- **Federal headship:** headship language re-emphasized to show solidarity and representation in Christ.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition and clarification** source for FV monocovenantal positions. 
- As a **polemic and pastoral defense** against denominational critiques. 
- As an **exegetical model** for reading covenant texts and sacramental passages. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating forensic doctrines with communal-covenantal theology.
