### TITLE
**Baptism: The Believer's First Obedience - Gordon T. Smith**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed milieu concerned with sacramental practice, church membership, and formation of disciples. Written for pastors, students, and lay readers amid ongoing debates between credobaptist and paedobaptist traditions.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Baptism is the believer's first act of obedient discipleship**: it is the normative inaugural obedience by which a repentant, professing believer is publicly identified with Christ, incorporated into the covenant community, and set on the path of sanctification.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical grounding: careful readings of key New Testament texts (notably Acts 2; Romans 6; Colossians 2; the Gospels) show baptism as tied to repentance, faith, and incorporation into Christ.
 - Theological synthesis: baptism is presented as a covenantal and ecclesial ordinance-neither mere symbol nor magical rite-that mediates identity in Christ without functioning as the automatic instrument of regeneration.
 - Pastoral application: practical guidance for preaching, pastoral care, liturgy, and nurture-baptism as the hinge between conversion and ongoing discipleship.
 - Polemical engagement: critique of infant baptism (paedobaptism) as disconnecting baptism from conscious obedience; critique of reductionist views that turn baptism either into a private sign of individual salvation or an empty ritual.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: biblical authors (Paul, Luke, the Gospel tradition), historical practices (early church), and contemporary Baptist and Reformed theologians. Implicit engagement with patristic, Reformation, and modern sacramental debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (church membership, sacraments), covenant theology, soteriology (relation of faith, repentance, baptism), pneumatology (baptism and Spirit), Christology (union with Christ), and pastoral theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Baptism is framed as the decisive, public, covenantal act by which a believer enters Christ, the church, and the lifelong process of obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Emphasis on obedience as primary theological category**
 - Baptism is described first and foremost as the believer's obedient response, not primarily as a sign of inward grace or a mere social rite.
- **Balanced sacramental view**
 - Avoids sacramentalism (baptism as automating regeneration) and ritual reductionism (baptism as only symbolic), insisting on real incorporation into Christ without deterministic mechanics.
- **Covenantal and ecclesial focal point**
 - Stresses baptism's role in covenant membership and ecclesial boundaries; baptism as the public mark of entry into the covenant community.
- **Pastoral and formative thrust**
 - Written with pastoral sensitivity: liturgical suggestions, discipleship links, and formation strategies that tie baptism directly to ongoing Christian nurture.
- **Corrective to both paedo- and credobaptist extremes**
 - Challenges infant baptism's decoupling from personal faith while also correcting credobaptist tendencies to privatize baptism's communal and covenantal significance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Used in evangelical seminaries and churches as an accessible, practice-oriented theological resource; valued by pastors for clarity and bridge-building between traditions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise theological-pastoral model linking biblical exegesis, doctrinal coherence, and congregational practice-helpful for preaching, membership instruction, and ecumenical conversation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Believer's baptism**
 - Baptism administered to those who have professed repentance and faith; the book's normative recommendation.
- **Obedience**
 - Primary descriptor: baptism as first act of obedience following conversion.
- **Union with Christ / baptismal union**
 - The theological locus for understanding how baptism signifies participation in Christ's death, resurrection, and new life (cf. Romans 6).
- **Covenant sign**
 - Baptism framed as the visible sign of entry into the covenant community (ecclesial and generational implications noted).
- **Sacrament / Ordinance**
 - Treated dialectically: sacramental in signifying and realigning identity, yet an ordinance in being commanded and grounded in faith.
- **Regeneration**
 - Distinguished from baptismal efficacy: regeneration is related to but not mechanically identical with the act of baptism.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Baptism's relation to the Holy Spirit (gift, witness, empowerment for discipleship) is emphasized.
- **Public profession / witness**
 - Baptism as communal testimony and boundary-marking for church membership.
- **Discipleship nexus**
 - Baptism as entry point for deliberate formation, spiritual practices, and pastoral accountability.
- **Paedobaptism (contrast)**
 - Critiqued for potential separation of sign and personal faith; historical and pastoral considerations are acknowledged without polemic.
- **Ecclesial incorporation**
 - How baptism effects belonging to the local and universal church.
- **Liturgy & catechesis**
 - Practical implications: recommended practices for baptismal liturgy and pre-/post-baptismal instruction.
- **Baptism and conversion**
 - Relationship between inner faith/repentance and outward rite: sequence and mutual witness.
- **Boundary-marker**
 - Baptism as the community's clear marker for who belongs and who is to be discipled.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for believer's baptism in pastoral and classroom settings.
 - As a **polemic resource** in baptismal debates-temperate but pointed critique of infant baptism separations.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 6 and Acts on baptismal significance.
 - As a **practical liturgical/catechetical guide** for churches shaping membership and baptismal preparation.
