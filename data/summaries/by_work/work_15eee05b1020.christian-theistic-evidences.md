### TITLE
Christian Theistic Evidences - Cornelius Van Til 
(mid-20th century Reformed apologetic work; foundational for presuppositionalism)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Reformed milieu reacting to classical evidentialism, British empiricism, and liberal theology; shaped by Kuyperian neo-Calvinism and interaction with Barthian rejection of natural theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Christian theism (Scriptural, Trinitarian revelation) is the necessary presupposition for rationality and intelligible experience; non-Christian thought is internally inconsistent because it denies the only adequate ultimate reference.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Expose the impossibility of neutral ground: all reasoning presupposes an ultimate commitment.
 - Offer a transcendental-style analysis: show that the possibility of knowledge, laws of logic, uniformity of nature, and moral obligations presuppose the Christian God.
 - Critique classical proofs and natural theology as either insufficient or illicit when treated apart from revelation.
 - Defend a "properly basic" circularity: Christian faith legitimately grounds reason because revelation is self-attesting and provides the ultimate criterion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical apologists (evidentialists), Kantian and empiricist epistemologies, Barthian critiques of natural theology; draws on Scripture heavily and on Reformed intellectual heritage (Kuyper, Bavinck) while forging novel apologetic method.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and general), epistemology (knowledge and presuppositions), God (transcendence and Trinity as normative), sin and the noetic effects of sin, analogy/analogy of being (rejected), common grace, Christology as epistemic locus.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on the claim that only a Scriptural, Trinitarian theism provides the coherent epistemic foundation for logic, science, and ethics; apologetics must begin by presupposing, not proving, that revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presuppositional method: knowledge begins with God's self-revelation; apologetics is exposure of inconsistent presuppositions rather than bare argumentation to a neutral judge.
 - Transcendental argument applied historically and biblically: show the necessary conditions for intelligibility that require the Christian God.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against classical evidentialism: evidences are subordinate to worldview commitments; proofs cannot establish neutral rationality.
 - Against analogia entis (classical analogical being): rejects a natural ontological bridge between God and creaturely knowledge; emphasizes qualitative Creator-creature distinction.
 - Relative to Barth: affirms Barth's rejection of natural theology but extends into a presuppositional epistemology that insists on engaging unbelieving thought as inconsistent.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Antithesis" as epistemic and existential: the ongoing, pervasive contrast between Christian and non-Christian systems.
 - Clarification of "properly basic" faith-circularity as legitimate grounding, not vicious circularity.
- **Reception & influence**
 - Core text for later Reformed presuppositionalists (Bahnsen, Frame and others react to or develop Van Til); controversial among evangelicals who favor evidentialism; influenced Reformed seminaries and apologetic curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - Sharpens worldview-sensitive apologetics; forces re-examination of epistemic foundations in theology and philosophy; valuable for teaching about the relation of revelation and reason.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - Apologetic posture that begins with God's revelation as the necessary cognitive presupposition.
- **Transcendental argument** - Move showing that the intelligibility of experience requires the Christian God as explanatory ground.
- **Antithesis** - The fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought-worlds; shapes reasoning and moral perception.
- **Properly basic / circularity** - The claim that Christian belief can be epistemically basic and that circular reasoning grounded in revelation is not vicious.
- **Analogy of being (analogía entis)** - Rejected as a root problem in classical theism; Van Til insists on Creator-creature qualitative distinction.
- **Noetic effects of sin** - The doctrine that sin distorts the unbeliever's cognitive faculties and presuppositions, producing internal inconsistency.
- **Common grace** - Allows non-Christians to make true scientific and moral claims, but does not provide ultimate epistemic justification apart from revelation.
- **Revelation (special vs general)** - Special revelation (Scripture, Christ) is the authoritative, self-attesting norm; general revelation is providential and evidential but insufficient alone.
- **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology** - Van Til insists systematic theology must be rooted in Scripture but argues apologetics/systematics must presuppose the whole counsel of God to perform their normative role.
 - Biblical theology: descriptive study of redemptive-historical data.
 - Systematic theology: constructive articulation that presupposes revelation as the organizing norm.
- **Barthian reformulation / Rahner's rule (methodological tensions)** - Van Til draws on Barth's rejection of natural theology but criticizes any method that softens the epistemic demand that revelation be the controlling presupposition; engages debates where Rahner-style methodological rules (accounting for human experience/transcendental conditions) are reworked into a Christocentric or revelational standard.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for presuppositional apologetics and a primary exposition of Van Tilian epistemology.
 - As a **polemic** against classical evidentialism and analogia entis.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on apologetics, philosophical theology, and Reformed systematic method - used to reframe discussions of reason, revelation, and worldview.
