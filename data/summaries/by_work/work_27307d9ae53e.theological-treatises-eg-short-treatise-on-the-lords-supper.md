### TITLE
John Calvin - Theological Treatises (exemplar: Short Treatise on the Lord's Supper)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation, Geneva as theological and ecclesial laboratory.
 - Polemical moment: contested Eucharistic theologies (Roman transubstantiation vs. Zwinglian memorialism vs. Lutheran sacramental union).
 - Calvin writing amid consolidation of Reformed churches and confessional formation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper is a **means by which the Holy Spirit unites believers spiritually to Christ**; it is neither a mere memorial nor a corporeal transference of Christ's natural body.
 - Sacraments function as **visible words**: signs and seals that, through the Spirit and faith, convey the benefits promised in Scripture.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis of Eucharistic texts (John 6; 1 Cor 11; Synoptics) to establish Christ's promise and the Spirit's role.
 - Polemic against Roman Catholic metaphysics of substance (transubstantiation) and against an exclusively memorialist reading.
 - Theological synthesis: sacramentality defined by **instrumentality** - sacraments are instruments or means, not automatic efficient causes.
 - Sacraments require the concurrent work of the Spirit and the faith of the recipient.
 - Distinction between sign (visible element) and reality (Christ's spiritual feeding).
 - Ecclesial and pastoral applications: order, administration, and the sacrament's role in assurance and eschatological hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Roman Catholic theologians (Council of Trent milieu), Huldrych Zwingli, Martin Luther, and other Reformers.
 - Heavy reliance on Augustine for sacramental theology and on Pauline and Johannine texts.
 - Use of conciliar and creedal language (Chalcedon, Nicene heritage) for Christological and Trinitarian framing.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology, ecclesiology, pneumatology, Christology (two natures), bibliology (authority of Scripture), and eschatology (foretaste of heavenly banquet).
 - Implicitly engages Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian debates via teachings on regeneration, grace, and faith.

- **Closing line**
 - Calvin centers the Lord's Supper as a **Scriptural, Spirit-wrought instrument** by which believers are spiritually fed by Christ and strengthened in covenantal assurance, rejecting both a merely memorial and a corporeal-transubstantiation account.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Spiritual real presence**: Christ is really present, but not in a physical local sense; presence is effected by the Holy Spirit.
 - **Sacrament as instrument (instrumental causality)**: sacraments are means through which God administers grace, conditioned by faith but not meritorious.
 - Emphasis on the **visible word** - sacraments as God's external preaching.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against Luther: denies corporeal ubiquity; presses a stronger pneumatological mediation.
 - Against Zwingli: insists on more than memory - sacraments convey actual spiritual benefit.
 - Against Roman Catholicism: rejects Aristotelian substantial change (transubstantiation) and sacramental ex opere operato as mechanical.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarification of "instrumentality" vs. "efficacy" in sacramental causation.
 - Tight linkage of sacrament, Spirit, and faith as a triadic economy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Reformed confessions (Heidelberg Catechism, Westminster Standards) and to later Reformed sacramental theology.
 - Shaped Protestant debates with Lutherans and Catholics; formative for Reformed pastoral practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact model for integrating exegesis, pneumatology, and ecclesial practice; widely used in sacramental instruction and confessional theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Real spiritual presence** - Christ truly present in the sacrament by the Spirit, not locally or physically.
- **Sacrament as sign and seal** - visible sign that seals the promise and certifies God's gift.
- **Instrumentality** - sacraments function as instruments used by God to communicate grace.
- **Visible word** - sacraments are an outward preaching of the Gospel.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological/relational ground for partaking; mediated by Spirit and faith.
- **Holy Spirit (agent in sacraments)** - effects communion with Christ; grounds sacramental efficacy.
- **Faith as receptive organ** - faith receives the Spirit's work; the sacrament presupposes and strengthens faith.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture / inner testimony** - Scripture's authority is confirmed by the Spirit's witness; tradition is subordinate.
- **Communicatio idiomatum (Christological relevance)** - Chalcedonian two-natures framing used to deny any physical transfer of Christ's natural body while upholding real benefit.
- **Rejection: Transubstantiation** - metaphysical change of bread/wine is denied.
- **Rejection: Pure memorialism** - reduces supper to remembrance, insufficient for Calvin's theology of grace.
- **Regeneration and indwelling** - regeneration is the Spirit's work; sacraments are not automatic regenerating causes but confirm and nourish the indwelling life.
- **Filioque / Trinitarian economy** - Calvin accepts creedal formulations while emphasizing economic roles and avoiding speculative metaphysics.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed sacramentology and pneumatology.
 - As **polemic** in controversies with Catholics, Lutherans, and radical reformers.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading sacramental texts that integrates covenantal, Christological, and pneumatological motifs.
