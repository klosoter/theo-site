### TITLE
Essays on the Lord's Supper - Oscar Cullmann 
(mid-20th century Lutheran-ecumenical scholarship; focus: eucharist as eschatological event)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century, post-war theological renewal and ecumenical conversation. Cullmann writes as a historical theologian and New Testament scholar reacting to Bultmannian demythologizing, historicist sacramentalism, and confessional polemics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper is primarily an **eschatological participation** in the already/not-yet presence of Christ: a foretaste and pledge of the Parousia that unites individual believers with the risen Christ and anticipates cosmic consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base in Pauline and Johannine texts (esp. 1 Cor 10-11) and synoptic anamnesis texts.
 - Historical survey of patristic eucharistic understanding to show early emphasis on participation and future fulfillment.
 - Systematic move: distinguish sacrament as **anticipatory presence** (eschatological event) from metaphysical theories of substantial presence.
 - The eucharist mediates both **individual eschatology** (personal participation in Christ's resurrection and life) and **cosmic eschatology** (anticipation of the transfigured creation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with the New Testament, early church fathers (Justin, Irenaeus, Augustine), Luther and Calvin, and modern scholars (implicit dialogue with Bultmann, Barth, and sacramental theology in both Catholic and Protestant traditions).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (presence of the risen Christ), eschatology (individual and cosmic), sacramental theology (nature and function of sacraments), ecclesiology (koinonia, body of Christ), and partially soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically, Cullmann centers the Lord's Supper as **eschatological participation**: the meal is a real but non-metaphysical encounter with the risen Christ that both personalizes resurrection life and points toward cosmic consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists that the eucharist is primarily temporal-eschatological (a participation in the coming kingdom) rather than ontologically transforming bread and wine.
 - Stresses the sacrament's double horizon: it reaches backward to Christ's once-for-all act and forward toward the Parousia.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Scholastic / Roman Catholic metaphysical accounts that locate presence in sacramental change (e.g., transubstantiation).
 - Pure memorialism that reduces the meal to mental remembrance (Zwinglian extremes).
 - Reductionist demythologizing that strips the meal of historical/eschatological content.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Articulation of the eucharist as a means of "eschatological presence" - presence defined by the horizon of the Parousia rather than physical presence or mere signification.
 - Emphasis on participation (koinonia) rooted in resurrection time rather than sacramental ontology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in ecumenical dialogues over the eucharist; used to bridge Protestant and Catholic conversations by reframing presence in eschatological rather than metaphysical terms.
 - Cited by both Reformed and Lutheran scholars as a corrective to purely memorialist or overly ontologizing accounts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable hermeneutic model tying NT exegesis, patristic witness, and systematic reflection; remains a primary resource for teaching the eucharist as eschatological anticipation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anamnesis**
 - The liturgical remembrance that makes the past salvific event present; Cullmann reads it as anticipatory, not mere recollection.
- **Parousia**
 - The coming of Christ; the decisive temporal horizon that gives the Supper its eschatological meaning.
- **Koinonia**
 - Fellowship/participation - Cullmann stresses koinonia with the body and blood as participation in the risen Christ and in the future community.
- **Realized / inaugurated eschatology**
 - The doctrine that the kingdom has begun in Christ; the Supper is a present participation in that inaugurated reality while awaiting consummation.
- **Individual eschatology**
 - Personal resurrection and life in Christ; the Supper confirms and effects believers' participation in this.
- **Cosmic eschatology**
 - Renewal of creation; the Supper anticipates the restoration of all things and the cosmic body of Christ.
- **Memorialism (contrast)**
 - Treats the meal as symbolic remembrance; Cullmann critiques this as insufficiently eschatological.
- **Real Presence (reframed)**
 - Not metaphysical local presence but eschatological presence - Christ present insofar as the eschaton is anticipated and believers are united to him.
- **Sacrament as sign vs. event**
 - Cullmann moves beyond a simple sign-model: the Supper is a sign that is also an event of eschatological incorporation.
- **Once-for-all / unique christological act**
 - Emphasizes Christ's historical, decisive act (death/resurrection) as the basis for the Supper's significance.
- **Foretaste / pledge**
 - The meal functions as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet and a pledge of the final state.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for an eschatological account of sacraments (shifts discussion from ontology to temporality).
- As a **polemic resource** against both memorialism and scholastic substantialism in eucharistic debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians and synoptic institution traditions through the lens of inaugurated eschatology.
