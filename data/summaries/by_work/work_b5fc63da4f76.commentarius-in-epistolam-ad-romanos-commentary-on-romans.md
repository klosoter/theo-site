### TITLE
Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos - Francis Turretin (Reformed scholastic exegesis on Romans; 17th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism centered in Geneva; Turretin (1623-1687) writes within a polemical post-Westphalian milieu against Roman Catholic, Arminian, Socinian and radical-enthusiast interpretations. The work is Latin, methodical, and designed for academy use (pastoral and disputational audiences).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Exegetically to show that Paul teaches forensic justification by imputed righteousness in union with Christ, and pastorally to defend Reformed soteriology (union, election, effectual calling) against rivals. Related pneumatological questions (including the Baptism of the Holy Spirit) are subordinated to this soteriological center.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Verse-by-verse exegesis of Romans with scholastic distinctions and quaestiones.
 - Reconstructs Pauline theology around union with Christ as the key explanatory category for justification, sanctification, adoption, and eschatology.
 - Deploys canonical and patristic citations, then subjects rival readings (Arminian, Romanist, Socinian, enthusiastic) to textual and theological critique.
 - Treats pneumatology where Romans addresses the Spirit (esp. Romans 5-8), arguing for the Spirit's role in union, regeneration, indwelling, and sealing rather than for subsequent "sign" phenomena.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy engagement with Augustine and Calvin for interpretive tradition; dialogue with contemporaries and opponents in Reformed scholasticism; explicit polemics against Arminian and Socinian positions and against charismatic/enthusiast readings prevalent in his day.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture (authority and hermeneutics), justification (imputation), union with Christ, regeneration, sanctification, adoption, eschatology, and pneumatology (including the Baptism of the Holy Spirit).
- **Closing line:** Turretin reads Romans to secure a Reformed, forensic, and covenantal soteriology in which the Spirit effects union with Christ (the real ground of justification and sanctification), thereby rebutting both works-righteousness and extra-conversion charismatic claims.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Exegetical-scholastic fusion:** Combines close verse-by-verse exegesis with scholastic precision-definitions, distinctions, and disputation-making the commentary both pastoral and academically rigorous.
- **Union as hermeneutical key:** Turretin consistently privileges "union with Christ" as the interpretive lens for Pauline data; this organizes his answers on justification, sanctification, and the Spirit.
- **Pneumatological restraint:** On the Baptism of the Holy Spirit Turretin affirms a single, objective, effectual baptism that unites the believer to Christ at conversion (regenerative and sealing), rejecting a required subsequent charismatic baptism as a normative Christian experience.
- **Corrective to enthusiasts and Arminians:** He corrects predecessors who either spiritualize baptismal and Pauline language or split Spirit-work into multiple normative stages; he also tightens the forensic vocabulary against semi-Pelagian appeals.
- **Terminological clarity:** Reintroduces careful Latin terminologies (baptisma Spiritus, unio Christi, imputatio, justificatio) with precise technical definitions, aiding later Reformed systematicians.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed academies (especially Geneva and Swiss cantons) and in later Puritan and Presbyterian contexts as a consolidating voice of high orthodoxy; less influential among Pietist/evangelical currents that emphasized subsequent Spirit experiences.
- **Enduring value:** Model of disciplined Reformed exegesis-useful for teaching how to read Pauline soteriology and pneumatology together, and for polemical clarity against a range of errors.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptisma Spiritus (Baptism of the Holy Spirit):** For Turretin, the Spirit-baptism is the one normative, objective act by which believers are united to Christ, effected in conversion, and constitutive of justification and newness of life; not a distinct post-conversion charismatic rite.
 - Contrast: Not a second, subsequent experiential anointing demanded for Christian maturity.
- **Unio Christi (Union with Christ):** Central explanatory principle-ground of imputation, source of sanctification, and locus of justification.
- **Imputatio (Imputation):** Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers; the language Turretin uses to secure justification as declarative and objective.
- **Justificatio (Justification):** Declared righteousness through faith alone; defended against both ceremonial and semi-Pelagian redefinitions.
- **Regeneratio (Regeneration):** Effect of the Spirit tied to union; Turretin treats regeneration as inseparable from the Spirit's baptismal work.
- **Sealing (Sellae Spiritus):** The Spirit as seal and assurance of the believer's inheritance; linked to the baptismal union and not treated as a separate subsequent sign.
- **Adoptio (Adoption):** Familial status consequent on justification and union; traced through Pauline anthropology.
- **Sanctificatio (Sanctification):** Progressive outworking of union; the Spirit's indwelling is the power for obedience, but not redefined as a new baptismal stage.
- **Pneumatologia (Pneumatology):** Systematic account of the Spirit grounded in Pauline texts; cautious about charismatic excesses.
- **Scriptura (Scripture authority):** Exegetical method governed by sola Scriptura, tested against patristic and scholastic sources.
- **Forensic language:** Emphasized to counter moralistic or mystical readings that undermine declaration by faith.
- **Polemic usage:** Turretin's categories are often invoked in confessional debates to deny second-blessing Spirit-baptism schemes.
- **Exegetical model:** Used as a template for verse-by-verse scholastic exegesis in Reformed seminaries.
- **Definition source:** Consulted for precise definitional work on terms like "baptism of the Spirit," "union," and "imputation" in systematic treatments.
