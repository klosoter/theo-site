### TITLE
**Theonomy in Christian Ethics - Greg L. Bahnsen** 
(focused notes emphasizing epistemological implications; cited topic: Existence And Knowability Of God)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century American Reformed milieu (Reconstructionist/theonomic movement; influenced by Cornelius Van Til's presuppositional apologetics and earlier Dutch Reformed covenantalism).
 - Reaction against liberal theology, secular legal theory, and religious pluralism; dialog with R.J. Rushdoony, Gary North, and critics across Reformed and secular ethics.
- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical law (including Old Testament civil/judicial statutes) is normatively binding for contemporary civil society because the existence and knowability of the triune God ground moral and legal epistemology; there is no neutral, non‑Christian epistemic ground for ethics or law.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm the full authority of Scripture and distinguish moral, civil/judicial, and ceremonial law.
 - Claim continuity: moral and civil/judicial laws reflect God's unchanging will and therefore retain normative force beyond Mosaic cultic context.
 - Epistemological claim: knowledge of God is both possible and necessary; only the Christian theistic presupposition secures logic, morals, and intelligibility (transcendental or presuppositional move).
 - Practical application: civil magistrate is obliged to enforce God's law (including specific penalties), as an outworking of covenantal fidelity and public justice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: proponents of secular/legal positivism, proponents of autonomous natural law, and moderate Reformed ethicists skeptical of civil application of OT penalties.
 - Intellectual debts: Cornelius Van Til (apologetics), classical Reformed confessions (for law categories), Rushdoony and Reconstructionist applications.
 - Critics engaged: mainstream Reformed scholars who challenge the continuist application of Mosaic civil sanctions and those who dispute the presuppositional method.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as epistemic norm), Covenant theology (covenant structure grounds law application), Law (moral/civil/ceremonial distinctions), Role of the magistrate/church-state relations, and Epistemology (God as precondition of intelligibility).
- **Closing line**
 - The book's theological center of gravity: the knowable, sovereign God is the necessary epistemic and moral foundation for law; therefore Scripture's civil ordinances must shape Christian social and political ethics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong coupling of presuppositional epistemology with a juridical, law-centered ethic: God's knowability is not abstract but the ground for public legal norms.
 - Insistence on specific continuity of Old Testament civil sanctions as normative for modern magistrates.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with classical natural law insofar as Bahnsen denies an autonomous, neutral rational basis for ethics apart from revelation; contrasts with liberal separationism that treats Scripture as private moral guidance only.
 - Corrects (as Bahnsen sees it) both pietistic privatism and a diluted "moralistic" natural theology that seeks common ground with unbelievers.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of the presuppositional/transcendental argument (TAG) to ethics and law - arguing that only the Christian worldview renders moral laws intelligible and binding.
 - Clear juridical taxonomy emphasizing civil/judicial laws as binding in principle, not purely typological or temporary.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant influence in Reconstructionist and certain Reformed circles; galvanized debate across Reformed theology about the role of Old Testament law and the magistrate.
 - Largely controversial in broader Reformed and evangelical scholarship; often used as a foil in debates over church‑state relations and apologetic method.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative synthesis of epistemology and ethics: forces careful attention to presuppositions in moral reasoning.
 - Valuable as a rigorous portrait of how revelation‑centered epistemology can be applied to public law and political theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theonomy** - rule of God's law as normative for civil society; not merely private piety.
- **Presuppositionalism** - apologetic method insisting that one must begin with Christian presuppositions to make sense of experience and reason.
- **Transcendental Argument for God (TAG)** - argument that logic, morality, and intelligibility presuppose the existence of the Christian God.
- **Civil/Judicial Law** - OT statutes governing public order; Bahnsen treats these as retaining normative force.
 - Contrast: distinguished from ceremonial (temporary) and moral (universal) law, though argued to be standard‑bearing.
- **Moral Law** - reflects God's eternal character; serves as universal ethical norm and basis for civil judgment.
- **Law-Covenant Continuity** - covenantal framework that links Mosaic civil law to God's unchanging covenant obligations.
- **Common Grace** - acknowledged but limited; does not provide ultimate epistemic or juridical grounding apart from revelation.
- **Antithesis** - the fundamental opposition between Christian and non‑Christian worldviews; no neutral middle ground.
- **Natural Law (contrasted use)** - critiqued when treated as an autonomous rational foundation apart from Scripture.
- **Biblical Inerrancy** - presupposed as necessary for treating OT civil statutes as authoritative.
- **Epistemic Privileging of Revelation** - thesis that revelation, not autonomous reason, secures the preconditions of intelligibility.
- **Magistrate** - role defined as God‑ordained agent to enforce divine law in society.
- **Capital Punishment (in application)** - Bahnsen affirms certain capital penalties prescribed in OT as warranted for maintaining public justice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for theonomic ethics and juridical continuism.
- As a **polemic** against secularist neutrality and autonomous natural law in legal/political theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading OT civil law through covenantal continuity.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in epistemology debates: exemplar of presuppositional/transcendental application beyond pure apologetics into ethics.
