### TITLE
De Necessaria Secessione Nostra ab Ecclesia Romana - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-17th century Reformed scholasticism (Turretin, Academy of Geneva). Post-Reformation polemical atmosphere; ongoing confessional consolidation after the Synod of Dort and the Thirty Years War. Turretin writes within a presbyterian/Reformed framework defending confessional separation from Rome.
- **Central thesis:** It is necessary and lawful for Reformed Christians and churches to secede from the Roman (Catholic) Church when that body openly maintains doctrinal error and usurps ecclesiastical authority; such separation is a faithful expression of ecclesial discipline and preservation of the true church.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes criteria for a true (visible) church and marks by Scripture and Reformed confessions.
 - Demonstrates Roman deviations (papal supremacy, sacramental inflation, juridical usurpation, public idolatry) that invalidate communion.
 - Argues normative duty to withdraw: secession is not mere schism but necessary discipline where unity would imply complicity in error.
 - Grounds obligation in Scripture, natural law, and the rights/limits of ecclesiastical and civil magistracy.
 - Treats practical forms of separation: individual, congregational, and consistorial action; relation to pastoral offices and presbyterial structures.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, early church fathers for marks of the church, Reformed authorities (Calvin, Beza, Ursinus), and Roman controversialists (e.g., Bellarmine, Suarez) as primary interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, marks), authority (Sola Scriptura vs magisterium), sacraments (nature, validity, abuses), ministry & offices (ordination, plurality of elders, ministerial jurisdiction), discipline and excommunication, relation of church and civil magistrate.
- **Closing line:** Turretin locates the theological center of gravity in a confessional ecclesiology that makes conscientious, instituted withdrawal from Rome an ecclesiastical duty to preserve gospel truth, order, and discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Scholastic precision applied to ecclesiology:** Turretin brings Reformed scholastic method (definitions, loci, syllogistic argument) to the question of separation, producing tightly argued criteria for when secession is obligatory.
- **Balance of principle and polity:** Emphasizes both normative principles (Scripture, marks of the church) and concrete Presbyterian mechanisms (presbytery/consistory action, pastoral responsibility) for implementing separation.
- **Corrective to both lax ecumenism and fanatical schism:** Asserts separation is required when core gospel elements are corrupted, but also frames secession as juridically and morally orderly - not a mere emotive rupture.
- **Terminological clarity about "schism" and "separation":** Distinguishes illicit schism (prideful rupture) from warranted secession (disciplinary fidelity), redefining language common in Catholic polemic.
- **Reception and influence:** Influential in later Reformed and Presbyterian polemics defending confessional distinctiveness; used in debates over union with Rome and in internal church discipline controversies. Less influential in modern ecumenical eras but frequently cited in confessionalist writings.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a durable model for evaluating confessional boundaries, ecclesial discipline, and the interplay between office-bearing and corporate purity; valuable for teaching Reformed ecclesiology and historical polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Secession (secessio):** Deliberate withdrawal from ecclesial communion on grounds of grave doctrinal or moral corruption.
- **Schism (scisma):** Illicit division; Turretin distinguishes this from rightful secession grounded in truth and order.
- **Marks of the church:** Criteria (preaching of the Word, proper administration of sacraments, exercise of discipline) used to identify a true visible church.
- **Papal supremacy / magisterium:** Targeted Roman claim; Turretin argues its usurpation of Scripture-based authority invalidates communion.
- **Sacramental corruption:** The elevation or perversion of sacraments (e.g., transubstantiation, sacerdotalism) as a sign warranting separation.
- **Ministerial office / plurality of elders:** Defense of Reformed office structure; presbyterial oversight is central to lawful local and corporate secession.
- **Discipline / excommunication:** Ecclesiastical mechanisms for removing scandal; secession can be a communal form of discipline when Rome refuses correction.
- **Civil magistrate:** Role acknowledged in supporting religious order; magistrate may have duty to restrain public idolatry but not to usurp church discipline.
- **Visible vs invisible church:** Reformed distinction retained; secession concerned primarily with visible communion and its public marks.
- **Authority of Scripture (Sola Scriptura):** Normative touchstone for judging church identity and for legitimizing separation.
- **Communion / fellowship:** Corporate participation in sacraments and governance; termination of fellowship is the operative act of secession.
- **Confessional integrity:** Maintaining doctrinal identity as a public, covenantal duty.

How this work is used:
- As a **polemic** and historical source for defending confessional separation from Roman Catholicism.
- As an **ecclesiological resource** for presbyterian polity discussions (offices, consistories, discipline).
- As a **didactic model** in Reformed systematic theology for applying scholastic method to practical church questions.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over legitimate boundaries of Christian communion and the distinction between schism and disciplinary withdrawal.
