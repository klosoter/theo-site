### TITLE
"The Reformed View" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, essay in The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism (2003)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed/evangelical conversation about baptismal polity and sacramental theology; a corrective to rising credobaptist influence within evangelicalism and a response to intra-Reformed debates about communion and household inclusion.
 - Locates itself in the stream of classic Reformed covenant theology and the Westminster/Heidelberg confessional tradition.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defends infant baptism as the consistent outworking of covenant continuity: children of believing parents are covenant members and thus rightly receive the covenant sign (baptism) though not the covenant meal (communion) until they profess faith.
 - Seeks to reconcile sacramental promise (inclusion, sign/seal) with pastoral caution (non-automatic regeneration; guarded admission to the Lord's Supper).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological groundwork: surveys Reformed confessions and Calvinian practice that link circumcision and baptism as covenant signs.
 - Biblical-theological argument: argues for continuity between Abrahamic household inclusion and New Testament household narratives (e.g., household baptisms), treating baptism as the New Testament counterpart to circumcision.
 - Sacramental theology: develops baptism as a **sign and seal** of the covenant - real covenantal marking without implying automatic inward regeneration.
 - Ecclesial and pastoral implications:
 - Explains **fencing the table** and admission practices: baptismal inclusion does not imply immediate reception of the Lord's Supper; the Supper is for professing, examined communicants.
 - Treats the Lord's Supper presence of Christ in Reformed terms (real spiritual presence mediated by the Spirit, not corporeal).
 - Concludes with practical pastoral counsel on nurture, catechesis, discipline, and the pastoral responsibility to raise baptized children in covenant faith.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Calvin and Reformed confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg), classic covenant theologians.
 - Opponents addressed: contemporary credobaptist critiques (infant baptism as illegitimate), paedocommunion proponents, Roman Catholic/Lutheran sacramental positions.
 - Uses biblical texts on covenant households, circumcision, and sacramental practice; appeals to pastoral experience and ecclesial tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (administrations, continuity)
 - Sacramentology (baptism and Lord's Supper)
 - Ecclesiology (membership, discipline, admission)
 - Christology (presence of Christ in the Supper) and pneumatology (Spirit's role in sacramental communion)
 - Soteriology (union with Christ; non-automatic baptismal regeneration)

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson's Reformed view anchors infant baptism in covenantal promise and household inclusion while maintaining sacramental sobriety: baptism admits children to the covenant community as a sign and seal, but the Lord's Supper remains the communion of examined, professing believers with Christ present by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on the pastoral and covenantal logic: baptism as corporate, formative inclusion that obliges parents and church to nurture covenant faith.
 - Balances assurance of covenant promise with rejection of automatic sacramental regeneration - assent to both promise and responsibility.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects credobaptist reduction of baptism to private symbol by reasserting corporate, covenantal sign status.
 - Distinguishes Reformed position from Roman Catholic and Lutheran sacramentalism:
 - Rejects ex opere operato or physical corporeal presence.
 - Affirms real spiritual presence of Christ in the Supper (not mere memorialism).
 - Rejects paedocommunion: baptismal inclusion is not equivalent to communicant admission.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rearticulates classic terms (household, sign and seal, fencing the table) in contemporary pastoral language to bridge academic theology and congregational practice.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among contemporary Reformed paedobaptists as a clear, pastoral synthesis of covenant theology and sacramental practice.
 - Used in pastoral training and denominational debates to reaffirm confessional Reformed practice on baptism and communion.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for integrating doctrine and pastoral practice: useful for teaching covenant catechesis, ecclesial discipline, and sacramental theology in Reformed contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant household**
 - Concept that God's promises attach to family units; children of believers are included as covenant members.
- **Sign and seal**
 - Baptism as sign (visible mark) and seal (assurance) of God's covenant promises; not equivalent to regeneration.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology**
 - Continuity argument: circumcision = OT sign; baptism = NT counterpart for covenant inclusion.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The theological basis for sacramental application of promises to believers and their children.
- **Fencing the table**
 - Pastoral/ecclesial practice of guarding admission to the Lord's Supper to examined, professing members.
- **Admission to the Lord's Supper**
 - Controlled by profession of faith, catechesis, and church discipline - distinct from baptismal inclusion.
- **Presence of Christ (Reformed)**
 - Real, spiritual presence in the Supper effected by the Spirit; not physical/ubiquitous presence of Christ's body in elements.
- **Means of grace**
 - Sacraments as instruments by which God communicates covenant promises, wielded by the Spirit.
- **Non-regenerative baptismal theology**
 - Denial that baptism automatically effects inward regeneration; emphasizes ongoing covenant nurture.
- **Catechetical responsibility**
 - Parental and congregational duty to instruct baptized children toward credible profession.
- **Confessional grounding**
 - Reliance on Westminster/Heidelberg teachings as normative for Reformed sacramental practice.
- **Household baptism evidence**
 - Use of NT household baptism narratives as warrant for infant baptism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a confessional Reformed account of paedobaptism and sacramentology.
 - As **polemic** against credobaptist and paedocommunion positions, while also serving as an **exegetical model** for covenantal interpretation of household texts.
 - As a **pastoral and ecclesial pivot** for teaching catechesis, table discipline, and sacramental practice in Reformed churches.
