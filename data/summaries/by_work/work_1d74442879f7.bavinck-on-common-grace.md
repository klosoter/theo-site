### TITLE
**Bavinck on Common Grace - John Bolt**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - John Bolt is a contemporary Reformed systematician who treats Herman Bavinck (Dutch Reformed, late 19th-early 20th century) within the broader neo-Calvinist milieu. Bolt reads Bavinck against the backdrop of post-Calvinist debates about Kuyperian neo-Calvinism, modernism, and rising secular culture.
 - The study functions as both historical-theological retrieval and constructive appropriation for modern Reformed theology and cultural engagement.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Bolt argues that Bavinck offers a coherent, biblically grounded doctrine of **common grace** that preserves the realities of human sin and depravity while accounting for genuine cultural goods, non‑saving knowledge of God, and providential ordering without collapsing common into saving grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological exposition of Bavinck's treatment of common grace across writings and lectures.
 - Systematic unpacking of Bavinck's theology:
 - Distinguishes **common** (general) from **special** (saving) grace.
 - Locates common grace in covenantal and creation-order categories rather than as an autonomous ethic.
 - Explains three functional aspects commonly associated with Bavinck: **restraint of sin**, **civil/human flourishing**, and **providential ordering** (including natural revelation).
 - Biblical and apologetic implications:
 - Evaluates Bavinck's use of Scripture (e.g., Genesis, Romans, Noahic covenant motifs) to justify limits and scope.
 - Assesses consequences for natural theology, cultural mandate, and public theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Herman Bavinck (primary texts, Dogmatics).
 - Comparators: Abraham Kuyper (neo-Calvinist optimism), Reformed confessional tradition (Calvin, Belgic Confession), critics in Dutch Reformed circles.
 - Modern interlocutors: contemporary Reformed theologians and philosophers engaging the cultural mandate and natural theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and fall; providence; covenant theology; general revelation / natural knowledge of God; sin and total depravity; law/creation order; apologetics; ecclesiology and public life (indirectly).

- **Closing line**
 - Bolt presents Bavinck's doctrine of common grace as a pastorally orthodox and systematically balanced bridge between divine sovereignty over culture and the theological reality that only Christ's special grace effects salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Bavinck (as presented by Bolt) insists on a **covenantal grounding** for common grace: common goods flow from God's creational and covenantal faithfulness, not human merit.
 - He gives a robust account of **non‑saving knowledge of God**-true in content yet non‑soteriological in effect.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects overly optimistic readings of Kuyper by stressing the **antithesis**: cultural achievements do not imply spiritual recovery.
 - Pushes back against rationalist or pietistic reductions that either overstate natural theology or collapse common grace into sanctifying grace.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies functional categories (restraint, providence, cultural enabling) and ties them systematically to covenant and creation rather than leaving them as loose sociological claims.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed seminaries and churches as a tempering, confessional account of how Christians should engage culture and public life.
 - Serves as a corrective to both cultural separatism and naïve cultural triumphalism within neo-Calvinist circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a teachable, defensible model for pursuing cultural engagement, apologetics, and public theology while maintaining doctrinal boundaries between common and saving grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace** - God's favor operative in providence that restrains sin and enables cultural goods without granting salvation.
- **Special (saving) grace** - Redemptive grace in Christ that alone effects salvation and reconciliation.
- **Antithesis** - The fundamental biblical distinction between the kingdom of God and fallen world; limits the scope of common grace.
- **General revelation / natural knowledge of God** - True cognitive access to God via creation and conscience, insufficient for salvation.
- **Restraint of sin** - A functional aspect of common grace whereby God curbs the worst effects of sin in society.
- **Providential ordering** - God's upholding of creation that enables continuity, social order, and cultural development.
- **Covenant grounding** - The theological move to root common grace in God's creational and covenantal faithfulness rather than as an autonomous doctrine.
- **Cultural mandate** - Human calling to steward creation; common grace explains why non‑Christians can contribute to culture.
- **Civil righteousness / public morality** - Social goods and legal order made possible by common grace and necessary for flourishing.
- **Natural theology (limited)** - Legitimate, non‑saving insights about God derivable from nature and reason as per Bavinck's cautionary stance.
- **Imago Dei (social-cultural axis)** - The image of God as basis for human dignity and cultural creativity, affirmed even in the non‑regenerate.
- **Noahic covenant motif** - Sometimes invoked by Bavinck to explain the postdiluvian promise that sustains human culture and order.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for careful distinctions between types of grace in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against both cultural triumphalism and separatist pietism within Reformed public theology.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading texts that speak to common providence, general revelation, and the cultural mandate.
