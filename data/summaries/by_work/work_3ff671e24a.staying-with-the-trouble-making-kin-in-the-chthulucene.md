### TITLE
Staying With the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene - Donna J. Haraway (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2016 amid intensified debate over the "Anthropocene" (naming human-driven planetary transformation), within feminist science and technology studies (STS), new materialism, and multispecies studies. Responds to ecological crisis, neoliberal techno-fixes, and posthumanist theory.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Haraway argues that the dominant framing of the Anthropocene is misleading and politically paralyzing. Instead she proposes the **Chthulucene** as a trope for multispecies, entangled survival practices. The ethical task is to **"stay with the trouble"** by making accountable, situated kin - not attempting human-centered salvation or techno-utopian fixes.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critique of Anthropocene narratives that center human sovereignty, universal responsibility, and managerial solutions.
 - Call to refuse innocence and purity; insist on responsibility for existing entanglements and their histories.
 - Propose conceptual and practical tools: **Chthulucene**, **sympoiesis** (making-with), **making kin**, **tentacular thinking**, and **speculative fabulation** (SF).
 - Emphasize **situated knowledges** and multispecies storytelling as methods for ethical-political practice.
 - Offer concrete vignettes and "string figures" as pedagogical devices for kin-making practices.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Dialogues with Latour (ANT), Bruno Latour's actor-network concerns; Anna Tsing (mushroom studies); Lynn Margulis (symbiosis); Karen Barad and other new materialists; Isabelle Stengers (cosmopolitics); Rosi Braidotti and posthumanist feminists. Draws on feminist STS, indigenous critiques implicitly and sometimes explicitly, and multispecies ethnography.
- **Doctrines treated (theological bearings):**
 - Not systematic theology, but implications for **creation**, **sin/culpability**, **eschatology**, **covenant/kinship**, and **stewardship**.
 - Reorients doctrines from anthropocentric dominion toward **relational, embodied, material entanglement**.
- **Closing line:** Haraway reframes ethical and theological imagination: survival requires staying with the trouble through accountable kin-making across species and matter, displacing sovereign humanism with relational responsibility.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Chthulucene** as an alternative epoch - a tentacular, entangled, ongoing set of practices rather than an epoch of human mastery.
 - **Making kin**, not reproduction or species purity: kin as chosen, crafted relations across species and materialities.
 - **Sympoiesis** (making-with) replaces autopoiesis (self-making) - emphasis on collective, co-constitutive becoming.
 - **Staying with the trouble** as an ethic of sustained attention and responsibility rather than escape or denial.
 - Use of **speculative fabulation** (SF) and storytelling as theorizing methods.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects the **Anthropocene**'s tendency to flatten responsibility and to naturalize human exceptionalism.
 - Opposes techno-optimistic, managerial, market-based "solutions" (geoengineering, carbon markets).
 - Critiques both humanist universalism and nihilistic posthumanism that abdicate moral responsibility.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:** Chthulucene, sympoiesis, making kin, tentacular thinking, string figures, response-ability, companion species, speculative fabulation.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely cited in eco-criticism, environmental humanities, feminist theology, and STS. Adopted as a conceptual resource in ecological ethics and multispecies studies; contested by scholars who prefer materialist or indigenous framings for political clarity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Provocative methodological model for interdisciplinary theology; useful in pedagogy for ethics, ecological responsibility, and rethinking doctrines of creation and covenant in multispecies terms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chthulucene:** A tentacular, multispecies epoch emphasizing symbiotic entanglement and ongoing co-creation; a rhetorical alternative to "Anthropocene."
- **Anthropocene (critique):** Haraway targets its depoliticizing generality and the techno-managerial impulses it spawns.
- **Staying with the trouble:** Ethical posture of sustained, accountable engagement with ecological and social crises rather than retreat or panacea.
- **Making kin:** Active practice of forming solidarities and responsibilities across species, technologies, and places; kin is deliberately constructed.
- **Sympoiesis:** "Making-with" - collective production and co-constitution of systems; counters autonomous self-creation frameworks.
- **Response-ability:** Moral capacity to respond; combines responsibility and ability - emphasizes relational accountability.
- **Tentacular thinking / tentacularity:** Nonlinear, distributed, relational mode of thought that tracks connections, entanglements, and consequences.
- **Companion species:** Focus on species co-evolution and relational companionship (e.g., dogs, microbes) to challenge isolated human subjectivity.
- **Situated knowledges:** Epistemic humility; knowledge is partial, embodied, and situated rather than universal Objectivity.
- **Speculative fabulation (SF):** Storytelling and imaginative practice as a mode of theorizing to explore multispecies futures and moral possibilities.
- **String figures:** Pedagogical metaphors/practices for tracing interconnections and crafting kin-relations.
- **Naturecultures:** Concept (Haraway's term elsewhere) pointing to inseparability of nature and culture; used here to dissolve dualisms.
- **Composting / soil metaphors:** Practical, material images for decay, regeneration, and co-creation.
- **Boundary breakdown:** Emphasis on porous boundaries (human/animal/machine/soil) and attendant ethical implications.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecological theology and ethics to displace anthropocentrism and reframe covenantal responsibility.
 - As a **polemic** against technocratic/market solutions to ecological crisis, mobilizing multispecies accountability.
 - As a **pedagogical and exegetical model**: employing storytelling, situated knowledges, and speculative fabulation to reread scripture and tradition in multispecies, material terms.
