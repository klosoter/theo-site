### TITLE
**The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church** - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Princeton/Neo-Calvinist milieu; Vos as founder of Reformed biblical theology and professor at Princeton Seminary.
 - Written against currents of liberal theology, triumphalist ecclesiologies, and tendencies to conflate social reform with the biblical kingdom.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus taught a *kingdom of God* that is the sovereign, eschatological rule of God inaugurated in Christ and present in seed form, and a *church* which is the covenant-instrument and societal manifestation of that kingdom; the two are distinct in concept and function and must not be confused.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of Jesus' utterances concerning the kingdom: its nature (rule, reign), present and future aspects, ethical demands, and eschatological consummation.
 - Careful delineation of the concept of the church in New Testament usage: origin in the calling of Israel and Christ, institutional marks, offices, sacraments, and relation to kingdom promises.
 - Theological synthesis: how the kingdom and the church relate - dependent but not identical; the church is the visible, covenantal organ through which the kingdom is mediated but the kingdom's reality is broader (divine rule over all).
 - Pastoral and polemical application: warnings against identifying the church with the totality of the kingdom or reducing the kingdom to mere ethical/social program.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Synoptic Gospels, Johannine material as it bears on kingdom themes.
 - Secondary/reception: engagements with Catholic and Protestant ecclesiologies, contemporary liberal theologians (implicitly Harnackian tendencies), and the Reformed tradition (Calvin, later confessional writers).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Christ as King and revelation of the reign), Christology (Messianic kingship), Eschatology (already/not-yet structure), Covenant theology (church as covenant community), Ecclesiology (visible/invisible, offices, sacraments), Soteriology (kingdom as sphere of salvation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The kingdom is God's sovereign, eschatological rule realized in Christ and present in seed form; the church is the covenantal instrument and visible society through which that rule is proclaimed and administered, but it is not coterminous with the kingdom itself.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in differentiating *kingdom* (divine rule, cosmic and eschatological) from *church* (covenantal congregation and institution), resisting both sacramentalist and purely spiritualized identifications.
 - Strong insistence on the kingdom's dual temporality - real-inauguration under Christ and awaiting consummation - without collapsing into vague "realized" or purely "future" doctrines.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushback against liberal social-gospel reductionism that equates the kingdom with progressive social aims.
 - Corrects Roman Catholic and some Protestant tendencies to identify the visible institutional church as the totality of the kingdom.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Methodological clarity in using biblical-theological categories: kingdom as rule/sovereignty rather than merely "kingdom as place."
 - Emphasis on covenantal-historical unfolding: kingdom language as narrative-historical rather than merely ethical imperative.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in Reformed circles for shaping careful ecclesiology and eschatology; used as corrective in seminaries and by later biblical theologians.
 - Widely cited in discussions on inaugurated eschatology and on the proper relationship between church and society.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined exegetical-theological model for maintaining tension of "already-not yet" and for guarding ecclesiology from theological and sociopolitical conflation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven**
 - Sovereign rule of God; entails present-inaugurated and future-consummate dimensions.
- **Church (ecclesia)**
 - Covenant community and visible society instituted by Christ; instrument and sign of the kingdom.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / Already-not-yet**
 - The kingdom is both present in Christ's ministry and awaiting final consummation.
- **Rule / Reign (basileia sense)**
 - Emphasizes authority and governance rather than territoriality.
- **Visible vs. Invisible Church**
 - Visible: institutional, sacramental, and ministerial reality; Invisible: the elect reality before God.
- **Covenant**
 - Framework for understanding the church as continuation and fulfillment of God's covenant dealings.
- **Sacraments (signs & seals)**
 - Means by which the church administers and signifies participation in kingdom blessings.
- **Messianic kingship / Christ as King**
 - Christ is the center of the kingdom; his person and work ground both the present kingdom and its future consummation.
- **Judgment and eschatological consummation**
 - Kingdom language always implies final divine reckoning and consummation.
- **Ethics of the kingdom**
 - Kingdom life entails distinctive moral demand but is not reducible to social reform.
- **Kingdom vs. Society/State**
 - Vos resists equating the kingdom with any particular social order or political structure.
- **Covenantal instrumentality**
 - Church as authorized organ for preaching, sacraments, and discipline within kingdom administration.
- **Biblical-theological method**
 - Historical-teleological reading of Scripture that traces the unfolding of kingdom themes.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing kingdom and church in ecclesiology and eschatology.
 - As a **polemic** against social-gospel and triumphalist ecclesiologies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Jesus' kingdom sayings within covenantal-history.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching on sacraments, offices, and the church's relation to the world.
