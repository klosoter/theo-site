### TITLE
Various Articles and Lectures on Christology and Pneumatology - Sinclair B. Ferguson
(Selected reflections on the Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th - early 21st century Reformed evangelical context. Ferguson writes as a pastor-theologian engaging Scripture, classical Reformed sources (Calvin, the Puritans), and contemporary evangelical pneumatology.
 - Audience: seminary students, pastors, informed laity; often delivered as lectures or shorter articles rather than monographs.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is not ancillary to Christ's work but integral: the Spirit anoints, empowers, testifies to, and finally raises the incarnate Son. Understanding Christology without a pneumatological axis impoverishes both the person and work of Christ and the believer's union with him.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Textual exegesis: key texts (Luke 1-4; Matthew 3; John 14-16; Romans 8; Acts 2) show the Spirit at every decisive stage of the Son's redemptive activity.
 - Conception/Incarnation: Spirit's overshadowing and creative agency.
 - Public ministry: Spirit's anointing at baptism as commissioning and empowerment.
 - Ministry and miracles: Spirit as enabling prophetic, teaching, and messianic functions.
 - Death and resurrection: Spirit as the agent of vindication and the efficient cause of resurrection (e.g., Romans 8:11).
 - Systematic integration: Trinitarian perichoresis - Father, Son, Spirit act inseparably in redemption; the Spirit is the personal, active presence that connects Christ's redemptive accomplishment to believers.
 - Pastoral-theological implications: assurance of salvation, union with Christ (the Spirit unites us to the risen Lord), and the life of holiness as Spirit-empowered.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Scripture, classical Reformed interpreters (John Calvin), Puritan pastoral theology.
 - Secondary interlocutors: contemporary evangelical pneumatology and occasional engagement with critiques that either downplay the Spirit (overly Christocentric accounts) or separate pneumatology into merely charismatic categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, Christology, Pneumatology, Incarnation, Resurrection, Union with Christ, Atonement, Sanctification, Ecclesiology (in relation to Spirit-wrought community).

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson locates the theological center of gravity in a Trinitarian economy where the Spirit is the active link between the incarnate, suffering Son and the believer's present assurance and sanctification - the Spirit vindicates, unites, and renews in the name of the risen Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Persistent insistence that the Spirit is the agent of resurrection and vindication, not merely a subsequent bestowal on the church.
 - Clear pastoral articulation: pneumatology as the ground of assurance and practical holiness, not abstraction.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies in some Christologies that place Christ's victory entirely in the Son's action apart from the Spirit; counters pneumatological accounts that detach the Spirit from the incarnate Son's specific work.
 - Balances "high" Christology (divine Son) with robust pneumatology, guarding the unity of Trinitarian action.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates traditional terms (anointing, overshadowing, witness) with functional clarity: "anointing" as commissioning + embodying messianic identity; "overshadowing" as Spirit's creative presence in incarnation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and evangelical circles as a concise, pastorally-minded pneumatology that integrates with Christology.
 - Influential in sermons, pastoral teaching, and curriculum that aims to recover the Spirit's role in Christ's own life and victory.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for teaching the inseparability of the Spirit's work from Christ's work; valuable for preacher-theologians and those integrating systematic theology with pastoral ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anointing**
 - The Spirit's conferring of messianic authority at Christ's baptism; functional Christology emphasizing empowerment and commissioning.

- **Overshadowing**
 - Term used for Spirit's role in the virginal conception - creative, personal agency in the incarnation.

- **Spirit as agent of resurrection**
 - The Spirit is the efficient cause by which the Father raises the Son (Romans 8 motif).

- **Witness/Testimony of the Spirit**
 - Spirit both testifies to Jesus' identity and bears witness in believers to the risen Lord (assurance).

- **Union with Christ**
 - The Spirit is the bond-maker: believers are united to the risen Christ by indwelling activity.

- **Vindication**
 - Resurrection as divine vindication performed by the Spirit, confirming Sonship and messianic fulfillment.

- **Indwelling / New-creation power**
 - The Spirit is the life-giving power that transfers Christ's resurrection life into believers (sanctification and eschatological hope).

- **Perichoresis / Trinitarian economy**
 - Framework used to insist on inseparable operations of Father, Son, and Spirit in redemption.

- **Functional Christology**
 - Emphasis on what the Son does (anointed, suffers, is raised) in union with the Spirit, rather than isolating metaphysical titles.

- **Assurance / Applied soteriology**
 - How the Spirit's work in raising Christ grounds the believer's assurance and adoption.

- **Sacramental implications**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper understood in light of Spirit's role in linking the believer to the risen Christ.

- **Witness in Scripture**
 - Priority given to Luke, John, Romans as primary exegetical loci for the Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for the Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection in systematic outlines.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching Luke/John/Romans passages that connect Spirit and Son.
- As a **polemic** against accounts that marginalize the Spirit or separate pneumatology from Christology.
- As a **pedagogical resource** in seminary courses integrating Christology, pneumatology, and pastoral theology.
