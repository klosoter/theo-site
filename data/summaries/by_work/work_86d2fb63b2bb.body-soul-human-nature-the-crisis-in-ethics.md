### TITLE
Body & Soul: Human Nature & the Crisis in Ethics - J. P. Moreland & Scott B. Rae

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-analytic response to late 20th-early 21st century challenges: rise of scientistic naturalism, moral relativism, and philosophical physicalism.
 - Interdisciplinary: philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, Christian ethics; targeted at seminary students, pastors, and philosophically informed lay readers.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human flourishing and coherent ethics require a metaphysically robust account of human nature: persons are embodied souls (personal substances), not reducible to physical processes. Without such an account, moral discourse collapses into subjectivism or reductionist error.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Critique of reductionist accounts of human nature
 - Challenges eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, and certain forms of emergentism.
 - Uses philosophical arguments (intentionality, qualia, first-person authority, personal identity) and appeals to moral praxis.
 - Part 2: Positive case for a dual-aspect/substance view of personhood
 - Defends a version of substance dualism or nonreductive personalism that preserves causal efficacy and moral responsibility.
 - Argues for moral ontology grounded in the reality of persons and ultimately in a theistic moral framework.
 - Part 3: Ethical implications
 - Shows how anthropology informs normative ethics: duties, rights, dignity, responsibility, and public policy.
 - Critiques prominent secular ethical theories (e.g., utilitarianism, emotivism) for failing to honor personhood.

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Philosophical: Descartes (critique), Aristotle and Aquinas (resources), contemporary materialists (Dennett, Churchland), philosophers of mind (Jaegwon Kim), moral philosophers (Kant, Bentham, Ross).
 - Theological: appeals to classical Christian doctrines (imago Dei, resurrection) rather than detailed theological-systematic dialogue with any single modern theologian.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christian anthropology (body-soul relation, personhood)
 - Imago Dei and human dignity
 - Moral ontology and moral realism
 - Indirectly: sin, responsibility, and eschatological hope (resurrection as coherent with personal identity)

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - A coherent Christian ethics requires a nonreductionist anthropology: only a robust conception of embodied persons secures objective moral claims, accountability, and human dignity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight linkage between metaphysics of personhood and normative ethics: metaphysical commitments are shown to have direct ethical consequences.
 - Combines analytic philosophy of mind with evangelical moral theology in a sustained way uncommon in many popular ethics texts.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects both crude Cartesianism (as historically caricatured) and reductionist physicalism; argues for a responsible, scientifically informed dualism or nonreductive personalism.
 - Contrasts with secular moral theories that ground value in utility, sentiment, or evolutionary function-argues these cannot sustain moral obligation.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reasserts and refines "embodied soul" language for contemporary debates, pressing for clarity about causal interaction and moral agency.
 - Reframes imago Dei as metaphysically tied to personhood rather than merely functional or relational descriptors.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded in evangelical academic and pastoral circles as a clear, robust defense of Christian anthropology.
 - Criticized by philosophical physicalists and some theological revisionists for committing to metaphysical dualism and for perceived insufficient engagement with neuroscientific data.
 - Used widely in seminary courses on Christian ethics and anthropology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a pedagogical bridge between philosophy of mind and applied ethics; durable resource for defending moral realism and human dignity in pluralist contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Embodied soul**
 - The person is both a soul (substantial subject) and bodily creature; neither element is ontologically disposable.

- **Substance dualism / personalism**
 - Defense of persons as substances that are not reducible to brain states; central to accountability and persistence through change.

- **Nonreductive physicalism (critiqued)**
 - The position Moreland & Rae critique: mental properties supervene on physical ones but are not reducible-argued to face explanatory gaps.

- **Physicalism / eliminative materialism (targets)**
 - Positions that reduce mind to brain processes or eliminate folk-psychological terms-argued to undermine moral and intentional language.

- **Imago Dei**
 - Ground of dignity and moral status; here tied to metaphysical personhood rather than merely social roles or capacities.

- **Moral realism**
 - Objective moral facts exist; defended as intelligible only on a metaphysically personalist and theistic background.

- **Intentionality & qualia**
 - Philosophical markers of irreducible mental states used to argue against reductionism.

- **Moral ontology**
 - The metaphysical foundation for moral properties; integrated with anthropology and theism in the book.

- **Free will & responsibility**
 - Secured by personhood: genuine agency presupposes a nonreductive self capable of choices.

- **Eschatological continuity (resurrection)**
 - Used to show personal persistence need not be purely biological; theological resource for identity across death.

- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: standard evangelical reference for a theologically informed, philosophically rigorous account of human nature.
 - Polemic: frequently cited against naturalistic ethics, moral relativism, and reductive neuroscience accounts of personhood.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in courses to connect metaphysics (mind/body) with normative ethics and pastoral implications.
