### TITLE
Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of Theodicy (with commentary from Claude Welch)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology; reaction against speculative metaphysics (Hegelian and classical theism), continuity with Kantian critique of metaphysics and Schleiermacher's religiosity; Ritschl flourished in the 1860s-1880s and wrote within a liberal, historical-critical milieu.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ritschl reframes theodicy: he rejects speculative attempts to reconcile God's absolute attributes with the reality of evil and instead locates divine justice within the moral-historical work of God in Christ and the eschatological vindication of the moral order.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Knowledge of God is a **value-judgment** (Werturteil) grounded in religious experience and the historical revelation of Jesus, not in metaphysical proofs.
 - Classical theodical speculation is illegitimate because it treats God as an object of speculative metaphysics; such accounts confuse theological with philosophical categories.
 - Theodicy must be understood ethically and soteriologically:
 - God's justice arises in God's purposive relation to human moral life, especially in redemption and justification by Christ.
 - Evil is principally a moral/historical phenomenon linked to human freedom and failure; God acts within history to realize the moral kingdom.
 - Ultimate vindication of divine justice is eschatological: God will rectify moral disorder in the consummation of the kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reaction to Hegelian systematic metaphysics, Kant's limits to speculative reason, Schleiermacher's focus on religious feeling; interlocutors include contemporary liberal theologians and later critics (notably Karl Barth).
 - Claude Welch functions as a historical interpreter who highlights Ritschl's shift from metaphysical to ethical categories in treating theodicy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (historical/Christocentric), Christology (Jesus as the decisive revelation of God's moral purpose), soteriology (justification and reconciliation as central to divine justice), eschatology (vindication), and epistemology of religion (value-judgment theory).
- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl's theological center of gravity: divine justice is not a metaphysical attribute to be reconciled with evil by abstract proof but a moral-historical reality disclosed in Christ and consummated in the eschatological realization of the kingdom of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Treats theodicy as a practical, ethical question rooted in redemptive history rather than a speculative philosophical problem.
 - Frames religious knowledge as a moral value-judgment anchored in Christ and the community.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects classical theodicies that attempt to justify God's absolute attributes via metaphysical explanation.
 - Moves beyond Schleiermacher's emphasis on religious feeling by insisting on moral-historical content (the fact of Christ's redemptive work) as the warrant for belief in divine justice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of Werturteil (value-judgment) language to reorient theological epistemology.
 - Emphasis on the "kingdom of God" as the locus where divine justice is enacted and verified.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in continental liberal theology and in the late 19th-century Protestant academy.
 - Criticized by neo-orthodox thinkers (e.g., Barth) for subordinating transcendence to moral immanence and for methodological reductionism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a paradigmatic alternative to speculative theodicy: useful for pastoral theology, ethical readings of suffering, and historical-critical approaches to divine justice.
 - Provokes continued debate about the proper balance between God's transcendence and God's moral activity in history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)** - religious judgments are moral-evaluative responses grounded in historical revelation, not metaphysical cognition.
- **Divine justice (Gerechtigkeit Gottes)** - understood primarily as God's moral and redemptive action in history, culminating eschatologically.
- **Theodicy (reframed)** - not a metaphysical reconciliation but the theological assessment of God's moral purpose in the face of evil.
- **Kingdom of God** - the concrete historical-eschatological sphere where divine justice is realized and tested.
- **Revelation (historical/Christocentric)** - Jesus and the church's redemptive action are the decisive revelations that justify belief in God's justice.
- **Justification / Reconciliation** - soteriological centerpieces for demonstrating God's justice, replacing abstract theodical proof.
- **Eschatological vindication** - final rectification of moral disorder; the guarantee of divine justice's ultimate triumph.
- **Human freedom / moral failure** - primary locus of explanation for the presence of evil within Ritschl's ethical framework.
- **Critique of metaphysics** - insistence that theological claims must avoid speculative metaphysical categories when addressing practical religious questions.
- **Practical reason / ethics** - theological method that privileges moral reasoning and communal praxis over speculative demonstration.
- **Church / community** - locus of the knowledge of God and of the evidence for divine justice through shared moral life.
- **Transcendence vs. immanence** - Ritschl stresses immanent, historical action of God; critics say this risks minimizing transcendence.
- **Historical theology** - Ritschl's method roots doctrine in historical acts rather than abstract attributes.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological reorientation from metaphysical theodicy to ethical-soteriological accounts of divine justice.
 - As a **polemic** against classical theodical systems and philosophical theism.
 - As an **exegetical/practical model** for pastoral theologies addressing suffering via community, proclamation, and eschatological hope.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in histories of modern theology showing the shift to value-centered, historical models of doctrine (frequently invoked by commentators such as Claude Welch).
