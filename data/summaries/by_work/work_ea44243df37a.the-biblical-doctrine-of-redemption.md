### TITLE
**The Biblical Doctrine of Redemption - B. B. Warfield**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton Seminary context; Warfield as leading conservative Reformed theologian reacting to liberal theology, Ritschlian reductions, and sentimental anti‑penal readings of Christ's work.
 - Work functions as systematic and exegetical defense of classical Protestant soteriology within the confessional Reformed tradition.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Redemption is a forensic, objective accomplishment by Christ that was both necessary and efficacious: it meets divine justice and secures salvation for those given to Christ by the Father.
 - Core controversies addressed: the nature and necessity of the atonement; the imputation of Adam's sin and Christ's righteousness; the extent of the atonement.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes the biblical facts concerning human sinfulness (original sin) and the legal demand those facts place on God's righteousness.
 - Demonstrates that only a vicarious, penal, and substitutionary satisfaction by Christ can meet those demands.
 - Shows how this satisfaction is both sufficient (in merit) and efficacious (in application) through union with Christ and the covenantal/decretal order.
 - Argues for the particularity/definiteness of the atonement: Christ's obedience and suffering are directed to redeeming the elect.
 - Concludes by tracing the application of redemption through justification, adoption, sanctification, and final glorification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture (Pauline corpus, Hebrews, Psalms), Augustine and Calvin for historical precedents, and contemporaries who defend moral‑influence or governmental theories.
 - Polemic against Pelagianism, Socinianism, liberal reductions (e.g., Ritschlianism), and modern sentimentalism about Christ's death.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin and imputation; Christology (vicarious humanity and obedience); atonement (penal substitution, satisfaction, propitiation); covenant of grace; justification; sanctification; union with Christ; extent and application of redemption.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers redemption on Christ's vicarious, penal satisfaction understood forensicly and covenantally: redemption is what the incarnate, obedient, suffering Christ accomplished for his elect, securing both divine justice and sinners' reconciliation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Unwavering insistence on **penal substitution** as the center of biblical atonement doctrine.
 - Careful linking of **federal headship** (Adam/Christ) with forensic imputation: original sin (guilt and corruption) and Christ's righteousness are transferred by representation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Systematic rejection of the **moral influence** and **governmental** theories as inadequate explanations of biblical penal language and the demands of divine justice.
 - Pushback against theological trends that minimize objective satisfaction in favor of subjective moral change or merely exemplary functions of Christ's death.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Clarifies and defends **double imputation** (our sin to Christ; his righteousness to believers) with forensic precision.
 - Emphasizes **necessity** (not metaphysical compulsion but moral-legal necessity) of atonement given the character of God and the fact of sin.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; became a staple reference for those defending classical penal substitution and particular redemption.
 - Criticized by liberal theologians and some contemporary evangelicals who favor broader atonement models or non‑forensic accounts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous exegetical-theological synthesis; invaluable for teaching doctrines of imputation, penal substitution, and the covenantal mechanics of redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemption**
 - The liberation and legal purchase of sinners accomplished by Christ's obedient suffering; both accomplished (objective) and applied (subjective).

- **Atonement**
 - The making‑at‑one of God and sinners effected by Christ's satisfaction of divine justice; central act explaining penal, propitiatory, and reconciling language.

- **Penal substitution**
 - Christ receives the punishment due to sinners as their substitute; Warfield holds this as the decisive scriptural motif.

- **Substitution**
 - Legal and relational exchange: Christ stands in the place of sinners, bearing their guilt and penalty.

- **Imputation**
 - Transfer of moral status:
 - Original Sin and Imputation: Warfield affirms **imputed guilt** (as well as inherited corruption) from Adam to his posterity under federal headship.
 - Imputation of Christ's righteousness: Christ's obedience and merit are imputed to believers in justification.

- **Original Sin**
 - Inherited corruption of nature plus forensic guilt imputed via Adam's representative headship; not mere tendency but covenantal liability.

- **Federal headship**
 - The representative principle whereby one person's act (Adam or Christ) legally binds many; the ground for both original guilt and particular redemption.

- **Necessity of the atonement**
 - A moral‑legal necessity arising from divine justice confronting human sin; not contingent pragmatism but intrinsic to God's righteousness.

- **Extent of the atonement (Definite/Particular Redemption)**
 - Christ's redeeming work is intended and effectual for the elect; sufficient in merit for all but efficient only for those given to Christ.

- **Satisfaction / Propitiation / Expiation**
 - Distinctions Warfield retains: satisfaction (making amends), propitiation (turning away wrath), expiation (removal of guilt); all converging in Christ's work.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The instrumental-causal nexus by which Christ's finished work is applied to believers; the ground of imputation and sanctification.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration based on Christ's imputed righteousness; central legal effect of redemption.

- **Active and passive obedience**
 - Christ's obedience in life (active) and suffering/death (passive) both necessary for the fullness of redemption.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a **definition source** for penal substitution, imputation, and federal theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against moral‑influence, governmental, and liberal atonement theories.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline soteriology and for teaching the forensic mechanics of justification and the extent of redemption.
