### TITLE
**Jesus and the Spirit** - James D. G. Dunn 
A study of the religious and charismatic experience of Jesus and the first Christians as reflected in the New Testament (mid-1970s, in the wake of the Charismatic Renewal and post-Bultmann NT scholarship).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - 1970s British NT scholarship, post-Bultmann existentialism and in dialogue with Heilsgeschichte approaches. 
 - Ecumenical context of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements; debates on subsequence and cessationism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The Spirit is the eschatological gift that both empowered Jesus ministry and mediates the risen Christ to the church; Spirit-baptism belongs to conversion-initiation, while continuing charisms mark the churchs life.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - **Jesus and the Spirit:** Jesus as Spirit-anointed prophet-exorcist; Abba prayer and vocation; exorcisms and healings as signs of the kingdom; the Spirits role in Jesus death and vindication. 
 - **Resurrection, exaltation, and Pentecost:** The exalted Christ pours out the Spirit; the Spirit is the mode of Christs continuing presence; resurrection life and new creation begin in the Spirit. 
 - **Conversion-initiation and Spirit-baptism:** Integrates faith, repentance, water baptism, and reception of the Spirit as one initiatory complex; rejects a normative second-blessing subsequence. 
 - **Charismata and communal discernment:** Prophecy, tongues, healing, discerning spirits; order and edification; continuation expected, not confined to apostolic age. 
 - **Pauline and Lukan pneumatologies:** Converging emphases on the eschatological Spirit; Pauls in Christ is Spirit-union; Luke narrates salvation-history with Pentecost as epochal. 
 - **Revelation and illumination:** The Spirit as agent of revelatory speech and ongoing illumination of Scripture in the church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** 
 - Engages Bultmann, Jeremias, Schweizer, Cullmann, Barrett; dialogues with Pentecostal-Charismatic interpreters and sacramental traditions. 
 - Canonical sources across Synoptics, John, Acts, Paul; Second Temple Jewish background.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Pneumatology:** Spirit-baptism, gifts, indwelling. 
 - **Christology:** Jesus anointed by the Spirit; Spirit of Christ. 
 - **Soteriology:** Regeneration, union with Christ, sanctification. 
 - **Eschatology:** Firstfruits, down payment, new creation. 
 - **Ecclesiology:** Charismatic community, discernment. 
 - **Bibliology:** Revelation and illumination by the Spirit.
- **Closing line:** The Spirits eschatological gift is the concrete mode of Christs presence, creating a community whose life, knowledge, and mission are charismatic from conversion onward.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - **Conversion-initiation** as a single complex including Spirit-baptism. 
 - Jesus as a **charismatic** figure whose ministry is paradigmatically Spirit-driven. 
 - Spirit as the **mode of presence** of the exalted Christ, grounding union and mission. 
 - Charisms as **ordinary** features of church life ordered toward edification.
- **Corrections or contrasts:** 
 - Against **subsequence** as a universal norm; Spirit-baptism, biblically, accompanies becoming Christian. 
 - Against **cessationism**; NT expects ongoing gifts under discernment. 
 - Nuances both **sacramentalism** severed from experience and **enthusiasm** severed from corporate order. 
 - Pushes beyond **Bultmannian demythologizing** by taking charismatic phenomena historically and theologically seriously.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Conversion-initiation; eschatological Spirit; Spirit as bond of union; differentiating initial gift from repeated fillings. 
 - Clarifies tongues as glossolalia in Corinth and wrestles with Acts narrative theology.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited in evangelical, Reformed, and ecumenical discussions of Spirit-baptism and gifts. 
 - A go-to exegetical control in teaching on Acts, Paul, and the Charismatic Renewal; critiqued by classical Pentecostals for downplaying subsequence.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Integrates exegesis, history of early Christian experience, and constructive theology; a stable reference for pneumatology, union with Christ, and redemptive-historical eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological Spirit:** The promised end-time gift now inaugurated; marks the new age and powers of the age to come.
- **Conversion-initiation:** Dunns composite of repentance, faith, baptism, and receiving the Spirit; frames Spirit-baptism as initial, not secondary.
- **Baptism in the Holy Spirit:** The initiatory bestowal of the Spirit that makes one Christian; distinguished from later fillings or empowerments.
- **Charismata:** Gifts for edification, including prophecy, tongues, healing, discernment; expected and regulated, not exceptional.
- **Glossolalia:** Tongues as Spirit-inspired speech; intelligibility sought via interpretation; contrasted with proclamation in known languages.
- **Prophecy:** Revelatory speech for upbuilding; communal discernment guards truth and order.
- **Spirit of Christ:** The Spirits personal relation to the exalted Jesus; the mode of his presence to and in believers.
- **Union with Christ:** Believers are in Christ by the Spirit; ethical transformation and ecclesial incorporation flow from this bond.
- **Indwelling and regeneration:** New life imparted and sustained by the Spirit; believers as temples; life in the Spirit versus flesh.
- **Firstfruits and down payment:** Spirit as arrabon of the resurrection and new creation; present assurance, future fulfillment.
- **Anointing of Jesus:** Spirit at Jesus baptism commissioning his ministry; miracles and exorcisms as Spirit-signs of the kingdom.
- **Revelation and illumination:** The Spirit who revealed Christ now illumines Scripture to the church; anchors theological understanding.
- **Heilsgeschichte narrative:** Lukes salvation-history with Pentecost as epochal turning in redemptive history.
- **Discernment of spirits:** Corporate testing of charismatic phenomena to preserve gospel truth and order.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for Spirit-baptism and conversion-initiation in pneumatology. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for Acts and Paul on gifts, indwelling, and union with Christ. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for eschatology and new creation via the Spirits firstfruits. 
 - As a **polemic and pastoral guide** against both subsequence-as-norm and cessationism, for ordered charismatic practice.
