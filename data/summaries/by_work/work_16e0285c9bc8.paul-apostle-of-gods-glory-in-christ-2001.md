### TITLE
**Paul, Apostle of God's Glory in Christ** (Thomas R. Schreiner, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2001 amid continuing debate over the New Perspective on Paul (Sanders, Dunn, Wright). Schreiner writes from an evangelical-Reformed standpoint, aiming to synthesize Pauline exegesis and systematic theology for seminaries and pastors.
 - Engages contemporary Pauline scholarship while defending classical Protestant formulations of justification, union with Christ, and the continuity of covenant promises to Israel.

- **Central thesis**
 - The controlling theme of Paul's theology is **God's glory revealed in Christ**; all major Pauline doctrines (justification, election, union with Christ, eschatology, mission) serve the telos of God glorifying himself in Christ and displaying his righteousness and mercy.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Lays out exegetical-theological readings of key Pauline loci to show coherence under the motif of divine glory.
 - Christology: Christ as the definitive revelation of God's glory; the cross and resurrection display divine righteousness and wisdom.
 - Justification and righteousness: forensic declaration rooted in Christ's work; justification displays God's glory by vindicating his righteousness in salvation.
 - Union with Christ: believers' status and sanctification flow from union, which is central to experiencing and manifesting God's glory.
 - Israel and mission: Gentile inclusion and Israel's future are both ordered to God's faithfulness and ultimate glorification.
 - Uses Romans (esp. chs. 9-11) as a focal test-case: **Romans 11 teaches a future, eschatological restoration of Israel**; God's gifts and calling are irrevocable; Gentile ingrafting does not annul Israel's covenant promises.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Paul as primary source; dialogues with modern interpreters - notably E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright - and with Reformed tradition (Calvin, Reformation theology).
 - Uses careful exegesis of key Pauline texts to counter aspects of the New Perspective.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification), Christology, covenant theology, election and predestination, eschatology (including Israel's future), revelation (glory), ecclesiology (Jew-Gentile relations in the church).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Paul's theology coheres around the single aim of **manifesting God's glory in Christ**, with justification, election, and the future of Israel serving that divine purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates **glory** as the organizing theological category for Paul; not merely a biblical motif but the integrative principle linking Christology and soteriology.
 - Readily integrates forensic justification with existential/relational themes through the rubric of union with Christ - both display God's glory.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against the New Perspective's reduction of justification to covenantal status - insists on a forensic, substitutionary element that vindicates divine righteousness.
 - Contrasts replacement or supersessionist reductions by affirming a future, corporate restoration of Israel (Romans 11) consistent with God's irrevocable promises.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Treats "glory" as a theological lens rather than merely an ethical/eschatological outcome: glory explains why God acts in election, redemption, and eschatological mercy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed seminaries as a synthetic introduction to Pauline theology.
 - Cited in polemics against the New Perspective; also respected for exegetical rigor even among critics.
 - Influential in shaping contemporary conservative readings of Romans 9-11 and Jewish-Gentile relations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful exegesis tied to systematic concerns; provides a teachable framework linking doctrines around a single theological telos (God's glory).
 - Valuable for courses in Pauline theology, soteriology, and contemporary debates about Israel and covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God's glory**
 - Central telos for divine action; the motif that unifies Paul's Christology, soteriology, and eschatology.

- **Righteousness of God**
 - Divine attribute displayed and vindicated in Christ; grounds justification and divine faithfulness.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration by God through Christ's atonement; not merely covenant membership but legal acquittal that displays God's righteousness.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological and relational bond that grounds believers' new status, sanctification, and participation in Christ's glory.

- **Gospel**
 - The proclamation of Christ's person and work that reveals God's glory and effects justification and reconciliation.

- **Election / predestination**
 - Divine choice tied to God's purpose to glorify himself; treated within covenantal-historical contours rather than abstract voluntarism.

- **Israel / Romans 11 (Israel's future)**
 - Schreiner reads Romans 11 as teaching a future, corporate turning of Israel: God's gifts and calling are irrevocable; a remnant by grace points toward ultimate restoration.

- **Remnant**
 - Theologically linked to God's sovereign mercy; the remnant underscores continuity with covenant promises.

- **Ingrafting (Gentile inclusion)**
 - Emphasized as a sign of God's sovereign plan that does not nullify Israel's role or promises.

- **Eschatology**
 - Oriented to the consummation of God's glory in Christ; includes both church and Israel in the final display of God's purposes.

- **Covenant theology**
 - Employed to show continuity of promises to Israel and the church; supports Schreiner's reading of Romans 11.

- **New Perspective critique**
 - Schreiner's exegetical defense of forensic justification and Israel's future functions as a corrective and polemic.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for reading Paul through the category of divine glory and for clarifying the forensic character of justification.
- As a **polemic** and exegetical model against aspects of the New Perspective on Paul, especially on justification and the status of Israel.
- As an **exegetical model** for Romans 9-11 on Israel's future and for integrating Pauline texts into systematic theology.
