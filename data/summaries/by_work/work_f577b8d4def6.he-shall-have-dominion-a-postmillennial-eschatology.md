### TITLE
**He Shall Have Dominion: A Postmillennial Eschatology** - Kenneth L. Gentry Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed/post-Reformation milieu reacting to the dominance of dispensational premillennialism in American evangelicalism.
 - Positioned within a revival of classical covenant theology and renewed interest in historicist readings of Revelation.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible teaches a *postmillennial* eschatology: Christ's rule will progressively extend through the church until a long era of Christian prosperity and dominion precedes His bodily return; the millennium is not a future isolated 1,000-year interruption but a God-wrought Christian ascendancy within history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: covenantal-historical hermeneutic combined with canonical and exegetical attention to key texts (e.g., Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew 13, Romans 8, Revelation 20).
 - Major moves:
 - Establish covenant continuity: promises to Abraham and David find progressive fulfillment in the church and Christian commonwealth.
 - Reinterpret Revelation 20 historically: the "binding of Satan" and the "thousand years" are best read as symbolic of the church age and its advance, not a future earthly reign following Christ's return.
 - Articulate the relationship of kingdom "already/not yet": present spiritual/institutional victory with eventual universal consummation at the Second Coming.
 - Apply the dominion/creation mandate: Christianization of culture and institutions is the biblical expectation and telos of mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Puritan and post-Reformation covenantal writers, patristic and Reformation background, and contemporary polemics with dispensational premillennialists and skeptical amillennialists.
 - Engages dispensationalists (popular eschatology of LaHaye/Lindsey-style), and debates with amillennial frameworks that deny progressive dominion.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology, covenant theology (continuity), kingdom of God, Christology (kingship and lordship of Christ), hermeneutics, ecclesiology, some implications for ethics and cultural mandate.
- **Closing line**
 - A systematic, covenantal defense of the conviction that Christ's sovereign reign progressively transforms history and culture prior to His final parousia.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust linking of the creation/dominion mandate to eschatological hope: cultural transformation is integral to biblical consummation, not optional extra.
 - Historicist reading of apocalyptic literature as church-history oriented rather than strictly futurist or purely symbolic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects premillennial dispensational separation of Israel and Church by arguing for continuities of promise (Abrahamic/Davidic) fulfilled in the church and Christian polity.
 - Contrasts with amillennial pessimism by affirming a positive, progressive expectation for societal Christianization.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the term **"dominion"** in tandem with covenant promises - using social-political discourse within a biblical-theological framework rather than purely spiritualized notions of victory.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a go-to systematic defense for contemporary postmillennialists within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; influential among those sympathetic to the social implications of covenant theology.
 - Provoked sustained critique from dispensationalists and cautious engagement from amillennialists; helped re-legitimate postmillennialism within scholarly and pastoral conversations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, exegetically grounded program for thinking eschatology as motivation for mission and cultural engagement; valuable classroom resource for re-evaluating common assumptions about millennium, kingdom, and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Postmillennialism** - Eschatological position holding that Christ's return follows a long era of Christian predominance in history.
- **Dominion mandate (creation mandate)** - Genesis command to exercise stewardship and rule; for Gentry, a normative guide to cultural transformation prior to consummation.
- **Covenant continuity** - The theological claim that God's promises to Israel find progressive fulfillment in the church through covenantal unity.
- **Historicist interpretation** - Reading Revelation and apocalyptic prophecy as unfolding through church history rather than wholly future or purely allegorical.
- **Kingdom "already/not yet"** - The tension between present inaugurated rule of Christ and yet-to-be consummated universal reign.
- **Thousand years (Revelation 20)** - Interpreted symbolically/historically as the church age or era of restrained Satan, not a literal future political reign after the parousia.
- **Abrahamic/Davidic promises** - Promises of seed, land, and eternal kingship; for Gentry these are progressively realized in the church's spiritual and social authority.
- **Progressive fulfillment** - The idea that biblical promises are realized in stages across salvation-history culminating in final consummation.
- **Apocalyptic historicity** - Use of apocalyptic texts as historically referential to the church's advance rather than dislocated futurist predictions.
- **Cultural mandate theology** - The integration of eschatology with social ethics and political concern.
- **Polemic against dispensationalism** - Frequent critique of premillennialism's hermeneutic separation of Israel/Church and pessimistic cultural outlook.
- **Eschatological optimism** - The conviction that Christian advance produces measurable societal transformation before Christ returns.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and systematic statement for contemporary postmillennialism within covenantal frameworks.
- As a **polemic** and apologetic resource against dispensational premillennialism and for reclaiming historicist/Reformed eschatologies.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Revelation 20 and kingdom texts through covenantal-historical lenses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking eschatology to mission, ethics, and public theology in Reformed contexts.
