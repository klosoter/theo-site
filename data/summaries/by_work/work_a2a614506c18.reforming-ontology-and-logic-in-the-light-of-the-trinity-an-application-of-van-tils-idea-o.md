### TITLE
**Reforming Ontology and Logic in the Light of the Trinity: An Application of Van Til's Idea of Analogy** - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated in late 20th-century Reformed theology interacting with analytic philosophy, post-Barthian debates, and developments in presuppositional apologetics (Van Til). Published in Westminster Theological Journal as part of a program to bring trinitarian commitment to bear on metaphysics and epistemology.
- **Central thesis**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity requires a reformed ontology and a reformed logic of predication: theological language must be **analogical** in a way that preserves both divine unity and genuine distinction of persons. Poythress draws on Van Til's notion of analogy to supply the epistemic and semantic grounding for that reform.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of prevailing ontologies:
 - Rejects both strict **univocity** (reifying creaturely categories onto God) and crude **equivocity** (making divine language meaningless).
 - Proposal of an analogical logic:
 - Adapts Van Til's insight that speaking about God presupposes revelation; formulates a logic where predicates are true analogically between God and creatures and between divine persons.
 - Application to classical trinitarian loci:
 - Deploys analogical predication to clarify **eternal generation** and **spiration**, to defend personal distinctions without dividing the divine essence.
 - Polemical engagements and corrective moves:
 - Engages Barth and Rahner on the rules linking economic and immanent Trinity; critiques certain interpretations of Van Til's "one-person language" to prevent collapsing persons into a single conceptual center.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: **Cornelius Van Til**, Karl Barth, Karl Rahner; historic sources include Augustine, Aquinas, and key Reformation theologians; engages analytic philosophers of language and metaphysicians on predication.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (central), revelation, ontology, logic of predication, divine attributes, Christology (implications for person and work), doctrine of God's simplicity and relations.
- **Closing line**
 - Poythress's thesis: to think rightly about God we must let the triune God reshape our categories-ontology and logic must be analogically disciplined by revelation so that both divine unity and personal distinction stand secure.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves Van Til's idea of analogy beyond apologetics into systematic metaphysics: analogy becomes a methodological and ontological principle, not merely epistemic caution.
 - Treats **logic** (the rules of predication) as malleable under theological constraint rather than neutral-a controversial methodological claim.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - To **Rahner**: resists simplistic identifications of economic and immanent Trinity (Rahner's Rule) that risk flattening personhood; insists on a nuanced analogical link rather than identity.
 - To **Barth**: appreciates Barth's corrective to scholastic univocity but argues Barth's reformulation needs a more explicit account of analogical predication to avoid indeterminacy in ascribing properties to persons.
 - To aspects of **Van Til**: accepts the analogical thrust but critiques any slide toward opaque "one-person language" that might undercut clear personal distinctions.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Proposes a structured account of **analogical predication** applied intra-divine (person-to-person) as well as divine-to-creature.
 - Advocates a **relational ontology** where relations (generation, spiration) have ontological primacy within a framework constrained by revelation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed analytic theologians and those exploring Trinitarian metaphysics; used as a bridge between presuppositional apologetics and constructive systemic theology. Stimulated further debate on logic and language in theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a workable model for integrating classical trinitarian doctrines (eternal generation, spiration) with contemporary concerns about language, predication, and metaphysical category transfer.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogy / Analogical predication**
 - Predication that is neither strictly univocal nor entirely equivocal; truth between God and creature and among divine persons is proportionate but not identical.
- **Van Til's analogy**
 - The idea that God-centered presuppositions shape our talk about God; Poythress extends this into formal logic and ontology.
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Epistemic posture inherited from Van Til; used here as a methodological base for theological reform of logic.
- **Univocity vs. Equivocity**
 - Opposing poles Poythress rejects: univocity flattens transcendence; equivocity dissolves meaningful theology.
- **Relational ontology**
 - Ontology that prioritizes relations (generation, spiration) as constitutive within the divine life, not merely accidental.
- **Eternal generation**
 - Classical doctrine; Poythress affirms it but recasts its logic analogically to avoid ontological division.
- **Spiration / Procession of the Spirit**
 - The Spirit's origin within the Trinity; analyzed so that processional relations are real but analogically predicated.
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The claim linking economic and immanent Trinity; Poythress critiques simplistic formulations and proposes an analogical corrective.
- **Barthian reformulation**
 - Barth's attempt to reconceive theological language about God; Poythress praises the move but presses for a clearer analogical logic.
- **One-person language (Van Til)**
 - Notion that theological language centers on the divine "one" as revealed; Poythress nuances and critiques applications that obscure persons.
- **Divine simplicity**
 - Maintained but interpreted so analogical predication preserves simplicity without collapsing relations.
- **Predicational rules**
 - Proposed norms for how attributes can be ascribed among divine persons and to creatures.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in trinitarian metaphysics: supplies an analogical logic for constructive models.
- As a **polemic** against Rahnerian equating of economic/immanent Trinity and against careless univocity.
- As a **definition source** for analogical predication in Reformed theological method.
- As an **exegetical-model guide** for reading biblical texts about intra-trinitarian relations (useful in Trinitarian theology and Christology).
