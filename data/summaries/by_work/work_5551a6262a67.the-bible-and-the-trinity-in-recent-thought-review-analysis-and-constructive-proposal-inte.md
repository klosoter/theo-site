### TITLE
**Scott R. Swain, The Bible and the Trinity in Recent Thought: Review, Analysis, and Constructive Proposal** (International Journal of Systematic Theology, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century trinitarian retrieval; post-1990s "Trinitarian renaissance" grappling with biblical theology, pro-Nicene ressourcement, and suspicion of metaphysics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to relate Scripture and classical trinitarian dogma so that biblical exegesis genuinely yields (and normatively controls) doctrines such as the ontological/economic distinction, inseparable operations, eternal generation/spiration, and the filioque.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Review:** Surveys recent proposals tying Trinity to Scripture (e.g., "divine identity" approaches, social trinitarianism, and anti-metaphysical readings), noting strengths and liabilities.
 - **Analysis:** Commends pro-Nicene rules as exegetically responsible canons of biblical reasoning; clarifies Rahner's rule within classical parameters; argues that missions disclose and fit the eternal processions.
 - **Constructive proposal:** Advocates a canonical, rule-of-faith-guided reading wherein biblical names, actions, and doxologies identify the one God and the distinct hypostases; correlates economy and ontology without collapsing them; defends eternal generation and spiration as scripturally warranted; articulates the theological logic of the filioque.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture; Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and Athanasian Creed; Augustine and Aquinas; pro-Nicene scholarship (e.g., Ayres/Anatolios); modern trinitarian voices (Barth, Rahner, Jenson, Gunton); Reformed dogmatics (Calvin, Bavinck).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (ontology/economy), revelation and Scripture, divine simplicity and inseparable operations, missions/processions, Christology (Son's eternal generation), Pneumatology (Spirit's spiration), filioque and ecumenical creedality.
- **Closing line:** The Bible, read canonically under the church's rule of faith, not only permits but requires pro-Nicene trinitarian dogma.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong account of how biblical missions reveal, not constitute, eternal processions.
 - Tight coupling of inseparable operations with the personal taxis to explain differentiated divine action ad extra.
 - Canonical and doxological exegesis as the pathway from biblical discourse to dogmatic ontology.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Resists collapsing ontology into economy (against some uses of Rahner's rule) and resists social trinitarian projections of creaturely society into God.
 - Pushes back on anti-metaphysical biblicism by retrieving classical metaphysics as hermeneutically servient to Scripture.
 - Clarifies that eternal generation/spiration are biblical conclusions, not speculative add-ons.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Fresh deployment of pro-Nicene "rules" (inseparable operations, relations of origin) as exegetical canons.
 - Refined account of appropriation grounded in hypostatic properties rather than mere pedagogical convenience.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed retrieval for classical trinitarian method; resource in debates on EFS/ERAS by re-centering missions/processions and one will.
 - Used ecumenically to frame Protestant participation in Nicene consensus, including careful handling of filioque.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model for integrating biblical theology with classical dogmatics.
 - Clear teaching resource on ontological vs economic Trinity, eternal generation/spiration, and filioque within creedally anchored exegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity:** God as revealed in salvation history; the domain of missions and inseparable operations.
- **Ontological (Immanent) Trinity:** God as he is eternally in himself; relations of origin ground personal distinctions.
- **Rahner's Rule (rightly ordered):** The economic is the immanent and vice versa, with missions manifesting, not creating, processions.
- **Inseparable Operations (ad extra):** The one undivided divine action, with personal distinctions manifesting as taxis and appropriations.
- **Taxis:** Ordered pattern of divine working (from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit) mirroring eternal relations.
- **Relations of Origin:** Paternity, filiation, and spiration as the sole differentiators of the persons.
- **Eternal Generation:** The Son's timeless origin from the Father; grounded in scriptural naming (Only-Begotten) and mission.
- **Eternal Spiration:** The Spirit's timeless origin; correlated with Pentecostal mission and indwelling.
- **Missions and Processions:** Missions reveal processions; economic sendings disclose eternal origins.
- **Appropriation:** Predicating works or attributes to a person fittingly, without dividing the essence or operations.
- **Divine Simplicity:** God is not composed; underwrites inseparable operations and one will/one power.
- **Filioque:** Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (or from the Father through the Son); read in light of biblical sendings and Western creedal usage.
- **Rule of Faith/Canon:** Ecclesial summary guiding canonical exegesis toward trinitarian conclusions.
- **Ecumenical Creeds:** Nicene-Constantinopolitan and Athanasian as authoritative summaries aligning Scripture and dogma.
- **Pro-Nicene Theology:** The fourth-century synthesis providing stable rules for reading Scripture trinitarianly.

- **How this work is used:**
 - Definition source: clarifies ontological vs economic Trinity and their ordered relation.
 - Polemical resource: defends eternal generation and spiration against subordinationist or purely functional accounts.
 - Ecumenical-dogmatic pivot: situates filioque within creedally faithful, biblically reasoned theology.
