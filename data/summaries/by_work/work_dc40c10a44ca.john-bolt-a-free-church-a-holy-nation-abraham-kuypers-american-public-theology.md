### TITLE
John Bolt, A Free Church, A Holy Nation: Abraham Kuyper's American Public Theology (Eerdmans, 2017). 
Primary subject: Abraham Kuyper and neo‑Calvinist public theology. 
Associated tradition: **Reformed / Neo‑Calvinism** (Kuyperian).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Historical frame: late 19th-early 20th century Dutch Reformed response to modernity; Kuyper's transatlantic reception in American Protestantism.
 - Movement: neo‑Calvinist public theology, rise of Reformed social institutions, conversation with American pluralism and liberal Protestantism.

- **Central thesis**
 - Bolt argues Kuyper offers a coherent model for Christian public life that marries a vigorous **free church** ecclesiology with a vision of a **holy nation**-a confessional people exercising cultural responsibility without ecclesiastical domination of the state.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical reconstruction of Kuyper's speeches, writings, and public actions.
 - Theological exposition of Kuyper's key doctrines (sovereignty of God, common grace, covenant, sphere sovereignty).
 - Application to American public theology: diagnosing secularism and proposing institutional alternatives.
 - Critical engagement with modern critics and later Reformed interlocutors (including contemporary debates).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Abraham Kuyper (works, Lectures, Stone Lectures).
 - Secondary: Calvinist confessional corpus (Belgic, Heidelberg, Canons of Dort), contemporaries in Dutch and American Protestantism; modern interlocutors include proponents and critics within Reformed public theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, **Trinity** (doctrinal implications for social order), Christology and **atonement**, covenant theology, ecclesiology, sacraments, grace (common and special), sanctification, and public ethics.

- **Site usages (mapping five loci)**
 - **Eternal Generation and Spiration**: Bolt traces Kuyper's Trinitarian ordering of creation and social relations, showing how eternal relations in God ground his social doctrines (divine community as model for ordered plurality).
 - **Confessional Formulations of Covenant**: Bolt reads Kuyper through confessional categories, demonstrating how Kuyper adapts Belgic/Heidelberg covenantal language to public and civic identity.
 - **Atonement: Necessity, Extent, Theories**: Bolt situates Kuyper within classical Reformed atonement commitments (definite atonement emphasis) while highlighting Kuyper's stress on cosmic and cultural consequences of the atonement.
 - **Federal Vision and Justification by Faith**: Bolt locates Kuyper as an antecedent sometimes invoked in modern Federal Vision debates; he clarifies Kuyper's covenantal, forensic commitments to defend against misreadings that collapse justification and covenantal participation.
 - **Regeneration and Indwelling**: Bolt highlights Kuyper's account of personal regeneration and Spirit‑indwelling as the inner engine for public Christian witness-private sanctification enabling public transformation.

- **Closing line**
 - Kuyper's theological center of gravity, as Bolt presents it, is a Reformed, confessional public theology that insists God's sovereignty governs every sphere-calling the church to be a holy people shaping culture by God's word, not by ecclesiastical coercion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Sphere sovereignty** (distinct life‑spheres each under God), robust **common grace**, and an institutionalized Reformed social vision (schools, press, political party).
 - Emphasis on a confessional people as cultural actor-church formation preceding cultural transformation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with liberal Protestant accommodation and pietistic privatization of faith; corrects simplistic readings that reduce Kuyper to mere culture war rhetoric.
 - Differentiates Kuyper clearly from later movements (e.g., Federal Vision) when those movements conflate covenantal participation with forensic justification.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Political theology vocabulary: sphere sovereignty and the comprehensive sovereignty of God over life's structures.
 - Systematic linking of Trinitarian doctrine to social ordering.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Renewed influence in contemporary Reformed public theology, neo‑Calvinist institutions, and conservative Protestant discourse in North America.
 - Cited by both critics and proponents in debates over church/state, education, and ecclesial identity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological model: marrying careful confessional theology to sociopolitical application.
 - Resource for teaching on how doctrinal convictions (Trinity, covenant, grace) inform communal and political engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sphere sovereignty** - Each societal sphere (family, church, state, science) has God‑given responsibilities; a pole in Bolt's reading of Kuyper's public theology.
- **Common grace** - God's restraining and preserving grace for non‑believers that enables cultural achievement; justifies Christian cultural engagement.
- **Antithesis** - The fundamental opposition between regenerate and unregenerate life that structures Kuyper's cultural strategy.
- **Covenant (confessional sense)** - Covenant as communal, formative reality; Bolt shows Kuyper uses confessional covenant language to undergird public identity.
 - Contrast: covenantal inclusion vs. individualistic voluntarism.
- **Sovereignty of God** - Foundational axiom; God rules all spheres and thus grounds the claim for comprehensive Christian discipleship.
- **Particular redemption / Atonement emphasis** - Kuyper's Reformed insistence on definite aspects of the atonement; Bolt nuances this with Kuyper's cosmic/ cultural emphasis.
- **Regeneration / Indwelling** - Personal work of the Spirit enabling ethical and public fruit; central to Kuyper's argument that inner renewal precedes public impact.
- **Justification by faith** - Forensic doctrine maintained by Kuyper; Bolt defends Kuyper against readings that would collapse justification into covenantal participation.
- **Trinitarian ordering (eternal generation & spiration)** - Bolt traces how Kuyper's social theology is analogically rooted in intra‑Trinitarian relations.
- **Confessional formularies** - Belgic, Heidelberg, Dort as frameworks Kuyper inherits and reappropriates for public theology.
- **Public theology / Cultural mandate** - Theological claim that Christians exercise stewardship in all areas of life; Bolt treats Kuyper as a prime exemplar.
- **Federal Vision (as interlocutory term)** - Contemporary debate deployed to test Kuyperian covenant language; Bolt uses Kuyper to correct misappropriations.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Kuyperian public theology (sphere sovereignty, common grace).
 - As a **polemic** against secular liberalism and against misreadings (e.g., conflations with Federal Vision).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading confessional covenant texts into contemporary social ethics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian doctrine, covenant theology, and social institutions in Reformed theological curricula.
