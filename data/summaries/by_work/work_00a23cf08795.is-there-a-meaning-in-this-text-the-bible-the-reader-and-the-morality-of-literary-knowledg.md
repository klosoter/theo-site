### TITLE
Is There a Meaning in This Text? The Bible, the Reader, and the Morality of Literary Knowledge - Kevin J. Vanhoozer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context.** Late-1990s postmodern turn in literary theory and theology; evangelical and Reformed retrieval projects; analytic philosophy of language (Austin, Searle) enters hermeneutics; interlocution with deconstruction, reader-response, Gadamerian tradition.
- **Central thesis / problem.** Against relativizing claims that meaning is undecidable or reader-constructed, Vanhoozer argues for a chastened hermeneutical realism: determinate meaning resides in authorial communicative action encoded in texts. Interpretation is a moral act of respecting authorial authority; for Scripture, this means receiving God's communicative action through inspired human discourse.
- **Core argument / structure.**
 - Critique of interpretive nihilism: exposes internal tensions in Derrida, Fish, Rorty; shows costs of severing meaning from authorial discourse.
 - Retrieval and renovation of authorial intention: moves from mentalist intention to **authorial illocution** (speech-act theory), distinguishing locution/illocution/perlocution.
 - Ethics of interpretation: cultivates **interpretive virtues** (humility, honesty, charity, patience) and proposes communal, tradition-aware practices.
 - Theological payoff: Scripture as **divine discourse** mediated by canonical texts; the literal sense is the divinely intended illocution of the human authors; the Spirit enables reception without collapsing divine into human.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors.** Hirsch (meaning/significance), Austin/Searle (speech acts), Wolterstorff (divine discourse), Gadamer/Ricoeur (tradition, narrative), Derrida/Foucault/Fish/Rorty (postmodern critiques), Calvin (accommodation), Augustine (charity).
- **Doctrines treated.**
 - **Revelation (general/special):** One communicative economy; general hermeneutics underwrite special revelation's intelligibility as discourse.
 - **Scripture and authority:** Canon as stable site of God's communicative action; authorial authority grounds the text's claim upon readers.
 - **Epistemology of knowing God:** Hermeneutical realism with moral conditions of knowledge; knowledge as covenantal reception.
 - **Accommodation/incarnational analogy:** Divine illocutions accommodated in human locutions; unity-in-distinction of divine and human discourse.
 - **Analogia fidei vs entis (hermeneutical function):** Canonical rule of faith and analogia scripturae regulate interpretation, not metaphysical similarity-principles.
- **Site usage (5 topical references).**
 - General and Special Revelation: frames revelation as communicative action continuous with ordinary understanding yet divinely initiated.
 - Self Attestation and Authority of Scripture: defends authorial authority; Scripture self-attests as God's speech in canonical form.
 - Analogia Entis vs Analogia Fidei: privileges analogia fidei/scripturae as interpretive norms over analogia entis as a hermeneutical guide.
 - Epistemology and the Knowledge of God: models chastened realism and interpretive virtue as epistemic posture.
 - Accommodation and Incarnational Analogy: articulates divine-human concurrence via speech-act and accommodation language.
- **Closing line.** God speaks by promising and commanding in Scripture; faithful interpretation is a morally responsible participation in that communicative act.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases.**
 - **Meaning as illocution:** the literal sense is what the author does with words.
 - **Morality of knowledge:** interpretation requires virtues; hermeneutics is ethics-laden.
 - **Canonical-linguistic focus:** authority resides in canonical discourse, not behind-the-text psychology.
- **Corrections/contrasts.**
 - Against deconstruction/reader-sovereignty: insists on determinate, public meaning.
 - Beyond naive foundationalism: admits finitude, tradition, and fallibility while refusing relativism.
 - From mentalist intention (Hirsch) to communicative action (Austin/Searle): intention is textualized action, not private states.
 - Nuances Gadamer/Ricoeur: tradition aids but does not overrule authorial discourse; charity is accountable to the text.
- **Conceptual innovations.**
 - **Triadic communicative model:** locution/illocution/perlocution applied theologically.
 - **Interpretive virtues** as methodological criteria.
 - **Canonical illocutions** and **divine discourse** as loci for doctrine of Scripture.
- **Reception/influence.**
 - Major catalyst for evangelical theological interpretation; bridges analytic philosophy and Reformed bibliology; informs later works (e.g., Drama of Doctrine).
 - Critiqued by strong postmodernists (for realism) and by some conservatives (for not specifying inerrancy formulae), yet widely adopted as a hermeneutical framework.
- **Enduring value.**
 - Equips exegesis with a rigorous account of meaning.
 - Grounds Scripture's authority in communicative action.
 - Provides a shared grammar for theology, philosophy, and literary theory.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Authorial intention (as communicative action):** Intention is what the author does in/through the text; publicly accessible via discourse.
- **Speech act (locution/illocution/perlocution):** Words, the act done in saying them, and their effects; biblical commands/promises are illocutions.
- **Hermeneutical realism:** We can know determinate meanings, though fallibly and virtue-dependently.
- **Meaning vs significance (Hirsch):** Stable textual meaning vs changing applications; protects authorial control.
- **Interpretive virtues:** Humility, honesty, charity, patience; ethical conditions for rightly hearing another's discourse.
- **Divine discourse:** God speaks through human authors; Scripture's illocutions are God's communicative acts.
- **Canonical discourse/Rule of faith:** Canon and creed guide reading; Scripture interprets Scripture (analogia scripturae/fidei).
- **Illumination of the Spirit:** The Spirit enables right uptake of divine illocutions without adding new meaning.
- **Reader-response/deconstruction (critiqued):** Positions centering reader or undecidability; judged ethically deficient toward the author/text.
- **Accommodation:** God condescends to human capacities; divine meaning is genuinely mediated by human forms.
- **Literal sense:** The authorially intended illocutionary content; foundation for responsible theological interpretation.
- **Perlocutionary effect:** The responsive action aimed at by the text (faith, obedience); tied to Scripture's authority.

- **How this work is used across loci.**
 - As a definition source for revelation and Scripture as communicative action (General/Special Revelation; Self-Attestation).
 - As a polemic against interpretive relativism in doctrinal method (Epistemology/Knowledge of God).
 - As an exegetical model privileging canonical illocutions and analogia fidei (Analogia Entis vs Analogia Fidei).
 - As a conceptual pivot for discussing accommodation/incarnational analogy in bibliology (Accommodation and Incarnational Analogy).
