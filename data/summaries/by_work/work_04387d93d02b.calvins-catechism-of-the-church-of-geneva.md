### TITLE
**Calvin s Catechism of the Church of Geneva** (Catechisme de l Eglise de Geneve), John Calvin, 1542 French; 1545 Latin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Produced after Calvin s 1541 return to Geneva, within the Magisterial Reformation s consolidation.
 - Designed for weekly catechesis and for examining youth before admission to the Lord s Supper; aligned with the Ecclesiastical Ordinances.
 - Milieu: polemics with Rome (sacramentalism, authority), Anabaptists (church, baptism), and Lutheran debates on the Supper.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To form believers in true piety by an ordered confession of the faith in dialogue form, grounding church life and sacramental practice in Scripture as illumined by the Spirit.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Knowledge of God and Scripture**: God is known savingly through the Word by the Spirit s internal testimony.
 - **Creed**: Exposition of the Apostles Creed, centering the economy of salvation in the Trinity and the Mediator.
 - **Law**: Decalogue as rule of gratitude; exposes sin and directs sanctified life.
 - **Prayer**: Lord s Prayer as model of filial dependence and worship.
 - **Church and Sacraments**: Nature and marks of the church, ministry, discipline; Baptism and the Lord s Supper as divinely instituted means, effective by the Spirit and received by faith.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - **Scripture** as norma normans; reception of **creedal tradition**; Augustinian soteriology and pneumatology.
 - Engages Rome (ex opere operato; transubstantiation), **Anabaptists** (rebaptism, church), and **Lutherans** (ubiquity of Christ s body).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology** (Scripture and Spirit), **Trinity** (ontological and economic), **Christology**, **Pneumatology**, **Soteriology** (union with Christ; duplex gratia), **Ecclesiology** (marks, ministry, discipline), **Sacraments** (Baptism; Supper).

- **Center of gravity**
 - **Union with Christ by the Spirit through Word and Sacraments within the visible church, unto a life of gratitude and worship.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Dialogical pedagogy** (Minister-Child) binding catechesis to church discipline and communion admission.
 - **Duplex gratia**: justification and sanctification inseparably bestowed in Christ.
 - **Word-and-Spirit** hermeneutic: external Word, internal testimony.
 - **Covenantal inclusion** grounding **infant baptism** in Abrahamic continuity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **Rome**: denies ex opere operato; insists on faith and the Spirit for sacramental efficacy; rejects transubstantiation.
 - Against **Anabaptists**: rejects rebaptism; affirms infants as covenant members; upholds visible church order and discipline.
 - Against **Lutheran ubiquity**: affirms Christ s true body in heaven; **real spiritual presence** by the Spirit, not local or carnal presence.
 - Guards against antinomianism and legalism by framing the Law as guide for the redeemed.

- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - **Testimonium Spiritus Sancti**; **union with Christ**; **means of grace**; **marks of the church**; **keys of the kingdom**; **fencing the table**.
 - Implicit **ontological/economic Trinity** distinction: economy reveals the one simple God without dividing essence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard in Geneva; influenced French Reformed, Scottish kirk practice, and later catechisms (Heidelberg, Westminster Shorter) in structure and emphases.
 - A resource for Reformed **sacramentology**, catechetical method, and church discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - Concise, ecclesially situated synthesis that integrates doctrine, devotion, and discipline; a durable template for catechesis and for teaching on Word-and-Spirit, Trinity, and sacraments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Testimonium Spiritus Sancti**: The Spirit s internal witness that certifies Scripture and seals the gospel to the heart; anchors theological method in Word-and-Spirit.
- **Principia of theology**: Scripture as principium cognoscendi; God as principium essendi. Calvin s catechetical ordering models theology as a disciplined science in service of piety.
- **Union with Christ**: The Spirit unites believers to the risen Christ, the fountain of justification and sanctification (duplex gratia).
- **Duplex gratia**: Twofold grace received together in Christ; grounds ethics in salvation, not merit.
- **Baptism: mode, subjects, efficacy**
 - **Mode**: indifferent; emphasis on promise and command.
 - **Subjects**: infants of believers included by covenant; believers unbaptized to be baptized.
 - **Efficacy**: sign and seal; truly offers and seals what it signifies, yet realized by the Spirit through faith, not tied to the moment or operator.
- **Lord s Supper: presence and admission**
 - **Presence**: true spiritual feeding on Christ s body and blood by the Spirit; rejection of transubstantiation and mere memorialism.
 - **Fencing**: examination, catechesis, and discipline precede admission; unworthy reception harms.
- **Church and discipline**: Marks are pure preaching, right sacrament administration, and discipline; ministers serve by Word and keys for edification.
- **Covenant**: Unity of the covenant of grace undergirds infant baptism and the continuity of church and promises.
- **Trinity: ontological vs economic**: One essence, three persons confessed; God known in missions and works is the same God who is; no subordination of essence.
- **Person and deity of the Holy Spirit**: Explicit affirmation of the Spirit as true God; the Spirit as bond of union and author of faith.
- **Spirit in Christ s ministry and resurrection**: The Spirit anoints the Mediator and applies His resurrected life to believers; hence sacramental efficacy is pneumatic.
- **Rahner s Rule (later retrieval)**: Calvin s economy-to-ontology coherence is often cited to support the maxim that the economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity, without collapsing them.
- **Van Til s one-person language (later debate)**: Calvin s precise essence-persons distinctions and anti-speculative reserve are used to critique conflations that blur tri-personal distinctions.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed teaching on sacraments, church marks, and the Spirit s testimony.
 - As a **polemic touchstone** against Rome, Anabaptists, and overly literalist accounts of presence.
 - As an **exegetical-catechetical model** integrating Creed, Decalogue, and Lord s Prayer with church practice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for Trinity and pneumatology discussions that engage later rules (Rahner) and analytic critiques (Van Til debates).
