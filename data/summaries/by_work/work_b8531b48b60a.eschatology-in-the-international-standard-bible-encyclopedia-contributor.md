### TITLE
Eschatology (ISBE entry) - Anthony A. Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Entry in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, a mid‑ to late‑20th century evangelical reference work. Hoekema writes from a Reformed/evangelical milieu shaped by postwar conservative theology and the resurgence of historicist/amillennial readings in academic circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Eschatology must be grounded in biblical revelation: the last things (final judgment and eternal states) are certain, morally decisive, and revealed in a way that requires both doctrinal fidelity and pastoral sensibility. The entry addresses what Scripture teaches about judgment, resurrection, the intermediate state, and the eternal destinies of righteous and wicked.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and scope: clarifies terminology (last things, consummation, judgment, eternal state).
 - The future consummation: Christ's second coming, the resurrection of the dead, and the establishment of the new heavens and new earth.
 - Judgment: distinguishes the general/final judgment from particular/individual reckoning; stress on Christ as judge.
 - Eternal states: exposition of eternal life for the righteous and eternal punishment for the wicked; rejection of annihilationism and universalism.
 - Pastoral implications: ethical urgency, assurance for believers, warning for sinners.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural witnesses (Gospels, Pauline eschatology, Revelation). Historical interlocutors implicit: Augustine and Reformation interpreters (Calvin), modern opponents such as dispensational premillennialists, annihilationists, and universalists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (biblical basis for last things), Christology (Christ as judge and consummator), resurrection, providence and sovereignty, sin and final retribution, salvation and sanctification as preparation for judgment.
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema centers eschatology on the biblical promise and threat: Christ will return to judge and consummate history, producing final, irreversible eternal states that compel both worship and holy living.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strongly Reformed, amillennial orientation: the consummation is final, not a future earthly millennium; present kingdom realities are anticipatory of the coming fullness.
 - Emphasis on continuity between present sanctification and final vindication - eschatology grounds Christian ethics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Explicit corrective to dispensational premillennialism (literalized prophetic timetable) and to theological liberalism (which minimizes divine judgment).
 - Firm rebuttal of annihilationism and universalism: defends conscious, eternal punishment for the unrepentant as biblically warranted.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the distinction between particular/individual judgment and the final, public judgment - useful for pastoral and doctrinal clarity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded as a reliable, concise evangelical-Reformed summary in reference literature; used by pastors and scholars for quick orientation and as a gateway to more extensive Reformed treatments (e.g., Hoekema's longer works).
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for its careful biblical grounding, pastoral tone, and clear contrasts with major contemporary errors; remains a compact, authoritative introduction from a Reformed vantage.
