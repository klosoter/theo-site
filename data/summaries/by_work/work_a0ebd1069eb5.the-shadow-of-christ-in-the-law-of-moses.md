### TITLE
**The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses** - Vern S. Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s Reformed evangelical milieu (Westminster Theological Seminary); debates on **theonomy**, **dispensationalism**, and **redemptive-historical** preaching shape the agenda.
 - Published by a confessional Reformed press; aims to equip pastors and students to read Mosaic law **Christocentrically** and ethically.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Mosaic law is a **God-ordained symbolic system** whose structures, institutions, and sanctions are **typological shadows** that find **fulfillment and transformation in Christ**; its **moral import continues** through the **Spirit** in the new covenant by way of **general equity** and redemptive-historical reapplication.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Hermeneutical foundations**: unity of Scripture, inspiration, typology grounded in divine authorship; use of a **tri-perspectival** method (normative, situational, existential).
 - **Theocracy and holiness**: Israel as a symbolically heightened **holy realm**; spatial and ritual boundaries (holy/common, clean/unclean) express proximity to Gods presence.
 - **Cult and priesthood**: sacrifices (burnt, purification, reparation, peace) and **priestly mediation** as patterns of substitution, cleansing, communion fulfilled in Christ and his priesthood (Hebrews).
 - **Purity, holy war, penalties**: impurity and crime relate to Gods holiness; **civil sanctions** echo holy war and are typological, not straightforwardly perpetual.
 - **Festivals, Sabbath, land**: sacred times and the land anticipate **Sabbath rest**, **Jubilee liberty**, and **new-creation** inheritance in Christ.
 - **Social ethics**: gleaning, loans, compassion laws embody justice and mercy that continue by **transformed application**.
 - **From shadow to substance**: practical guidelines for applying each law today by discerning its **underlying principle**, **typological trajectory**, and **new-covenant form**.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on **Calvin**, **Westminster Confession** (esp. 19 on the law), **Vos** and **Clowney** on typology; dialog with **Meredith Kline** (intrusion ethics).
 - Engages and corrects **theonomy** (e.g., Bahnsen) and **dispensationalism** (Ryrie) while critiquing purely **historical-critical** fragmentation.
 - Canonical interlocutors: **Hebrews**, **Colossians 2**, **Matthew 5**, **Jeremiah 31**.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology** (inspiration, unity, typology), **Covenant theology**, **Christology** (priest, king, prophet; atonement), **Soteriology** (substitution, cleansing), **Pneumatology** (law on the heart), **Eschatology** (already-not yet), **Ethics** and **Ecclesiology** (church as temple).
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Christ fulfills, reorients, and deepens the law**, and by the **Spirit** the church embodies its justice and holiness in anticipatory, eschatological form.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A comprehensive, Christ-centered reading of **all three traditional law divisions** via **typology**, rather than treating only ceremonies as symbolic.
 - **Tri-perspectival** ethical method integrates divine norms, redemptive-historical situation, and changed heart obedience.
 - **Theocracy as symbolic intensification**: Israels civil order and sanctions protect Gods holy presence and thus are not directly replicated post-Christ.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **dispensational abrogation**: the law continues in fulfilled form; moral substance abides.
 - Against **strict theonomy**: penalties and land-tied ordinances were **typological** and are transformed; application proceeds by **general equity**, not replication.
 - Nuances **Klinean intrusion ethics** by embedding it within a broader typological architecture.
 - Moves beyond a rigid **moral/civil/ceremonial** grid toward **redemptive-historical continuity/discontinuity**.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear **application pathway**: identify symbolic function, locate Christological fulfillment, state abiding moral principle, articulate ecclesial and civic implications.
 - **Holiness mapping** (holy/common, clean/unclean) as an ethical-exegetical tool for Leviticus and beyond.
 - Multi-level fulfillment schema: **shadow -> Christ -> church -> consummation**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed preaching and courses on Pentateuch/ethics; a standard **exegetical model** for OT law.
 - Cited in debates on public theology, criminal justice, and pastoral application of purity texts; critiqued by hard theonomists and some dispensationalists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Equips readers to preach and teach OT law with **Christological depth**, **ethical clarity**, and **pastoral prudence**; bridges academic biblical theology and church practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Shadow and substance**: OT institutions as anticipatory signs; Christ as the reality (Heb 8-10; Col 2).
- **Typology**: God-intended historical patterns that escalate to Christ and the church.
- **Theocracy**: Israels polity structured around Gods dwelling; sanctions tied to sacred space.
- **Holiness taxonomy**: holy/common and clean/unclean; proximity to Gods presence governs ritual and ethics.
- **Tri-perspectivalism**: normative (Gods commands), situational (redemptive-historical context), existential (heart-renewal) perspectives on obedience.
- **General equity**: abiding moral principle of case laws applicable across cultures after redemptive transformation.
- **Fulfillment as transformation**: continuity that changes form in Christ, not mere continuation or cancellation.
- **Priesthood and sacrifice**: substitution, purification, and communion fulfilled in Christ the high priest.
- **Holy war**: judicial intrusion of end-time judgment into Israels history; now spiritual warfare and church discipline.
- **Sabbath and Jubilee**: present rest and liberty in Christ; consummated in new creation.
- **Temple/presence**: God dwells now by the Spirit in Christ and his body; holiness relocates from land to church.
- **Law on the heart**: new-covenant Spirit-enabled obedience (Jer 31; Ezek 36).
- **Land and kingdom**: typological of universal inheritance; mission replaces territorial sanctity.
- **Case law**: concrete exemplars revealing creational justice principles.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Christology**: defines how priest, sacrifice, temple, king, and prophet converge in Christ.
 - **Covenant theology**: calibrates continuity/discontinuity and the role of Mosaic law.
 - **Soteriology and ethics**: grounds atonement imagery and shapes moral reasoning from OT law.
 - **Bibliology and hermeneutics**: serves as a model for canonical, typological exegesis guided by the Spirit.
