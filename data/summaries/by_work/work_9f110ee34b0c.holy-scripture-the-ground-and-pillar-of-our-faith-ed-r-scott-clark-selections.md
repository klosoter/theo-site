### TITLE
Holy Scripture: The Ground and Pillar of Our Faith (selections) - Francis Turretin; ed. R. Scott Clark 
Topic cited: Self Attestation And Authority Of Scripture

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687), professor at the Academy of Geneva. Post-Remonstrant controversies, reacting to Roman Catholic claims about ecclesial authority and to rationalist and Socinian denials of inspiration.
 - R. Scott Clark's 21st-century edition extracts Turretin's treatments on Scripture to re-present classical Reformed bibliology for confessional readers.

- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture is the self-authenticating Word of God: it is both the ground and the pillar of faith because it alone bears intrinsic authority, confirmed by the Holy Spirit's internal testimony and by external evidences (miracles, prophecy, and apostolicity).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes kinds of testimony and evidence for canonical books:
 - **External marks**: miracles, prophecy, fulfillment, apostolicity, ecclesiastical reception.
 - **Internal marks**: doctrinal coherence, majesty of style, divine efficacy.
 - **Spiritual testimony**: the Holy Spirit's inward witness producing certain, saving assent in believers.
 - Argues that Scripture's authority is not dependent on ecclesiastical ratification as its primary ground; the church recognizes, but does not create, canonical authority.
 - Addresses epistemic concerns: differentiates moral probability from supernatural certainty supplied by the Spirit; defends certainty of faith without undermining reason's role in apprehending external proofs.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Proffers Reformed predecessors (Calvin, Beza) as resources; opposes Roman Catholic claim of papal/institutional finality and Socinian rationalism.
 - Engages occasional Cartesian influences indirectly by defending revelation against purely rationalist retrenchments.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special), inspiration, canonicity, perspicuity, infallibility/inerrancy, illumination (internal testimony), authority (norma normans), faith and assent.

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's core claim: Scripture, by divine inspiration and the Spirit's inward testimony, is the ultimate, self-attesting rule for faith and life - the normative ground and pillar of the church's doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear, systematic integration of external evidences with the decisive role of the Holy Spirit's internal testimony; not a purely evidentialist or purely fideistic stance but a twofold confirmation model.
 - Careful scholastic distinctions (degrees and kinds of assent; intrinsic vs. extrinsic authority).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters Roman Catholicism by denying that the church's decretal act confers canonical authority; church's role is recognitive.
 - Opposes Socinian and rationalist reductions by insisting on supernatural testimony (not merely human persuasion) for certitude in saving faith.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of terms such as **self-attestation** (scriptura sui ipsius testis) and refined articulation of the Spirit's witness as epistemic, not merely subjective consolation.
 - Nuanced treatment of **norma normans** (Scripture as the norm that norms the church) versus **norma normata** (confessions/church rules).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in later Reformed and Presbyterian orthodoxy as a touchstone for bibliology; influential for conservative evangelical doctrines of inerrancy and infallibility.
 - Modern revival through Clark and others has reintroduced Turretin into confessionalist debates and pastoral formation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, rigorous model for defending Scripture against both ecclesiastical and rationalist challenges; exemplary for teaching systematic bibliology and apologetics within a confessional Reformed frame.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation (scriptura sui ipsius testis)** - Scripture bears internal marks that testify to its divine origin; it requires no external institution to confer ultimate authority.
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit** - The Holy Spirit gives believers a certifying, saving assent to Scripture, producing assurance beyond probabilistic proofs.
- **External evidences** - Miracles, fulfilled prophecy, apostolicity, and catholic reception serve as objective signs supporting canonicity.
- **Canonicity** - The status of books as Scripture: discerned by marks and Spirit-witness, recognized (not created) by the church.
- **Inspiration** - Divine authorship of Scripture; Turretin affirms plenary, verbal assistance while attending to human modes of expression.
- **Infallibility / inerrancy** - Scripture is incapable of error in its intended teachings; Turretin links authority and truthfulness tightly.
- **Norma normans vs. norma normata** - Scriptural authority as the ultimate norm that judges confessions and church decisions; confessions are subordinate recognitions.
- **Perspicuity (clarity)** - Scripture sufficient in its saving doctrines to be understood by believers; Turretin affirms basic perspicuity without denying complexities.
- **Assent (notitia, assensus, fiducia)** - Distinguishes cognitive knowledge, intellectual assent, and trustful reliance as elements in faith's response to Scripture.
- **Revelation (special vs general)** - Special revelation in Scripture is unique and determinative for redemptive truth; general revelation plays an evidential but subordinate role.
- **Authority (auctoritas)** - The binding force Scripture exerts on conscience and doctrine; rooted in divine authorship.
- **Ecclesial recognition** - The church's canonical lists are acts of recognition; the church bears responsibility to guard and proclaim the self-attesting Word.
- **Test of doctrine** - Scriptural rule as the tribunal for orthodoxy; tradition and reason are evaluated by Scripture.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for classical Reformed bibliology (doctrine of Scripture) in systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against Roman Catholic claims of magisterial primacy and against rationalist/Socinian objections.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for grounding preaching, assurance, and the discipline of the church on Scripture's self-authenticating authority.
