### TITLE
**Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul's Soteriology** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., Westminster Theological Journal

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed/evangelical scholarship attentive to Pauline theology; written as part of a corrective to readings that marginalize the resurrection in accounts of salvation.
 - Engages both classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Warfield) and contemporary interpreters of Paul (biblical scholarship that emphasized the cross or covenantal/nomistic frameworks).
- **Central thesis**
 - The resurrection of Christ is the central, constitutive fact in Paul's soteriology: it is not merely attestation of Jesus' identity but the decisive event that effects believers' justification, participation, new life, and eschatological status.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegesis of key Pauline texts (notably 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 4-8) to show resurrection language functions as the locus of soteriological realization.
 - Theological synthesis: resurrection grounds both forensic (justification/imputation) and participatory (union with Christ, new creation) aspects of salvation.
 - Polemic against approaches that subordinate the resurrection to the crucifixion or reduce salvation to moral/ethical reformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (via canonical exegesis).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Reformed tradition (Calvin, Warfield), modern theologians and NT scholars (representative debates with those emphasizing the cross, or legal/nomistic interpretations).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, union with Christ)
 - Christology (resurrection as constitutive of Christ's saving work)
 - Eschatology (inaugurated eschatology, already/not-yet)
 - Adoption (as a fruit grounded in risen-life participation)
 - Implicitly: revelation and covenantal language where they intersect with Pauline soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin situates the resurrection as the theologically decisive center of Pauline salvation-grounding both the justification and participatory dimensions of new life in the risen Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the resurrection as ontologically and soteriologically prior: the risen Christ is the *subject* and *source* of believers' new status, not merely the proof of past atonement.
 - Integrates forensic and participatory dimensions rather than pitting imputation against incorporation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that cast the crucifixion as the exclusive center of atonement or that over-privilege moral transformation apart from objective, enacted resurrection realities.
 - Reframes certain Augustinian/Reformed emphases so that traditional doctrines (justification, adoption) are read through Pauline resurrection motifs rather than exclusively jurisprudential categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "resurrection as constitutive" language to displace dichotomies (objective/subjective; imputation/participation) and to provide a unifying center for Pauline soteriology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles as a corrective to both liberal reductions of resurrection significance and theological systems that separate forensic and participatory elements.
 - Instructive in later debates over the New Perspective on Paul insofar as it reasserts classical Pauline categories while urging a more integrated reading.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact exegetical-theological model useful for preaching, systematic formulation, and critique of Pelagian/semi-Pelagian tendencies; valuable in courses on Pauline theology, soteriology, and systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection as constitutive** - The resurrection is the decisive, formative event that realizes believers' soteriological standing.
- **Union with Christ** - Central relational bond by which believers are made participants in the risen life; primary locus for justification and sanctification.
- **Justification (forensic dimension)** - Not divorced from resurrection; imputation and acquittal are understood in light of participation in the risen Christ.
- **Participation (participatory dimension)** - New life and ethical transformation flow from real participation in Christ's risen life.
- **New creation / inaugurated eschatology** - Resurrection inaugurates the eschatological reality that believers already share but await consummation for.
- **Imputation vs. incorporation** - Gaffin refuses a sharp either/or, arguing resurrection integrates both categories.
- **Objective vs subjective aspects of salvation** - Resurrection secures the objective status (what God has done in Christ) and serves as the basis for the subjective outworking (life in the Spirit).
- **1 Corinthians 15 / Romans 4-8** - Primary Pauline texts used to show the central theological function of resurrection in Paul's soteriology.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism and Augustinianism** - 
 - Gaffin uses resurrection centrality to polemicize against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian tendencies that make human response or moral renewal the decisive factor in salvation; emphasizes divine initiative and gift in resurrection-grounded salvation.
 - Engages Augustinian categories sympathetically on grace and divine sovereignty but reframes key doctrines (e.g., adoption, imputation) within Pauline resurrection language rather than purely Augustinian juridical schemata.
- **Adoption** - Treated as a soteriological fruit grounded in union with the risen Christ: resurrection secures believers' filial status and eschatological inheritance.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for locating the resurrection at the doctrinal center of soteriology (useful in systematics and homiletics).
 - As a **polemic/exegetical model** against Pelagian/semi-Pelagian impulses and reductionist readings that overlook the participatory, eschatological dimensions of Paul's theology.
