### TITLE
**By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ** (2006), Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2000s Reformed debates on justification, the New Perspective on Paul (NPP), and Federal Vision; Westminster Theological Seminary milieu.
 - Builds on Vosian redemptive-historical exegesis and earlier Gaffin (Resurrection and Redemption) with a concise, programmatic synthesis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Pauls soteriology is determined by inaugurated eschatology: union with the crucified-and-risen Christ by the eschatological Spirit is the center from which justification, sanctification, adoption, and glorification flow.
 - The church lives between the ages, now by faith and not yet by sight, awaiting the consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Two-age schema**: This age vs the age to come frames Pauls theology; Christ is the turning point.
 - **Resurrection-Pentecost axis**: Christs resurrection inaugurates the new creation; the Spirit is the down payment, making believers participants in the age to come.
 - **Union with Christ**: The organizing soteriological reality; all benefits are distinct yet inseparable in union.
 - Coordinates historia salutis (what Christ accomplished) and ordo salutis (how applied) without collapsing one into the other.
 - **Justification and sanctification**: Distinct benefits, neither temporally nor logically prior in a way that severs them; both are in Christ and by the Spirit, through faith.
 - **Faith vs sight**: Present life is characterized by faiths relation to the unseen, with sufferings conforming us to Christ until glory.
 - **Final judgment according to works**: Compatible with sola fide when works are fruits of union, evidential not meritorious.
 - **Law, works, and the NPP**: Defends Reformed understanding of justification over against redefining justification as primarily ecclesial boundary-marking.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Allies: Calvin, Vos, Ridderbos, Murray, Bavinck.
 - Interlocutors: Wright, Dunn, Sanders (NPP); Roman Catholic accounts of justification; strands of Lutheran and Reformed ordo debates; Federal Vision proposals.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics (redemptive-historical method); covenant and two-Adam schema; Christology (resurrection/ascension); pneumatology (Spirit as eschatological gift); soteriology (union, justification, sanctification, adoption, perseverance, glorification); ecclesiology and sacraments in brief; eschatology (already/not yet).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: participation by the Spirit in the resurrected Christ determines the believers by-faith now and the not-yet of coming sight.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Union with Christ as the architectonic principle, not a discrete benefit among others.
 - Resurrection and Pentecost as the hinge of redemptive history; the Spirit as down payment of the age to come.
 - Reframing ordo salutis within inaugurated eschatology; definitive-sanctification alongside progressive sanctification.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushback against linear, compartmentalized ordo schemes that abstract justification from union and sanctification.
 - Critique of NPP construals that reduce justification to ecclesial identity; defense of a forensic, eschatological verdict in the present.
 - Clarifies Reformed compatibilism: sola fide with a future judgment according to works as evidential fruit of Spirit-wrought union.
- **Conceptual innovations / sharpenings**
 - Tight coordination of historia salutis and ordo salutis.
 - Faith-versus-sight lens as an eschatological hermeneutic of the Christian life.
 - Consolidation of two-age schema for anthropology and ethics (suffering-then-glory).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed seminaries as a concise guide to Pauline soteriology; often paired with Vos and Ridderbos.
 - Cited in debates on justification, Federal Vision, and pastoral theology of assurance and perseverance.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, doctrinally careful map linking exegesis to systematics; guards against both moralism and antinomianism.
 - Useful for preaching and teaching Paul with redemptive-historical depth.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: The age to come has begun in Christ; believers live in an already/not yet tension.
- **Two-age schema**: This age vs the age to come; frames sin, salvation, and hope.
- **Historia salutis**: Once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in Christs death-resurrection-ascension.
- **Ordo salutis**: Application of redemption; re-coordinated under union with Christ rather than a rigid sequence.
- **Union with Christ**: Spirit-wrought participation in Christ, source of every soteriological benefit.
- **Resurrection of Christ**: Eschatological firstfruits; the decisive new-creational event determining justification and sanctification.
- **Eschatological Spirit**: The arrabon (down payment) sealing believers for the day of redemption.
- **By faith, not by sight**: Present modus vivendi of the church; sight awaits the Parousia.
- **Justification by faith**: Present forensic verdict in Christ, apart from works, yet issuing in works as fruit.
 - **Judgment according to works**: Future assessment evidencing union, not the ground of acceptance.
- **Definitive sanctification**: Once-for-all transfer from the old to the new realm; basis of progressive renewal.
- **Adoption/glorification**: Present status and future consummation; creation awaits the sons revealing.
- **Works of the law**: Not boundary markers only; the issue is any human work as ground of righteousness.
- **Second Adam**: Christ as representative head bringing life and righteousness over against Adam.
- **Pentecost**: Historical gift of the Spirit, applying the resurrected Christs benefits to the church.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Conceptual pivot**: Establishes union with Christ as the organizing center for soteriology.
 - **Exegetical model**: Redemptive-historical reading of Paul (Rom 5-8; 1 Cor 15; 2 Cor 3-5; Gal).
 - **Doctrinal synthesis**: Clarifies justification-sanctification relations within eschatology.
 - **Polemic resource**: Engages NPP/Federal Vision and explains judgment-according-to-works compatibilism.
