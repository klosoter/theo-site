### TITLE
The Lordship of Christ: Serving Our Savior All of the Time, in All of Life, with All of Our Heart - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical milieu: pastoral concern about fragmented Christian life, debates over lordship salvation, and contemporaneous controversies (open theism, Federal Vision, EFS debates).
 - Aimed at pastors, theologians, and informed laity wanting a robust, comprehensive doctrine tying Christology to ethics, ecclesiology, and daily discipleship.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christ's lordship is universal and concrete: he is sovereign over cosmos, covenant, and conscience; therefore Christian life must be comprehensively ordered to him-intellectually, morally, socially, and liturgically.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: New Testament texts (esp. Pauline and Johannine) present Christ as sovereign Lord and covenant head.
 - Theological synthesis: connect cosmic kingship, incarnational servanthood, and covenant headship to form a single doctrine that grounds vocation and sanctification.
 - Pastoral application: show how lordship shapes worship, family, work, politics, spiritual gifts, and ethical decisions.
 - Polemical moves: defend classical Reformed emphases (sovereignty, union with Christ, sola fide) while engaging modern challenges (open theism, Federal Vision, EFS).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Scripture plus Reformed authorities (Calvinic tradition, systematicians) and contemporary evangelical debates.
 - Interacts with proponents of open theism, advocates of Federal Vision and those proposing eternal functional subordination, as well as discussions about sanctification and spiritual gifts.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology**: lordship, incarnation, kingly and priestly roles.
 - **Theology Proper**: divine sovereignty, action, condescension.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit's role in union with Christ and sanctification.
 - **Doctrine of Sin**: total depravity, origin and persistence of sin, moral inability.
 - **Bibliology**: authority and self-attestation of Scripture.
 - **Soteriology/Covenant**: federal headship and implications for justification and sanctification.

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers Christian theology and life on the comprehensive, unifying reality of Christ's lordship: true devotion is service shaped by union with the sovereign Redeemer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats lordship as an integrative principle that resists compartmentalizing faith and life; Christ's rule is both cosmic and intimately personal.
 - Strong stress on **union with Christ** as the immediate ground for obedient service rather than mere moralism or duty.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters both lax antinomian tendencies and legalistic "lordship salvation" caricatures by rooting obedience in covenantal union and grace.
 - Challenges open-theist attempts to limit divine sovereignty by affirming divine condescension without relinquishing providential rule.
 - Critiques Federal Vision and similar trends where covenantal language risks collapsing justification into covenantal standing without preserving forensic justification by faith.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of "kingly rule" language to ordinary vocations (work, family, politics) as spheres of Christ's lordship.
 - Nuanced framing of **sovereignty + servanthood** as complementary, not opposed, aspects of Christ's activity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in Reformed circles as aCompact, pastoral-theological treatment that bridges academy and church.
 - Frequently cited in discussions about how doctrine informs discipleship, and in critiques of contemporary theological errors that affect practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model for integrating rigorous Christology with ethical formation and ecclesial practice; useful for preaching, counseling, and curriculum design.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lordship of Christ**
 - Central category: Christ rules all and demands wholehearted service; anchors obedience in union not coercion.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological-relational ground for sanctification and vocation; union secures justification and motivates obedience.
- **Sovereignty**
 - God's providential rule affirmed robustly; sovereignty permeates every sphere of life.
- **Servanthood / Incarnational Rule**
 - Christ's kingly power expressed in humility and service; models redeemed human activity.
- **Total depravity / Total inability**
 - Human moral inability emphasized to show need for sovereign grace enabling genuine submission to Christ.
- **Spiritual gifts and sanctification**
 - Gifts are exercises under Christ's rule for building the body; sanctification is cooperative but grounded in divine initiative.
- **Divine condescension / Open theism**
 - Affirms God's self-limiting condescension in the incarnation while rejecting open-theist reductions of God's sovereignty.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture**
 - Scripture functions as authoritative and self-authenticating measure for discerning Christ's lordship.
- **Federal headship**
 - Christ as covenant representative; implications for corporate and individual righteousness.
- **Justification by faith (response to Federal Vision)**
 - Defends forensic justification while integrating covenantal language of union and imputation.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**
 - Engages debates by protecting persons' equality in divinity while allowing relational order without subordinationism.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit & union)**
 - Spirit mediates union and applies Christ's lordship to believers.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a comprehensive doctrine of Christ's lordship connecting Christology to ethics.
- As a **polemic** against theological errors (open theism, Federal Vision, simplistic EFS claims) that distort practical obedience.
- As an **exegetical-model** linking New Testament texts on Christ's kingship to concrete pastoral applications (worship, vocation, gifts).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula seeking to integrate systematic theology with spiritual formation and church practice.
