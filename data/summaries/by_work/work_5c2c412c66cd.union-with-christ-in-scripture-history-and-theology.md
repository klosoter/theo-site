### TITLE
**Union with Christ: In Scripture, History, and Theology** - Robert Letham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century Reformed retrieval and ecumenical engagement; responds to renewed interest in union with Christ as the center of soteriology and to debates on ordo salutis, justification, and theosis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Union with the incarnate, crucified, risen, and ascended Christ is the encompassing reality of salvation, Spirit-wrought and ecclesially mediated, grounding both forensic and transformative benefits without collapsing them.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Scripture:** OT-NT trajectory of participation and covenant presence fulfilled in Christ; Pauline in Christ idiom as controlling soteriological category; Johannine mutual indwelling.
 - **History:** Patristic foundations (Irenaeus recapitulation; Athanasius and Cyril on incarnation and deification); medieval developments; Reformation crystallization (Calvin, duplex gratia); Reformed orthodox precision (imputation, mystical union); modern discussions (Barth, Torrance; Eastern Orthodox theosis).
 - **Dogmatics:** Christology drives soteriology; the Spirit unites to the person of the Son; union structures justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification; sacraments as real means of union; church as visible and invisible communion in Christ.
 - **Pastoral-ecclesial:** Faith as Spirit-given instrument; assurance located in Christ; worship and holiness as participation in his life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine, the Cappadocians, Athanasius, Cyril; Aquinas; Luther and Calvin; Turretin, Owen, Edwards; modern voices including Barth and T. F. Torrance; Eastern Orthodox (Palamas and energies); within Reformed, dialogue with Gaffin and Murray; contrasts with Osiander, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian schemes, and reductionist accounts of justification.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity and procession; eternal Sonship and incarnation; original sin and imputation; Christology (anhypostasia/enhypostasia; communicatio idiomatum); ordo salutis; justification and sanctification; active and passive obedience; church and sacraments; freedom and grace.
- **Closing line:** Theologically and pastorally, the believer lives from union with the living Christ by the Spirit, in the church, receiving every saving benefit in him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Union as architectonic principle:** Not one benefit among many but the matrix in which all benefits are received.
 - **Spirit-wrought, Christ-centered, ecclesially mediated union:** Personal union with the Son by the Spirit, nourished through Word and sacraments.
 - **Reformed retrieval of theosis:** Participation language affirmed while safeguarding Creator-creature distinction and forensic justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Pushes back against a fragmented ordo salutis and purely legal paradigms; resists Osiandrian essentialist righteousness and any sacramentalism ex opere operato.
 - Opposes Pelagian and semi-Pelagian accounts of sin and free will; reasserts Augustinian bondage of the will and federal headship.
 - Nuances Eastern energies talk and Western filioque to clarify the Spirit as the bond of union with the Son.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframing duplex gratia within a broader participation schema; careful deployment of anhypostasia/enhypostasia to ground union in the incarnation.
 - Clarifies relation of historia salutis to ordo salutis: the accomplished work of Christ structures the applied order.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries as a bridge text between exegesis, historical theology, and dogmatics; constructive ecumenical interlocutor with Eastern Orthodox accounts of deification.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a coherent map linking Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and pneumatology; a reliable counter to both moralism and antinomianism in teaching and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** The Spirit-created bond by which believers participate in the person and work of the incarnate Son; encompassing relation in which every saving benefit is received.
- **Spirit and union:** The Holy Spirit as the bond of union, uniting to the risen Christ; guards against reducing union to psychology or bare forensic decree.
- **Eternal Sonship and incarnation:** The Son, eternally begotten, assumes a human nature (anhypostatic/enhypostatic) so that what is not assumed is not healed; grounds real participation.
- **Ordo salutis vs. historia salutis:** The applied order derives from the once-for-all accomplishment in Christ; union reorders the sequence around the person of Christ.
- **Duplex gratia:** Justification and sanctification given together in Christ, distinct yet inseparable within union.
- **Imputation:** The reckoning of Adams guilt and Christs righteousness; upheld within union to avoid legal fiction and essentialist confusion.
- **Original sin:** Adamic solidarity and corruption; explained via federal headship and nature-person distinction, informing need for Spirit-wrought union.
- **Christs active and passive obedience:** Whole-life obedience including cross, imputed to believers in union; secures both pardon and positive righteousness.
- **Visible and invisible church distinction:** Union has both outward, sacramental-ecclesial shape and inward, Spirit-given reality; prevents ecclesial reductionism.
- **Sacramental realism:** Baptism and the Supper as true means of grace, effectual by the Spirit through faith, uniting and nourishing in Christ.
- **Theosis or deification:** Participation in Gods life by grace in Christ through the Spirit; affirmed without collapsing Creator and creature or denying forensic grace.
- **Sin and free will:** Augustinian account of bondage of the will; grace precedes and enables faith as the instrument of union.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Proper predication across the natures in the one person; undergirds talk of participation without confusion of natures.
- **Participation:** Sharing in Christs benefits and life; coordinated with covenant and imputation, not opposed to them.
- **How this work is used:**
 - **Definition source:** Standard reference for defining union with Christ and duplex gratia.
 - **Conceptual pivot:** Integrates Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology; reorients ordo salutis discussions.
 - **Polemic aid:** Critiques Pelagianism, Osiandrianism, and reductionist sacramentalism.
 - **Exegetical model:** Biblico-theological tracing of union across Scripture for preaching and teaching.
