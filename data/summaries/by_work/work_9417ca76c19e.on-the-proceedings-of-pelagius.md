### TITLE
On the Proceedings of Pelagius - Augustine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 5th century North Africa; the controversy follows Pelagius' arrival in Rome and the subsequent spread of his teachings (c. 410s-420s).
 - Part of Augustine's extended anti-Pelagian corpus written amid diocesan, synodal, and imperial adjudications (Council of Carthage 418 as proximate context).
 - Milieu: intense competition between Roman ascetic moralism and African Augustinian theology over sin, grace, and moral effort.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Pelagius' proceedings reveal a systematic denial of the necessity of prevenient and efficacious grace; Augustine argues that human nature is wounded by original sin such that divine grace is both necessary and decisive for beginning, continuing, and completing salvation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose Pelagius: present Pelagius' claims about free will, human ability, and merit; show logical consequences for baptism, infant salvation, and moral responsibility.
 - Scriptural proof-texting: sustained appeal to Pauline letters (esp. Romans and Ephesians) to demonstrate corruption of human will and the primacy of grace.
 - Tradition and council: appeal to ecclesial practice (infant baptism) and patristic consensus against Pelagian implications.
 - Practical pastoral consequences: show how Pelagianism undermines pastoral care, fosters presumption or despair, and distorts the gospel of Christ.
 - Concluding claim: salvation is grounded in God's gratuitous initiative (prevenient and efficacious grace), not merely in unaided human effort.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary antagonist: Pelagius; allied or associated figures include Caelestius and Julian of Eclanum.
 - Secondary interlocutors: Roman ascetics; contemporary African clergy; recourse to Pauline exegesis and earlier Fathers.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Original sin** (transmission and consequences)
 - **Grace** (necessity, prevenience, efficacy)
 - **Free will** (scope, woundedness, co-operation with grace)
 - **Baptism and infant salvation**
 - **Merit and justification**
 - (Less emphasis on Trinity/Christology except as grounds for soteriology)

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers the sovereignty and necessity of divine grace: human will is real but incapacitated by sin; only God's gratuitous, effectual gift can secure healing, baptismal inclusion, and final perseverance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong language for the depth of corruption in human nature and the **necessity of prevenient and efficacious grace** for even the first movement toward God.
 - Vivid pastoral framing: sin as communal and inherited, not merely individual bad choices.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Pelagius' optimism about unaided human ability and moral sufficiency.
 - Distinguishes Augustinian view from simple determinism: Augustine preserves responsibility and a role for will while insisting on prior divine initiation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the categories of **prevenient grace** and **efficacious grace** as doctrinal pivots against moralistic Pelagianism.
 - Refined distinction between nature as created good and nature as wounded (so that grace heals rather than supplants nature).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central source for later Western theology's articulation of original sin and grace; primary warrant for medieval, Protestant (notably Reformed), and later Catholic formulations against Pelagian tendencies.
 - Played into later controversies - e.g., Semi-Pelagian debates and the Council of Orange (529) which both drew on and moderated Augustine's emphases.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of combining exegesis, pastoral concern, and doctrinal argument; essential reading for understanding Western doctrine of sin and grace and for teaching anti-Pelagian polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism**
 - Denial that original sin incapacitates the will; stress on human ability and moral example.
- **Semi-Pelagianism**
 - Mediating position: asserts a human initiative toward God later assisted by grace; Augustine's work helps define and criticize this as insufficient.
- **Augustinianism**
 - Emphasis on original sin, prevenient/effectual grace, and divine initiative in salvation.
- **Original sin (peccatum originale)**
 - Inherited moral corruption and privation of right will; not merely imitation but a transmissible condition.
- **Prevenient grace (gratia praeveniens)**
 - Grace that precedes and enables any movement toward God; necessary to begin conversion.
- **Efficacious grace (gratia efficax)**
 - Grace that effectively accomplishes what it intends - genuine conversion and sanctification.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)**
 - Affirmed but seen as wounded; true freedom restored only through grace.
- **Concupiscence**
 - Disordered desire; Augustine treats it as symptom and effect of original sin.
- **Merit**
 - Human 'merit' is reinterpreted: works are fruits of grace, not grounds for justification.
- **Baptism (infant baptism)**
 - Defence of infant baptism as remedy and sign for inherited sin and inclusion in covenant.
- **Predestination (praedestinatio)**
 - Asserted cautiously as divine election grounded in grace, though later development in Augustine's corpus intensifies this theme.
- **Cooperation (cooperatio)**
 - Human response is real but enabled by grace; rejects unaided cooperation as sufficient.
- **Grace and nature distinction**
 - Grace does not destroy nature but heals and perfects it; central corrective to Pelagian naturalism.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for identifying and diagnosing Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian errors.
 - As a **polemic model**: exemplar of combining scriptural, pastoral, and ecclesial argumentation against moralistic theologies.
 - As an **exegetical model**: template for Pauline exegesis on sin and grace that informs subsequent doctrinal loci (sin, grace, conversion).
