### TITLE
Francis Turretin on Church Government: Offices, Presbyterian Polity, and Discipline (notes framed by Willem van Asselt, ed., Reformation and Scholasticism)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑17th century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687), professor at the Genevan Academy; principal theological work: Institutio Theologiae Elencticae (Latin). Context: post‑Dort, anti‑Arminian, rising Erastian and Independency controversies, and the need to systematize ecclesiology for confessional Reformed churches.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church is a visible, covenantal society instituted by Christ, governed by divinely ordained offices and discipline; legitimate polity is presbyterial‑synodal, neither Erastian subordination to the civil magistrate nor congregational independence.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and marks of the true church (Word, sacraments, discipline).
 - Distinction between visible and invisible church; particular congregations as local instances of the one catholic church.
 - Offices: justification for pastors/teachers, elders/presbyters, deacons; scriptural warrant and functions.
 - Jurisdiction and keys: ministers and elders exercise spiritual authority (binding/loosing) in doctrine, sacraments, and discipline.
 - Discipline: principles, procedures, and aims (repentance, purity, witness), including excommunication and restoration.
 - Relation to civil magistrate: cooperation but clear limits-magistrate protects external order and supports religion, but cannot usurp ecclesiastical jurisdiction in spiritual matters.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural texts and Reformed confessions (Genevan, Belgic, Westminster paradigm). Dialogues with Calvinist predecessors (Calvin, Beza), contemporary scholastics, and polemical opponents: Erastians, Independents/Congregationalists, Roman Catholics, Socinians/Arminians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (marks, visible/invisible church), ministry and offices, sacraments as means of grace administered by officeholders, discipline and keys, church‑magistrate relations, covenantal identity of the congregation.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's ecclesiology insists that Scripture and covenant order prescribe a presbyterial polity exercised through rightly constituted offices and firm yet pastoral discipline, guarding the church's spiritual integrity against both state encroachment and sectarian atomism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic, scholastic articulation of polity: precise definitions of office functions and juridical powers (binding/loosing, right to administer sacraments, adjudicate doctrine and morals).
 - Strong covenantal framing: the church as covenant community shaped by the promises and obligations of redemption.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Erastian tendencies by insisting on ecclesial jurisdiction in spiritual matters; corrects Independency by arguing for synodal accountability and intercongregational oversight.
 - Distinguishes from Roman hierarchicalism by rejecting papal supremacy and sacramental magisterium; distinguishes from sectarian voluntarism by rooting polity in Christ's ordination and Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Technical deployment of classical scholastic categories (potestas, jurisdictio, munus) to clarify church offices and coercive discipline without collapsing into secular juridicalism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in later Reformed confessional circles, notably in Dutch and Anglo‑American academies (including Princeton); used as a standard statement of orthodox Reformed polity throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, defensible model of Reformed polity that balances pastoral care, doctrinal fidelity, and institutional order-important for historical theology, ecclesiology, and confessional churches today.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible church**
 - The concrete, organized body with marks (Word, sacraments, discipline) where offices function publicly.
- **Invisible church**
 - The elect known perfectly only to God; grounds distinctions in membership and sacramental efficacy.
- **Office (munus)**
 - Divinely instituted roles (minister, elder, deacon) with specific duties and authorities.
- **Minister of the Word**
 - Primary preacher/teacher with charge of doctrine, sacraments, and pastoral oversight.
- **Elder / Presbyter**
 - Governance and disciplinary officers acting collegially with ministers; guardians of order and doctrine.
- **Deacon**
 - Officer for temporal care and mercy, distinct from spiritual jurisdiction.
- **Keys (binding and loosing)**
 - Authority to admit/deny sacraments, to remit or retain sins (discipline/excommunication) exercised by ministers and elders.
- **Discipline / Excommunication**
 - Corrective process aimed at repentance and purity; includes admonition, suspension, and, if necessary, exclusion from sacramental fellowship.
- **Presbyterial‑synodal polity**
 - System of local elders and intercongregational assemblies (consistories, classes, synods) for mutual oversight.
- **Potestas ecclesiastica vs. civil potestas**
 - Distinct spheres: ecclesiastical power governs spiritual matters; civil magistrate upholds external order and can support the church but must not exercise spiritual adjudication.
- **Marks of the church**
 - Presence of the pure preaching of the Word, right administration of sacraments, and exercise of discipline.
- **Covenant**
 - The theological matrix for church membership and communal obligations; shapes polity and sacramental practice.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed Presbyterian polity and offices.
 - As polemic against Erastianism and Independency and as an exegetical‑procedural model for pastoral discipline and sacramental administration.
