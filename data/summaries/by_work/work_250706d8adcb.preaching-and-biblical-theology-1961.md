### TITLE
**Preaching and Biblical Theology (1961) - Edmund P. Clowney**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1960s Reformed-evangelical recovery of redemptive-historical exegesis amid the Biblical Theology Movement and challenges from historical criticism, neo-orthodoxy, and moralistic homiletics. Westminster Seminary milieu, downstream of Vos and interacting with European Heilsgeschichte.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can Christian preaching be truly biblical and truly Christian? Clowney argues that preaching must proclaim Christ from all Scripture by tracing the canonical, redemptive-historical movement of promise and fulfillment, so that the church receives Christ through the means of grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Biblical theology defined:** Organizes Scripture by history of revelation and covenant epochs, not topical loci; it uncovers the organic unity of promise-fulfillment culminating in Christ.
 - **From text to Christ to church:** Sound preaching moves from the text in its redemptive horizon, to its typological and promissory trajectory fulfilled in Christ, to application in the church under the Spirit.
 - **Typology, not allegory:** Legitimate correspondences arise from God-ordained patterns (exodus, temple, kingdom, Davidic son), confirmed and controlled by the canon.
 - **Church and kingdom:** The church manifests the reign of Christ as firstfruits of the eschatological kingdom, gathered by the Word and sacraments for witness.
 - **Means of grace:** Preaching is primary; sacraments seal the same gospel; prayer expresses dependence as the church participates in the mission of the kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Geerhardus Vos, Herman Ridderbos, Oscar Cullmann; in contrast with Bultmann and demythologizing, and with moralistic or exemplarist homiletics. Engages Calvin and classic Reformed confessions on Word and sacrament.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and canon; covenant and kingdom; Christology (Christ in OT and NT; offices of Christ); ecclesiology (one, holy, catholic, apostolic; marks of the church); sacramentology; homiletics as means of grace.
- **Closing line:** Preaching that is biblically theological proclaims the once-for-all saving acts of God fulfilled in Christ and presses them into the churchs life by the Spirit, so that the people of God live as the apostolic, catholic community of the kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Christ-from-all-Scripture by a disciplined, canonical typology rooted in covenant history.
 - The sermon as an eschatological event where Christ addresses and forms his church.
 - Tight integration of ecclesiology and homiletics: marks of the church arise from Christocentric proclamation.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against moralism and exemplarism: refuses to reduce OT sermons to virtues or heroes.
 - Against allegory: demands canonical grounding and typological warrant.
 - Against atomistic criticism or kerygma severed from history: anchors proclamation in the actual history of revelation.
 - Against proof-texting systematic theology: insists on epochal development and redemptive context.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Redemptive-historical trajectory from text to Christ to church.
 - Distinction and coordination of biblical and systematic theology for preaching.
 - Ecclesial reception of the Word as means of grace within the kingdom mission.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for Reformed and evangelical homiletics; formative for Greidanus, Goldsworthy, Dennis Johnson, and later pastor-theologians.
 - Shaped Westminster Seminary pedagogy; influenced broader evangelical interest in Christ-centered preaching.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A clear, practicable model for preaching Christ in both Testaments.
 - A stable guide for relating church and kingdom and for articulating the marks and means of grace.
 - A canonical check on typology that avoids fanciful allegory.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology:** The discipline tracing the progressive history of revelation; organizes Scripture by covenantal epochs and divine acts.
- **Redemptive-historical:** Method that reads texts in their place within Gods unfolding plan, climaxing in Christ.
- **Promise-fulfillment:** Canonical pattern whereby OT promises, types, and offices reach realization in Jesus.
- **Typology:** God-ordained correspondences (persons, events, institutions) that prefigure Christ and his benefits; controlled by canonical warrant.
- **Allegory (rejected):** Imposed symbolic readings lacking historical-canonical grounding.
- **History of revelation:** The sequence of divine words and deeds by which God makes himself known, recorded in Scripture.
- **Covenant:** Structural backbone of biblical history (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, new covenant) organizing promises and obligations.
- **Kingdom of God:** The reign of God manifested climactically in Christ; the church is its firstfruits and embassy.
- **Church - one, holy, catholic, apostolic:** Unity, sanctity, worldwide scope, and continuity with apostolic Word grounded in Christs work.
- **Marks of the church:** Pure preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and discipline; rooted in apostolic pattern.
- **Means of grace:** Ordained instruments (Word, sacraments, prayer) by which Christ communicates himself to his people.
- **Christocentric preaching:** Proclamation that moves from text to Christ and then to the churchs faith and obedience.
- **Canonical context:** Reading a passage within the whole-Bible unity to discern its role in redemptive history.
- **Apostolic kerygma and didache:** Proclamation and teaching mutually informing preaching that both announces and instructs.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Ecclesiology:** Frames the nature and marks of the church and clarifies church-kingdom relations.
 - **Sacramentology and means of grace:** Grounds the primacy of preaching and the sealing role of sacraments.
 - **Christology and Scripture unity:** Provides a model for Christ in OT and NT via typology and fulfillment.
 - **Covenant theology:** Supplies the redemptive-historical scaffold for doctrinal integration and preaching practice.
