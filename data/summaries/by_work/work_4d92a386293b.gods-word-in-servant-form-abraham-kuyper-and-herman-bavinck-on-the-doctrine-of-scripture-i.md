### TITLE
God's Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture (essay by Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in The Trustworthiness of God)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-19th / early-20th-century Dutch Reformed recovery: Kuyper and Bavinck writing amid modernist criticism, rising historical-critical scholarship, and cultural-political engagement. Gaffin's essay is a late-20th/early-21st scholarly retrieval that reads both theologians against modern caricatures and within Reformed confessional commitments.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Both Kuyper and Bavinck articulate a Reformed doctrine of Scripture that treats the biblical Word as divinely authoritative while expressed in genuine human, historical, and creaturely forms - an **incarnational accommodation** of revelation; Gaffin argues this converges with a robust claim for Scripture's trustworthiness (self-attestation, inerrancy in intended meaning) and offers resources for contemporary debates (authority vs. critical method; science and Genesis 1-11).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of the *incarnational analogy*: Scripture as "servant-form" of divine self-revelation (parallel to the Word made flesh).
 - Comparison of Kuyper and Bavinck on key loci: inspiration/inerrancy, canon/tradition, theological method (theology as a science with principia), and the self-attesting character of Scripture.
 - Application to contested issues: accommodation and language, relation of theology to empirical science (Genesis 1-11), and confessional formulations of covenant and authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck; interpreters: Kuyperian and Bavinckian postures, Reformed confessions (Belgic Confession, Canons of Dort), and Gaffin as contemporary interpreter.
 - Implicit interlocutors: liberal Protestant criticism, higher criticism, and modern scientific claims about origins.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration; Scripture's authority and self-attestation; canon and tradition; covenant theology; theological method (theology as a systematic science); relation of Scripture to science (esp. Genesis 1-11); anthropology/creation insofar as affected by biblical teaching.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The gospel-language that binds God to creatures is both incarnational and covenantal: Scripture, as servant-form of the Word, is historically mediated yet authoritatively self-attesting - a Reformed balance of divine initiative and creaturely expression that undergirds trustworthiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates the **incarnational analogy**: Scripture's human forms are not signs of divine deficiency but the means by which God condescends to address sinners - a positive account of accommodation.
 - Affirms **self-attestation** while avoiding sola-internalism: the Spirit's witness validates Scripture within the church's life, not as a purely subjective warrant.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against portrayals of Kuyper as liberal or merely cultural-political; shows Kuyper's theological seriousness on bibliology.
 - Notes Bavinck's systematic nuance: more cautious epistemology and fuller development of tradition/canon than some popular summaries allow.
- **Conceptual/terminological contributions**
 - "Servant-form" as heuristic for thinking of Scripture analogous to Christ's servant-identity - helps mediate debates over literalism, accommodation, and historical contingency.
 - Recasts "theology as science" (principia) language to defend disciplined, principled theological method that counts Scripture as foundational principle.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful corrective in Reformed circles that oscillate between fideism and naïve literalism. Influential among conservative exegetes and confessional theologians who want to uphold inerrancy while admitting historical expression.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to hold *authority + historical mediation*; supplies a conceptual toolkit for engaging science (Genesis debates), doctrinal formulation, and confessional teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnational analogy / servant-form**
 - Scripture as God's condescension: divine Word clothed in human language and history.
- **Accommodation**
 - God accommodates revelation to finite minds; Gaffin shows Kuyper/Bavinck treat this positively, not as compromise.
- **Self-attestation**
 - Scripture internally authenticates itself by the Spirit's witness in the covenant community; not purely subjectivist.
- **Plenary inspiration / inerrancy**
 - Affirmed in principle: Scripture truthful in what it intends to affirm; historical modes of expression acknowledged.
- **Canon and tradition**
 - Canon as normative; tradition as interpretive matrix that preserves self-attestation and guards the church's reading.
- **Theological method (principia; theology as science)**
 - Theology disciplined by principles; Scripture functions as foundational principium without reducing theology to mere epistemology.
- **Covenant confessionalism**
 - Use of Reformed confessions to articulate and guard Scripture doctrine; links bibliology to covenantal identity.
- **Relation to science (Genesis 1-11)**
 - Methodologically cautious: recognizes distinct spheres (science vs. theological meaning) while insisting Scripture governs theological claims about origins.
- **Nature and task of theology**
 - Theology as orderly systematic reflection grounded in revelation and servant-shaped language.
- **Anthropology & creation**
 - Scripture's account of human origin and fall read as theological essentials, shaped by incarnational accommodation.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies Reformed doctrine of Scripture (bibliology) and self-attestation.
 - Polemic: deployed against both liberal critical diminishment and naive literalism that ignores accommodation.
 - Exegetical model: guides constructive engagement with Genesis 1-11 and science-Scripture relations.
 - Conceptual pivot: frames accommodation/incarnational analogy as the central heuristic for contemporary bibliology.
