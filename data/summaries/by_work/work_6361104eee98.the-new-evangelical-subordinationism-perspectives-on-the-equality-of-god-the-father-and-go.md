### TITLE
"The New Evangelical Subordinationism? Perspectives on the Equality of God the Father and God the Son" (chapter in One God in Three Persons, 2015) - Bruce A. Ware

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2010s Trinitarian controversy within evangelicalism over whether alleged "eternal functional subordination" (EFS) of the Son implies doctrinal subordinationism.
 - Part of a collected volume engaging recent debates about equality and order within the Godhead; addresses both academic and church-pastoral audiences, especially those concerned with implications for gender roles (complementarian debates).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ware maintains that **ontological equality** (same divine essence) of Father and Son is preserved while affirming an **eternal, ordered functional relationship** in authority and submission within the Trinity. He argues this is not the old heretical subordinationism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies terminological distinctions: ontological (being), economic (works), and relational/functional (authority-ordering) aspects of Trinitarian life.
 - Scriptural exegesis: engages texts used in the debate (e.g., John 14:28; 1 Corinthians 15:24-28; passages describing Father sending the Son) to argue for a real, personal ordering of authority that is not inferiority of nature.
 - Historical-theological defense: contends that historic creedal orthodoxy allows for relational ordering (e.g., eternal generation) without ontological inequality; rejects conflation of relation-of-origin with ontological subordination.
 - Polemical move: responds to critics who label EFS as "new subordinationism," insisting that careful conceptual distinctions remove the charge of heresy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary evangelical proponents and critics of EFS (implicit interlocutors include Wayne Grudem and those who have accused EFS proponents of reintroducing subordinationism).
 - Appeals to Scripture, patristic and creedal language, and systematic-theological categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), Christology (relation of Son to Father), revelation (Scriptural witness to intra-Trinitarian relations), and implications for ecclesial practice (e.g., complementarian discussions).
- **Closing line**
 - Ware's theological center: **ontological equality plus eternal relational ordering** - a preservation of Nicene orthodoxy while affirming an eternal pattern of authority/submission within the Godhead.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on sharp conceptual distinction between **essence** (what God is) and **authority-order** (how persons relate), with the latter being eternal and not a functional consequence of creation or incarnation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against critics who treat any language of submission as covert ontological subordination; conversely critiqued by others who hold that any eternal submission language risks altering divine equality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes the phraseology distinguishing **ontological subordination** (heresy) from **eternal functional subordination** (defensible, Ware argues) and insists on consistent use of those categories in debate.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative evangelical and complementarian circles as a theological justification for linking intra-Trinitarian order to male-female role distinctions.
 - Provoked sustained critique from those who claim the model undermines classical accounts of perichoresis and divine simplicity; stimulated further scholarly responses defending classical equality and rejecting EFS.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for illustrating how fine-grained conceptual distinctions function in contemporary Trinitarian polemics; useful as a clear statement of the EFS-friendly position and for teaching the stakes of intra-Trinitarian language in church life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**: The claim that the Son eternally submits in role/authority to the Father while remaining equal in essence.
- **Ontological Equality**: Equality of being and attributes among Father, Son, and Spirit (Ware insists this is non-negotiable).
- **Ontological Subordination**: Inferiority of nature or being - Ware denies this of the Son and labels it heretical.
- **Relational Order / Authority-Submission**: The eternal ordering of persons within the Trinity that governs personal relations without affecting essence.
- **Immanent Trinity**: God's inner life and relations apart from creation - the locus Ware affirms as containing eternal relational ordering.
- **Economic Trinity**: God's actions in history (sending, redeeming) - Ware argues economic roles reflect but do not create eternal relations.
- **Relations of Origin (e.g., eternal generation)**: Traditional language Ware uses to hold in tension order and unity without ontological inferiority.
- **Perichoresis**: Mutual indwelling of persons - Ware maintains perichoresis is compatible with ordered relations.
- **Creedal Nicene Orthodoxy**: Standard of doctrinal fidelity Ware appeals to; used to argue that EFS need not breach creeds.
- **Scriptural loci cited**: Passages invoking sending, obedience, and authority (e.g., John, Paul) used to ground relational claims.
- **Complementarian application**: Ware's theological move is often mapped onto male-female role discussions in church and home.
- **Polemic target**: The chapter functions primarily against charges that contemporary EFS proponents are reviving classical subordinationism.
- **Methodological marker**: Combines exegesis, doctrinal history, and systematic distinctions as the argumentative method.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for proponents of EFS to distinguish **functional** from **ontological** subordination.
- As a polemical resource in debates over Trinitarian language informing gender-role theology (complementarian vs egalitarian).
- As an exegetical-model exemplar showing how texts about sending and submission are read into intra-Trinitarian relations.
