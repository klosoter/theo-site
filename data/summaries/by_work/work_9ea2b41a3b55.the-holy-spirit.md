### TITLE
**The Holy Spirit** - Sinclair B. Ferguson (Contours of Christian Theology, 1996)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical and Reformed retrieval of classical pneumatology amid charismatic renewal, cessationist-continuationist debates, and renewed Trinitarian theology. Written to redress neglect of the Spirit in systematics with biblical-theological depth and pastoral clarity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Holy Spirit is the personal, divine agent who executes the triune God's purposes in creation and redemption, uniting us to Christ and applying the benefits of his work; Word and Spirit are inseparable; Pentecost ushers in the eschatological age of the Spirit.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Biblical foundations:** OT Spirit as life-giver, presence, and promise; NT fulfillment in Christ and Pentecost; redemptive-historical development.
 - **Trinitarian identity:** Personhood, deity, procession (filioque), and inseparable operations safeguarding unity and distinction.
 - **Christology and the Spirit:** Spirit's role in Christ's conception, anointing, obedience, miracles, death, resurrection, and exaltation; Spirit-gifted Messiah as pattern for believers.
 - **Union with Christ and ordo salutis:** Spirit unites to the risen Christ; regeneration, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance framed within union rather than a merely sequential scheme.
 - **Assurance and sanctification:** Witness of the Spirit, mortification and vivification, fruit of the Spirit; ordinary means of grace.
 - **Church, sacraments, and gifts:** Church as temple; baptism and the Lord's Supper as Spirit-used means; gifts ordered by love and edification; critique of second-blessing theology.
 - **Mission, guidance, and eschatology:** Empowerment for witness; illumination and providential guidance; Spirit as arrabon and aparche of the new creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture; patristics (Cappadocians, Augustine); Reformers and Reformed orthodox (Calvin, Owen); later Reformed (Kuyper, Warfield); engagement with Pentecostal/charismatic theology, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox emphases.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration; creation and providence; Trinity; Christology; covenant and redemption accomplished/applied; ecclesiology and sacraments; sanctification and assurance; eschatology.
- **Closing line:** The Spirit is the eschatological gift who makes Christ present to his people, forming a Word-shaped, Christ-conforming communion for the glory of the Father.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Christ-centered pneumatology: the Spirit's ministry is to glorify Christ and conform believers to him.
 - Union-with-Christ as the integrating center of the Spirit's work.
 - Word-and-Spirit coinherence in revelation, conversion, and sanctification.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Rejects impersonal views of the Spirit; insists on robust personhood and deity.
 - Critiques second-blessing/Spirit-baptism-as-post-conversion schemas; identifies Spirit-baptism with initiation into Christ.
 - Counters pneumatic individualism with ecclesial and sacramental horizons; prioritizes fruit over conspicuous gifts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Renewed use of inseparable operations to frame Trinitarian action.
 - Eschatological lens: Spirit as arrabon and firstfruits structuring Christian life.
 - Recasting ordo salutis within union rather than a mechanistic sequence.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a standard modern pneumatology.
 - Frequently cited for balanced engagement with charismata and for retrieving Owen within contemporary idiom.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Bridges exegesis, dogmatics, and pastoral theology.
 - Offers a stable framework for Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology grounded in the Spirit's personal agency.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Personhood of the Spirit:** The Spirit acts, wills, speaks; not a mere force.
- **Deity of the Spirit:** Full consubstantiality; worship and doxology appropriate.
- **Procession and filioque:** From the Father through/and the Son; safeguards Christ's mediatorial agency while honoring the Father's monarchy.
- **Inseparable operations:** The triune persons act outwardly as one; personal properties shape modes of action.
- **Economy/immanent Trinity:** Economic missions reveal, without collapsing into, eternal relations.
- **Union with Christ:** The Spirit as bond of union; nexus of all saving benefits.
- **Baptism in/with the Spirit:** Conversion-initiation into Christ and his body, not a second tier.
- **Regeneration and effectual calling:** New birth and call wrought by the Spirit through the Word.
- **Adoption and witness of the Spirit:** Testifies with our spirit, producing assurance and filial freedom.
- **Sanctification (mortification/vivification):** Spirit-empowered dying to sin and living to righteousness in conformity to Christ.
- **Fruit vs. gifts:** Character (Gal 5) prioritized as the telos; gifts serve love and edification.

- **Illumination:** The Spirit enables right understanding and reception of Scripture.
- **Church as temple:** Indwelling Spirit constitutes the church's life and holiness.
