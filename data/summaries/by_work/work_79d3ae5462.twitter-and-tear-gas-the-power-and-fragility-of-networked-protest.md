### TITLE
Twitter And Tear Gas: The Power And Fragility Of Networked Protest - Zeynep Tufekci

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2017 amid post-Arab Spring reflections and rising global protest waves (Gezi, Tahrir, Occupy, Ferguson/Black Lives Matter, Hong Kong, Turkey).
 - Context: rapid diffusion of social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook), expanding surveillance and algorithmic governance, and scholarly debate over whether social media democratizes dissent.
- **Central thesis**
 - Digital networks create unprecedented **power** for rapid mobilization and visibility, but they also introduce **fragility**: movements organized through networked, connective practices often lack the durable organizational capacity required to convert moments of outrage into lasting political change.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic chapters: document how platforms lower coordination costs and enable rapid scaling of protests via viral cues, hashtags, live video, and algorithmic amplification.
 - Mechanisms of fragility: explain how networked protest tends toward **loose, decentralized coordination**, which produces tactical advantages but strategic weaknesses (negotiation, sustained action, vulnerability to repression and co-optation).
 - State and platform responses: show how authorities and corporations adapt - from surveillance and internet shutdowns to targeted repression and algorithmic de-amplification.
 - Prescriptive/analytic moves: argue for recognizing the **affordances** of technologies (what platforms make easy or hard), and for developing **organizational capacity** alongside networked tactics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Case studies: Gezi Park, Tahrir/Square movements, Occupy, Ferguson/BLM, Hong Kong protests, others.
 - Interdisciplinary sources: sociology of social movements, technology studies, platform studies, interviews with activists, and empirical event analysis.
 - Implicit interlocutors: tech-optimists (e.g., early "Twitter revolution" narratives), scholars of collective action, state security apparatuses, and platform companies.
- **Doctrines treated (translated into theological vocabulary)**
 - **Authority and power**: who wields visible moral authority in public square and how visibility shapes legitimacy.
 - **Communion vs. covenantal structures**: tensions between episodic connexions (connective ties) and durable commitments (institutional covenantalism).
 - **Prophetic witness**: the role of visibility and testimony in calling public attention; limits when visibility lacks sustained institutional backing.
 - **Ethics of means**: questions about means/end in protest tactics, surveillance, and digital complicity.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The book foregrounds a theological-political paradox: networked visibility can enact a prophetic moment, but without cultivated institutional and covenantal structures, prophetic flashes risk passing without structural change.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on the **affordances** of platforms (what technologies enable or constrain) as determinative for protest form and fate.
 - Clear pairing of **power vs. fragility**: celebrates the immediacy of networked action while diagnosing its structural insufficiencies.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters techno-utopian claims that social media automatically democratizes or sustains revolutions; contests simplistic "Twitter caused X" narratives.
 - Contrasts classical collective action theory that privileges formal organizations as the only route by showing the novel possibilities and limits of connective action.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes ideas like **connective action**, **visibility paradox** (visibility helps mobilize but also exposes activists), and **affordances** applied rigorously to social movements.
 - Emphasizes **scalability vs. strategic capacity** as twin axes for evaluating movement potential.
- **Reception and influence in theology and wider fields**
 - Widely cited across social movement studies, political science, and technology studies; adopted in public theology and practical ecclesiology as a model for thinking about church engagement in digital-era protest.
 - Influenced pastoral praxis regarding social media use, and ethical reflection on solidarity, witness, and institutional resilience.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a compact, empirically grounded primer on how digital platforms reshape civic formation and prophetic action.
 - Useful for courses linking technology and theology, public theology, political ethics, and ecclesial strategy in times of social upheaval.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Networked protest** - protests enabled primarily by digital social networks rather than hierarchical organizations.
- **Connective action** - forms of action coordinated through networks, personalization of content, and weak ties rather than formal membership.
- **Collective action** - traditional organized action requiring durable institutions and commitments; contrasted with connective action.
- **Affordances** - properties of a technology that make certain actions easy and others difficult; central analytic lens.
- **Visibility paradox** - the ambivalent role of public visibility: necessary for mobilization and moral witness, yet exposing movements to surveillance and simplifying complex aims.
- **Fragility** - the tendency of networked protest to dissipate or fail to institutionalize demands.
- **Scalability** - capacity of a movement to grow quickly via network effects; not synonymous with strategic viability.
- **Strategic/organizational capacity** - the deeper abilities to negotiate, sustain, and institutionalize change.
- **Algorithmic amplification** - how platform algorithms elevate certain content, often unpredictably shaping attention.
- **State countermeasures** - tactics like surveillance, shutdowns, disinformation, and targeted repression responding to networked protests.
- **Repertoires of contention** - the set of tactics culturally available to movements; Tufekci charts new digital repertoires.
- **Surveillance and repression** - the flip side of digital visibility; activists become easier targets.
- **Rapid diffusion** - viral spread of protest signals, hashtags, images, and tactics across borders.
- **Tactical improvisation** - on-the-ground adaptive tactics enabled by networks but limited by lack of long-term planning.
- **Platform governance** - corporate policies and algorithms that shape political speech and mobilization.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in public theology and ecclesiology for thinking about digital witness, visibility, and institutional resilience.
 - As a **polemic** against tech-utopianism in political theology and ethics, urging sober attention to structures and power.
 - As an **exegetical model** analogizing prophetic biblical moments (visibility + risk) to modern networked protest dynamics.
