### TITLE
iGods: How Technology Shapes Our Spiritual And Social Lives - Craig Detweiler

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid rapid smartphone adoption, social media expansion, and public debates about privacy, attention economies, and the "app" culture.
 - Interdisciplinary moment: theology meets media studies, film, design theory, and cultural criticism.

- **Central thesis**
 - Contemporary technologies and the corporate systems behind them function like quasi-deities - "iGods" - shaping desires, practices, and communal formation; theology must diagnose these formations and propose spiritual practices and ethical design as corrective.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Technologies and platforms are not neutral tools but embodied liturgies that train attention, shape identity, and instantiate values.
 - Critique: Tech companies and their cultural artifacts often displace worship of God by promising omniscience, omnipresence, efficiency, and communion.
 - Theological response: Recover practices, virtues, and communal habits (e.g., Sabbath, silence, stewardship, embodied community) that reorient humans toward the Creator and human flourishing.
 - Practical engagement: Call to shape design ethics, pastoral practices, and cultural critique that neither uncritically embraces nor simply rejects technology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Media theorists and cultural critics (e.g., Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Sherry Turkle-like concerns), plus contemporary writers on the digital turn.
 - Biblical-theological resources (Augustine and classical notions of idolatry and desire inform the diagnosis).
 - Practitioners from film, design, and ministry - the book leverages Detweiler's background in film and popular culture.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology**: formation of desires, identity under technological mediation.
 - **Sin / Idolatry**: modern idols reframed as platforms, gadgets, and algorithms.
 - **Worship / Liturgy**: technology as a kind of liturgy or formative practice.
 - **Ecclesiology / Spiritual formation**: community practices to resist technological idolatries.
 - **Ethics / Stewardship**: design responsibility and moral formation in technological contexts.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Technology is a rival formative power; Christian theology must recover diagnostic language (idolatry), cultivate counter-liturgies (practices), and engage design ethics to reclaim human flourishing under God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames technology explicitly as liturgy: not merely instrument or infrastructure but formative practice that trains worship.
 - Moves beyond dystopian/utopian binaries to a pastoral, formation-centered engagement.
 - Marries media/design analysis with pastoral theology and spiritual practices.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects techno-utopianism that treats tech as neutral progress; also resists simple Luddite rejection by offering constructive Christian practices and design interventions.
 - Contrasts with purely sociological critiques by keeping theological categories (idolatry, worship, grace) central.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Coining and popularizing the term **"iGods"** to describe tech platforms/companies-as-deities in modern life.
 - Emphasis on **"liturgies of technology"** and **design as moral grammar** - design choices instantiate theological claims about what matters.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Christian higher-education courses on faith and culture, media theology, and digital discipleship.
 - Cited by pastors and theologians seeking a balanced, practice-oriented approach to technology.
 - Influence strongest in practical theology, cultural theology, and media studies within ecclesial contexts rather than systematic theology trenches.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides an accessible, ecumenical framework for diagnosing and responding to technology's spiritual effects.
 - Useful bridge between academic media theory and pastoral practice; durable for teaching spiritual formation in digital age.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **iGods**
 - Technologies/platforms (and their corporate sponsors) that demand allegiance and shape ultimate concerns.
- **Liturgies of technology**
 - Recurrent technological practices that train habituated desires and rituals; function like worship.
- **Design as moral grammar**
 - The idea that design choices embody moral and theological claims about human flourishing.
- **Attention economy**
 - Economic logic that monetizes human attention and thereby competes with spiritual attentiveness and formation.
- **Idolatry (contemporary)**
 - Reinterpreted to include devotion to devices, metrics, algorithms, and convenience rather than traditional idols.
- **Technological formation**
 - The process by which technologies form character, habits, and social relations.
- **Digital Sabbath**
 - Prescriptive practice advocating intentional rest from devices as a formative counter-liturgical act.
- **Mediated presence**
 - Theologically significant distinction between physical, sacramental presence and mediated/virtual presence.
- **Algorithmic authority**
 - Trust placed in algorithmic systems as epistemic or moral guides; rival to theological authority.
- **Embodiment vs. virtuality**
 - Stress on embodied practices and face-to-face community as corrective to purely virtual relationality.
- **Pastoral design**
 - Practical application: churches and ministries shaping technology-use practices and digital spaces intentionally.
- **Flourishing / telos**
 - Human flourishing as normative telos against which technologies are evaluated.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the idea that technology functions as modern idolatry and liturgy.
 - As a **polemic** against both uncritical technological embrace and despairing rejection - offers a middle, practice-based alternative.
 - As a **practical model** in pastoral theology and spiritual formation curricula for shaping digital discipleship and congregational practices.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in cultural theology courses linking media/design studies with doctrinal categories (worship, sin, stewardship).
