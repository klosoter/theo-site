### TITLE
Devoted to God: Blueprints for Sanctification - Sinclair B. Ferguson (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2016 within contemporary Reformed evangelicalism; Ferguson writes from the Westminster/Scottish Reformed tradition with long pastoral and academic ministry (Westminster Seminary, Ligonier).
 - A pastoral-theological response to perceived gaps in modern discipleship literature: seeks to reconnect doctrinal truth with disciplined Christian living.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - True sanctification is the fruit of **union with Christ** effected by the **Holy Spirit**, worked out through concrete means of grace and disciplined spiritual habits; the chief problem addressed is how believers grow in holiness without falling into moralism or introspective uncertainty.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - The book provides "blueprints" - ordered, practical blueprints - for progressive Christian growth, organizing classical Reformed and Puritan insight into usable pastoral strategy.
 - Major moves:
 - Ground sanctification in objective union with Christ and the Spirit's present work.
 - Distinguish sanctification from justification while showing their inseparability in life and assurance.
 - Identify and prescribe means: Word, prayer, sacraments, church discipline, memory and meditation, disciplines of mortification and vivification.
 - Give concrete pastoral counsel for patterns of devotion and community life that sustain holiness over time.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Frequent appeal to Calvin and the Puritans (notably John Owen), classic Reformed architects of union theology, and recent Reformed writers on union with Christ and pneumatology.
 - Engages popular evangelical tendencies toward therapeutic or moralistic discipleship, correcting them with covenantal, covenant-embedded sanctification.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (primary), Union with Christ, Pneumatology (Spirit as agent), Justification (as distinct but inseparable), Covenant theology, Means of grace, Christian perseverance, holiness and practice.

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson stakes sanctification firmly on the nexus of **union with Christ and the Spirit's applying work**, arguing for gospel-centered, disciplined growth rather than moralistic striving.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses architectural metaphor ("blueprints") to map doctrinal truth onto practical routines - making theological structure directly operational for the church.
 - Strong pneumatological priority: Spirit is the primary agent who effects and sustains sanctification within the believer's union with Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects moralistic and therapeutic models that focus on performance or self-improvement; contrasts with pietistic individualism by emphasizing ecclesial means and covenantal context.
 - Reframes Puritan introspection positively: not as anxious self-examination but as Spirit-led mediation on Christ applied by means.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Terminological clarity around "blueprints" as replicable patterns for spiritual formation.
 - Integrates classical terms (mortification/vivification) with contemporary devotional practice language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in Reformed and evangelical pastoral circles for its accessible doctrinal depth and practical orientation.
 - Used by pastors and small-group leaders as a template for discipleship programs; cited in recent pastoral formation curricula.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable bridge between systematic theology (union/pneumatology) and pastoral application, useful both for seminary instruction and congregational discipleship design.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification** - the progressive making holy of the believer; doctrinally rooted and practically pursued.
- **Union with Christ** - the foundational relational reality from which sanctification flows; the decisive theological hinge.
- **Holy Spirit** - the applying agent who unites believers to Christ and effects mortification and vivification.
- **Mortification** - put to death the flesh; active pursuit of dying to sin through Spirit-enabled means.
- **Vivification** - enlivening by the Spirit; growth in grace and Christlike affections.
- **Means of grace** - Word, prayer, sacraments, fellowship, discipline - the ordinary channels through which the Spirit sanctifies.
- **Justification vs sanctification** - maintained distinction: justification is declarative, sanctification is transformative, yet inseparable in the life of faith.
- **Covenant context** - frames sanctification within covenantal promises and obligations, countering individualistic spirituality.
- **Assurance** - grounded not in subjective success but in union with Christ and the Spirit's witness; pastoral counsel for confidence in growth.
- **Perseverance** - promised outcome of Spirit-worked sanctification within covenantal faithfulness.
- **Holiness (habitual)** - emphasis on patterned, habitual practices rather than one-off moral acts.
- **Blueprints** - practical architectures of spiritual disciplines and communal practices to shape holy living.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition and application source** for sanctification in pastoral theology courses and discipleship curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against moralistic or therapeutic models of spiritual growth, re-centering union and Spirit.
 - As an **exegetical-practical model** for reading Pauline union texts and deriving congregational disciplines.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking pneumatology and soteriology for teaching the means and mechanics of spiritual formation.
