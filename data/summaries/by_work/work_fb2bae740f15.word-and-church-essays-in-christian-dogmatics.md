### TITLE
Word and Church: Essays in Christian Dogmatics - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century revival of doctrinal theology within British Anglican and Reformed academic circles. Webster writes against liberal reductionism and technical historicism, drawing substantially on classical sources and Karl Barth while aiming at retrieval for contemporary dogmatics.
 - Collection includes focused essays such as **"Canon and Tradition"** and **"General and Special Revelation,"** which exemplify the book's pairings of historical fidelity and constructive retrieval.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be remade as a discipline ordered by the Word of God: revelation is primarily an event of the Triune God, and the church and Scripture stand in a dialectical, normative relation to that event.
 - Problems addressed: the relation of Scripture to tradition and church authority; the distinction and unity of general and special revelation; the priority of divine initiative against anthropocentric theological methods.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory move: critique of modern reductions (experience, culture, method) that depose the divine Word.
 - Christological pivot: revelation is not primarily a set of propositions but the self-disclosure of God in and through the incarnate Word (and the preaching of that Word).
 - Canon and church:
 - The canon is normative because it mediates the Word-event; tradition is derivative and servant, not equal partner.
 - Ecclesial reception gives the canon traction, but church practice must be disciplined by canonical normativity (see "Canon and Tradition").
 - Revelation thesis:
 - Distinguishes general revelation (God's revelation in creation and conscience) from special revelation (Christ and the canonical proclamation), but insists both are comprehended by the one economy of the Triune God (see "General and Special Revelation").
 - Methodological conclusion: dogmatics must be ordered to worship and proclamation; theological propositions are performed within the church's life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Calvin, Barth centrally; dialogues with Schleiermacher, Bultmann, and modern critical scholarship.
 - Draws on patristic and Reformation resources to correct modern distortions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), Scripture and canon, tradition, ecclesiology, Christology, Trinity, sacraments, and theology-methodology relations.

- **Closing line**
 - Webster centers theology on the Word-event: the Triune God speaks in Christ, Scripture mediates and the church receives - theology's task is faithful articulation of that divine speech.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Theology as *proclamatory* and *doxological* activity rather than primarily propositional or methodological inquiry.
 - A robust doctrine of the Word that unifies incarnation, Scripture, and proclamation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal and experiential theologies by restoring divine initiative and objectivity of revelation.
 - Nuanced appropriation of Barth: affirms Barthian priority of God's action while recovering continuity with classical Trinitarian and sacramental theology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on the **Word-event** (Word as action) and **canonical normativity** (canon as authoritative medium rather than merely historical collection).
 - Recasts tradition as the church's faithful reception rather than a parallel source of normativity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in contemporary Reformed and Anglican theological education for reclaiming doctrinal theology's center.
 - Adopted as a corrective resource in conservative and confessional contexts; criticized by some for perceived conservatism or dense style.

- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies a disciplined framework for integrating Scripture, church, and doctrine; invaluable for courses on revelation, ecclesiology, and dogmatic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word / Word-event** - The decisive self-disclosure of God in Christ, enacted in proclamation; theology's primary referent.
- **Revelation (General)** - God's revelation in creation and conscience; real but subordinate and interpretable only in relation to Christ.
- **Revelation (Special)** - Christ and the canonical proclamation; decisive for salvation and doctrinal normativity.
 - Relation: general revelation is disclosure; special revelation is interpretive fulfillment.
- **Canon** - Scripture as normative medium of the Word; not an abstract rule but the church-received witness to the Word (see "Canon and Tradition").
- **Tradition** - The church's reception and handing on; valuable as mediating practice but judged by canonical witness.
- **Normativity / Canonical normativity** - Idea that the canon governs theology and ecclesial life rather than tradition or social contexts.
- **Proclamation** - The church's act of making present the Word-event; theological speech is an act within this proclamation.
- **Triune God** - The ground of revelation; Webster stresses Trinitarian economy as theological locus.
- **Scripture** - The book-form witness to the Word-event; Scripture's authority derives from its role in mediating revelation.
- **Church** - The community that receives and performs the Word; receives the canon and performs sacraments.
- **Sacrament / Sacramental life** - Linked to Word-event; sacramental practice is formative for faithful reception.
- **Doxology** - Worship as the corrective orientation of dogmatics; theology serves praise.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Word-centered dogmatics and canonical normativity.
 - As a **polemic** resource against liberal-reductionist accounts of revelation and theology.
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot** linking biblical exegesis to doctrinal formulation through the concept of proclamation and the canon.
