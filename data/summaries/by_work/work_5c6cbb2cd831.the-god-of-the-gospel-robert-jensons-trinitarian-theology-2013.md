### TITLE
**The God of the Gospel: Robert Jenson's Trinitarian Theology** (2013), Scott R. Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context.** Early 21st-century ressourcement of classical trinitarian theology within evangelical and Reformed circles; critical engagement with late-20th-century revisionist trinitarianism (Jenson, Moltmann, Pannenberg) and the Barth-Rahner legacy.
- **Central thesis / problem.** Swain argues that Jenson's gospel-centered, narrative, and temporally construed doctrine of God both illuminates and distorts the church's rule of faith. The task is to receive Jenson's christological and ecclesial insights while retrieving pro-Nicene metaphysics (processions, simplicity, eternity) necessary to confess the God of the gospel.
- **Core argument / structure.**
 - Jenson's project: identify God by the gospel's story; God's being as dramatic event; the triune name as God's identity.
 - Scripture and naming: the biblical names Father, Son, Spirit are revelatory; however, theological grammar (processions/missions; inseparable operations) is needed to speak truly of God.
 - Rahner and Barth: Jenson radicalizes Rahner's Rule and Barth's being-in-act into a strict identity of immanent and economic Trinity, reconfiguring eternity as temporal futurity.
 - Attributes and ontology: Swain critiques Jenson's revisions of simplicity, immutability, and eternity, contending that pro-Nicene metaphysics safeguards the gospel's universality and freedom.
 - Dogmatic payoff: a classical account of relations of origin, perichoresis, and the divine missions grounds communion with the triune God without historicizing God's inner life.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors.** Robert W. Jenson; Karl Barth; Karl Rahner; Athanasius; Augustine; the Cappadocians; Thomas Aquinas; modern interlocutors such as Pannenberg and Torrance; Reformed scholastic voices in the background (e.g., Junius, Turretin, Bavinck).
- **Doctrines treated.** Revelation and divine naming; Trinity (processions, missions, taxis, perichoresis); divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, eternity); Christology and election; ecclesiology and sacramentality as they bear on trinitarian presence.
- **Closing line.** The God of the gospel is the Father, Son, and Spirit who, in indivisible operations, brings us by the missions into participation in the eternal processions; only a pro-Nicene ontology can secure this evangelical confession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases.**
 - Careful mapping of Jenson's narrative ontology alongside pro-Nicene grammar.
 - Strong retrieval of **inseparable operations** and **relations of origin** as the key to relating economy and immanence.
- **Corrections / contrasts.**
 - Pushback against collapsing the immanent Trinity into the economic history; resists construing eternity as temporal infinity.
 - Clarifies Rahner's Rule as hermeneutical axiom, not identity thesis; distinguishes Barth's reform from Jenson's radicalization.
- **Innovations (conceptual/terminological).**
 - Reframing gospel identity talk with classical **analogical naming** and **appropriations**.
 - Deploying pro-Nicene taxis to interpret christological concentration without EFS patterns of authority/submission.
- **Reception / influence.**
 - Became a touchstone in evangelical and Reformed discussions on classical theism and trinitarian method, often cited against historicist and social-trinitarian proposals.
 - Helpful dialogue partner for readers of Jenson, clarifying what can be received and what must be revised.
- **Enduring value.**
 - Models charitable, textually grounded critique.
 - Provides a compact handbook on how classical attributes and processional logic serve the gospel's content and proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule.** The economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity; Swain restricts it to hermeneutics, not a one-to-one identity of histories and processions.
- **Barth's being-in-act.** God's being is identical with His triune act; Swain receives the emphasis but resists historicizing God's life.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity.** Distinction without separation; the missions manifest the eternal processions.
- **Relations of origin.** Paternity, filiation, and spiration are the constitutive distinctions in God; basis for taxis apart from authority-submission schemes.
- **Inseparable operations.** The external works of the Trinity are undivided, yet with fitting appropriations.
- **Divine simplicity.** God is not composed of parts; attributes are identical with the divine essence; safeguards grace's freedom.
- **Eternity.** Not temporal infinity or mere futurity; God's timeless, perfect life; critiques Jenson's temporalization.
- **Perichoresis.** Mutual indwelling of the persons; grounds unity without collapsing distinctions.
- **Analogical naming.** Scriptural names truly refer to God without exhausting His mode of being.
- **Appropriation.** Attributing works to one person fittingly while maintaining inseparable operations.
- **Processions and missions.** Eternal relations (begetting, spiration) are the arche of temporal sendings (Incarnation, Pentecost).
- **Narrative identity.** Jenson's thesis that God is identified by the gospel's story; Swain qualifies by classical metaphysics.
- **Monarchy of the Father.** Pro-Nicene principle of personal order grounded in origin, not domination.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Eternal Functional Subordination Debates:** Cited for the primacy of relations of origin and inseparable operations over eternal authority-submission schemas.
 - **Rahner's Rule and Barth's Reformulation:** Used to parse the rule's limits and to distinguish Barthian reform from Jenson's identity collapse.
 - **Absolute and Relative Attributes:** Source for retrieving simplicity, immutability, and eternity and for critiquing temporalist revisions.
 - **Good Works and Merit in the Covenant of Grace:** Grounds Christ's merit and believers' non-meritorious good works in the triune missions and inseparable operations, safeguarding sola gratia within a trinitarian frame.
