### TITLE
Some Epistemological Reflections on 1 Corinthians 2:6-16 - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; postwar conservative Presbyterian milieu attentive to Pauline theology, Reformation hermeneutics, and debates with Neo-orthodoxy and liberal epistemologies.
 - Part of a wider recovery of Pauline pneumatology and Reformed concerns about revelation, authority, and noetics.

- **Central thesis**
 - 1 Corinthians 2:6-16 presents a distinctly *pneumatic epistemology*: true knowledge of God and his wisdom is not the fruit of unaided human reason but is granted by the Spirit; yet that knowledge is objective, propositional, tied to Christ and his cruciform wisdom rather than private subjective illumination.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical reading of 1 Cor 2:6-16:
 - Contrast between "wisdom of this age" and "spiritual wisdom" as categories (vv.6-8).
 - The "natural" (psuchikos) man cannot receive spiritual things because they require the Spirit's revealing work (vv.14-15).
 - The Spirit searches and reveals the "deep things of God" (vv.10-12), enabling the believer to have the "mind of Christ" (v.16).
 - Theological implications:
 - The Spirit is necessary for cognitive access to divine truth (noetic dependence).
 - This access preserves objectivity: the Spirit discloses revealed content (Christ-crucified), not private mystical data.
 - The noetic effects of sin are real (total inability to discern spiritual truth unaided), hence the necessity of regeneration for true knowledge.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (exegesis of 1 Cor).
 - Engagement with Reformed tradition: implicit dialogue with Calvin, Warfield, and classic Reformational noetics.
 - Polemical contrast with inner-light/subjectivist views of illumination, Enlightenment autonomy, and certain neo-orthodox emphases that downplay propositional revelation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (nature, propositional content, mediation)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as revealer and illuminator)
 - Anthropology and noetics (noetic effects of sin; human inability)
 - Christology (wisdom embodied in the crucified Christ)
 - Soteriology (regeneration as prerequisite for true knowledge)

- **Closing line**
 - The article centers a Reformed pneumatic epistemology: knowledge of God is Spirit-enabled, objectively anchored in Christ and revelation, and presupposes redemption from the noetic effects of sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linkage of epistemology to Christian soteriology: knowing God is inseparable from the Spirit's redeeming work.
 - Simultaneous insistence on Spirit-dependence and the objectivity/propositionality of divine truth.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters pietistic or charismatic models that make "illumination" essentially subjective and private.
 - Pushes back on Enlightenment-derived accounts of human autonomy in knowledge and on readings that eject propositional revelation in favor of merely existential encounter.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Clarifies distinctions among "natural" (psuchikos), "spiritual" (pneumatikos), and "mind of Christ" in epistemic terms.
 - Rearticulates the noetic effects of sin as a hermeneutical barrier remedied only by the Spirit.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and journals as a surgical exegetical model for Pauline epistemology and Christian knowledge.
 - Cited in debates over illumination, preaching authority, and pastoral theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise exegetical-theological template for integrating pneumatology, epistemology, and soteriology.
 - Serves as a corrective to both rationalist and subjectivist extremes; useful for preaching, apologetics, and ecclesial formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Wisdom of this age"** - human, unaided philosophical or worldly wisdom; contrasted with divine wisdom.
- **"Spiritual wisdom"** - wisdom disclosed by the Spirit; content is Christ-centered and salvific.
- **"Natural (psuchikos) man"** - human in unregenerate condition; epistemically incapable of receiving spiritual truth.
- **"The Spirit searches/reveals"** - the Spirit as active cognitive agent who discloses the "deep things of God."
- **"Mind of Christ"** - the believer's access to divine understanding through the Spirit; not absorption into mystical subjectivity but appropriation of revealed truth.
- **"Objectivity of revelation"** - emphasis that Spirit-bestowed knowledge corresponds to propositional content (Scripture/Christ), not merely inner feeling.
- **"Noetic effects of sin"** - incurvatures of intellect and will that render natural reason unable to discern God.
 - Related to Total Depravity and Total Inability: supports the claim humans cannot attain saving knowledge without divine action.
- **"Regeneration as epistemic prerequisite"** - conversion/Spirit-work is prior or concurrent with genuine knowledge of divine things.
- **"Discernment for ecclesial offices"** - implication that recognition of gifts and doctrines in polity depends on Spirit-enabled judgment.
 - Linked application: Church Government (Presbyterian polity, offices, discipline) - Gaffin's epistemology undergirds the conviction that ordination and discipline require Spirit-guided assessment of doctrine and character.
- **"Freedom and responsibility"** - intersects with Sin and Free Will: affirms human moral responsibility but recognizes freedom constrained by noetic bondage prior to Spirit-renewal.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional/exegetical source for a Reformed pneumatic epistemology (doctrine of revelation and knowledge).
- As a polemic against subjectivist/inner-light theories of illumination and against Enlightenment autonomy in theology.
- As an exegetical model applied in ecclesiology and polity debates to ground Spirit-enabled discernment in offices and discipline.
