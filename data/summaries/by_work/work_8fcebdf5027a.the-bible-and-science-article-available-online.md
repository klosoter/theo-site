### TITLE
The Bible and Science - John M. Frame (article; online)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed evangelical milieu; Frame writes as a systematic theologian and apologist addressing tensions between modern science and biblical authority.
 - Conversation situated against scientism, evolutionary naturalism, and various Christian responses (young-earth creationism, concordism, theistic evolution).

- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture is the final norm for truth; science is a legitimate, limited mode of creaturely inquiry. Properly related, biblical doctrine and empirical science are complementary because both derive from the one God who is Lord of creation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm the legitimacy and value of scientific methods while denying their claim to ultimate authority (critique of scientism).
 - Distinguish domains: Scripture gives normative theological and historical truth (e.g., Genesis 1-11), science gives empirical, provisional descriptions and explanations.
 - Argue that scientific inquiry presupposes theological commitments (God as orderly Creator); thus Christian presuppositions make sense of scientific intelligibility.
 - Reject both naive concordism (read Scripture as modern science) and reductive separationism (treat Scripture as irrelevant to factual questions).
 - Apply to Genesis 1-11: treat these chapters as theological-historical revelation that sets interpretive boundaries for anthropology, sin, and covenant, without insisting that Scripture mimic modern scientific categories.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with modern science (evolutionary theory), secular scientific authorities (as representatives of scientism), and Christian interlocutors ranging from Warfield/Bavinck-type accommodationists to strict biblical literalists and contemporary theistic evolutionists.
 - Presuppositional influences (Van Tilian concerns about ultimate commitments) inform Frame's approach.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture
 - Creation (creatio ex nihilo), providence, and the orderliness of nature
 - Anthropology and the Fall (Genesis 1-3)
 - Miracles and the limits of naturalistic explanation
 - Indirectly: covenantal structure and the cultural mandate (human vocation to explore creation)

- **Closing line**
 - The Bible rules as the ultimate interpreter of reality; science is a providential tool within creaturely limits - valuable, provisional, and subordinate to Scripture's theological and historical claims.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on Scripture's normative role without dismissing scientific findings; Frame frames science as a God-given cultural task undertaken under divine lordship.
 - Presuppositional move: scientific observation and theory are intelligible only within a theistic framework that explains order and rationality.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects naive concordism by refusing to force Scripture into modern scientific idioms.
 - Counters scientism by showing its self-refuting nature and by affirming that empirical methods lack resources to settle ultimate metaphysical questions.
 - Distinguishes from both strict young-earth literalism and wholesale theistic evolution by insisting on the theological import of Genesis 1-11 while allowing careful, theologically bounded engagement with science.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Applies a Lordship/presuppositional lens directly to the science-scripture debate: treaties on authority, not just hermeneutics or method.
 - Frames scientific disagreement as ultimately driven by differing ultimate commitments rather than mere data interpretation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars as a balanced, theologically rigorous response to scientism and naive concordism.
 - Influential in discussions where theological norms are defended without anti-intellectualism; used in classrooms and apologetic settings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a robust integration of doctrine and intellectual inquiry: affirms scientific practice while safeguarding Scripture's primacy.
 - Serves as a tempering corrective to extremes on both sides of the culture-war debate over Genesis and evolution.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture supremacy**
 - Scripture as the final normative standard for truth claims about God, creation, and redemptive history.
- **Scientism**
 - The philosophical claim that empirical science is the sole or ultimate arbiter of truth; Frame critiques and rejects this.
- **Methodological naturalism**
 - Scientific practice that brackets supernatural causation for methodological reasons; Frame acknowledges its utility but warns against philosophical conflation with metaphysical naturalism.
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - The approach that ultimate commitments shape interpretation of facts; used to show that science presupposes theism for intelligibility.
- **Two-books motif (Scripture and nature)**
 - Reworked: both reveal God, but Scripture is the normative interpretive key; nature is intelligible because of the Creator.
- **Creation ex nihilo**
 - Doctrine affirmed as foundational for granting ontological priority and contingency to the cosmos; supports the rationality of science.
- **Genesis 1-11: theological-historical locus**
 - Treated as revelatory history that establishes creation, fall, covenantal framework, and human vocation; not reduced to modern scientific prose.
- **Concordism**
 - The project of aligning Genesis directly with modern scientific accounts; Frame warns against simplistic concordism.
- **Accommodation**
 - The idea Scripture communicates in terms intelligible to its original audience; Frame allows accommodation but maintains doctrinal content remains authoritative.
- **Miracles**
 - Authentic divine actions that transcend natural explanation; Frame defends their theological significance against methodological dismissal.
- **Cultural mandate**
 - Human vocation to steward creation; justifies Christian engagement in scientific work as service under divine authority.
- **Limits of scientific explanation**
 - Science cannot adjudicate metaphysical or ultimate theological claims; such limits demand theological deliberation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for the proper relation of Scripture and science in systematic theology and apologetics.
 - As a **polemic** against scientism and naive concordism, offering a middle path for evangelicals.
 - As an **exegetical model** for treating Genesis 1-11 theologically while engaging scientific data with humility and doctrinal clarity.
