### TITLE
The New Testament as Canon - Robert W. Wall & Eugene E. Lemcio

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century academic theology and biblical studies: conversation between historical-critical scholarship and the rise of canonical, theological, and reception-oriented approaches.
 - Situated within debates over Scripture's authority, formation of the NT corpus, and the church's role in defining canonical boundaries.
- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament must be read and understood as a coherent canonical corpus whose final shape and reception by the church determine its theological authority and interpretive meaning.
 - Canonical form-not merely source-layer history-inscribes theological priorities that must guide contemporary exegesis and doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: problems of atomized biblical interpretation produced by exclusive reliance on historical-critical methods.
 - Historical reconstruction: survey of the processes, criteria, and contexts that produced the NT canon (apostolicity, catholicity, orthodoxy, liturgical use).
 - Canon as theological determinant: demonstration that the final form and communal reception of NT writings function as decisive theological testimony.
 - Methodological proposal: advocates a canonical-critical reading that attends to text-formation, intertextual canonical connections, and ecclesial reception.
 - Practical consequences: implications for preaching, doctrine, ethics, and ecumenical dialogue.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic witnesses (Irenaeus, Athanasius) for formation history; key modern interlocutors include Brevard Childs (canonical criticism), Bruce Metzger (canon history), and critics of canonical approaches from historical-critical and literary-critical schools.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (nature, authority, inspiration)
 - Canon and canonicity (formation, criteria)
 - Christology (canonical portrayal and confessional contours)
 - Ecclesiology (church's role in reception and norming)
 - Hermeneutics and theological method
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: the New Testament's final canonical shape, as received by the church, is the primary locus for theological reading and doctrinal formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong privileging of the NT's *final form* and communal reception as normative for theology, not merely as the end-point of textual history.
 - Explicit linking of canon formation to liturgical and ecclesial practice-canon emerges as lived, not only textual, reality.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects reductive historicism that fragments texts into source-layers divorced from ecclesial use.
 - Contrasts with radical canonical skepticism that treats canon as purely sociological artifact; insists on theological authority arising from reception within the believing community.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of terms like **canonical horizon** (the interpretive frame provided by the corpus), **receival theology** (theology informed by reception), and **canonical intertextuality** (the networked theological reading across NT books).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in seminary courses on canon, biblical theology, and hermeneutics; serves as a bridge between historical study and confessional reading.
 - Valuable to both mainline and evangelical contexts seeking a theologically robust account of Scripture's authority without abandoning historical inquiry.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an accessible, disciplined corrective to methods that either absolutize final-form reading or deny theological weight to ecclesial reception; durable for teaching canonical hermeneutics and integrating exegesis with doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon / Canonicity** - the set of texts recognized as authoritative; treated as theological outcome of reception, not merely bibliographical list.
- **Final form** - the canonical text as transmitted and received; primary locus for theological interpretation.
- **Apostolicity** - connection to apostolic witness as central criterion for inclusion and authority.
- **Catholicity** - wide church usage across regions as evidence of normative status.
- **Orthodoxy** - conformity to rule of faith; used to explain theological acceptance/rejection of texts.
- **Reception history (receptio / receival theology)** - how interpretive communities adopt and authorize texts; a key hermeneutical principle.
- **Canonical criticism** - method that reads texts within the canonical corpus and ecclesial frame rather than isolated historical strata.
- **Canonical horizon** - the interpretive frame created by the whole canon that shapes meaning of particulars.
- **Canonical intertextuality** - theological conversation among NT books; cross-textual shaping of doctrine (e.g., Christological motifs).
- **Liturgical use** - public worship as a formative arena for recognizing and shaping canon.
- **Textual formation** - processes (writing, copying, circulation) that precede and contribute to canonical status.
- **Rule of faith (forma fidei)** - proto-creedal shapes that orient canonical reception and doctrinal judgment.
- **Authority / Inspiration** - treated theologically as bound up with canonical reception by the church rather than a purely individualistic notion.
- **Historical-critical vs canonical approach** - contrast highlighted throughout to clarify method and theological consequences.
- **Receival vs. provenance** - tension between what the text is historically vs. how the church has received it; the work privileges receival for theological use.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source for courses on the doctrine of Scripture and canon history.
 - Polemical resource against readings that isolate texts from ecclesial reception (useful in debates with strict historical criticism).
 - Exegetical model for preaching and theological interpretation that foregrounds corpus-wide coherence and church usage.
