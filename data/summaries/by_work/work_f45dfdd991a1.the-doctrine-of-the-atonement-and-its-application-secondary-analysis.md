### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Atonement and Its Application (secondary analysis) - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687) writing in Geneva/Neuchatel amid post-Reformation controversies. Reactionary posture toward Amyraldian hypothetical universalism, Arminianism, and Socinian denial of satisfaction. Texts part of Turretin's Institutes of Elenctic Theology and related disputations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** defense of a particular, substitutionary, satisfactionary atonement whose **sufficiency is universal but efficacy is particular**-effectual only for the elect-coupled with a precise account of how the atonement is applied (union with Christ, imputation, effectual calling, regeneration).
- **Core argument / structure:** systematic treatment moving from divine decree and covenant of redemption to the work of Christ and its application.
 - Establishes divine intent: eternal election and the covenant of redemption as the logical ground of atonement.
 - Articulates the nature of the atonement: penal satisfaction, voluntary obedience, and substitutionary suffering.
 - Distinguishes **sufficiency vs. efficacy**: Christ's death sufficient for all, efficient only for the elect by God's intentional decree.
 - Treats application: call (external/internal), regeneration, justification (imputation of righteousness), sanctification, and perseverance.
 - Defends sacramental signs as means of application without making them automatic causes of salvation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and later Reformed scholastics (Beza, Voetius), opponents Amyraut (Moïse Amyraut/"Amyraldism"), Arminians, Socinians; primary reliance on Pauline and Johannine exegesis; appeal to early church and confessional standards (Westminster/Heidelberg emphases).
- **Doctrines treated:** soteriology (atonement, justification, adoption), Christology (person and office of Christ), covenant theology (covenant of redemption and works/faith), predestination, grace (common, preparatory, special), sacramental theology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Turretin centers the atonement in the eternal decree and covenant of redemption: Christ satisfied divine justice for those given him in election; the work is objectively sufficient for all but effectually applied only to the elect by sovereign grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Meticulous scholastic distinctions (esp. sufficiency vs. efficacy) employed as doctrinal safeguards.
 - Strong insistence that the atonement's intention is particular: God intended to save a definite people, not merely make salvation possible for all.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct polemic against Amyraldian hypothetical universalism (rejected universal atonement as inconsistent with particular election).
 - Rebuffs Socinian/moral influence readings by affirming penal satisfaction and substitution.
 - Opposes Arminian prevenient-grace models that posit a salvific preparatory grace common to all.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refined use of the term **"preparatory grace"** to denote non-salvific divine dispositions or external means (evangelical call, providential restraint) distinguished sharply from efficacious, regenerating grace.
 - Clarifies categories used thereafter in Reformed confessional vocabularies (sufficiency/efficacy; external/internal calling).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in later Reformed seminaries (notably Princeton and conservative continental academies); became a touchstone for 17th-19th century Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Widely cited in polemics against Amyraldian and Arminian strains; less influential in modern liberal or nonconfessional circles.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplary for methodological precision, exegetical argumentation on Pauline texts, and a defensible schema linking decree, atonement, and application-valuable for teaching systematic soteriology and polemical history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement:** Christ's reconciling work; defined in penal-satisfaction terms.
- **Penal Substitution:** Christ bore the penalty due sinners; primary mechanism of satisfaction.
- **Satisfaction:** The legal/forensic settling of divine justice by Christ's obedience and sufferings.
- **Imputation:** Transfer of sin to Christ and righteousness of Christ to believers (double imputation).
- **Particular Redemption (Limited Atonement):** The atonement intended and efficacious for the elect.
 - Contrast: Amyraldian hypothetical universalism (rejected by Turretin).
- **Sufficiency vs. Efficacy:** Christ's death sufficient for all, efficacious only for those given in election.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Eternal pact between Father and Son as the logical ground of Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Effectual Calling / Internal Grace:** The work of the Spirit that unites elect to Christ and renders the atonement efficacious.
- **External Call / Preparatory Grace:** Gospel proclamation, civil blessings, and common restraining grace that may precede but do not accomplish salvation.
 - Note: Turretin affirms non-saving common/preparatory graces (restraint, providential goods) while denying their salvific power for the non-elect.
- **Common Grace:** Non-saving divine benevolence and restraint of sin in society; distinct from saving, regenerating grace.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration by God upon imputation of Christ's righteousness.
- **Union with Christ:** The instrumental nexus for application-ground of adoption, sanctification, and perseverance.
- **Sacramental Application:** Baptism and Supper as signs and seals that communicate benefits when accompanied by faith (not automatic causes).

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for classical Reformed positions on atonement, election, and grace.
 - As polemical exemplar against Amyraldian, Arminian, and Socinian alternatives.
 - As an exegetical-model resource for Romans/Hebrews/John exegetical treatments linking doctrine and application.
