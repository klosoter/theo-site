### TITLE
The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology - edited and contributed to by **William Lane Craig** (compendium of contemporary natural-theological arguments on the existence and knowability of God)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century analytic theology and philosophy of religion; resurgence of interest in natural theology within analytic philosophy, apologetics, and evangelical circles.
 - A multi-author, interdisciplinary companion collecting programmatic essays defending, reformulating, and critiquing traditional natural-theological arguments in light of modern science and epistemology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Natural theology remains a live and rationally tractable route to theism: classical arguments (cosmological, teleological, moral, ontological, experiential) can be rehabilitated and updated to respond to modern critiques (Hume, Kant, Darwin, naturalism).
 - Secondary concern: the epistemic status and knowability of God on the basis of natural reason and empirical data.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey chapters presenting both historical background and contemporary reconstructions of major arguments:
 - **Cosmological**: renewed formulations (notably the Kalam/temporal origin argument) emphasizing finitude of past, causal principle, and transcendent cause.
 - **Teleological / Fine-tuning**: probabilistic and inference-to-best-explanation accounts using cosmology and anthropic reasoning.
 - **Moral**: grounding objective moral values and duties in theism as best explanatory hypothesis.
 - **Ontological / Metaphysical**: modal and perfection-based defenses reworked with modal logic and metaphysical semantics.
 - **Religious experience and divine hiddenness**: phenomenological and epistemological treatments of religious experience as evidence.
 - Epistemic machinery: Bayesian confirmation theory and probabilistic reasoning applied to theological claims.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: **Aquinas, Leibniz, Hume, Kant** (as chief historical critics/foils).
 - Contemporary analytic debate partners: proponents of classical theism and natural theology, plus naturalistic and skeptical interlocutors (scientific cosmologists and philosophical critics).
 - Scientific inputs from cosmology (Big Bang, fine-tuning), evolutionary biology (challenge to teleological intuitions), and epistemology (Bayesianism).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Existence of God; divine attributes (necessity, aseity, omnipotence, timelessness/temporal concerns); relation of natural knowledge to special revelation; providence and design; epistemic warrant for religious belief.
- **Closing line**
 - The volume stakes that rational, interdisciplinary natural theology-recast with current metaphysics, cosmology, and probabilistic epistemology-provides substantive grounds for belief in God and a principled challenge to rival naturalistic explanations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic application of **Bayesian confirmation theory** and probabilistic methods to classical arguments.
 - Prominent revival and reformulation of the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** (Craig's signature contribution) linking scientific cosmology to metaphysical theism.
 - Integration of fine-tuning and contemporary physics with philosophical inference-to-best-explanation strategies.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves away from purely deductive classical proofs toward **inference, probability, and explanatory power** as standards of warrant.
 - Rebuttals to Hume/Kant reduce reliance on metaphysical a priori claims by appealing to empirical cosmology and modern modal logic.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of contemporary modal and probabilistic language to recast ontological and cosmological arguments (e.g., possible-worlds terminology combined with Bayesian priors).
 - Emphasis on **epistemic humility**: arguments as cumulative case rather than single decisive proof.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical, Reformed, and broader Christian philosophical contexts as a comprehensive reference on natural theology.
 - Stimulated renewed academic discussion; cited in apologetics, graduate seminars, and philosophical-theological responses to naturalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - As a compact, interdisciplinary toolbox: brings classical theistic arguments into ongoing scientific and epistemic conversations; valuable as syllabus text and reference for constructing cumulative apologetic cases.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural theology** - knowledge of God attainable through reason and observation rather than special revelation.
- **Kalam Cosmological Argument** - argument for a cause of the universe based on the beginning of the cosmos, causal principle, and the grounding of a transcendent cause.
- **Contingency / Necessary Being** - modal metaphysics framing God as the ontologically necessary ground of contingent reality.
- **Fine-tuning (teleological argument)** - inference from the apparent precision of physical constants and initial conditions to design or explanatory best-fit involving a divine mind.
- **Ontological argument (modal/perfection versions)** - modal-logical treatments of God's necessary maximal greatness.
- **Moral argument** - claim that objective moral values and duties are best explained by the existence of God.
- **Bayesian confirmation theory** - probabilistic framework used to weigh evidence and update credences for theistic hypotheses.
- **Religious experience (epistemology)** - phenomenological testimony used as evidence for God, treated alongside natural signs.
- **Divine attributes (classical theism)** - attributes such as aseity, omnipotence, omniscience, and necessary existence discussed in relation to natural-theological inferences.
- **Anthropic principle** - methodological tool in fine-tuning discussions to constrain explanations.
- **Inference-to-best-explanation (IBE)** - explanatory reasoning favored over strict deductivism in assessing natural-theological claims.
- **Divine hiddenness** - problem and response regarding absence of evident divine presence in natural signs.
- **Epistemic warrant / Reformed epistemology (contrast)** - debate over whether natural evidence provides warrant or whether warrant is internal/faith-based; companion situates natural theology within broader epistemic frameworks.
- **Classical theism vs. process / panentheistic alternatives** - comparative discussions evaluating how well different divine models fit empirical and metaphysical data.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional and methodological source** for modern natural theology courses and syllabi.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with naturalism, atheism, and secular philosophy of religion.
- As a **conceptual pivot** and model for integrating scientific data (cosmology, physics) with metaphysical argumentation in apologetics and systematic theology.
