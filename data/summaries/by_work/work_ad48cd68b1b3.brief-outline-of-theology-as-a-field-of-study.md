### TITLE
Brief Outline of Theology as a Field of Study - Friedrich Schleiermacher (Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums, 1811)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1811 in early 19th-century Germany amid post-Enlightenment, German Idealism (Kant, Fichte), and Romantic reaction to both rationalist theology and pietistic narrowness.
 - Intended as a programmatic statement for theological education and the discipline of theology as a Wissenschaft (systematic science).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be established as a critical, systematic science rooted not in metaphysical proofs or confessional formulae alone but in the empirical core of religion: the *feeling of absolute dependence* (Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology = science of religion that has both descriptive-historical and normative-systematic tasks.
 - Primary datum: religious experience (feeling), which theology must interpret historically (history of religion and Scripture) and systematize doctrinally for church life and practical faith.
 - Method: critical-historical exegesis; clear separation of the *fundament* (experience) from subsequent dogmatic formulations; attention to development and contextuality of doctrines.
 - Practical aim: to form pastors and theologians competent in interpretation, dogmatics, ethics, and ecclesiastical practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophical interlocutors: Kant and Fichte (epistemology and self-consciousness), Romantic critics of Enlightenment reductionism.
 - Theological interlocutors: orthodox scholasticism, Enlightened rationalists, pietism; uses Bible and church tradition but recasts their authority through religious feeling and historical study.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation reconceived as the communication that engenders and shapes religious feeling rather than primarily propositional content.
 - Christology: Jesus as the archetype of perfect God-consciousness (the most complete religious feeling) and the communicative center of Christian community.
 - Trinity, ecclesiology, sacraments, soteriology and eschatology are treated as developments built upon the religiously felt ground; emphasis on their experiential function rather than speculative metaphysics.
 - Moral theology and practice framed as the maturation of religious feeling in communal life.
- **Selective engagements with the topics assigned**
 - **Guilt / Pollution / Death**: sin and guilt are primarily disruptions of God-consciousness and communal immediacy with God; death and ritual pollution are interpreted in terms of existential rupture and the need for restored religious feeling.
 - **New Heavens and New Earth**: eschatology becomes the progressive transformation of communal life and moral order grounded in renewed religious feeling rather than speculative cosmic reconstitution.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher centers theology on the lived, historical, and communal interpretation of the foundational human experience of dependence on God - theology as disciplined reflection on religious feeling for ecclesial formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates *feeling* (religious consciousness) as the epistemic and existential ground of theology, subordinating metaphysical proof and abstract dogmatics to lived religious life.
 - Systematic yet practical orientation: theology must produce ministers formed for pastoral and communal tasks.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects rationalist theologies that reduce religion to doctrine and moralism; corrects pietistic inwardness that divorces faith from scholarly critical study.
 - Opposes scholastic metaphysics' claim to foundational authority by relocating foundation in experience rather than speculative ontology.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence" as theological axiom; theology as Wissenschaft with descriptive-historical and normative-systematic branches.
 - Distinction between *theological fundament* (experience) and *dogmatic superstructure* (doctrinal formulations).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for modern liberal Protestant theology, historical-critical biblical scholarship, and theological education reform.
 - Criticized by conservative and confessional theologians for relativizing doctrine and underplaying objective revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating hermeneutics, history, and pastoral formation; a pedagogical blueprint for theology departments and for theologians dealing with modernity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence**
 - The primary datum; religious self-consciousness that theology must explicate and cultivate.
- **Theological fundament vs. dogmatic superstructure**
 - Foundation in experience; doctrines as explanatory, historical articulations.
- **Theology as Wissenschaft**
 - Systematic, disciplined study with critical and historical dimensions.
- **Critical-historical method**
 - Emphasis on historical development and contextual exegesis of Scripture and dogma.
- **Religion vs. dogma**
 - Religion = lived experience; dogma = communicative, communal expression shaped by history.
- **Christ as perfect God-consciousness**
 - Christology centered on exemplary and revelatory fullness of religious feeling rather than metaphysical incarnation schema.
- **Soteriology as restoration of immediacy**
 - Salvation understood as healing of disrupted God-consciousness and reformation of communal life.
- **Eschatology as communal transformation**
 - "New Heavens and New Earth" read primarily as the moral and ecclesial renewal of creation, not as speculative cosmology.
- **Sin, guilt, pollution, death**
 - Interpreted existentially: terminologies describing the rupture of religious Feeling and communal order; ritual language reinterpreted for ethical-spiritual restoration.
- **Historical consciousness**
 - Awareness of doctrinal development and the necessity of contextual interpretation.
- **Practical-theological formation**
 - Theology's aim is pastoral competency and ecclesial vitality, not only abstruse speculation.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitions source: foundational for locating theology's epistemic ground in experience rather than metaphysics.
 - As a polemic and hermeneutical model: deployed against scholastic metaphysics and dogmatic literalism; used to reframe issues such as sin/guilt and eschatology toward ethical-communal correction (see entries on Guilt/Pollution/Death and New Heavens/New Earth).
