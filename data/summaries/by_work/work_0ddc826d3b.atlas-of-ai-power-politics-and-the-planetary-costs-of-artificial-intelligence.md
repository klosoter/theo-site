### TITLE
**Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence - Kate Crawford (2021)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2021 amid heightened public debate on AI ethics, climate crises, and supply-chain scrutiny. Situated at the intersection of critical AI studies, environmental humanities, political economy, and design/technology criticism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** AI is not immaterial software or neutral intelligence; it is a global, extractive, material system whose power shapes political relations and produces planetary costs. The work reframes ethical concerns about AI as questions of resource use, labor, infrastructure, and sovereignty.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Maps the **infrastructural life-cycle** of AI: raw materials (mining), hardware production, energy-intensive training, deployment, disposal.
 - Traces the **political economies** underpinning AI: corporate platforms, state actors, surveillance apparatuses, and military applications.
 - Demonstrates the **ecological and social externalities**: carbon footprint, mining violence, e-waste, labor precarity, and data colonialism.
 - Proposes a taxonomy of harms and governance failures rather than technological determinism; calls for reparative policy, transparency, and redistribution of costs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on ethnographies, investigative journalism, environmental science, political economy (e.g., platform capitalism critics), Indigenous and Global South perspectives, and AI/ML technical literature; interlocutors include tech companies, NGOs, policymakers, and impacted communities.
- **Doctrines treated (theological resonance):**
 - **Creation and stewardship:** material impact on earth and species; challenge to responsible caretaking.
 - **Anthropology:** reframing of human agency and labor under automation and platformization.
 - **Sin and power:** structures of domination, extraction, and injustice resonate with doctrines of structural sin.
 - **Eschatology/hope:** implicit questions about desirable futures and the moral imagination required to limit harms.
- **Closing line:** Theologically, Crawford's atlas insists that AI must be read as a creation-shaped practice with moral responsibility - a distributive and ecological problem that demands repentance and structural reorientation rather than mere technical fixes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Centers **materiality** (minerals, labor, energy) rather than code-as-myth; makes visible what is often abstracted away.
 - Frames AI harms as **planetary** and **geopolitical**, not only algorithmic bias or privacy breaches.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against techno-optimist and purely ethical-algorithm approaches by exposing supply chains and ecological footprints.
 - Contrasts with AI governance texts that foreground accountability frameworks without engaging material extraction and labor.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularizes concepts such as **data colonialism**, **extractive infrastructures**, and the **material stack** of AI.
 - Treats AI as an **ecology** of practices and resources rather than a discrete technology.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used in technology ethics, environmental humanities, and public-policy discourse; picked up by theologians concerned with creation care, social justice, and political theology as a rigorous empirical account informing normative critique.
 - Serves as a resource for ecclesial and theological discussions on stewardship, economic justice, and the church's public witness on technology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Empirically rich syllabus resource for courses on theology and technology, Christian ethics of creation, and political theology.
 - Provides a durable analytic frame-material, political, and planetary-that grounds theological reflection in concrete practices and systems.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Materiality / Material stack:** The layers (minerals, hardware, datacenters, software) making AI possible; used to redirect moral attention to physical processes.
- **Data colonialism:** Analogy/diagnosis of how data extraction mirrors historical colonial extraction of land and labor.
- **Extractive infrastructure:** Systems that extract value from people and ecosystems; highlights continuity with fossil-fuel and mining logics.
- **Energy and carbon footprint:** Empirical measures of training/deployment costs; grounds ecological claims in quantifiable terms.
- **Supply chain violence:** Social and environmental harms (mining, labor conditions) tied to hardware production.
- **E-waste and disposal:** The end-of-life costs and toxic legacies of hardware; ethical concern for future generations and creation.
- **Surveillance and militarization:** Deployment contexts where AI amplifies state/power asymmetries; theological concern for dignity and peace.
- **Labor displacement and precarious work:** Platform labor, data labeling, and invisible human inputs that sustain AI; reframes debates on automation.
- **Transparency and accountability:** Governance demands that must extend beyond algorithmic audits to corporate practices and geopolitics.
- **Reparative governance / Redistribution of costs:** Policy proposals aimed at shifting burdens away from vulnerable communities and ecosystems.
- **Planetary ethics:** Ethical framework that attends to earth systems and intergenerational justice rather than narrow human-centric metrics.
- **Atlas method:** Mapping, visualizing, and connecting dispersed sites of production and harm to make systemic critique accessible.
- **Commons and sovereignty:** Questions regarding data, resources, and the rights of communities resisting extraction.
- **Technopolitical imaginaries:** How narratives about AI shape policy and moral imagination; central for prophetic theological critique.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "AI" understood as infrastructure and ecology rather than mere algorithms.
 - As a **polemic and case-study resource** in ethics and political theology for critiques of extraction, injustice, and creation-care.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula: bridging technical AI studies with environmental theology, political economy, and pastoral concerns about vocation and stewardship.
