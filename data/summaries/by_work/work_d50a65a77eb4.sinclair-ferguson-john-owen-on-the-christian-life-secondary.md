### TITLE
Sinclair B. Ferguson, John Owen on the Christian Life (secondary study of John Owen) - focused reading on **regeneration and effectual calling**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - John Owen (1616-1683): English Puritan and Reformed scholastic pastor-theologian; wrote in the context of post-Reformation covenant theology, controversy with Arminianism, and pastoral care for a beleaguered church.
 - Sinclair Ferguson (contemporary Reformed theologian) reads Owen pastorally, as part of 20th-21st century Reformed renewal and Banner of Truth-style Owen revival; aims to bridge Owen's dense theology to pastoral formation today.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Owen's account of the Christian life is grounded in a Trinitarian, Christocentric understanding of **regeneration and effectual calling**: the Spirit's sovereign quickening unites sinners to Christ and issues in mortification and vivification.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Establish Owen's ontology of union with Christ as the master category: all saving benefits, including regeneration, flow from union by the Spirit.
 - Define and defend effectual calling as a supernatural, efficacious divine act distinct from external proclamation or common grace.
 - Trace how regeneration (a decisive, Spirit-wrought quickening) issues in:
 - **Vivification** (new spiritual life, faith, love), and
 - **Mortification** (ongoing war against indwelling sin).
 - Show Owen's pastoral method: doctrinal exposition tied to experimental application and assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Owen's own corpus (Works): especially on the Spirit, indwelling sin, mortification, and redemption.
 - Implicit contrasts with Arminians, Socinians, and pietistic tendencies that de-emphasize sovereign grace or the mechanics of spiritual renewal.
 - Ferguson engages modern pastoral concerns: assurance, spiritual formation, and the misuse of "psychological" moralism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Regeneration, effectual calling, union with Christ, sanctification (mortification/vivification), assurance, the Spirit's internal work, and covenant of grace implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Owen, as read by Ferguson, makes regeneration and effectual calling the pastoral hinge: the Spirit's sovereign vivifying union with Christ is both the root and continual power of the Christian life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Elevates **union with Christ** as the central theological category that explains regeneration, not merely an adjunct doctrine.
 - Stresses **simultaneity**: effectual calling and regeneration are decisive, immediate acts of God rather than gradual moral awakenings.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern caricatures of Owen as only scholastic: Ferguson emphasizes Owen's pastoral tenderness and experiential concern for believers' inner life.
 - Contrasts with Arminian/prevenient-grace frameworks by insisting on divine efficacy (not irresistible language as polemical caricature, but real transforming power).
 - Pushes back on pietistic moralism by showing that mortification flows from received life, not merely willpower.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims older terms like **vivification** and **effectual calling** for contemporary use and ties them systematically to assurance and pastoral care.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Ferguson's reading has helped reintegrate Owen into pastoral seminary curricula and preaching resources; contributed to a resurgence of Owen's use in Reformed pastoral theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for marrying doctrinal precision with pastoral sensitivity; valuable for ministers, spiritual directors, and theologians concerned with how doctrine shapes soul care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Effectual calling** - God's inward, efficacious summons by the Spirit that results in the sinner's turning; distinct from external call.
- **Regeneration (vivification)** - The Spirit's sovereign quickening that imparts new spiritual life, enabling faith and repentance.
- **Union with Christ** - The formative center: the covenantal/ontological bond by which regeneration and all benefits are applied.
- **Mortification** - Ongoing put-to-death of indwelling sin; disciplined warfare enabled by union and the Spirit.
 - Relation: not an autonomous effort but the fruit of vivification.
- **Indwelling sin** - The remaining corruption within believers that necessitates mortification and assurance work.
- **Assurance (experimental knowledge)** - Certainty grounded in the Spirit's witness and the experiential fruits of regeneration, not mere speculation.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive conformity to Christ rooted in the once-for-all act of regeneration and ongoing Spirit-empowered mortification/vivification.
- **Prevenient/common call** - External proclamation and common grace contrasted with the particularity and efficacy of the effectual call.
- **Illumination** - The Spirit's enabling work that accompanies and makes possible understanding and faith in effectual calling.
- **Covenant of grace** - The theological framework within which Owen locates calling and regeneration as covenantal benefits.
- **Experimental theology** - Using Scripture-based doctrines to address the believer's present experience (Owen's pastoral method emphasized by Ferguson).
- **Efficacious grace** - God's grace that effectively accomplishes what it intends in the elect; used to counter semi-Pelagian accounts.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source and clarifying exposition for Reformed doctrines of **regeneration** and **effectual calling**.
- As a pastoral/therapeutic model tying doctrine to soul-care: exemplar for preaching on assurance and sanctification.
- As a polemical resource against modern reductionist or moralistic views of spiritual conversion.
- As an exegetical-method model: reading doctrinal formulations through pastoral experience and Trinitarian application.
