### TITLE
The Lord's Supper as a Means of Grace: More than a Memory - Scott R. Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2011 within contemporary Reformed evangelical scholarship; addresses late 20th-21st century pressures toward memorialist readings of the Supper.
 - Written from a confessional Reformed vantage; interacts with Continental, Anglican, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic sacramental traditions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper is properly understood as a true **means of grace** in the Reformed sense: a sign and seal by which Christ effectually communicates himself to believers, not merely a memorial that evokes mental remembrance.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical exegesis: Readings of key texts (1 Cor 10-11, John 6, Luke 22, institution narratives) support real, spiritual participation in Christ through the Supper.
 - Theological-linguistic clarification: Distinguishes the Reformed category of sacramental instrumentality (promise + Spirit) from Romanist physical presence and Zwinglian memorialism.
 - Historical-theological synthesis: Draws on the Reformed confessions, Calvin's sacramental theology, and patristic precedents to show continuity and corrective development.
 - Pastoral-theological application: Shows how treating the Supper as a means of grace shapes worship, pastoral care, and ecclesial identity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Huldrych Zwingli (memorialism), Martin Luther (real corporeal presence), John Calvin (spiritual presence and participation), Reformed confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg).
 - Engages contemporary critics of sacramental efficacy and writers emphasizing purely symbolic or commemorative functions.
 - Uses Scripture, the patristic witness, Reformation-era texts, and modern Reformed systematicians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology (nature, sign/seal, efficacy)
 - Covenant theology (signs within covenant economy)
 - Christology (presence of the risen Christ)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as instrumental in sacramental union)
 - Ecclesiology and soteriology (union with Christ, faith, and assurance)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Lord's Supper is an instituted, covenantal means by which believers truly partake of Christ by the Spirit through the promise - thereby effecting nourishment, union, and assurance beyond mere memorialization.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, confessional reclaiming of the language of **"means of grace"** as Reformed, not Roman, articulating how sacraments instrumentally (not automatically) convey Christ through the promise and the Spirit.
 - Clear insistence on objective sacramental efficacy-rooted in Christ's promise and action-while avoiding any notion of physical transfer or ex opere operato mechanics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Zwinglian memorialism by showing that "remembrance" in Scripture is active and sacramental rather than merely cognitive.
 - Distinguishes itself from Lutheran metaphysical presence and Roman sacramentalism by affirming spiritual, not corporeal, real presence mediated by the Spirit and promise.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines the Reformed vocabulary around instrumental causality: sacraments function as **means** specifically because God promises and the Spirit effects what is signified.
 - Emphasizes covenantal promise as normative hermeneutic for sacramental efficacy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and churches as a contemporary defense of confessional sacramentology.
 - Cited in pastoral resources and polemical writings aimed at reclaiming sacramental practice from memorialist trends.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a compact, biblically grounded, confessional corrective for pastors, teachers, and students; bridges exegetical work and pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Means of grace** - Sacraments as instruments by which God communicates promised benefits; Swain reclaims this as distinctly Reformed.
- **Memorialism** - The view that the Supper is only a symbolic remembrance; Swain critiques this as biblically inadequate.
- **Real (spiritual) presence** - Christ truly present to believers in the Supper by the Spirit, not corporeally present in the elements.
- **Sign and seal** - Classic Reformed categories: sign depicts what is given; seal confirms the promise and secures assurance.
- **Instrumental causality** - The idea that sacraments are instruments God uses to effect union with Christ through promise and Spirit (not efficient cause in an automatic sense).
- **Promise** - Central to sacramental efficacy: God's promise binds the sign to the thing signified; faith receives it.
- **Union with Christ** - Soteriological framework that explains how believers partake of Christ in the Supper.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit's role)** - The Holy Spirit is the immediate agent who applies Christ to believers in the sacrament.
- **Ex opere operato** - Catholic formula for automatic efficacy; Swain rejects this for confessional Reformed nuance.
- **Remembrance (anamnesis)** - Reinterpreted: remembrance includes active participation and re-presentation, not mere mental recall.
- **Confessional standards** - Uses Westminster and other Reformed confessions to ground sacramental definitions and pastoral practice.
- **Efficacy** - How sacraments achieve their end; Swain stresses objective grounding in Christ's promise mediated by the Spirit.
- **Participation in Christ (koinonia)** - Communal and mystical participation effected in the Supper.
- **Eucharist/Lord's Supper** - Preferred Reformed framing emphasizing covenantal and communal aspects.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental theology (clear confessional articulation).
 - As a **polemic** against memorialism and reductive symbolic readings in modern Protestantism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting 1 Corinthians 10-11, John 6, and institution narratives with covenantal-theological sensitivity.
 - As a **pastoral-conceptual pivot** for worship planning, pastoral care, and catechesis on the Lord's Supper.
