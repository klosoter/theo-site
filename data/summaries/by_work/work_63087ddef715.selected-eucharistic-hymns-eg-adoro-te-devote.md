### TITLE
**Selected Eucharistic Hymns (notably "Adoro te devote") - Thomas Aquinas**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 13th century scholastic and liturgical milieu (Dominican tradition). Hymns composed for the Feast of Corpus Christi and common medieval devotion. Aquinas wrote liturgical hymnody alongside his sacramental theology (contemporaneous with Summa Theologiae, III, on the Eucharist).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To deepen liturgical devotion to the Eucharist by combining doctrinal clarity about Christ's real presence with affective adoration; to foster reverent reception and safeguard the sacrament against irreverence.
- **Core argument / structure:** devotional-poetic rather than systematic; key moves:
 - Affirmation of Christ's **real, personal presence** in the consecrated elements.
 - Call to worship: adoration and silence before the sacrament as appropriate for the unique presence of God.
 - Pastoral exhortation: recognize worthiness, lament unworthiness, and seek sanctification prior to reception.
 - Eucharist as nourishment: spiritual feeding, union with Christ, healing of the soul.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** draws on Latin liturgical tradition, Augustine and earlier Patristic Eucharistic piety; implicitly addresses medieval controversies about presence (e.g., reactions to Berengarius; presupposes Fourth Lateran/Scholastic formulations). Its clarity later served in polemics against Protestant reductions of sacramental presence.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Christology** (presence of the incarnate Lord), **sacramentality** (sign and reality; sacramental union/substantial presence), **worship/adoration** (latria due to Christ's presence), **soteriology and pastoral disposition** (worthiness, confession, fencing/admission practices).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** These hymns fuse scholastic Eucharistic realism with intimate liturgical adoration, making doctrinal conviction palpable in worship and prescribing reverential boundaries for reception.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Poetry as theology: doctrinal claims rendered in devotional language so that belief shapes worship behavior.
 - Strong insistence on **adoration** (not merely reception) of Christ in the consecrated host.
 - Emphasis on the Eucharist as both sacrificial memorial and present reality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves beyond abstract metaphysical debate to insist on practical reverence and guarded access (contrast with more permissive liturgical cultures).
 - In later polemical contexts counters Reformation tendencies that minimized corporeal presence by providing a liturgical articulation of substantial presence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integrates scholastic categories implicitly (real presence, species/substance) into vernacular liturgical formulae; memorable phrases ("panis angelicus") that shaped devotional vocabulary.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central to Roman Catholic devotion and liturgy from late medieval period through Counter-Reformation; used in Corpus Christi rites and Eucharistic processions.
 - Often used in Catholic catechesis and art/music; occasionally received or translated in Protestant contexts but typically with theological reservations.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies how doctrine can be embodied in worship; useful for teaching the coexistence of intellectual theology and pastoral liturgy.
 - Helpful source when discussing **presence**, **adoration**, and ecclesial practices of **fencing and admission**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adoro te devote:** principal hymn; personal adoration of Christ in the Eucharist; models posture and disposition before Communion.
- **Pange lingua / Tantum ergo:** hymn sequence and final strophe used for Benediction and procession; affirms sacramental presence and appropriateness of adoration.
- **Panis Angelicus:** phrase emphasizing heavenly character of the Eucharist as nourishment for humans.
- **Real Presence:** asserted as the living, personal presence of Christ in the sacrament; central theological claim of the hymns.
- **Species / Substance (implicit):** liturgical language presumes the scholastic distinction (what appears vs. what is) used pastorally rather than philosophically.
- **Adoration (latria):** worship due to God, here applied to the sacrament because of Christ's personal presence; differentiates Eucharistic veneration from mere respect.
- **Fencing and admission:** hymnic insistence on worthiness and reverence undergirds ecclesial practices that regulate who may receive and under what conditions (confession, fasting, pastoral discipline).
 - Supports medieval and Counter-Reformation practices of guarded communion and sacramental discipline.
- **Unworthy reception / sacrilege:** hymns warn against irreverent reception; theological basis for ecclesiastical sanctions and pastoral correction.
- **Eucharistic nourishment / union:** language of feeding and union as soteriological effect of Communion.
- **Corpus Christi (liturgical context):** feast that institutionalized these hymns in public worship and processions; locus for communal adoration.
- **Devotional theology:** hymnody as a secondary theological source that expresses and shapes belief.
- **Liturgical pedagogy:** used to form congregational piety regarding presence and reception.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Catholic Eucharistic devotion and public piety (illustrates belief in presence).
 - As a **polemic and catechetical resource** against views minimizing sacramental presence or laxity in admission.
 - As an **exegetical/liturgical model** showing how theology is taught through hymnody and ritual practice.
