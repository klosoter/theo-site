### TITLE
**Westminster Confession of Faith and Biblical Theology** - Vern Poythress (articles and lectures)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th-early 21st century Reformed academic milieu; Poythress writes from conservative, confessional Reformed scholarship seeking to marry historic confessions with the methods of biblical theology (notably the Vosian redemptive-historical tradition).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the Westminster Confession is a faithful, theologically rich condensation of biblical covenantal structure; properly read, the Confession and biblical theology are complementary disciplines rather than competitors. Confessional formulations function as conceptual maps that must be tested and refined by sustained attention to Scripture's redemptive-historical flow.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of major confessional covenant loci in the WCF (covenant of works, covenant of grace, administrations of the covenant).
 - Methodological reflection on what "biblical theology" means (canonical, redemptive-historical, typological) and how it differs from and interacts with systematic/confessional theology.
 - Mapping exercise: demonstrate how WCF language corresponds to biblical patterns (creation-fall-promise-fulfillment; federal headship; sacramental administrations) while allowing for progressive revelation and typology.
 - Practical admonition: confessions should guide exposition, catechesis, and doctrine formation without supplanting ongoing exegetical work.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutors: Westminster divines (17th c.), Calvinic tradition.
 - Biblical-theology interlocutors: Geerhardus Vos (redemptive-historical method), John Murray on covenant theology.
 - Contemporary contrasts: dispensationalists and exegetical approaches that de-emphasize confessional grids.
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace), revelation and Scripture, Christology (Christ as federal head and mediator), sacramental theology (signs and seals), typology and progressive revelation, federal headship and imputation.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is that the WCF embodies a confessional, covenantal hermeneutic that illumines Scripture's redemptive pattern and should be held as a faithful, but critically engaged, guide within biblical theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stress on the WCF as a *hermeneutical tool* rather than merely a historic artifact; it organizes Scripture's storyline around covenantal acts.
 - Careful insistence that confessional categories must accommodate the Bible's progressive and typological texture.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against readings that treat the Confession as frozen dogma; Poythress situates it within a living exegetical practice.
 - Corrects some biblical-theological tendencies that minimize historic doctrinal articulation by showing how confessions distill and protect insight from exegetical drift.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integration of Vosian redemptive-historical categories with confessional technicalities (e.g., aligning "administrations" of the covenant with stages in the canon).
 - Emphasis on confessional language as a *semantic grid* for preaching and catechesis.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Readily adopted in conservative Reformed seminaries and among pastors seeking robust catechetical frameworks; influential in conversations about confessional subscription and biblical theology.
 - Provokes constructive engagement among those who seek to salvage confessional resources while applying modern canonical and redemptive-historical methods.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to read historic confessions in dialogue with Scripture-led biblical theology.
 - Useful for training pastors to use confessions as exegetical and pedagogical aids without excuse for exegetical negligence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF):** confessional articulation of Reformed doctrine; treated as a compact doctrinal grid for covenantal reading.
- **Biblical Theology:** emphasis on the unfolding of divine revelation in redemptive history; used as the methodological partner to the WCF.
- **Covenant of Works:** pre-fall covenantal structure often used to explain Adam's federal relationship to humanity.
- **Covenant of Grace:** the overarching covenantal economy in which promise and fulfillment in Christ are understood.
- **Federal Headship / Imputation:** Christ as representative/head; foundational for doctrine of justification and covenant continuity.
- **Typology / Types:** persons/events as divinely instituted foreshadowings; used to connect WCF formulations to canonical shapes.
- **Progressive Revelation:** Scripture's self-unfolding over time; justifies reading the Confession in light of the whole canon.
- **Administrations of the Covenant:** the historical modes (law, promise, sacraments) by which covenant blessings are mediated-key for aligning WCF chapters with biblical stages.
- **Signs and Seals (Sacraments):** sacramental theology as covenantal pledges; WCF language clarifies their covenantal function.
- **Canonical Reading:** attention to the Bible as an ordered canon; used to validate confessional summaries against Scripture's trajectory.
- **Subordinate Standard:** the WCF's role relative to Scripture-authoritative for doctrine but subordinate to Scripture's final authority.
- **Confessional Exegesis:** practice of reading and preaching Scripture through confession-informed categories.
- **Redemptive-Historical Method:** Vosian approach emphasizing historical acts of God; serves as Poythress's preferred biblical-theological frame.
- **Confessional Hermeneutic:** using confessional categories as interpretive aids, not replacements for exegesis.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for articulating confessional covenant theology in seminary teaching.
 - As a **polemic** against approaches (e.g., dispensationalism or anti-confessional biblical theology) that sever confessional categories from canonical reading.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching and catechesis that integrates redemptive-historical insights with confessional clarity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses when moving from biblical-theological description to confessional formulation.
