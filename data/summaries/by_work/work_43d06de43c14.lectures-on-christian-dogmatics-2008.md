### TITLE
Lectures on Christian Dogmatics (2008) - John D. Zizioulas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary Orthodox systematic lectures (early 21st century) shaped by late-20th-century renewal in Trinitarian and ecclesial theology; engages patristic sources and modern continental philosophy to address post-Enlightenment ontology and ecclesiology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Reframe the Trinity not as a metaphysical problem of substance but as the ontological ground of personhood: persons exist as hypostatic relations; the distinction and identity of the **ontological** (immanent) and **economic** Trinity must be reinterpreted through relational ontology and ecclesial sacramentality.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critique of substance-based ontologies (Greek metaphysics, Thomistic substantialism, modern individualism) that render persons as isolated subjects.
 - Proposal of **being as communion**: being is fundamentally relational; persons (hypostases) are constituted by inter-personal relations (perichoresis).
 - Reassess the ontological/economic Trinity distinction: the **economic** (God's actions in history, revelation, incarnation, pascha) discloses the **ontological** reality of God; divine hypostases are known and constituted in the economy.
 - Ecclesiology and sacramentality as loci where human personhood participates in Trinitarian life - the Church (Eucharist) is the concrete form of participation in God's communion.
 - Anthropological implications: human personhood is ontologically relational and constituted by participation in the Church; salvation is incorporation into Trinitarian communion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** heavy use of Cappadocians (Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa), Maximus the Confessor; engages Augustine and Western scholastic categories critically; dialogical encounter with moderns (Barth, Balthasar, Rahner, Moltmann) and contemporary philosophy (communicative ontology, existential ontology).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (central), ecclesiology (Eucharist), Christology (incarnation as revelation of hypostatic life), anthropology (personhood), ontology, sacramentology, soteriology as participation.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity: **God is communion; true personhood is hypostatic relationality actualized in the Church's sacramental participation in the economic revelation of the Trinity.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - **Relational ontology** as primary: persons are not substances bearing relations but are constituted by relations (the church as existential space of personhood).
 - **Eucharistic ontogenesis:** the Eucharist is the primary means by which humans are incorporated into Trinitarian being.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Contra Western substance metaphysics (and common readings of Augustine/Aquinas), Zizioulas returns to Cappadocian categories to challenge individualist or atomistic notions of person.
 - Revises the classical immanent/economic distinction by insisting the economic revelation *constitutes* knowledge of the immanent life; revelation and ontological being are inseparable through hypostatic relations.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Reworking of "person" (hypostasis) as existential relationality rather than as an individual substance.
 - Emphasis on **ontology as communion** as a systematic hinge connecting Trinity, Church, and anthropology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - High influence in Orthodox theology, social-Trinitarian discourse, and sacramental/ecclesial theology across traditions.
 - Adopted and critiqued in Reformed and Protestant circles: valued for corrective to individualism and for ecumenical dialogue, but critiqued for possible collapse of immanent/economic distinction or for ecclesiocentrism.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a robust alternative to substance-based personhood; indispensable for studies on Trinitarian social ontology, ecclesial identity, and sacramental anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ontological Trinity (immanent Trinity):** the inner life of God understood as hypostatic relations; for Zizioulas revealed and constituted by the economy.
- **Economic Trinity:** God's actions in history (incarnation, cross, resurrection, sacraments); the revelation that discloses and constitutes the ontological Trinity.
- **Being as Communion:** central heuristic-being is fundamentally relational and participatory rather than substantial and individual.
- **Hypostasis / Person:** existence as a concrete relational centre; personhood is constituted by relations, not by substratum.
- **Perichoresis:** reciprocal interpenetration of divine hypostases used to elucidate relational ontology.
- **Eucharistic Ecclesiology:** the Church and Eucharist as the concrete form where human persons participate in Trinitarian being.
- **Relational Ontology:** metaphysical claim that relations are ontologically prior to distinct individual substances.
- **Participation / Koinonia:** theological anthropology and soteriology framed as participation in divine communion through the Church.
- **Immanence-Economy identity (reinterpreted):** claim that economic revelation is not merely indicative but constitutive of God's ontological reality as known.
- **Anti-substantialist critique:** polemic against metaphysical models that reduce persons to substances or individuals.
- **Patristic retrieval:** methodological reliance on Cappadocian and Byzantine theologians to reconstruct person and being.
- **Ecclesial ontology:** notion that the Church is the ontological locus where human personhood is formed.
- **Anthropological correlate:** human personhood as constituted only within interpersonal and ecclesial communion.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "person" as hypostatic relationality in Trinitarian and anthropological debates.
- As a **polemic** against Western substance-based ontologies and modern individualism.
- As an **exegetical and ecclesiological model** for sacramental theology: Eucharist as ontological participation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in social-Trinitarian and ecumenical discussions, especially in Orthodox-Western dialogues.
