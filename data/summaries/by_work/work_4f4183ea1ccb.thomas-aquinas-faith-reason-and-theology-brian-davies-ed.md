### TITLE
Thomas Aquinas: Faith, Reason, and Theology (Brian Davies, ed.) - selections and readings on faith, reason, and theological method with implications for grace, works, and merit (primary texts: Thomas Aquinas).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 13th-century Latin Scholasticism; Summa Theologiae and Question/commentary literature; synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Augustinian theology. Modern selection edited by Brian Davies highlights Aquinas's method for contemporary theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can human freedom and good works coexist with the primacy and gratuitousness of divine grace so that works can be truly meritorious without making grace a wage?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Grace is antecedent and constitutive: God gratuitously bestows habitual (infused) grace and virtues, principally charity (caritas).
 - Human acts performed in charity and under divine assistance can be **meritorious** because merit presupposes a prior gratuitous gift (grace) and a divine promise of reward.
 - Distinctions deployed:
 - **Condign merit** (meritum de condigno): a fitting, commensurate claim founded on the justice of God as legislator and on a promise tied to infused charity.
 - **Congruent merit** (meritum de congruo): a less strict, due-to-goodness or commended action not strictly owed by justice.
 - Works are consequences and signs of justification and sanctification, not the independent grounds of initial justification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Augustine on grace and human will; Aristotle for virtue and teleology; engages Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian charges and later scholastic critics (e.g., nominalists) implicitly through his distinctions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (habitual and actual), charity, merit (condign vs congruent), free will/cooperation, justification and sanctification, sacraments as means of grace, theological method (faith and reason).
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas locates the theological center of gravity in the priority of gratuitous divine grace that, by constituting charity within the believer, makes human acts genuinely meritorious while preserving God's sovereignty and the gratuity of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes **infused charity** as the ontological basis of merit - works owe their moral worth and claim only to the extent they flow from sanctifying grace.
 - Systematic use of legal and covenantal categories (promise, justice, reward) without reducing grace to a quid pro quo.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Pelagianism: denies sufficiency of nature for salvific merit.
 - Against purely forensic accounts: insists on real internal sanctification (infused virtues), not merely imputed righteousness.
 - Contrasts with later Reformation formulations that reject condign merit and ground justification by faith alone.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Precise technical distinction of **condign** vs **congruent** merit; systematic tying of merit to divine promise and God's distributive justice in relation to grace.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became central to medieval and post-Tridentine Catholic doctrine of merit and the sacraments; principal foil in Protestant-Catholic debates on justification (Council of Trent echoes Thomistic categories).
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers rigorous vocabulary and a mediating account for contemporary ecumenical discussion: preserves divine initiative and human responsibility, provides a bridge for discussing reward, holiness, and ecclesial praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Grace (gratia habitualis / actualis)** - infused habitual grace as the disposition enabling meritorious acts; actual grace as assisting acts.
- **Charity (caritas)** - the infused principal virtue that unites the soul to God and conditions true merit.
- **Merit (meritum)** - a claim to reward; subdivided into:
 - **Condign merit** - a proportionate claim grounded in Christ's merits applied by God's promise and distributive justice.
 - **Congruent merit** - a fitting but gratuitous reward based on benevolence rather than strict justice.
- **Prevenient / antecedent grace** - grace that precedes and enables consent; affirms freedom yet secures priority of God's initiative.
- **Infused virtues vs acquired virtues** - moral/perfective powers given by God as opposed to virtues attained by natural habituation.
- **Cooperation (cooperatio)** - the interplay of free will and divine assistance in moral action; not a rival cause to grace.
- **Justification (iustificatio)** - involves the infusion of righteousness, not merely forensic declaration; linked to sanctification.
- **Sanctification** - the process by which habitual grace increases, leading to meritorious acts.
- **Promise and divine law** - God's promise (voluntas promittendi) grounds the notion of condign merit; God as legislator distributes rewards.
- **Final cause / teleology** - actions measured by ordered end (beatific union); merit judged by conformity to final end.
- **Sacramental economy** - sacraments as ordinary means of infusion and increase of grace, enabling meritorious cooperation.
- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)** - truly operative under grace; its consent is necessary for merit.
- **Merit of increase vs initial justification** - distinction between growth in grace (meriting further goods) and initial reception of justification which remains gratuitous.
- **Analogical predication** - method for speaking about divine justice/merit analogically, avoiding equivocation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Catholic doctrine of merit and the language (condign/congruent).
 - As a **polemic fulcrum** in Protestant-Catholic debates over justification and the role of works.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for sacramental theology and pastoral teaching on growth in holiness.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical dialogues seeking to reconcile divine initiative and human responsibility.
