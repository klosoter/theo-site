### TITLE
Sin and Depravity - Sinclair B. Ferguson, entry in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson & David F. Wright)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed theological summary for a broadly evangelical readership; consolidates confessional Reformed anthropology and soteriology against modern and ecumenical alternatives.
 - Engages historical and contemporary debates (Augustinian/Reformed vs Pelagian/Arminian emphases) within covenantal framework.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human sin is both universal and radical: sin penetrates the whole person (mind, will, affections) so that unregenerate humanity is unable to respond savingly to God apart from sovereign grace.
 - The proper theological response locates sin in original corruption, actual transgression, and culpability while preserving moral responsibility and the continued though distorted presence of the imago Dei.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and biblical basis: treats sin as both condition and act, citing Pauline and covenantal texts (esp. Romans, Psalms, Genesis, Jeremiah).
 - Historical-theological summary: traces Augustinian and Reformed formulations (Calvin, Westminster, Dordt) and contrasts them with Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian and Arminian alternatives.
 - Analytical distinctions:
 - **Extent vs. degree**: "total" as comprehensive, not absolute (not every faculty is as depraved as possible).
 - **Depravity vs. inability**: moral corruption that results in spiritual inability to seek God.
 - **Original vs. actual sin**: inherited corruption and guilt (federal headship) vs concrete sinful acts.
 - Pastoral and soteriological implications: necessity of regeneration, role of common/prevenient grace, Christ as covenant head who rectifies federal ruin.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine and Calvin as primary proponents; Pelagius, semi-Pelagians, Arminians as opponents. Occasional reference to Thomistic and modern liberal positions for contrast.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology, sin (original and actual), imputation (federal headship), grace (common, prevenient in Reformed sense vs Arminian), regeneration, soteriology, covenant theology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Reformed teaching insists that sin is radically pervasive and that only sovereign, divine regeneration can restore the fallen will and enable a saving response to God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Precise confessional framing**
 - Ferguson reiterates classic Reformed language (total depravity, total inability) but consistently qualifies "total" to avoid caricature.
- **Balanced nuance**
 - Stresses that depravity affects all faculties yet leaves natural capacities intact for civic and cultural goods under common grace.
- **Covenantal emphasis**
 - Interprets original sin through federal headship: Adam's failure brings representative guilt and corruption; Christ's headship secures restoration.
- **Correction of rivals**
 - Counters Pelagian/Arminian tendencies by defending the necessity of sovereign regeneration; counters antinomian misreadings by affirming moral responsibility and exhortation.
- **Terminological clarity**
 - Distinguishes inability to initiate salvation from general human competence; resists the idea that total depravity equals total impotence in every human arena.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed teaching and pastoral training as a clear, compact statement; serves as a go-to summary for confessional formulations against modern revisions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students as a concise exegetical-theological synthesis connecting biblical texts, historical formulations, and pastoral implications without sectarian polemic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity**
 - The pervasive corruption of human nature after the Fall; "total" = all-encompassing, not absolute annihilation of faculties.
- **Total Inability**
 - The unregenerate person's incapacity to turn to God in saving faith without divine regeneration.
- **Original Sin**
 - Inherited corruption and guilt via federal headship (Adam); explanatory link between Genesis and Pauline anthropology.
- **Actual Sin**
 - Concrete sinful acts arising from a corrupt nature; distinction preserves moral culpability.
- **Imputation**
 - Federal accounting: Adam's sin imputed to his descendants; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Image of God distorted but not destroyed; basis for residual moral capacity and responsibility.
- **Common Grace**
 - God's restraining and enabling grace that allows social, cultural, and civic goods despite depravity.
- **Prevenient / Effectual Grace**
 - Reformed emphasis on sovereign grace that precedes and secures regeneration (distinguished from Arminian prevenient grace).
- **Bondage of the Will**
 - Notion that the will is bound by sin and needs liberation by the Spirit; compatibilist account of freedom and responsibility.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace**
 - Framework for understanding original covenantal failure and Christ's representative obedience.
- **Moral Responsibility**
 - Affirmed: depravity does not remove guilt or accountability.
- **Extent vs. Degree**
 - Clarifies "total" as scope (affects all areas) rather than intensity (complete corruption of every faculty).
- **Representative Headship**
 - Adam as federal head; Christ as covenant head and mediator.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for Reformed anthropological and soteriological claims (seminaries, courses).
- As a **polemic/clarificatory tool** against Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and softening of depravity in liberal theology.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** for reading Pauline texts on sin, grace, and justification within covenantal contours.
