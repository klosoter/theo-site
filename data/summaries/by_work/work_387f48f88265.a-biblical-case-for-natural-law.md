### TITLE
A Biblical Case for Natural Law - David VanDrunen (Oxford University Press, 2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed theological context addressing late 20th-21st century skepticism about natural law within Protestantism.
 - Conversation partners include Roman Catholic natural-law tradition, modern natural-law philosophers, and sceptical Protestant trends (neo-orthodoxy, some streams of Reformed anti-natural-law thought).
 - Practical relevance for debates in political theology, Christian ethics, and public life.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible provides a coherent, scriptural foundation for a durable theory of natural law: a creation-constituted moral order accessible to human reason and conscience, morally binding on all people and relevant to civil government and cultural life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation
 - Survey of Old Testament data (Genesis creation ordinances, the Noahic covenant, wisdom literature, law) showing a created moral order.
 - New Testament confirmation (Pauline appeals to conscience and general revelation; Christ's fulfillment of the law).
 - Theological synthesis
 - Natural law is rooted in creation, mediated covenantally (Noahic covenant as universal moral-civic framework), and interpreted in light of special revelation.
 - Sin distorts but does not obliterate natural knowledge of God's moral order; common grace preserves civil order.
 - Practical implications
 - Natural law constrains civil legislation and informs magistrate duties; it frames Christian engagement with culture without collapsing into autonomous rationalism.
 - Polemical moves
 - Replies to Roman Catholic accounts that detach natural law from Scripture and to Protestant denials that reduce moral knowledge to special revelation alone.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Biblical witnesses (Genesis, Psalms, wisdom literature, Pauline corpus).
 - Historical figures: Augustine, Calvin (Reformed tradition), Thomas Aquinas, Grotius, and modern theorists (e.g., John Finnis indirectly).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Protestant critics who reject natural law, and Catholic natural-law theorists.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), covenant theology (esp. Noahic), doctrine of sin/original sin, conscience, common grace, law (moral/ceremonial/civil distinctions), Christology and eschatology as qualifiers of natural law's consummation.

- **Closing line**
 - Natural law, properly grounded in Scripture and shaped by covenantal theology, is a biblically warranted, creation-origin moral order that binds conscience, guides civil authority, and orients Christian cultural witness pending eschatological consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Scripture-first grounding: VanDrunen insists natural law must be explicated and constrained by biblical revelation rather than by autonomous philosophical systems.
 - Covenantal framing: highlights the Noahic covenant as the canonical locus for a universal moral order applicable to all peoples and nations.
 - Practical magistrate focus: sustained attention to how natural law informs civil government responsibilities in Reformed political theology.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against radical Protestant rejection: corrects tendencies to deny any abiding natural moral knowledge outside special revelation.
 - Against certain Catholic accounts: resists the notion that natural law can be fully articulated apart from Scripture or that philosophical epistemology alone secures it.
 - Reorients Thomistic abstractions into an explicitly biblical, covenant-shaped schema.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Uses covenant categories (Noahic covenant) as hermeneutical hinge for natural-law claims.
 - Emphasizes "creation-constituted" rather than purely "natural-reason" language to stress theological grounding.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Rapid uptake in Reformed ethics, seminaries, and conservative Protestant political theology.
 - Useful bridge in Protestant-Catholic dialogue on moral law.
 - Critiques: some philosophers fault limited engagement with analytic natural-law literature; some evangelicals remain wary of perceived extra-biblical moral reasoning.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear exegetical case linking Genesis-Romans to public morality.
 - Pedagogical utility for teaching law, covenant, and magistrate roles.
 - Durable resource for confessional Reformed engagement with public theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural law** - moral norms rooted in creation, accessible to human reason and conscience; biblically mediated.
- **Creation-constituted order** - moral structure embedded in created relations and purposes (male/female, work, stewardship).
- **Noahic covenant** - universal, covenantal framework that VanDrunen identifies as the biblical locus for obligations binding all peoples.
- **General revelation** - God's self-disclosure in nature and conscience that yields moral knowledge.
- **Common grace** - divine restraint of sin that preserves knowledge of moral order and civil life.
- **Conscience** - human faculty reflecting the law written on hearts (Rom 2) and serving as witness to natural law.
- **Moral law (law of nature and nations)** - norms distinguishing right/wrong for societies and magistrates, not identical to ceremonial law.
- **Magistrate / civil government** - responsible to enforce natural justice and restrain evil, guided by natural-law norms.
- **Eschatological consummation** - Christ's fulfillment of the law; natural law endures but finds ultimate completion in the new creation.
- **Commonwealth ethics** - application of natural law to public policy and legal order.
- **Scripture-first methodology** - insistence that biblical exegesis controls natural-law claims.
- **Sin's effect on knowing** - account of how fallibility distorts but does not erase natural moral cognition.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Church And State Relations - as a biblical-theological warrant for magistrate duties, civil justice, and limits on legislation based on creation-order and Noahic norms.
 - Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective - to argue Christians should engage and reform culture according to enduring creation norms while anticipating Christ's consummation; natural law orients cultural stewardship without eschatological triumphalism.
 - Pedagogical/polemical uses - standard Reformed definition source for natural law in curricula; used polemically against secularist and anti-natural-law Protestant positions.
