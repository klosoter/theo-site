### TITLE
Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word - Walter J. Ong (1982)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1982; Ong, a Jesuit cultural historian and literary scholar, writing amid rising interest in media theory (McLuhan) and oral-formulaic studies (Parry, Lord) and responding to anthropologists (Goody) and classicists.
 - Cross-disciplinary milieu: literary studies, anthropology, media studies; seized on by theology, biblical studies, missiology and homiletics.

- **Central thesis**
 - **The medium of expression (oral vs. literate) fundamentally restructures human consciousness.** Alphabetic literacy is not a neutral tool but a technology that reorganizes memory, thought, argument, interiority, and social relations; oral cultures manifest different cognitive patterns and rhetorics.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-philosophical tracing of the consequences of alphabetic writing from antiquity to modernity.
 - Characterization of features of primary oral cultures (formulaic composition, redundancy, additive thought, situationality, participatory worldview).
 - Analysis of literacy effects: abstraction, conceptualization, interiorization, detachment, analytic and classificatory thinking, linear causality, and autonomous authorship.
 - Introduction of continuum distinctions: **primary orality**, **residual orality**, **secondary orality** (electronic media revival).
 - Application: implications for rhetoric, religion, law, education, and transmission of sacred texts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Builds on Parry and Lord (oral-formulaic theory), dialogues with Goody, McLuhan, classical sources (Plato/Socrates on writing), and modern linguistics/psychology.
 - Engages implicitly with hermeneutical concerns of biblical scholars and historians of religion.

- **Doctrines treated (implicit/heuristic)**
 - Not a systematic theological treatise, but affects:
 - **Revelation** (how Word is mediated and received),
 - **Scripture/Canon** (oral transmission vs. textualization),
 - **Preaching and liturgy** (orality as communal memory),
 - **Ecclesiology and tradition** (authority rooted in communicative form),
 - **Hermeneutics** (contexts of interpretation: oral mentality vs. literate exegesis).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The form in which the Word is communicated shapes the community that receives it and the theological forms it can take; to understand Christian origins, reception, and proclamation we must integrate media-technology as formative of theological consciousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats literacy as a technology with cognitive and social consequences rather than mere skill; emphasizes **qualitative shifts** in cognition tied to alphabetic writing.
 - Highlights **secondary orality** (electronic media recreating oral patterns within literate societies) - significant for modern liturgy, preaching, and evangelism.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond romanticized 'progress' narratives (writing = progress) to a nuanced account of gains and losses: literacy enables abstraction and critical thought but diminishes communal mnemonic modes and participatory immediacy.
 - Refines Parry/Lord's focus on formulaic composition by situating oral features within a broader cultural and cognitive transformation effected by writing.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operational distinctions: **primary orality**, **residual orality**, **secondary orality**; the phrase **"technologizing of the word"** encapsulates his central move.
 - Catalog of oral stylistic features (redundancy, aggregation, rhythm, performance-dependent memory) as cognitive symptoms, not merely stylistic curiosities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in homiletics, missiology, biblical studies and liturgical theology to rethink oral transmission, Gospel formation, and contemporary communication strategies.
 - Influential for those studying early Christianity's communicative milieu; also critiqued for overgeneralization and insufficient engagement with variability within oral cultures.
 - In Reformed and wider Protestant theology used as a heuristic for understanding preaching's oral art and for contextual mission strategies; Catholic and ecumenical scholars similarly employ it in liturgy and patristics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for integrating media theory into theological method; prompts re-evaluation of assumptions about textual primacy, authority, and memory.
 - Pedagogically valuable for training preachers, missionaries, and biblical interpreters to attend to medium-specific effects on reception.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Primary orality**
 - Cultures entirely without writing; mnemonic and participatory modes dominate cognition and discourse.

- **Residual orality**
 - Societies literate in some respects but retaining oral traits (e.g., communal storytelling, liturgy).

- **Secondary orality**
 - New oral-like speech patterns produced by electronic media in literate societies (radio, TV, internet).

- **Technologizing of the word**
 - Core concept: technologies (especially alphabetic writing) transform how the word operates socially and cognitively.

- **Formulaic composition**
 - Recurrent phrases and patterns that support oral memory and performance; explanatory for oral layers in scriptural traditions.

- **Redundancy / Additive/Aggregative style**
 - Oral tendency to repeat and accumulate information for memory and emphasis, contrasted with literate condensation.

- **Situational vs. Abstract thought**
 - Oral discourse anchored in present contexts and communities; literacy fosters decontextualized, abstract concepts.

- **Interiorization**
 - Literacy's promotion of private, reflexive consciousness and self-critical thought.

- **Authorial autonomy / textuality**
 - Literacy produces discrete texts and author-centered authorship; orality privileges communal performance and fluidity.

- **Participatory consciousness**
 - Oral cultures experience thought as communal and present-tense participation rather than detached analysis.

- **Acoustic space**
 - A concept borrowed/in dialogue with media theory: the sensory, communal orientation of oral worlds vs. visual space of texts.

- **Mnemonic techniques**
 - Structural devices (meter, chorus, repetition) enabling reliable oral transmission.

- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "orality" and "literate mentality" in hermeneutics and historical theology.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against assumptions of textual primacy when reconstructing early Christian transmission and authority.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Gospel forms, Pauline rhetoric, and the relationship between oral tradition and final texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for preaching, liturgy, and mission strategy - informing how the Word is presented to oral, literate, or digitally mediated audiences.
