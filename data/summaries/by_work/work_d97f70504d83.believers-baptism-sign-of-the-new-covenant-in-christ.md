### TITLE
Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ - Bruce A. Ware

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical-Reformed milieu responding to longstanding debates over paedobaptism vs. credobaptism. 
 - Situated within renewed interest in covenant theology and New Covenant hermeneutics among evangelicals and Baptists seeking a biblically grounded account of baptismal practice.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Baptism is the New Covenant sign and seal instituted for those who are actual recipients of covenant promises in Christ - that is, professing believers - and therefore properly administered to believers (and baptically-believing households where faith is present), not as a pledge to biological descendants without faith.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Exegetical layer: careful treatment of key NT texts (household baptisms, baptism as "seal" language, Pauline and Johannine references) to show baptism's function as covenant entrance tied to faith. 
 - Biblical-theological layer: tracing continuity and discontinuity between circumcision (Old Covenant sign) and baptism (New Covenant sign), arguing continuity of typology but discontinuity in application because the New Covenant is mediated by promise and faith. 
 - Theological layer: integration with doctrines of regeneration, justification, church membership, and sacramental efficacy - baptism symbolizes and marks what faith has already effected, not effecting regeneration ex opere operato. 
 - Polemical layer: critiques of paedobaptist arguments that rely on natural descent, presumed covenantal inclusion, or sacramental ontologies that locate efficacy in the rite itself.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages the Reformed covenant tradition in broad strokes (classical covenant theologians and contemporary defenders of infant baptism), New Testament exegesis, and Baptist/credobaptist commentators and pastors. 
 - Interlocutors include advocates of covenant infant membership, sacramental accounts of baptism, and those emphasizing household-baptism precedents.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Covenant theology**, sacramentology, ecclesiology (church membership and discipline), soteriology (regeneration and conversion), biblical authority and hermeneutics.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Baptism is the covenantal sign and seal of the New Covenant that visibly marks entrance into Christ's people by virtue of personal faith; it preserves covenant continuity while relocating covenant membership from biological descent to professing faith in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Stresses **promise-conditioned continuity**: baptism continues the typological role of circumcision but only for those who receive covenant promises by faith. 
 - Emphasizes the normative connection between **regeneration/faith prior to baptism** and the proper meaning of the rite as sign, not cause, of covenant membership.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Counters paedobaptist appeals to household inclusion by arguing that household baptisms must be interpreted in light of explicit faith professions or New Covenant fulfillment principles, not automatic infant inclusion. 
 - Pushes back on sacramental systems that ascribe intrinsic salvific efficacy to the ritual act.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes classic circumcision-baptism typology in terms of **promise reception vs. biological descent**, clarifying how typology functions across covenants.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used among evangelicals and Baptists as a clear, theologically robust defense of credobaptism; contested by Reformed paedobaptist scholars but adopted as a standard apologetic and catechetical resource in credobaptist circles.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a compact, covenantal framework linking exegesis and doctrine; useful for pastors, seminarians, and scholars engaged in sacramental theology, church order, and pastoral catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Believer's baptism (credobaptism):** Baptism administered to those who profess faith; the author's primary conviction and normative practice. 
- **New Covenant:** The covenant inaugurated by Christ, characterized by internal promises of regeneration and faith; baptism is its sign/seal. 
- **Sign and seal:** Language denoting baptism's role as visible sign and confirming seal of God's covenant promises - symbolic, evidential, not magically efficacious. 
- **Circumcision-baptism typology:** Continuity of sign-function across covenants; continuity in typology but discontinuity in application (promise/faith vs. descent). 
- **Household baptisms:** NT data (e.g., Acts households) read as consistent with credobaptism when interpreted with attention to expressed faith or covenant promise dynamics. 
- **Covenant continuity and discontinuity:** Analytical frame distinguishing what transfers (typological sign function) and what changes (criteria for inclusion). 
- **Regeneration prior to baptism:** The claim that baptism ordinarily follows (or accompanies the public evidence of) inward work of the Spirit and credible faith. 
- **Paedobaptism (infant baptism):** The alternative view critiqued; treated as insufficiently attentive to New Covenant promise-conditions. 
- **Sacramental efficacy:** Theological locus discussed to deny automatic saving power in the rite itself; baptism is significatory, not instrumental cause of salvation. 
- **Covenant membership:** Ecclesiological status tied to profession of faith under Ware's model, not mere biological descent. 
- **Baptismal entrance:** Concept tying baptism to visible incorporation into the church as a consequence of faith.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for credobaptist accounts of the New Covenant sign. 
 - As a **polemic** against paedobaptism in denominational debates and confessional revision. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for treating household texts and baptismal theology in NT studies. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral teaching on church membership, catechesis, and the order of conversion and sacrament.
