### TITLE
Aquinas on Faith, Hope, and Love (selected translations and secondary analyses)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 13th-century Latin scholasticism; principal texts in Summa Theologiae (Prima Secundae, qq. 62-113; Secunda Secundae on virtues), and selected Quaestiones Disputatae. Aquinas synthesizes **Aristotelian virtue theory** with Augustinian and patristic theology within the medieval sacramental and penitential milieu.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The theological virtues-faith, hope, charity-are infused habits by which humans are elevated toward the supernatural end (beatific vision). They order intellect, will, and affections to God, ground sanctifying grace, and thereby figure centrally in Aquinas's account of justification, merit, and salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Philosophical presupposition: virtues as habitual dispositions (Aristotle) revised by supernatural end.
 - Nature of the theological virtues:
 - **Faith:** intellectual assent and habitus (fides qua) informed by revelation (fides quae); a supernatural habit that moves intellect and will toward divine truths.
 - **Hope:** confident desire for eternal beatitude, ordered to the means and to God as last end.
 - **Charity (love):** love of God for his own sake; the form of all virtues and the principal perfection of the soul.
 - Relation to grace and justification:
 - Virtues are **infused** by God as part of sanctifying grace; they are causes of meritorious acts and play a constitutive role in moral transformation.
 - Justification is primarily an **interior sanctification (infused righteousness)**, though Aquinas allows a forensic declaration inasmuch as the soul's state is objectively rightened by grace.
 - Moral-ecclesial corollaries: sacraments as ordinary channels of infusion; merit as participation in divine goodness, with human cooperation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Aristotle, Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, classical and patristic authorities; polemically engaged by later Reformers (Luther, Calvin) and by post-Reformation debates (Council of Trent). In modern discussion Aquinas is contrasted with Reformed emphases (e.g., imputed righteousness, sola fide) and sometimes compared with Federal Vision concerns over covenantal efficacy.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, grace (sanctifying/operative), virtue theory, Trinity indirectly (as beatific exemplar), Christology (merits of Christ as source of infusion), sacraments, justification, faith and works relation.
- **Closing line:** Aquinas cements a comprehensive account in which faith, hope, and charity are supernatural habits infused by grace that transform the soul toward God, providing the metaphysical and moral scaffolding for justification as inward sanctification ordered to the beatific end.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Charity as the **form of the Christian virtues**-it shapes and perfects other virtues, morally and ontologically.
 - Faith conceived both as **habit (fides qua)** and as **content (fides quae)**, distinguishing assent from the living trust that issues in works.
 - Robust realist metaphysics undergirding grace: virtues are real habitudes, not merely legal statuses.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Refines Augustine by systematizing Aristotelian categories; departs from purely forensic accounts of justification by insisting on interior transformation.
 - In contrast to typical Reformation formulations (imputed righteousness/sole fide), Aquinas emphasizes infused righteousness and cooperative merit-hence a major point of contention with Protestant soteriology.
 - With respect to Federal Vision debates: some FV emphases on covenantal status and objective belonging to Christ echo Aquinas's concern for objective sacramental efficacy, but Aquinas remains distinct in locating justification primarily in interior sanctifying union rather than solely covenantal forensic declarations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** formalizing "theological virtues" as distinct infusions; clear separation of habit and act; notion of charity as constitutive form; detailed taxonomy of faith's acts (assent, understanding, trust).
- **Reception and influence:** Central to medieval and Roman Catholic moral theology and to Trent's response to Protestantism; frequently critiqued by Reformers; influential resources for ecumenical dialogues on faith, works, and justification; periodically revived in contemporary theology and pastoral practice.
- **Enduring value:** Provides precise conceptual tools for theology of virtue, sacrament, and sanctification; durable framework for debates on justification (including modern treatments of Federal Vision and imputation vs infusion).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theological virtues:** faith, hope, charity-infused habits ordering the person to God.
- **Fides qua / fides quae:** distinction between the act/habit of believing and the content believed.
- **Habit (habitus) vs. actus:** virtues as stable dispositions (habitus) that ground moral acts (actus).
- **Infused virtues:** virtues given directly by God (not acquired by natural habit), foundational for sanctifying grace.
- **Charity (caritas):** love of God as end; the form of all virtues that unites the soul to God.
- **Faith as intellectual assent + trust:** combines understanding of revealed truths with reliance on God-bridges cognition and will.
- **Hope (spes):** desire for supernatural beatitude coupled with confident expectation based on God's promises.
- **Sanctifying grace:** habitual participation in Divine life that renders the soul righteous-basis for merit.
- **Justification (Thomistic sense):** primarily inward rectification via infused righteousness; not reducible to mere declarative imputation.
- **Imputed vs infused righteousness:** Aquinas affirms infusion (internal change) and allows objective reckoning, differing from classic Reformed imputation-only models.
- **Merit and cooperatio:** human acts ordered by grace can be meritorious through cooperation with divine gift.
- **Sacramental economy:** sacraments as ordinary means of grace and infusion of virtues.
- **Form of the virtues:** charity as the principle shaping other virtues toward their supernatural end.
- **Certitudo fidei:** intellectual certainty rooted in divine testimony and ecclesial mediation.
- **Beatific end:** God as ultimate final cause giving teleological unity to the virtues.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for the theological virtues and sacramental theology.
 - As a **polemical resource** in debates over justification (countering imputation-only positions).
 - As an **exegetical and ethical model** for interpreting Pauline texts on faith and love and for teaching Christian moral formation.
