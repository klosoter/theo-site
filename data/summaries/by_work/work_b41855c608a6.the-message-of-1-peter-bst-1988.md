### TITLE
**Edmund P. Clowney, The Message of 1 Peter (Bible Speaks Today; IVP, 1988)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late-20th-century conservative Reformed evangelical exegesis. BST series aims at pastorally oriented, readable commentary for preaching and church life.
 - Clowney writes from Reformed pastoral-theological perspective emphasizing covenant community and worship.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - 1 Peter presents the church as God's **suffering, priestly people**: called to holy living and faithful witness under persecution, sustained by Christ's suffering and vindication.
 - The epistle addresses how identity (elect exiles) shapes conduct, worship, and church order in a hostile world.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical exposition of 1 Peter that moves from identity to practice:
 - Introduction: election, living hope, new birth (1:1-2:3).
 - Ethical consequences: holiness, household and social relations (2:4-3:12).
 - Suffering and witness: Christ as pattern, submit to authorities, suffer for righteousness (3:13-4:19).
 - Leadership, church order, and eschatological hope: elders, discipline, encouragement (5:1-14).
 - Persistent pastoral thrust: text → exhortation → congregational application.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues implicitly with **Reformation and Puritan pastoral tradition**, patristic readings of 1 Peter, and contemporary evangelical NT scholarship. Clowney integrates theological reflection with careful verse-by-verse exegesis rather than technical critical engagement.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (suffering, exaltation, servant motif); **soteriology** (election, living hope); **ecclesiology** (priesthood, elders/office, discipline, visible church life); **ethics** (holiness, submission); **eschatology** (future vindication); implicit treatment of sacramental identity (baptismal imagery).

- **Closing line**
 - Clowney's theological center: 1 Peter summons a covenant community, shaped by the cross and living hope, to disciplined, holy witness-expressed in ordered, accountable church life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that theology must directly shape **pastoral practice**: doctrine of election and Christ's suffering yields specific patterns of worship, discipline, and leadership.
 - Treats the church not merely as a spiritual reality but as an **ordered, visible covenant community** with offices and discipline.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters pietistic or individualistic readings that detach moral exhortations from corporate ecclesial contexts.
 - Offers an alternative to purely sociological readings of 1 Peter by foregrounding theological identity (elect exiles) rather than primarily social adaptation.

- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Recasts New Testament motifs (exile/sojourner, priesthood, cornerstone) into a **pastoral ecclesiology**: offices and discipline are not bureaucratic add-ons but means for sustaining the church's witness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries and churches for preaching and pastoral training; valued for clarity and applicability rather than technical critical novelty.
 - Influenced debates on church order within conservative Presbyterian and Reformed circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of **pastoral exegesis**: theological depth married to concrete guidance for eldership, discipline, and congregational life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elect / election**
 - Foundation for identity: suffering people chosen to a living hope; undergirds pastoral assurance and perseverance.

- **Sojourner / exile (parepidemos)**
 - Christians as temporary residents; frames ethical distinctiveness and witness in hostile cultures.

- **Royal priesthood / priesthood**
 - Corporate priestly identity-worship and witness responsibilities that shape communal life and discipline.

- **Cornerstone / Christ the living Stone**
 - Christ as foundation for the community and for suffering vindicated by God; basis for unity and doctrinal fidelity.

- **Holiness (hagiasmos)**
 - Ethical demand flowing from election; practical outworking in social and household relations.

- **Suffering / redemptive suffering**
 - Christological model for persecution; suffering interpreted theologically as participation in Christ and as witness.

- **Elders / overseers / shepherds**
 - Office-language treated as normative for church government and pastoral responsibility; basis for ordained leadership and care.

- **Discipline**
 - Seen as necessary for visible church purity and witness; not merely punitive but restorative and covenantal.

- **Submission / household codes**
 - Social ethics located within covenant community, balanced by gospel-centered mutual submission.

- **Visible church**
 - Community governed and disciplined visibly; locus of sacraments, office, and public witness.

- **Invisible church (elect people)**
 - Distinction retained: God's elect and their sure standing, even as the visible community can be mixed and in need of discipline.

- **Hope / eschatological living**
 - Living hope anchors endurance and shapes present conduct toward holy witness.

- **Baptismal imagery**
 - Used as identity marker (new birth, new priesthood) that grounds vocation and communal rites.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model and pastoral-theological resource** for preaching and training elders, especially in Reformed contexts.
- Employed in discussions of **Church Government / Presbyterian Polity / Offices / Discipline**: provides biblical warrant for elder-led oversight and disciplined visible church life.
- Cited in treatments of the **Visible and Invisible Church distinction**: balances assurance of election with the need for visible order, worship, and corrective discipline.
