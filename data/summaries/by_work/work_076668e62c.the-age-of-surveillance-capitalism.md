### TITLE
**The Age of Surveillance Capitalism - Shoshana Zuboff**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2019 amid heightened public concern about data privacy, Cambridge Analytica, and growing dominance of Big Tech (Google, Facebook, Amazon).
 - Situated at the intersection of social theory, political economy, and digital ethics; draws on scholarship in sociology, business history, and critical theory rather than theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Surveillance capitalism** is a novel economic logic that claims human experience as free raw material for commercial extraction, creating predictive products and new forms of power that subvert autonomy and democratic life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Historical emergence - traces origins in behavioral experiments, advertising markets, and tech business models.
 - Part II: Mechanisms and logic - defines key practices (data capture, behavioral surplus, prediction products) and institutional structures.
 - Part III: Political and social consequences - describes **instrumentarian power**, the transformation of public/private boundaries, and threats to human agency and democracy.
 - Part IV: Resistance and remedy - normative appeal for regulation, collective action, and reasserting human sovereignty.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages economists, information scientists, tech executives (as case studies), Foucault implicitly (power/knowledge themes), and critical theorists; dialogues with neoliberal critiques but emphasizes emergent capitalist mutation rather than simple continuation.
- **Doctrines treated (theological relevance)**
 - Not explicitly theological, but intersects with: **anthropology** (human agency, personhood), **sin/ethics** (commodification, domination), **ecclesiology** (public square and community practices), **eschatology** (visions of future social order), and **revelation** (mediated knowledge vs. embodied witness).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Zuboff frames a secular theological problem: the commodification of human interiority and the rise of a prophetic-political task to reclaim human dignity, autonomy, and communal flourishing from a new, quasi-religious market power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames data extraction as an ontological enclosure: not just information gathering but the conversion of lived experience into marketable prediction.
 - Distinguishes **surveillance capitalism** from earlier market forms by its reliance on **behavioral surplus** - data beyond what is needed for service improvement, used to predict and modify behavior.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against techno-utopian narratives that portray platforms as neutral marketplaces; argues they are purposive, designing environments to shape conduct.
 - Differentiates from classical critiques of capitalism by treating surveillance as both economic and epistemic power - an economy of knowledge that restructures subjectivity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - **Surveillance capitalism**, **behavioral surplus**, **prediction products**, **instrumentarian power**, **the Big Other** (a market-social actor that knows and nudges).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Quickly appropriated by ethicists and public theologians as analytic vocabulary for pastoral and social critique.
 - In Reformed circles: used to critique neoliberal individualism and market theology; informs discussions on vocation, stewardship, and common good.
 - Wider theology and religious studies: prompts engagement with sacramental presence, formation of conscience, and ecclesial resistance to commodifying logics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a robust conceptual toolkit for diagnosing modern threats to agency and communal life.
 - Serves as a case study for interdisciplinary dialogue between theology, social ethics, and political economy.
 - Provokes curricular modules on digitality, power, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Surveillance capitalism**
 - The economic system that monetizes human experience through continuous data capture and behavior prediction.
- **Behavioral surplus**
 - Data collected beyond what is necessary for service delivery; the raw material for creating prediction products.
- **Prediction products**
 - Commodified forecasts of human behavior sold to advertisers, firms, and political actors.
- **Instrumentarian power**
 - A form of power that aims not primarily at persuasion or consent but at shaping behavior through data-driven instruments.
- **The Big Other**
 - The emergent, quasi-sovereign corporate actor that monitors, knows, and influences populations.
- **Epistemic enclosure**
 - The narrowing of knowledge regimes where corporate analytics determine what counts as knowable and actionable about persons.
- **Radical indifference**
 - The market's disregard for human meaning and dignity when extracting behavioral data for profit.
- **Privatized prediction economy**
 - The enclosure of public experience into proprietary predictive markets, displacing democratic deliberation.
- **Surveillance as governance**
 - The substitution of mechanistic behavioral modification for political and moral formation.
- **Algorithmic nudging**
 - Techniques for steering behavior subtly by design choices in platforms and interfaces.
- **Commodification of the interior**
 - Transforming subjective life - attention, habits, emotions - into tradable assets.
- **Data colonialism (related)**
 - Analogy underscoring asymmetries of extraction and dispossession in the digital order.
- **Human autonomy at stake**
 - Conceptual focal point for ethical and theological response concerning freedom and moral agency.
- **Remediation (policy, collective action)**
 - Proposed corrective: legal regulation, public ownership models, and culture-shaping resistance.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: gives precise vocabulary for diagnosing digital commodification in social ethics syllabi.
 - As a **polemic**: undergirds critiques of neoliberal and techno-utopian theology that conflates market efficiency with human flourishing.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: supplies frameworks for ecclesiology and pastoral theology to articulate practices resisting commodifying logics (formation, liturgy, confidentiality).
 - As an **exegetical model**: used analogically in theological interpretation to read Scripture and tradition against forms of domination that colonize inner life.
