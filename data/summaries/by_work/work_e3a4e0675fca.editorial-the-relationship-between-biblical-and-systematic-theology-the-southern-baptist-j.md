### TITLE
Editorial: The Relationship Between Biblical and Systematic Theology (Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, 2005) - Stephen Wellum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-2000s evangelical/Reformed renewal within Southern Baptist and broader conservative Protestant theological education; rise of redemptive-historical and canonical approaches to Scripture; institutional interest at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in clarifying method and curriculum.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Biblical theology and systematic theology are distinct but mutually necessary disciplines; biblical theology, properly understood, supplies the historically sensitive, canonical description of God's self-revelation that must inform and correct systematic construction of doctrine.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define the two disciplines: biblical theology as the diachronic, redemptive-historical description of revelation; systematic theology as the synoptic, locus-based synthesis and application of doctrine.
 - Trace methodological tensions: tendency for biblical theology to be descriptive and for systematic theology to become ahistorical or schematic.
 - Argue for a constructive integration: biblical theology provides the interpretive contours and Christocentric storyline; systematic theology organizes the data into coherent doctrinal loci that serve the church and confession.
 - Offer normative implications: exegetical practice, confessional fidelity, and theological education should reflect this interplay.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** draws on and positions itself relative to figures in the contemporary conversation - Geerhardus Vos (historical priority of biblical theology), Brevard S. Childs and the canonical approach, and Protestant evangelical expositors advocating redemptive-historical reading (e.g., Goldsworthy-style interpreters); interacts implicitly with systematicians who risk de-historicizing doctrine.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and Scripture (authority, unity), covenant and redemptive history, Christology (centrality of Christ in the storyline), hermeneutics (canonical, typological, and diachronic methods), and the practice of doctrinal formulation.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Biblical theology provides the historically grounded, Christ-centered map of Scripture's unfolding revelation that must guide and discipline systematic theology as it formulates doctrine for the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the *normative* priority of the biblical story (redemptive history) for doctrinal formation without collapsing the normative role of confessional systematic reflection.
 - Emphasizes both diachronic (history of revelation) and synchronic (canonical unity) aspects of biblical theology as essential to theological synthesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters readings that either elevate biblical theology to the exclusion of systematic ordering or that reduce biblical theology to mere background for abstract doctrinal schemas.
 - Pushes back against systematicians who ignore the developmental and eschatological dimensions of revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Framing the relationship as a disciplined interplay rather than a hierarchy that silences one or the other; recommends methodological reciprocity - biblical theology frames, systematic theology formulates.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a concise programmatic statement for curriculum and faculty formation.
 - Cited in debates over biblical-theological methods and used to justify integrated programs that require both redemptive-historical exegesis and confessional systematic work.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a clear pedagogical paradigm for training ministers and scholars: learn the storyline of Scripture, then synthesize responsibly for doctrine and ministry.
 - Durable as a corrective to both historicist reductionism and abstract doctrinalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology:** the discipline that traces the progressive, historical disclosure of God in Scripture; emphasizes storyline and redemptive-historical development.
- **Systematic theology:** the discipline that organizes biblical teaching into doctrinal loci for coherent Christian belief, worship, and praxis.
- **Redemptive-historical:** approach that reads Scripture as a unified narrative of God's saving work culminating in Christ.
- **Canonical approach:** attention to the final form of the biblical canon as normative for theology and interpretation.
- **Diachronic method:** reading Scripture in its historical sequence to trace development of revelation and covenant.
- **Synchronic method:** reading Scripture as a unified whole in its canonical form to ascertain theological coherence.
- **Progressive revelation:** the theological claim that God's self-disclosure unfolds over history, requiring sensitivity to context and fulfillment.
- **Christocentricity:** central commitment that all biblical theology finds its unity and telos in Christ.
- **Hermeneutical priority:** the principle that accurate exegesis (informed by biblical theology) has priority for responsible doctrinal formulation.
- **Loci (theological loci):** the standard systematic categories (e.g., doctrine of God, Christ, salvation, church) that synthesize biblical data.
- **Confessional mediation:** role of historic creeds/confessions in shaping and testing systematic articulation derived from Scripture.
- **Theological reciprocity:** the idea that biblical and systematic theology must continually inform and correct one another.
- **Exegetical-model use:** employing redemptive-historical insights to guide sermon and commentary work.
- **Doctrinal-polemic use:** deployed against approaches that either absolutize biblical-theological description or strip doctrine of historical texture.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for curriculum design and departmental methodology (clarifies what each discipline does).
- As a polemic resource against both anti-systematic biblical theologizing and ahistorical systematics - a conceptual pivot advocating integration.
