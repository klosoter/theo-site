### TITLE
De gratia et libero arbitrio (Disputationes) - Robert Bellarmine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th - early 17th century Counter-Reformation scholasticism; part of Bellarmine's larger Disputationes (De Controversiis).
 - Written amid polemic with Protestant Reformers (Luther, Calvin) and within intra‑Catholic debates (notably the Congregatio de Auxiliis) over grace, predestination, and the recently articulated Molinist proposals.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reconcile **God's absolute sovereignty and efficacious causality in grace** with **authentic human freedom and moral responsibility**; oppose both Pelagianism (denial of need for prevenient grace) and determinist Calvinism (grace that negates freedom).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with precise definitions (gratia sufficiens, gratia efficax, gratia praeveniens, liberum arbitrium) and sets methodological rules: Scripture, Fathers, and scholastic causality.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish that grace is necessary for the beginning and completion of supernatural acts; human will cooperates but cannot effect salvation unaided.
 - Distinguish types of grace (sufficient vs. efficacious) and explain how efficacious grace brings about assent without coercion - God is primary cause, human will is a true secondary cause.
 - Critique extremes: shows Calvinist accounts make sin necessary or God the author of sin; shows Pelagianism undermines God's gratuitous gift.
 - Engage Molinist thesis: examines the role of divine foreknowledge and the proposed scientia media; accepts the need to account for counterfactuals of freedom but cautions against making divine willing dependent on creaturely decisions.
 - Uses logical analysis of causation (first / second causes), exegetical proofs (Pauline and Patristic texts), and probabilistic arguments about God's simplicity and omnipotence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Protestants: Calvin, Luther (as representative of deterministic tendencies).
 - Catholic interlocutors: Thomists (on premotion), Molina and Molinists (scientia media); extensive appeal to Augustine and scholastic authorities.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (sufficient, efficacious, prevenient, sanctifying, actual)
 - Free will and moral responsibility
 - Predestination and reprobation
 - Divine foreknowledge and middle knowledge (scientia media)
 - Causality, concurrence, merit
- **Closing line**
 - Bellarmine presents a measured post‑Tridentine synthesis: God is the efficacious cause of salvation while human freedom remains genuinely operative - a mediating Catholic articulation that rejects both deterministic and Pelagian extremes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Careful technical distinctions (especially between sufficient and efficacious grace) used pastorally to preserve human culpability and God's gratuitous initiative.
 - Emphasis on God's freedom in decreeing means and on the transcendence of divine causality - avoids mechanistic accounts of premotion.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Explicit polemic against Calvinist double predestination and irresistible grace as making God the author of sin.
 - Critical but restrained engagement with Molina: recognizes the usefulness of scientia media for explaining foreknowledge of free acts but resists interpretations that subordinate divine causality to creaturely freedom.
 - More conciliatory than hardline Thomists; he refuses to close the question definitively in the Congregatio de Auxiliis spirit.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of classical scholastic categories to carve a middle path: principled retention of efficacious grace while insisting on non‑coercive influence.
 - Nuanced treatment of foreknowledge - differentiates God's absolute foreknowledge from contingent counterfactuals without fully endorsing Molinist metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a central handbook for post‑Tridentine Catholic orthodoxy on grace and free will.
 - Read as a balanced corrective by later Catholic theologians; cited in debates over Molinism (both by critics and sympathizers).
 - Protestants used it as a principal Catholic statement to argue against, while Catholics used it as a teaching norm in seminaries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies disciplined scholastic method and pastoral sensitivity; valuable as a mediating model in contemporary discussions on divine causality, freedom, and Molinist resources.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gratia (Grace)** - general term; Bellarmine insists on supernatural gratuity and necessity for salvation.
- **Gratia praeveniens (Prevenient grace)** - grace that precedes free consent; necessary for any good act.
- **Gratia sufficiens (Sufficient grace)** - offers capacity for action; can be resisted by free will.
- **Gratia efficax (Efficacious grace)** - infallibly secures the act without destroying voluntariness; primary focus of Bellarmine's defense.
- **Liberum arbitrium (Free will)** - genuine causal power of the agent; cooperates with grace without being its ultimate cause.
- **Concurrence (Concurrentia)** - the notion that divine causality concurs with creaturely cause; Bellarmine stresses real concurrence that preserves causality of both.
- **Praedestinatio (Predestination)** - God's eternal choice; must be understood as compatible with human freedom and not the origin of sin.
- **Praevidentia / Prae-scientia (Foreknowledge)** - God's knowledge of future contingents; separate discussion from determinative decree.
- **Scientia media (Middle knowledge)** - the Molinist doctrine of God's knowledge of counterfactuals; Bellarmine engages it critically and pragmatically.
 - Relation: sees value in the concept but warns against making it the linchpin that diminishes God's primacy.
- **Premotio physica (Physical premotion)** - a Thomist explanation of how God moves the will; Bellarmine avoids rigid endorsement, preferring subtler causality language.
- **Meritum (Merit)** - discussion of how human cooperation and divine grace relate to merit before God.
- **Reprobatio (Reprobation)** - negative side of predestination; Bellarmine counters any account that makes reprobation unjust or causative of sin.
- **Actual / sanctifying grace** - distinction retained and used to explain moral acts vs. habitual transformation.
- **Irresistible grace** - Bellarmine rejects the Calvinist form (that annihilates freedom), affirming efficacious grace respects the will.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise post‑Tridentine **definition source** for Catholic doctrine on grace and freedom.
- As a **polemic** instrument against Protestant doctrines of predestination and irresistible grace.
- As a methodological **exegetical model** combining Scripture, Fathers, and scholastic causality.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in the Molinist/Thomist debates - often cited to show a cautious mediated stance rather than wholesale adoption of either school.
