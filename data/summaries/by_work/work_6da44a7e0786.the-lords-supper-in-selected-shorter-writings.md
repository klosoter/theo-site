### TITLE
The Lord's Supper (Selected Shorter Writings) - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century American Presbyterianism; Warfield writing from Princeton Seminary amid debates with modernists, liberal theology, and rising ecclesiastical disputes over sacramental practice.
 - Positioned within classical Reformed covenant theology and confessional Presbyterian practice; reacting to both Roman Catholic sacramentalism and radical Protestant memorialism/subjectivism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper is a true sacrament in which Christ is really present and efficacious to believers, yet His presence is spiritual, not corporal; the sacrament functions as a promised sign and a seal of the covenant, objectively conveying grace when received in faith.
 - Secondary pastoral problem: the church's right and duty to regulate participation (fencing the table) so the sacrament's integrity and pastoral efficacy are preserved.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegesis of key New Testament texts (esp. 1 Cor 10-11; John 6; Luke 22) to show communicants partake of Christ truly but spiritually.
 - Rejection of both transubstantiation (corporeal presence) and pure memorialism (mere remembrance), advancing a Reformed middle path: **real spiritual presence** and sacramental efficacy as a covenantal seal.
 - Theology of sacraments as **means of grace**: objective promises enacted by visible signs through the Holy Spirit to the faithful.
 - Practical implications: basis and limits of church discipline; criteria for admission; purpose of fencing the table as pastoral protection, not punitive exclusivism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine, Calvin, Bucer, and Reformed confessions; contrasts with Roman Catholic scholasticism (transubstantiation), Lutheran consubstantiation tendencies, Zwinglian memorialists, and contemporary liberal theologians who reduce sacraments to symbolic ritual.
 - Engages textual critics and exegetes of his day while remaining confessional.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology, Christology (presence and person), covenant theology, ecclesiology (discipline and admission), soteriology (means of grace), pneumatology (Spirit's role in sacramental benefit), and ethics (worthy reception).

- **Closing line**
 - The Lord's Supper is a sacramental, covenantal means of grace in which Christ is really present by the Spirit to seal and apply redemption to believers; the church must guard this means through faithful administration and disciplined admission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear formulation of **"real spiritual presence"**: avoids metaphysical transfiguration language yet insists on objective Christological efficacy.
 - Integration of high sacramental theology with rigorous Presbyterian discipline-sacramental grace is objective but conditioned by faith and worthy reception.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic metaphysical transference (transubstantiation) by denying corporeal change.
 - Corrects Zwinglian and purely memorial accounts by insisting on a genuine participatory benefit, not mere symbol.
 - Challenges subjectivist and modernist reductions that privatize the sacrament into merely ethical or symbolic acts.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes precise use of "spiritual presence" as a technical mediating term between "corporeal presence" and "mere memorial."
 - Emphasizes "seal" language in close conjunction with "means of grace" to stress both objective promise and subjective appropriation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles in the 20th century; used in defenses of confessional sacramentology against liberalizing trends.
 - Less influential among sacramentalist Roman Catholic/Lutheran theologians but respected for careful exegesis and pastoral concerns.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to hold together objective sacramental efficacy and the necessity of faith/discipline; valuable for pastors, sacramental theologians, and ecclesial polity debates (open vs closed communion).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Real spiritual presence**
 - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but present spiritually (by the Spirit), not physically.

- **Sign and seal**
 - The elements are signs that visibly represent and seals that confirm the covenant promise to believers.

- **Means of grace**
 - The Supper is an instrument through which God ordinarily communicates saving benefits.

- **Objective efficacy**
 - Sacraments possess an objective effect in virtue of Christ's promise and the Spirit's work, though appropriation requires faith.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Participation in the Supper expresses and nourishes the believer's mystical union with Christ.

- **Fencing the table**
 - Ecclesial practice of regulating admission to Communion to protect sacramental integrity and care for souls.

- **Admission / church discipline**
 - Criteria and procedures for admitting communicants; linked to examination, profession of faith, repentance.

- **Worthy reception**
 - Not sinless perfection but a repentant, believing stance; unworthy reception is reproved in 1 Cor 11 and warrants pastoral correction.

- **Memorialism (contrast)**
 - The view that the Supper is solely a remembrance; Warfield rejects this as insufficient.

- **Transubstantiation (contrast)**
 - The Roman Catholic claim of substantive change in the elements; Warfield rejects corporealistic metaphysics.

- **Seal of the covenant of grace**
 - The Supper functions as assurance of God's promise within covenantal structure.

- **Participation / communion**
 - Active eating and drinking as participation in benefits of Christ, distinguished from mere symbolic acts.

- **Pneumatology (sacramental role)**
 - The Holy Spirit's work is central to making the sacrament efficacious.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed sacramentology that affirms real spiritual presence.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both Roman Catholic metaphysics and ritualistic/subjectivist Protestant reductions.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians 10-11 and Luke 22 in sacramental theology.
 - As a **practical guide** for churches deciding on fencing/communion admission policies.
