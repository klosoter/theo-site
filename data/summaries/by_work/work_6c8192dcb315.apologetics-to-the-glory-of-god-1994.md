### TITLE
Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the 1990s amid renewed debates between evidential, classical, and presuppositional apologetics.
 - Part of a broader Reformed recovery of apologetics that sought to defend Scripture's authority against secular epistemologies.
 - Engages both contemporary philosophers of religion and historical Reformed theologians.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Apologetics must begin with and aim at the **glory of God**: God and the self-attesting authority of Scripture are the proper starting points for rational defense of the faith.
 - The primary task is to show Christian thought as **epistemically basic** and norming, not merely to accumulate neutral proofs.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defends a **presuppositional** framework that affirms Scripture's self-authentication while allowing for rational engagement with non-Christian thought.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the distinction and relation of **general** and **special revelation**: general revelation renders humans without excuse but is not saving or self-authorizing.
 - Argue for **self-attestation** (self-authentication) of Scripture grounded in the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit and the coherence, efficacy, and authority of the biblical witness.
 - Critique classical/evidential methods that treat neutral reason as preeminent; argue that unbelief is ultimately a volitional/religious stance, not merely intellectual deficiency.
 - Address problems often raised against biblical theism (e.g., theodicy, knowability and existence of God, analogies between Creator and creature) showing how a God-centered epistemology better answers them.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Cornelius Van Til (affinity and qualification), Gordon H. Clark, classical apologists (Aquinasian and modern), and analytic philosophers of religion.
 - Draws on Reformed theologians (Calvin, Bavinck) and engages contemporary critics of presuppositionalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general vs special), **Bibliology** (self-attestation, authority, canon/tradition), **Theology Proper** (existence, knowability of God), **Theodicy/Divine Justice**, epistemology of religious belief.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Apologetics is properly a theocentric discipline: it begins from God and Scripture as norm, uses reason under Scripture, and aims not merely at assent but at God's glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that apologetics be done "**to the glory of God**" - telos shapes method and content.
 - Balances presuppositional confidence in Scripture with practical engagement of evidences as confirmatory, not foundational.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Modifies strict Van Tillian formulations by allowing more room for common ground and rational contrast rather than pure transcendental refutation.
 - Opposes classical/evidentialist strategies that treat unbelief as primarily intellectual; stresses its ultimate religious character.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refines language of **self-authentication/self-attestation** of Scripture in epistemological terms (internal witness + Spirit).
 - Emphasizes a coherent biblical epistemology where Scripture, Spirit, and human faculties interact.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical apologetics curricula; often cited in defenses of presuppositionalism.
 - Criticized by evidentialists for underutilizing neutral evidence and by some for theological assumptions in philosophical argumentation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear systematic linkage of bibliology and apologetics: valuable for courses on bibliology, apologetics, and Reformed dogmatics.
 - Serves as a corrective to purely evidentialist practice and a model for integrating theology and philosophy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositional apologetics**: Apologetic posture that begins from the truth of Scripture as the necessary presupposition for coherent thought.
- **Self-attestation / self-authentication**: The claim that Scripture validates itself by its internal witness and the confirming testimony of the Holy Spirit.
 - Distinguishes from mere circularity by appeal to epistemic basicness and the Spirit's work.
- **General revelation**: God's revelation in nature and conscience; sufficient to render humanity culpable but insufficient to save or to ground divine truth apart from Scripture.
- **Special revelation**: Redemptive, propositional disclosure in Scripture and Christ; normative and determinative for apologetic claims.
- **Analogia fidei vs analogia entis**:
 - **Analogia fidei**: Analogy grounded in God's self-revelation (Frame's preferred approach).
 - **Analogia entis**: Analogy grounded on creaturely resemblance (rejected as epistemically risky).
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit**: The Spirit's role in confirming Scripture to the believer's conscience and mind; integral to self-attestation.
- **Theodicy / divine justice**: Treated as an apologetic locus - divine justice must be understood within God's revealed purposes and the gospel narrative.
- **Knowability and existence of God**: Argues for both - knowability via revelation and created capacities; existence is best defended within a biblical-theistic framework rather than de novo natural theology.
- **Common grace / sensus divinitatis**: Affirms that God communicates truth in general revelation and restrains sin, providing a basis for some rational exchange with non-Christians.
- **Evidences (confirmatory use)**: Empirical and historical supports are useful but subordinate; they confirm the biblical claim rather than establish it.
- **Canon and tradition**: Canon is norming; tradition may assist but never supersedes the self-attesting Scripture.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed presuppositionalism and self-attestation doctrines in bibliology.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialist and classical apologetic methods.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking epistemology, theology proper, and bibliology - showing how apologetics flows from doctrine.
