### TITLE
American Babylon: Notes of a Christian Exile (2009) - Richard John Neuhaus

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2009; collection emerges from Neuhaus's long career as public intellectual, priest, founder of First Things, and a convert from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism.
 - Written against the backdrop of late-20th / early-21st-century American secularism, the culture wars, and debates about religion in the public square.
 - Theological milieu: conservative catholic public theology with engagement across ecumenical lines; conversant with Augustine, Niebuhr, American founding rhetoric, and modern liberal political theory.

- **Central thesis**
 - American civic life treats Christianity as an optional private posture; Christians are therefore in a condition of exile ("Babylon") and must recover a robust, confessionally rooted public witness that resists privatization and state neutrality that effaces truth claims.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: U.S. public culture prizes a privatized religion and an ideology of state neutrality that effectively marginalizes truth-bearing religious claims.
 - Historical-theological reading: Traces how American constitutionalism and modern liberalism have shaped church-state relations to favor a secular public square.
 - Prophetic corrective: Argues for a confessional public theology - religion must both respect civic pluralism and insist on the public salience of Christian truth.
 - Practical posture: Advocates for institutional engagement (churches, schools, media) and prophetic critique rather than withdrawal or capitulation to secular norms.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical and modern interlocutors: Augustine, Reinhold Niebuhr, John Courtney Murray, John Rawls, Jefferson and Madison as constitutional interlocutors.
 - Cultural figures and movements: secularists defending "neutrality," advocates of strict separation, and religious conservatives involved in culture-war politics.
 - Neuhaus also draws on Catholic social teaching and Biblical witness as foundational resources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: affirmation that public argument must be shaped by revealed truth, not restricted to private conscience.
 - **Covenant / political anthropology**: implied critique of social contractism; emphasizes duties grounded in covenantal obligations rather than purely contractual rights.
 - **Trinity / ecclesiology**: ecclesiology implicit in the stress on the church as a public institution bearing witness; the Trinitarian center shapes the church's public witness as relational and missionary.
 - **Christology**: Christ as Lord of all spheres - public life included; undermines any strict privatization of Christ's sovereignty.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Christians in America are exiles called to refuse privatization of faith and to exercise a confessional, public witness grounded in revealed truth and ecclesial identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses "Babylon" as a sustained metaphor for American cultural exile - not merely persecution but displacement by a self-consciously secular order.
 - Strong insistence that true public neutrality is a myth; purported neutrality is itself a moral and metaphysical claim that must be contested by confessional faith.
 - Balances prophetic critique with institutional engagement rather than purely political activism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with liberal religious privatizers (who confine religion to conscience) and with accommodationists who seek to reduce doctrine to civic morality.
 - Differs from simplistic theonomy or church takeover strategies: Neuhaus rejects clerical domination of the state while insisting on robust public voice.
 - Modifies Niebuhrian realism by insisting on stronger confessional clarity rather than ironic distance.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reappropriation of "public theology" as explicitly confessional rather than merely religiously informed civic reasoning.
 - Reframing "neutrality" as a substantive ideological posture requiring theological challenge.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Catholic and orthodox Protestant circles invested in reclaiming the public square.
 - Shaped debates in First Things network and conservative public theology; used as a touchstone against secular liberalism and religious privatization.
 - Criticized by secularists and some liberal theologians for insufficient attention to pluralist concerns and for risking confessional triumphalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to privatizing tendencies; clarifies the theological stakes in church-state debates.
 - Useful for seminarians and political theologians seeking a confessional model for public engagement grounded in ecclesial identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Babylon**
 - Metaphor for exile in a culture that marginalizes authoritative Christian witness.
- **Exile**
 - Condition of Christians in modern America; prompts prophetic posture.
- **Public theology**
 - Theology practiced in and for the public square; Neuhaus insists it be confessional.
- **Neutrality (state neutrality)**
 - Critiqued as illusory and ideologically loaded; not the default ground for civic ordering.
- **Privatization of religion**
 - The reduction of faith to private conscience which Neuhaus opposes.
- **Confessional witness**
 - Public speech rooted explicitly in revealed truth and ecclesial identity.
- **Secularism**
 - Diagnosed as a dominant cultural force shaping law and public norms, often hostile to robust religious claims.
- **Church as public institution**
 - The church's role extends beyond worship into social, moral, and civic formation.
- **Prophetic critique**
 - Mode of engagement combining witness, denunciation of injustice, and public reasoning.
- **Civic pluralism**
 - Recognized as a fact to be navigated; Neuhaus envisions pluralism not as a reason for silence but for robust witness.
- **Authority (theological vs. political)**
 - Differentiates ecclesial authority (confessional truth) from coercive state power; both have distinct roles.
- **Common good**
 - Reinterpreted in light of revelation rather than secular utilitarianism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional public theology and critiques of secular neutrality.
 - As a **polemic** against secularist privatization and naive church-state separation models.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in political theology courses illustrating Catholic/orthodox responses to modern liberalism.
