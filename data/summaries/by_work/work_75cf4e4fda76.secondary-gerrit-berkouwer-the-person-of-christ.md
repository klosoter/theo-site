### TITLE
Gerrit W. Berkouwer, The Person of Christ (mid-20th c., Studies in Dogmatics) - critical engagement with Friedrich Schleiermacher on Christology; defence and reappropriation of the Chalcedonian Two Natures doctrine for Reformed theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Dutch Reformed theology (post-WWII). Part of Berkouwer's Studies in Dogmatics project aiming to restate Reformed dogma in conversation with modern theology and ecumenical currents.
 - Intellectual milieu: reaction to liberal and existential reinterpretations of doctrine (Schleiermacher among the chief historical interlocutors), and renewed interest in patristic and Chalcedonian resources.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To defend an orthodox, personal Christology that preserves the Chalcedonian affirmation of one person in two natures against modern reductions that either spiritualize or subjectivize Christ (e.g., Schleiermacher's "religious consciousness" model).
 - To show that authentic Christian faith requires both a historically grounded, objective incarnation and a living theological account of the person of Christ.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical base: biblical witness to the person and work of Christ insists on both genuine humanity and genuine divinity.
 - Historical-theological move: affirms Chalcedon as necessary grammar; reads patristic formulations not as antiquarian formulas but as theological rules that guard against error.
 - Critical engagement: subjects Schleiermacher's Christology to critique - especially his reduction of the incarnation to elevated religious feeling or a normative human divine-consciousness - arguing it disfigures substitution, atonement, and revelation.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: articulates the hypostatic union in a way that preserves communicatio idiomatum (attribution of properties) without confusion of natures; links incarnation to soteriology and revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Friedrich Schleiermacher (modern liberal-existential influence), patristic writers (Athanasius, Cyril), Chalcedonian Definition, Reformed tradition (Calvinic emphases on revelation and substitution).
 - Wider conversation: engagements with contemporary Protestant and ecumenical scholarship (implicitly dialoguing with Barthian and liberal trends).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Principal: Christology (person and natures, incarnation, communicatio idiomatum, kenosis).
 - Connected: Trinity (implications for divine identity and relation), revelation (God disclosed in Christ), atonement and reconciliation (soteriological consequences of personhood).
- **Closing line**
 - Berkouwer insists that the Chalcedonian account, rightly interpreted, is the indispensable theological grammar for safeguarding the concrete, objective truth of Christ's person and the efficacy of his saving work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong personalist stress: Christ's identity is primarily a matter of hypostasis (person) rather than abstract qualities or existential states.
 - Balances Reformed concern for objective revelation with pastoral sensitivity to existential appropriation of Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Systematic critique of Schleiermacher: resists reducing Christ to the paradigm of religious feeling or exemplary divine consciousness.
 - Counters both liberal subjectivism and any tendency to depersonalize the incarnational event.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of communicatio idiomatum: emphasizes relational and attributive logic rather than simple metaphysical transfer; seeks to protect both natures' integrity within one personal subject.
 - Reframes Chalcedonian categories for contemporary dogmatics rather than mere historical citation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed circles as a model for engaging modern theology while retaining classical orthodoxy.
 - Used in ecumenical dialogues as a constructive Reformed articulation of Chalcedonian Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust methodological example of how to read classical creedal language for present doctrinal, pastoral, and apologetic needs.
 - Remains a corrective resource where Christology is privatized, historicized away, or reduced to psychological categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chalcedonian Definition**
 - The classical formulary Berkouwer defends as the necessary doctrinal framework for speaking truthfully about Christ as one person in two natures.
- **Two Natures (Divine and Human)**
 - Affirmation that Christ possesses fully and distinctively both natures without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Hypostatic Union (Person / Hypostasis)**
 - Central term: one personal subject who is both God and man; Berkouwer insists on personhood as decisive.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Doctrine of the communication of properties; Berkouwer stresses attributive, relational articulation that avoids metaphysical collapse.
- **Incarnation**
 - Event and doctrine emphasizing the historical, objective entry of the Son into human existence - not merely an exemplar of religious consciousness.
- **Kenosis**
 - Meaningful in Berkouwer's account but bounded by the inviolability of divine nature; relates to how the Son assumes human limitations without ceasing to be truly God.
- **Atonement / Substitution**
 - Soteriological implications depend on the real personal union; Berkouwer argues Schleiermacher's model undermines objective substitution.
- **Revelation (Christ as Word)**
 - Christ as God's definitive self-disclosure; requires an incarnational, historical person rather than a merely religious idea.
- **Personhood vs. Functionality**
 - Emphasizes ontological personhood over merely functional roles or moral patterns.
- **Historical Reality**
 - The incarnation is a concrete, historical event that theology must account for, not a generalized religious ideal.
- **Religious Consciousness (Schleiermacher)**
 - Targeted as insufficient: a religious quality cannot bear the weight of redemption or revelation without the personal, historical Christ.
- **Patristic Retrieval**
 - Use of early councils and fathers as interpretive rules, not frozen dogma.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a contemporary, Reformed reading of Chalcedon and hypostatic union.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal/subjectivist Christologies (notably Schleiermacher) that reconstruct incarnation as religious experience.
 - As an **exegetical-model** resource linking biblical witness, patristic categories, and Reformed soteriology into coherent Christological doctrine.
