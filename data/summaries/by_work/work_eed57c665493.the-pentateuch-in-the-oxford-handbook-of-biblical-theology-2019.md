### TITLE
The Pentateuch - Stephen G. Dempster (in The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Theology, 2019)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Chapter in a major 2019 Oxford Handbook summing contemporary biblical-theological scholarship.
 - Situated within recent canonical and covenantal conversations: evangelical and Reformed interlocutors engaging form-critical, tradition-historical, and canonical methods.
 - Dempster writes from a broadly covenantal, canonical perspective attentive to redemptive-historical continuity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Pentateuch functions as the covenantal architecture of Israel: it narrates election, organizes vocation (law and cult), and frames Israel's identity for God's kingdom purposes. Sinai (the Mosaic covenant) must be read as a covenantal specification within the ongoing economy of God's covenantal dealings rather than as a stand-alone "works" covenant.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: canonical reading that integrates narrative, law, ritual, and covenantal typology.
 - Narrative arc: Creation -> Fall -> Patriarchal election -> Exodus and Sinai -> Wilderness formation -> Conquest/settlement promises. Each stage both advances redemptive history and rearticulates covenantal obligations.
 - Sinai as covenantal center:
 - Presents legal stipulations, cultic forms, and covenantal sanctions (blessings/curses) in a suzerain-treaty idiom.
 - Functions to define communal identity and vocation (holy nation, kingdom of priests) rather than merely to demand meritorious righteousness apart from grace.
 - Law and cult are formative: they shape Israel's social, moral, and theological life as a covenant people and point typologically forward to Christ and consummation.
 - Concludes that the Pentateuch's theology coheres around covenantal faithfulness grounded in God's prior initiative and promises.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Canonical and covenantal scholars: Brevard Childs, Meredith G. Kline (notably on covenant typology), John Goldingay, scholars of treaty form and ancient Near Eastern covenants.
 - Engages historical-critical work (tradition-history, form criticism) but subsumes it under canonical patterns.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (law and narrative as revelation of God's covenant will)
 - Covenant (Adamic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, and the unfolding covenant of grace)
 - Law/Torah, cult/temple, election, typology/Christology (implicit forward-reading), soteriology as covenantal vocation.

- **Closing line**
 - The Pentateuch is the covenantal backbone of Scripture: Sinai specifies how the elect vocation is to be lived without dissolving the deeper continuity of God's redemptive covenantal initiative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong canonical-covenantal synthesis: treats narrative, law, and cult as integrated vehicles of covenantal formation.
 - Reads Sinai as covenantal specification within an already-established covenantal economy rather than as an autonomous legal contract.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against treating the Mosaic covenant as a pure "covenant of works" in opposition to the covenant of grace. Instead, he nuances the debate: Mosaic law contains works-language but is embedded in God's promissory, covenantal action.
 - Counters overly fragmentary critical reconstructions by privileging the Pentateuch's final canonical shape for theological interpretation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes legal strictures as formative covenantal vocation (law-as-formation) rather than only forensic demands.
 - Uses suzerain-treaty language to highlight both continuity with ANE covenant forms and the distinctive theological content of Israel's covenant.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical contexts for integrating covenant theology with canonical exegesis.
 - Useful in academic syllabi bridging OT theology and systematic covenantal frameworks.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how Mosaic stipulations function within redemptive history, helping pastors and scholars avoid polar extremes (strict works-covenant vs. ahistorical grace-only accounts).
 - Serves as a concise canonical model for interpreting Pentateuchal law and covenant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pentateuch** - the fivefold foundational corpus narrating creation, election, covenant formation, and law.
- **Canonical reading** - emphasis on the final form and theological coherence of the Pentateuch within Scripture.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - Sinai covenant characterized by stipulations, cult, sanctions; read as covenantal specification within God's ongoing covenant.
- **Covenant of Works** - the Adamic covenant language; Dempster acknowledges formal resemblances but resists equating Mosaic covenant wholesale with a works-covenant.
 - **"As to substance" nuance** - Mosaic covenant includes works-language (obedience, blessings/curses) but should be located within God's covenantal grace trajectory.
- **Covenant of Grace** - over-arching covenantal framework; Dempster situates the Pentateuch's promises and law within this redemptive-historical continuity.
- **Suzerainty treaty form** - ANE model applied to Sinai: suzerain stipulations, historical prologue, blessings/curses - used to explain legal-covenantal shape.
- **Law/Torah** - formative, covenantal instruction shaping corporate life and vocation.
- **Cult / Ritual** - covenantal practices that instantiate Israel's relationship with God.
- **Election** - patriarchal call and promise that grounds Mosaic obligations.
- **Blessings and Curses** - covenantal sanctions that bind obedience to communal welfare.
- **Typology / Christological forward-reading** - Pentateuchal persons and institutions prefigure redemptive fulfillment.
- **Covenant ratification** - ritual and narrative forms that confirm Israel's obligations and God's promises.
- **Land promise** - central component tying covenantal faithfulness to promise-fulfillment and vocation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies the Pentateuch's covenantal structure for OT theology and systematic theology discussions.
 - Exegetical model: offers a canonical-covenantal hermeneutic for reading law, cult, and narrative together.
 - Polemic / conceptual pivot: moderates debates over the Mosaic covenant as a pure "covenant of works," providing a framework that integrates legal demands into the covenant of grace.
