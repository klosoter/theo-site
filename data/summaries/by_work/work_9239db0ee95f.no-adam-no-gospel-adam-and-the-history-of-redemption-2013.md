### TITLE
No Adam, No Gospel: Adam and the History of Redemption (2013) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2013 within conservative Reformed scholarship, responding to rising evangelical and popular challenges to a historical Adam (scientific evolution, literary/mythic readings).
 - Gaffin writes as a confessional Presbyterian scholar situated in the mid-20th/21st-century Reformed theological milieu; intended for pastors, students, and theologians worried about anchoring soteriology in Scripture.

- **Central thesis**
 - The historicity of Adam is indispensable to the gospel: without a historical Adam as federal head, key doctrines (original sin, imputation, the salvific significance of Christ as Second Adam) collapse.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundations: close reading of Paul (especially Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15) to establish Adam as a historical, federal head whose sin has real, imputed effects.
 - Theological systematization: ties Adam to covenantal structure and federal representation central to Reformed anthropology and soteriology.
 - Polemic and clarification: rejects non-historical, purely typological, or merely archetypal readings of Adam; argues these undermine the logic of Christ's atoning work.
 - Engagement with science/culture: affirms legitimate scientific inquiry but marks theological limits-biblical claims about origins are theological commitments not optional metaphors.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (Romans, 1 Corinthians).
 - Historical sources invoked or presupposed: Augustine, Calvin, Reformed confessions and Murray/Gaffin reformed tradition.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: those advancing non-historical/representative readings of Adam (various evangelical scholars and scientists); engages broadly with recent theology-science debates.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (creation, fall, original sin)
 - Soteriology (atonement, imputation of sin and righteousness)
 - Christology (Christ as Second Adam)
 - Covenant theology and revelation (Scripture as normative for theological claims about origins)
 - Redemption history (Adam as the opening hinge for redemptive chronology)

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin insists: the gospel's coherence depends on Adam's historical role as federal head; to remove historical Adam is to remove the theological ground for Christ's redeeming work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes Pauline exegesis over speculative harmonizations with modern science when assessing Adam's role.
 - Places covenantal/federal representation at the center of the Adam-Christ correlation rather than primarily metaphysical or mythic categories.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicitly opposes recent evangelical moves to reinterpret Adam as non-historical, symbolic, or a population-level phenomenon that severs the one-to-one representational logic required for imputation.
 - Corrects purported accommodations that treat original sin as merely sociological or cultural rather than a theological, covenantal fact.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Tightens argumentative link between **historicity**, **federal headship**, and the **necessity of imputation**-argues these are conceptually inseparable in Pauline theology.
 - Clarifies method for theological use of Scripture in conversation with empirical claims: theology sets boundary questions, science operates within those bounds.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read and cited in conservative/Reformed circles as a succinct defense of traditional affirmaiton of Adam.
 - Provoked sustained discussion in theology-science forums; critics say it underestimates complexity of genetic and paleontological data or over-privileges Pauline theology over historical-critical nuance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a clear, compact exegetical-theological defense of Adam's historicity and federal headship; effective pedagogical tool in seminary settings and denominational debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam (historic)** - the original human male as a historical person and federal head whose fall has covenantal consequences.
- **Historicity of Adam** - the claim Gaffin defends: Adam was actual, not merely symbolic or archetypal.
- **Federal headship** - the representative role whereby Adam's sin is imputed to humanity and Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers.
- **Imputation (of sin / righteousness)** - juridical transfer: Adam's guilt to the race; Christ's righteousness to redeemed persons.
- **Original sin** - inherited, corporate, and covenantal corruption rooted in Adam's fall, not merely moral example or social conditioning.
- **Second Adam / Christ as head** - theological parallel: Christ reverses Adam's condemnation by his life, death, and resurrection.
- **Pauline theology (Romans 5; 1 Cor 15)** - Gaffin's primary exegetical locus; these texts function as theological prooftexts for Adam's historicity and federal role.
- **Covenant representation** - framework used to explain how one person's act has corporate effect; central to Reformed anthropology and soteriology.
- **Typology vs. historicity** - Gaffin accepts typology but insists typological reading presupposes historical referent.
- **Redemption history (historia salutis)** - narrative arc beginning with Adam's fall and culminating in Christ; Adam is the initial historical hinge.
- **Theology-science boundary** - principle that theological claims about origins are normative while science describes processes within created order.
- **Representative/one-to-one reading** - Gaffin's insistence that Adam's singularity is essential for imputation.
- **Gospel logic** - shorthand for Gaffin's claim that gospel coherence requires a fallen, yet real, Adam.

How this work is used
- As a **definitional source** for confessional Reformed defenses of Adam's historicity and the doctrine of imputation.
- As a **polemic** against non-historical or purely symbolic readings of Adam in evangelical theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 within covenantal/federal frameworks.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theology-science discussions, articulating theological limits and priorities when engaging evolutionary claims.
