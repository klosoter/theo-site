### TITLE
Divine Discourse: Philosophical Reflections on the Claim That God Speaks - Nicholas Wolterstorff

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion (published 1995). Wolterstorff writes as a Christian philosopher shaped by Reformed theology, analytic philosophy of language, and epistemology.
 - Conversation with speech-act theory (Austin, Searle, Grice), contemporary epistemology (Plantinga), and debates about propositional vs. non-propositional revelation in evangelical and academic circles.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The central claim: **God speaks** - not merely that Scripture contains true propositions or that God acts in history, but that divine speech is a coherent, intelligible category that does normative epistemic and theological work.
 - Core problem addressed: how to understand divine utterance intelligibly without reducing it to mere human metaphor, category mistake, or private mystical state.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - 1) Clarify what speaking is in human terms using speech-act theory (illocutionary acts, perlocutionary effects), then ask which aspects can be analogically or literally applied to God.
 - 2) Defend the intelligibility of divine speech against three chief objections:
 - Category-mistake objection (God cannot do X human beings do).
 - Epistemic objection (if God speaks, how do we have warranted belief?).
 - Metaphysical/ontological objection (transcendence implies incommunicability).
 - 3) Sketch how divine speech can be both personal (a speaker acting) and mediated (Scripture, incarnation, prophecy) without collapsing into mere human testimony or purely symbolic acts.
 - 4) Explore implications for revelation, Scripture, prophecy, and the believer's epistemic situation (testimony, warrant, hearer's responsibility).
 - 5) Conclude with normative claims about what it means to attend to divine speech and how theology and epistemology should register it.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages speech-act theorists (Austin, Searle, Grice implicitly), epistemologists of religious belief (Plantinga), and historical theological resources (biblical witness, Reformed emphasis on Word and covenant).
 - Responds implicitly to non-propositional revelation champions, radical mysticism skeptics, and reductive naturalists.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (primary), Scripture (as vehicle of divine discourse), prophecy, Word of God (Logos motif), epistemology of religious belief (warrant, testimony), and implications for doctrine of God (personhood and communicative action).
 - Less emphasis on Trinity or Christology except where Logos/Incarnation functions as paradigmatic divine speech.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Wolterstorff's theological center: **God is a speaking, personal agent whose speech - mediated and immediate - is a theologically central, epistemically intelligible reality that shapes how believers receive, trust, and respond to revelation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Applies contemporary speech-act theory to the doctrine of revelation, shifting focus from mere propositional content to the **performative, normative** force of divine utterances (commands, promises, blessings).
 - Stresses the reality of divine address: God not only conveys propositions but **addresses** hearers in ways that aim to change their standing, commitments, and actions.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond a simple propositional model of revelation (God gives true propositions) and beyond purely non-linguistic mystical models. Offers a middle path: divine speech can be both propositional and performative.
 - Challenges reductionist readings that make "God speaks" a mere metaphor or allegory.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Productive use of **illocutionary force** and **perlocution** in a theological register (e.g., divine promises as illocutionary acts that create obligations and hope).
 - Emphasis on **mediation** (Scripture, prophets, incarnation) as legitimate vehicles without collapsing divine speech into human utterance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in philosophy of religion and theology debates on revelation and religious language.
 - Influential among Reformed and evangelical thinkers seeking philosophically robust accounts of divine speech; also engaged by analytic theologians interested in speech acts and testimony.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable conceptual toolkit for discussing revelation, prophecy, and Scripture that bridges analytic philosophy and constructive theology.
 - Useful pedagogically for courses on revelation, religious epistemology, and philosophy of language in theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine discourse** - The claim that God speaks; includes immediate and mediated speech acts.
- **Speech-act theory** - Framework (illocutionary, perlocutionary, locutionary acts) transposed into theological analysis.
 - **Illocutionary force** - What the divine utterance does (e.g., commands, promises, blesses).
 - **Perlocution** - The effects on hearers (e.g., conversion, assurance, obedience).
- **Testimony** - Human reception of divine speech; the epistemic route by which believers claim knowledge of God's speech.
- **Propositional revelation** - God's communicative content; Wolterstorff reframes it to include performative dimensions.
- **Mediation** - The means by which God speaks (Scripture, prophets, incarnation) distinguished from literal human speech yet not merely symbolic.
- **Authenticity and warrant** - Issues of how hearers are justified in accepting claims of divine speech (epistemic credentials of testimonies, community practices).
- **Analogy of speech** - Use of analogical language to make divine speaking intelligible without collapsing divine transcendence.
- **Normativity of divine speech** - Divine utterances as binding, formative for moral and covenantal life.
- **Prophetic word** - Example of divine illocutionary act: declaration and summons to action.
- **Incarnation / Logos** - Jesus as paradigmatic divine speech (occasionally invoked to ground divine communicative action).
- **Speakerhood of God** - Emphasis on God as a personal agent capable of addressing creatures.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "divine speech" and for deploying speech-act categories in theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against purely non-propositional or eliminativist accounts of revelation.
- As an **exegetical-model resource** for interpreting Scripture as vehicle of divine address (helps bridge linguistic analysis and hermeneutics).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in religious epistemology debates about testimony, warrant, and the believer's hearing of God.
