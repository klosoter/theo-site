### TITLE
**The Christian View of Man** - J. Gresham Machen 
(early 20th century Reformed apologetic and doctrinal anthropology; published in the context of Machen's broader apologetic and anti‑modernist writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th‑century American Protestantism; reaction against theological liberalism, modernist optimism about human nature, and naturalistic reductionism.
 - Machen writing as a Princeton‑trained New Testament scholar and emerging leader in conservative Presbyterianism; contemporary with debates that led to the 1920s modernist‑fundamentalist controversies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A truly Christian anthropology holds that human beings are God's creatures, made in the **Imago Dei**, radically fallen through sin, and redeemable only by the incarnate Christ and the work of the Spirit. Modern sentimental or scientific accounts either obliterate the creaturely relation to God or understate human sinfulness and dependence on revelation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of creaturehood: humans are made, not self‑explaining; dignity derives from God, not from autonomous development.
 - Explication of the Imago Dei: moral, rational, and religious capacities point beyond nature to God.
 - Diagnosis of the Fall: sin is pervasive - guilt and corruption - not mere error or social maladjustment.
 - Critique of rival accounts:
 - Naturalistic/scientific reductionism fails to account for conscience, personality, and spiritual needs.
 - Liberal optimism (moral evolution, social gospel without conversion) minimizes sin and the necessity of divine grace.
 - Soteriological consequence: only regeneration and the mediatorial work of Christ restore the image and secure hope in resurrection and final judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary appeal to Scripture and Reformed confessional traditions (implicit dialogue with Augustine/Calvin).
 - Engagement with modern philosophers, naturalists, and liberal theologians in outline and polemic (general critique rather than sustained engagement with a single author).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (Imago Dei, createdness), Hamartiology (original sin, total depravity), Christology (incarnation, mediation, true humanity), Pneumatology (regeneration), Soteriology, Eschatology (resurrection, destiny), Revelation (objective propositional truth vs. subjective religion).
- **Closing line**
 - Machen argues that Christian doctrine alone gives a coherent, sobering, and hopeful account of what man is and what he needs: creaturehood corrupted by sin and healed only by the redemptive work of God in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the **objective** character of divine revelation as the necessary corrective to speculative anthropology.
 - Simultaneous affirmation of human dignity (creation in God's image) and the profundity of human sinfulness - resisting sentimental humanism and corrosive pessimism alike.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to theological liberalism that relativizes revelation and moralizes sin into social or psychological phenomena.
 - Rejection of naturalistic explanations (scientific materialism, evolutionary teleology) as insufficient for moral and religious categories.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much neologisms as a crisp re‑deployment: treating the Imago Dei as the theological pivot between created dignity and need for redemption; insistence on sin as both guilt (forensic) and corruption (ontological).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed circles; contributed to the intellectual climate that produced Westminster Theological Seminary and the organized conservative response to modernism.
 - Cited in apologetic and pastoral discussions of human nature, used as a concise formulation of Reformed anthropology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches how to integrate biblical doctrine, confessional commitments, and cultural critique; useful for seminarians, pastors, and theologians confronting contemporary forms of optimism about human nature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - human dignity grounded in being created in God's image; marks human capacities for reason, morality, and relationship.
- **Createdness** - ontological dependence on God; counters autonomy and self‑sufficiency.
- **Original Sin** - inherited corruption and guilt affecting will, mind, and affections.
- **Total Depravity** - extent of sin: no faculty of man remains untouched such that salvation is not merely moral improvement.
- **Fall** - historical/universal rupture of creaturely relation to God with pervasive consequences.
- **Regeneration** - sovereign work of the Spirit restoring the image and enabling faith; indispensable for true moral and spiritual renewal.
- **Incarnation / True Humanity of Christ** - Christ as the model and means of human restoration; necessary for the mediation that redeems human nature.
- **Objective Revelation** - Scripture and historical revelation as the binding norm against subjective religious reinterpretation.
- **Naturalism** - criticized explanatory framework that reduces persons to biological or social processes.
- **Liberal optimism / Social Gospel critique** - insistence that social reform is insufficient without personal conversion and atonement.
- **Guilt + Corruption** - dual aspect of sin (forensic and ontological) emphasized against therapeutic or merely legal readings.
- **Resurrection / Eschatological Hope** - ultimate restoration of human destiny grounded in Christ's resurrection.
- **Mediation** - Christ's necessary role linking divine holiness and human sinfulness.
- **Moral Responsibility** - retained and affirmed despite discussions of determinism or scientific accounts.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise definitional source for Reformed Christian anthropology in teaching and catechesis.
 - As a polemic resource against liberal and naturalistic accounts of human nature in apologetics and ecclesial controversies.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking anthropology to hamartiology, Christology, and soteriology in systematic outlines.
