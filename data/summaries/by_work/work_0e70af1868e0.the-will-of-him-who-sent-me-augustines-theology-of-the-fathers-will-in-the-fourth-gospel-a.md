### TITLE
**"The Will of Him Who Sent Me: Augustine's Theology of the Father's Will in the Fourth Gospel" - Andrew Moody**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Recent scholarly article situating Augustine's John-commentary within late antique Trinitarian and exegetical debates.
 - Moves between patristic exegesis of the Fourth Gospel (John) and Augustine's theological development amid controversies over will, grace, and agency (notably against Pelagian tendencies and Arian implications).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Moody argues that Augustine reads the Johannine phrase "the will of him who sent me" as a hinge for his Trinitarian and soteriological theology: the Father's will is both the inner relational will of the Trinity and the external salvific will enacted in the Son's mission. Augustine therefore stabilizes divine unity and human salvation by treating will as relational, teleological, and efficacious.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Shows how Augustine exegetically seizes John 6:38 (and cognate Johannine passages) to develop a theology of will that:
 - Distinguishes but does not divide the wills of the divine persons (avoiding dyotheletism in a way that preserves divine unity).
 - Locates the Son's obedience in a voluntary, relational submission rather than in a subordination of essence.
 - Links the Father's will to the economy of salvation-incarnation, obedience, and the gift of the Spirit-so that divine will is both ontological (intra-Trinitarian) and economical (redemptive history).
 - Traces Augustine's use of biblical exegesis, lexical choices (voluntas, cupido, caritas), and rhetorical patterns to show conceptual continuity across Trinitarian and moral works.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Augustine's Tractates on John, De Trinitate, sermons and anti-Pelagian writings.
 - Interlocutors discussed: Origenic John-exegesis, contemporary patristic commentators, Pelagian critics and later medieval interpretations of divine will.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (intra-divine relations and unity of will), Christology (obedience, mission), soteriology (salvific will, election, grace), pneumatology (gift and mission), divine freedom and human will.
- **Closing line**
 - Moody presents Augustine's handling of "the will of him who sent me" as a compact program: the Father's will is the Trinitarian will of love that orders the economy of salvation, enacted by the Son in willing obedience and given effect in the gift of the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reads Augustine's Johannine exegesis as formative for his overall doctrine of will-less a subsidiary exegetical footnote and more a structural key to Trinitarian and soteriological thought.
 - Emphasizes will as relational and teleological rather than merely cognitive or volitional in a modern sense.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts Augustine's approach with readings that over-emphasize a static divine unity (making will monolithic) or that fragment wills ontologically between persons; Moody shows Augustine preserves both distinction and unity.
 - Pushes back on treatments that locate Augustine's doctrine of will primarily in anti-Pelagian polemics, arguing instead it is integrally exegetical and liturgically shaped.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Highlights Augustine's nuanced lexical deployment (voluntas, desiderium, caritas) to articulate different registers of divine willing (innate, goal-directed, and loving).
 - Frames Augustine's move as treating "will" as a category that negotiates intra-Trinitarian relation and economical action without implying mutability or division of essence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful corrective for Reformed and wider theological traditions that lean on Augustine for doctrines of election and grace: Moody clarifies the Trinitarian grounding of Augustine's claims about efficacious will.
 - Offers a model for reading patristic exegesis as formative theology rather than merely historical commentary.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for Trinitarian theology, Johannine studies, and scholarship on Augustine's pastoral-exegetical method; helpful for teaching Augustine's integration of exegesis and systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Voluntas (will)** - central term; Augustine treats it as relational and oriented to the good.
- **Paterna voluntas (the Father's will)** - both intra-Trinitarian intention and the economic will ordering salvation.
- **Obedientia (the Son's obedience)** - voluntary, loving compliance grounded in Trinitarian communion, not ontological inferiority.
- **Missio / economical will** - the sending of the Son and Spirit as the Father's will enacted in history.
- **Caritas (love)** - the operative mode of divine will; will is expressed as loving relation and purpose.
- **Desiderium / cupido (desire)** - used by Augustine to nuance motive and movement in divine willing vs. human appetites.
- **Inseparable operations** - Augustinian move to affirm distinct persons acting without dividing the divine will/essence.
- **Liberties of the will (liberum arbitrium)** - Augustine's anthropology of will interacts with divine will in discussions of grace and human response.
- **Efficacious will** - the Father's will as actively bringing about salvation (link to election/grace debates).
- **Economy (oikonomia)** - the framework connecting inner-Trinitarian will with historical salvation acts.
- **Augustine's Johannine exegesis** - methodological marker: rhetorical-pontifical reading that shapes doctrine.
- **Trinitarian relationality** - the conceptual pillar that makes distinct wills coherent with unity.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Augustine's notion of divine will grounded in relational Trinitarian ontology.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how Johannine passages function theologically in patristic thought.
- As a **polemic resource** when interlocutors appeal to Augustine on election/grace-Moody refocuses those appeals on Trinitarian will rather than unilateral decretalism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for linking Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology through the category of will.
