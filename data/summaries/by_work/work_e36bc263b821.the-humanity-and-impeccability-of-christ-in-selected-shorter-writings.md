### TITLE
**The Humanity and Impeccability of Christ** (essay in Selected Shorter Writings) - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Princeton theology; written against currents of liberal criticism and revisionist Christology that sought to explain Christ's sinlessness away or to make him peccable to secure "real" humanity.
 - Warfield writes as a defender of classical Reformed, Chalcedonian Christology within a scientific-theological ethos-precision in metaphysical categories and exegetical rigor.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ is truly human and yet morally **impeccable** (incapable of sin). This incapacity for sin does not undercut his genuine freedom, passibility, or full participation in human experience.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: texts that attest to Christ's sinlessness and temptability (e.g., Heb 4:15; Luke 4; the Passion narratives).
 - Philosophical and theological analysis:
 - Distinguishes between **natural ability** and **moral possibility**; Christ could be tempted (natural susceptibility) but not actually sin (moral impossibility).
 - Locates the ground of impeccability in the **hypostatic union**: the human will united to the Divine Person is, by that union, morally incapable of sinning.
 - Refutes the inference that impeccability implies determinism or removes genuine freedom; instead, Christ possesses a free will rightly ordered and non-possessed by sinful inclination.
 - Polemic: addresses opponents who claim peccability is required for authentic humanity; counters by appeal to Scripture, patristic and scholastic categories, and logical distinctions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to Chalcedonian formulations, Augustine, medieval scholastics (categories of will and potency), and Reformed systematicians; polemically opposes currents in modern liberal theology and any pietistic or rationalistic pressures to alter classical dogma.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (person-nature union; properties of the incarnate Son), freedom and will, passibility vs impassibility, soteriology (implications for atonement), revelation (Christ as normative revelation).

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield insists that a robust orthodoxy preserves both **true humanity** and **moral impeccability** by grounding sinlessness in the hypostatic union without collapsing the distinction between divine and human natures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful philosophical parsing of "ability to sin" versus "moral possibility"; refuses simplistic either/or between peccability and determinism.
 - Anchors impeccability not in abstract metaphysics alone but in the personal union with the Divine Son-thus making doctrinal claims personal and Scriptural.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies that make Christ peccable to prove his humanity (polemical answer to some modernists and existentialist readings).
 - Contrasts with views that treat impeccability as a mere absence of temptation or as an external restraint; for Warfield it is an internal moral configuration consequent on union with the Word.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Reiteration and nuanced application of scholastic distinctions (potency/act; moral vs natural ability) to modern debates.
 - Reclaims the hypostatic union as the decisive explanatory principle for Christ's moral status.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; reinforced Princeton orthodoxy and later confessionalist treatments of Christology.
 - Criticized by some who prioritize the existential risk in atonement theories (those who argue Christ must have been able to sin to atone for fallen freedom).

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies doctrinal coherence of sinless humanity and provides a compact corrective to both liberal reductionism and crude polemical defenses of peccability.
 - Serves as a model of combining biblical exegesis with disciplined philosophical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability** - the doctrinal claim that Christ was not capable of sinning; for Warfield a moral incapacity grounded in the hypostatic union.
- **Peccability** - the claim that Christ could have sinned; treated as the rival thesis Warfield refutes.
- **Hypostatic union** - personal union of two natures in the one Person of the Son; Warfield treats this as the metaphysical basis for impeccability.
- **Moral inability (non posse peccare)** - inability to commit sin in a moral sense; distinguished from lack of opportunity or external restraint.
- **Natural ability** - capacity to be tempted, suffer, act; permitted and affirmed in Christ (He was susceptible to hunger, pain, temptation).
- **Passibility** - Christ's ability to suffer; Warfield insists passibility and impeccability are compatible.
- **Freedom / free will** - genuine, non-coerced freedom ordered to holiness; Warfield resists equating impeccability with absence of freedom.
- **Temptation** - real encounters with sinfulness; used to show Christ's authentic humanity while maintaining sinlessness.
- **Chalcedonian frame** - doctrinal horizon that preserves two natures without confusion; background for Warfield's argument.
- **Moral necessity vs metaphysical necessity** - Warfield distinguishes moral certainty (rooted in nature and union) from fatalistic metaphysical necessity.
- **Atonement implications** - sinlessness necessary for unblemished sacrifice; Warfield links impeccability to soteriological efficacy.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying)** - noted but not allowed to imply loss of divinity or ground for peccability.
- **Exegetical model** - close reading of temptation texts to balance temptability and sinlessness.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional source** for orthodox statements on Christ's impeccability in Reformed systematic theologies.
- As a **polemic tool** against modern liberal or revisionist claims that Christus could or must have sinned to be "real."
- As an **exegetical model** combining text-critical attention with philosophical clarity to defend Chalcedonian Christology.
