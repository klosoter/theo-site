### TITLE
**Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy** - Siva Vaidhyanathan (2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 2018 amid rising concern over Cambridge Analytica, election interference, and debates about regulation of Big Tech.
 - Situated within secular critiques of digital platforms; intersects media studies, political science, and public ethics.
 - Engages a moment when democratic institutions and civil society were re-evaluating technology's civic effects.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Facebook's architecture and business model intentionally optimize attention and engagement in ways that fragment public life, erode shared facts, and therefore **undermine democratic practice and civic trust**.
 - The problem is systemic, not merely individual misuse: design incentives, corporate governance, and regulatory gaps produce social harms.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Facebook evolved from a benign social tool to an algorithmically driven attention machine.
 - Mechanisms: algorithms, advertising economies, data extraction, and platform affordances amplify misinformation, emotion, and polarization.
 - Responsibility: Apple-and-state style fixes are insufficient; accountability requires legal, regulatory, and civic remedies.
 - Remedies proposed: transparency, enforceable privacy and antitrust measures, democratic oversight, and norms to restore shared informational bases.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts with tech-optimists (e.g., Clay Shirky), critiques of surveillance capitalism (parallels with Shoshana Zuboff), journalism scholars, political theorists, and investigative reporting on Cambridge Analytica.
 - Uses case studies: 2016 U.S. election, misinformation campaigns, platform policy failures, and internal Facebook history.

- **Doctrines treated (theological mapping)**
 - **Truth and epistemology**: public epistemic standards and shared reality.
 - **Sociality and community**: formation and fragmentation of communal bonds.
 - **Authority and governance**: corporate power vs. covenantal accountability; subsidiarity and public responsibility.
 - **Ethics of speech and conscience**: limits of free expression when speech disrupts the common good.
 - The author does not treat theology explicitly, but implications map onto political theology, ecclesiology, and moral theology.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Vaidhyanathan's core moral claim: when informational infrastructures prioritize profit over the common good, they become a form of social sin that corrodes communal trust, public reason, and democratic covenant.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Coining of the concise label **"antisocial media"** to highlight moral and civic harms rather than technological novelty.
 - Focus on **business incentives and design choices** as primary causal mechanisms, not merely user behavior.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges techno-utopian narratives that treat networks as inherently democratizing.
 - Counters reductionist accounts that blame individual users alone; shifts blame to platform architectures and corporate governance.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes **engagement as an ethical vector**: how metrics shape content and moral outcomes.
 - Frames platform dysfunction as a **public-health-like civic emergency** requiring systemic cures.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Widely used outside theology in media studies, policy debates, and civic tech discussions.
 - In theological circles, adopted as an empirical source and ethical provocation in courses on public theology, digital ethics, and congregational formation.
 - Influential for pastors and church leaders crafting digital ministry policies and for theologians sketching ecclesial responses to disinformation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a clear, accessible linkage between technical design and moral outcomes-helpful for applied ethics curricula.
 - Serves as a practical case study for deliberations on regulation, covenantal accountability, and communal resilience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Antisocial media**
 - The central label: platforms that, by design, harm social cohesion and democratic processes.

- **Engagement economy / attention economy**
 - Metrics of likes, shares, and time-on-site drive algorithms and content selection.

- **Algorithmic amplification**
 - Algorithms prioritize content that elicits strong affect, thereby amplifying polarization and falsehood.

- **Surveillance/data extraction**
 - Business model dependent on user data commodification for targeted advertising and influence.

- **Misinformation/disinformation**
 - False or deceptive content circulated at scale; often weaponized for political ends.

- **Filter bubbles / echo chambers**
 - Algorithmic and social dynamics that isolate users from diverse viewpoints, weakening deliberative norms.

- **Platform governance**
 - Internal policies, moderation practices, and corporate accountability structures that mediate speech and harm.

- **Civic harm / public epistemic harm**
 - Damage to the shared basis of knowledge and trust necessary for democratic deliberation.

- **Scalable persuasion**
 - Techniques that enable influence at mass scale via microtargeting and algorithmic optimization.

- **Regulatory remedies**
 - Proposed legal responses: antitrust, privacy law, transparency mandates, and oversight mechanisms.

- **Moral economy**
 - The ethical landscape shaped by corporate incentives and communal norms.

- **Infrastructure ethics**
 - The study of how technical design choices embed value commitments with social consequences.

- **Commons / shared informational space**
 - A civic resource analogous to common goods that must be stewarded for democracy.

- **Covenantal accountability (theological import)**
 - Idea that institutions must answer to communal obligations beyond profit motives.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source / conceptual pivot**: Provides a widely cited, succinct label and diagnosis for platform-induced civic harms.
- **Polemic / policy primer**: Used to justify regulatory and legislative intervention in digital platforms.
- **Ethical and pastoral resource**: Employed in theological ethics and congregational practice to shape digital discipleship and public witness.
- **Case model for public theology**: Models how empirical media critique informs theological reflection about truth, community, and governance.
