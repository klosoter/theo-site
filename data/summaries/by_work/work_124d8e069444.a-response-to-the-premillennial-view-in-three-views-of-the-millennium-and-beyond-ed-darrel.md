### TITLE
A Response to the Premillennial View (in Three Views of the Millennium and Beyond, ed. Darrell L. Bock) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate (book pub. 1999). Gaffin writes from a Reformed, covenantal, and historically amillennial perspective amid renewed attention to premillennial and dispensational readings.
 - Part of a multi-author volume presenting and critiquing competing millennial positions for evangelical readership.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The premillennial separation of the millennium from the present age and its futurist reading of Revelation 20 are exegetically and theologically mistaken. Revelation 20 should be read within a canonical, Christ-centered inaugurated-eschatology framework: Christ has already, in his death-resurrection-ascension, bound Satan and inaugurated the kingdom; the millennium is symbolic of the present age between comings.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical critique of premillennial readings of Revelation 20:
 - Argues that the "binding of Satan" is present reality effected by Christ's ministry, especially his death and resurrection; it is not a wholly future event that initiates a distinct 1,000-year political-peace epoch.
 - Treats the "thousand years" as symbolic/apocalyptic imagery consistent with Revelation's genre and the OT-NT typological pattern rather than a literal chronological interval.
 - Interprets the "first resurrection" as a spiritual or inaugurated resurrection (Christ and his redeemed life in the age of the church) rather than positing two separate physical resurrections widely separated in time.
 - Theological integration:
 - Locates the millennium within **already/not-yet** inaugurated eschatology: present participation in resurrection life and kingdom realities, with final consummation at the parousia and the single general resurrection.
 - Appeals to Pauline theology (esp. 1 Cor 15; Rom 5-8) and to the wider canonical witness to support continuity between present redemption and future consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: contemporary premillennial interpreters represented in the volume; broader engagement with dispensational futurist exegesis.
 - Draws on Augustineian/historical amillennial resources, Pauline exegesis, and canonical-theological method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and apocalyptic hermeneutics, Christology (victory in death-resurrection), resurrection, kingdom of God (inauguration and consummation), Satanology, final judgment.

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin centers the millennium theologically on **Christ's inaugurated victory**: Revelation 20 depicts the present, decisive restraint and defeat of Satan in virtue of the cross and resurrection, with consummation reserved for the single future return.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on canonical and Pauline corroboration for interpreting Revelation: eschatology must be anchored in Christology (cross & resurrection).
 - Balances symbolic/apocalyptic reading with historic, covenantal continuity; refuses both carte blanche allegorizing and literalistic futurism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects premillennial literalism that isolates Revelation 20 as inaugurating a separate earthly golden age and that posits two widely separated bodily resurrections.
 - Contrasts with dispensational premillennialism by emphasizing covenant continuity and the unity of the resurrection-judgment event.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the language of **inaugurated eschatology** and **first resurrection as present/participatory** to reframe the "millennium" as the epoch of Christ's present reign rather than a future political millennium.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited within Reformed and evangelical circles favoring amillennial or inaugurated readings; used as a clear, canonical-theological counter to premillennial positions.
 - Strengthened scholarly respectability for Reformed amillennialism in late-20th/early-21st century evangelical debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies disciplined integration of exegesis and systematic theology; useful model for resisting simplistic literalism and for teaching the unity of the New Testament eschatological witness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Binding of Satan** - effected in Christ's death-resurrection; a present restraint, not merely a future punitive event.
- **Thousand years (1,000)** - symbolic apocalyptic number signifying the church-age epoch; not a literal chronological millennium.
- **First resurrection** - interpreted as the present, participatory resurrection-life in Christ (inaugurated aspect); distinguishes from final bodily resurrection at parousia.
- **Second death** - final eschatological judgment; remains future and decisive.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - central hermeneutical grid: kingdom already begun in Christ, not yet consummated.
- **Realized eschatology** - emphasis on present realities already accomplished in Christ (victory, new life).
- **Parousia** - decisive future event that consummates what is inaugurated; single general resurrection and judgment coincide with Christ's return.
- **Apocalyptic symbolism** - warns against literalist handling of Revelation's images; genre-sensitive interpretation required.
- **Canonical-theological method** - uses Pauline and Johannine corpus to interpret Revelation coherently.
- **Covenant continuity** - commitment to continuity of God's saving purposes across covenants; resists sharp dispensational breaks.
- **Christological hermeneutic** - reads eschatological texts through the death-resurrection-ascension of Christ.
- **Single general resurrection** - rejects premillennial two-resurrection schema; final bodily resurrection at parousia.
- **Kingdom already/not-yet** - the millennial motif reframed as present reign plus future consummation.
- **Satanology (defeat vs. release)** - acknowledges temporary restraint (now) and final defeat (at consummation).

- **How this work is used**
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Revelation 20 within canonical and Pauline horizons.
 - As a **polemic** or corrective against premillennial and dispensational readings.
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed/inaugurated eschatology in teaching and systematic formulations.
