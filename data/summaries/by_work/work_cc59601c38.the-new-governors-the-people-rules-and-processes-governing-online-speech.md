### TITLE
The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech - Kate Klonick

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid intensified debate (late 2010s) over platform power, content moderation, and democratic discourse.
 - Situated at the intersection of internet studies, administrative law, and public policy; empirical focus on major social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) and emergent governance bodies (e.g., Facebook Oversight Board).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Private technology companies have become de facto governors of public speech; their internal rules, adjudications, and governance architectures perform functions historically reserved to states and legal institutions.
 - The problem: legitimacy, accountability, and procedural fairness when private actors exercise public-facing authority over speech.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Empirical mapping: identifies who the new governors are (platform policy teams, moderators, external advisors) and how they act.
 - Institutional analysis: compares platform governance practices to administrative law and public governance (rulemaking, adjudication, enforcement).
 - Normative assessment: argues for proceduralization, transparency, and institutional design that recognizes platforms' quasi-public role; points to hybrid solutions (self-regulation plus public oversight).
 - Case studies: platform policies, takedowns, bans, and the creation of independent-ish bodies (e.g., Oversight Board) illustrate both innovation and shortcomings.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Platforms: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Instagram.
 - Interlocutors: in-house policy teams, content moderators (including contractors), civil-society advocates, free-speech proponents, regulators, and legal scholars.
 - Methods: interviews, policy-document analysis, ethnographic observations of moderation practices.
- **Doctrines treated (theological analogues)**
 - **Authority and governance**: analogous questions about who legitimately governs a community.
 - **Covenant & polity**: private platform terms function as covenantal rules shaping belonging and discipline.
 - **Justice and due process**: procedural justice concerns when decisions affect participation and reputation.
 - **Public square / speech ethics**: normative limits on speech and the communal goods at stake.
- **Closing line**
 - Klonick locates a new, hybrid governance architecture: private companies as public governors require institutional safeguards and renewed concepts of accountability to preserve democratic and normative goods of collective speech.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Coins and popularizes the label **"new governors"** to reframe platforms as governing actors rather than mere intermediaries.
 - Emphasizes governance *processes* (rulemaking, adjudication, enforcement) over isolated content controversies.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against narratives that treat platforms solely as free-speech platforms or purely commercial intermediaries; shows structural governance roles are substantive and persistent.
 - Offers a middle path between laissez-faire platform self-regulation and blunt governmental regulation, stressing procedural design and accountability.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Treats moderation and policy teams as administrative actors; borrows from administrative law vocabulary (notice, rulemaking, adjudication, appeals).
 - Articulates the concept of **private global governance**-rules enacted by transnational corporations carrying state-like effects.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in internet governance, legal, and policy debates; influential in discussions around platform transparency and independent oversight mechanisms.
 - Informed policy designs (e.g., debates around Oversight Board) and academic work on corporate governance of speech.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a clear empirical and conceptual framework for understanding platform power.
 - Useful for comparative study across polity, law, ethics, and ecclesial governance analogies - especially for courses on authority, public theology, and digital ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Governors**
 - The class of private actors (platforms, policy makers, moderators, advisory boards) that govern online speech.
- **Platform governance**
 - The set of rules, institutions, and practices through which platforms regulate user behavior and content.
- **Content moderation**
 - Operational practices (human and algorithmic) of reviewing and acting on user-generated content.
- **Community standards / Terms of Service**
 - The articulated rules and covenants defining permissible speech and conduct on platforms.
- **Oversight Board**
 - An exemplar of attempted institutionalization of independent review and appeals outside traditional public law.
- **Deplatforming**
 - Enforcement practice of banning or removing an actor or content from a platform; raises questions about exclusion and remedy.
- **Notice-and-takedown**
 - Legacy legal-compliance model borrowed from copyright law; contrasted with platforms' contemporary policy enforcement.
- **Administrative-law analogy**
 - Framework treating platform rulemaking and adjudication like public administrative processes (rules, transparency, appeals).
- **Private/global governance**
 - The transnational, corporate exercise of regulatory power affecting global publics.
- **Transparency**
 - Calls for clearer publication of rules, decisions, and rationales to legitimize governance practices.
- **Due process / Proceduralization**
 - The push to institutionalize notice, appeals, and reasoned decisions in platform governance.
- **Contractual covenant**
 - Platform terms as a type of communal covenant shaping membership, rights, and obligations.
- **Moderation labor**
 - Visibility into the human and precarious workforce tasked with enforcement and the ethical implications thereof.
- **Marketplace of ideas (critique)**
 - Klonick shows how the classical marketplace metaphor is inadequate to capture concentrated corporate gatekeeping.
- **Hybrid governance**
 - The blend of private rulemaking with public norms, external experts, and emergent oversight mechanisms.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: as the canonical exposition of the "new governors" concept in policy and academic literature.
 - Polemic and policy design: employed in arguments for procedural reform, transparency, and independent oversight of platforms.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in comparative analyses linking digital governance to administrative law, ecclesial polity, or public theology discussions about authority and community.
