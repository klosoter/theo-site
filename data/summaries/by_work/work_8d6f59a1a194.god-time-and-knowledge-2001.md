### TITLE
God, Time, and Knowledge (2001) - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Turn-of-the-21st-century analytic-theological debate: resurgence of Molinism within analytic philosophy of religion; sharp exchanges among Molinists, Thomists, and Open Theists.
 - Craig writes as a prominent analytic evangelical philosopher, bringing formal tools to classical theism, providence, and free will debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To show that **Molinism (middle knowledge)** provides the most coherent solution to the tension between divine omniscience/foreknowledge and libertarian human freedom; to defend the coherence and metaphysical grounding of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Exposition of possible-worlds framework and Molina's distinction of God's knowledge:
 - Natural knowledge (what God could know independ. of creation),
 - Middle knowledge (what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance),
 - Free knowledge (knowledge of the actual world God brings about).
 - Formal defense of the **truth and grounding** of counterfactuals of freedom (CCFs) against the main objections (esp. the grounding objection).
 - Articulation of how God's providential choice of a world using middle knowledge secures omniscience, responsibility, and genuine libertarian freedom.
 - Engagement with alternative views: Open Theism (denial of exhaustive future truth), Thomistic/Boethian views (divine timelessness and predetermination), and critiques claiming Molinism makes God contingent on creatures.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Luis de Molina (originator of middle knowledge), Alvin Plantinga, Thomas Flint, and contemporary critics such as William Hasker, Richard Swinburne, and Thomistic defenders.
 - Draws on possible-worlds semantics (Lewisian vocabulary tempered to theological ends).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine omniscience and providence; freedom and moral responsibility; creation and divine causality; issues touching on classical theism (timelessness vs temporality) and predestination.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig situates **Molinism as the best analytic-theistic strategy** to reconcile exhaustive divine knowledge with libertarian freedom while preserving robust providence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Detailed analytic articulation of middle knowledge as a viable and theologically robust epistemic category; emphasis on **metaphysical grounding** rather than mere semantic stipulation.
 - Systematic use of possible-worlds vocabulary to explain how God actualizes a world in light of CCFs.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against both Open Theism (which limits divine foreknowledge) and classical Thomism (which tends to subsume freedom under divine causation), arguing Molinism preserves divine sovereignty without determinism.
 - Counters the claim that middle knowledge makes God dependent on creaturely facts by arguing epistemic priority (truths about what free creatures would do are true simpliciter and do not causally constrain God).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the taxonomy of divine knowledge (natural / middle / free) with technical attention to truthmakers for counterfactuals.
 - Refines the "grounding objection" and formulates substantive rejoinders grounded in character-circumstance accounts of truthmakers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Cemented Craig as a leading contemporary Molinist; contributed substantially to Molinism's revival in evangelical and analytic circles.
 - Generated extended literature (responses, defenses, and further refinements) on the grounding objection and on how to model CCFs metaphysically.
- **Enduring value**
 - A benchmark text for teaching and contested dialogue: rigorous, programmatic, and usable as both a primary exposition of Molinism and a primer on contemporary debates about divine foreknowledge and freedom.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Molinism** - The theological system hinging on God's possession of middle knowledge; central explanatory framework of the book.
- **Middle knowledge** - Knowledge of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (what a free agent would do in any hypothetical circumstance).
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)** - Propositions about what free agents would do under specified circumstances; the pivotal objects whose truth Craig defends.
- **Grounding objection** - The charge that CCFs lack truthmakers and so cannot be true prior to God's creative decree; Craig offers positive accounts of grounding.
- **Natural / Middle / Free knowledge** - Molina's tripartite schema for divine knowledge; Craig refines and defends its coherence.
- **Possible worlds semantics** - Analytical apparatus used to model God's knowledge and world-selection; adapted to avoid problematic metaphysical commitments.
- **Libertarian free will** - The view of libertarian human freedom whose compatibility with divine foreknowledge is the question at stake.
- **Divine providence** - How God uses middle knowledge to actualize a providentially ordered world; central theological application.
- **Atemporal vs temporal models of God** - Discussed in relation to foreknowledge; Craig engages classical theism without making temporality the decisive issue for Molinism.
- **Transworld depravity** - Related Alvin Plantinga idea (not Craig's view) cited in debates about God's ability to actualize a morally acceptable world under libertarian freedom.
- **Truthmaker** - Ontological grounds that make propositions true; crucial for defending the metaphysical status of CCFs.
- **Actualization of a world** - God's creative choice among possible worlds informed by middle knowledge.
- **Divine sovereignty vs contingency** - Tension addressed: Craig argues Molinism preserves both.
- **Modal epistemology** - Underpins the account of how God knows counterfactuals and selects worlds.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for contemporary Molinism and the taxonomy of divine knowledge.
- As a **polemic** against Open Theism and deterministic Thomistic accounts of divine foreknowledge.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about truthmakers for CCFs and the metaphysics of providence; frequently cited in courses on philosophy of religion and analytic theology.
