### TITLE
Beyond the Modern Age (with Bob Goudzwaard) - Craig Bartholomew

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century conversation addressing the collapse of Enlightenment confidence and the rise of postmodern and post-secular critique.
 - Emerging from a broadly **Reformed / neo-Calvinist** milieu (Kuyperian concerns) with explicit engagement of cultural theory, economics, and ecclesial vocation.
 - Coauthor Bob Goudzwaard brings a missional-economics and social-critique perspective to Bartholomew's theological-narrative sensibility.

- **Central thesis**
 - Modernity's claim to autonomous reason and a privatized faith has exhausted its cultural resources; a Christian recovery beyond modernity requires retelling the biblical meta-narrative and reappropriating **vocation**, the **dominion/cultural mandate**, and an integrated public theology that resists modern idolatry.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: maps the cultural symptoms and philosophical presuppositions of modernity (autonomy, commodification, disenchantment).
 - Theological recovery: argues for a return to **creation-fall-redemption** as organizing categories to interpret culture.
 - Practical application: redefines vocation and dominion as faithful stewardship in every sphere (economics, ecology, arts, politics), stressing structural sin and the need for systemic reform.
 - Ecclesial and societal consequences: proposes strategies for Christian formation and public witness that resist privatization and promote cultural renewal.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thinkers indirectly (critique of autonomy and reason).
 - Draws on Kuyperian and reformational thinkers (e.g., Abraham Kuyper, Dooyeweerd-style concerns) and contemporary cultural critics; Goudzwaard contributes critiques shaped by Christian economics and social ethics.
 - Uses Scripture as canonical frame - especially Genesis (creation mandate), Pauline and wisdom texts (ethics and vocation), and redemptive-historical motifs.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (ordering, gift, mandate), **Fall** (idolatry, structural sin), **Redemption** (Christ as healer and re-maker of culture), **Covenant** motifs, and practical outworkings for **ethics**, ecclesiology, and social theology. Implicitly depends on doctrine of providence and common grace.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically centered on reframing vocation and dominion as God-formed stewardship within the biblical narrative, offering a Kuyperian-informed public theology that moves Christian engagement beyond the failures of modern autonomy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates **narrative theology** with Kuyperian cultural concern: not merely programmatic cultural reform but a re-storying of identity and vocation rooted in biblical metanarrative.
 - Strong focus on the **structural/collective** character of sin in modern institutions (economy, technology), not just individual morality.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal privatization of faith and secular-neutral public spheres; critiques both naive optimism about modern progress and reactionary withdrawal into pietism.
 - Distinguishes itself from purely intellectualist renewals by emphasizing praxis: economic reform, ecological stewardship, and communal formation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses an "archaeology of contemporary culture" approach to excavate modern assumptions.
 - Recasts the **cultural mandate** as vocational, relational, and constructive rather than merely dominative or exploitative.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and neo-Calvinist circles as a constructive resource for public theology and cultural engagement; used in courses on vocation, cultural theology, and Christian social ethics.
 - Influential among those seeking synthesis of narrative biblical theology and socio-economic critique; less cited in strictly academic secular cultural theory.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a workable theological framework for training Christians in holistic vocation and institutional reform.
 - Endures as a concise corrective to overly privatized or overly triumphalist models of cultural engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Vocation**
 - Human calling in every sphere; not limited to clergy. Central to ethics and cultural transformation.

- **Dominion / Cultural Mandate**
 - Genesis mandate reframed as stewardship and co-creation under God, bearing responsibilities, constraints, and limits (not license).

- **Imago Dei**
 - Basis for human dignity, creativity, and relational vocation; grounds resistance to commodification.

- **Common Grace**
 - Explains cultural goods and shared gifts in a fallen world; allows constructive engagement with non-Christian culture.

- **Autonomy of the modern subject**
 - Critiqued as the root of modern idolatry; must be displaced by Trinitarian and covenantal dependence.

- **Structural sin / systemic idolatry**
 - Social and economic institutions can idolize wealth, efficiency, or consumption; requires systemic remedies.

- **Narrative theology / biblical metanarrative**
 - Scripture as organizing story (creation-fall-redemption) that reorients cultural interpretation and action.

- **Public theology**
 - Theology aimed at public institutions and practices, not only individual piety; practical and civic in scope.

- **Stewardship**
 - Practical outworking of dominion; ecological, economic, artistic care.

- **Reformational / Kuyperian resources**
 - Philosophical and theological tools for cultural engagement; emphasize sphere sovereignty and vocation.

- **Economics as ethical domain**
 - Goudzwaard's contribution: economic critique integrated with theological anthropology and vocation.

- **Praxis-oriented formation**
 - Christian formation aimed at equipping laity for cultural work, not only church ministry.

- **Lament and hope**
 - Cultural diagnosis balanced with redemptive hope; avoids naïve optimism or despair.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary formulations of vocation and the cultural mandate.
- As a **polemic** against privatized faith and modern autonomy in public theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis and creation theology into cultural ethics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula linking Reformed theology, ethics, and social/economic critique.
