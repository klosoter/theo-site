### TITLE
Our Program (Ons Program, 1879) - Abraham Kuyper

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the Netherlands, 1879, as the programmatic manifesto of the newly organized Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP).
 - Arises from late-19th-century Dutch orthodox Calvinist reaction to liberal Protestantism, secularizing modernity, and the rise of socialism; formative for Kuyper's neo-Calvinist public theology and the later phenomenon of verzuiling (pillarization).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian citizens require a distinct, confessional political program and social organization because sovereignty belongs to God and secular-political neutrality is a myth; the state must not be absolutized nor must Christians withdraw from public life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: the French Revolution's political philosophy privatized faith and erected an absolutist state that claims total authority over social life.
 - Principle: the **sovereignty of God** implies differentiated social spheres (family, church, school, economy, state) each with their own God-given authority; no single human institution may claim absolute sovereignty.
 - Programmatic proposals:
 - Formation of a Christian political party as the legitimate organ for confessional representation.
 - Defense of parental rights and the establishment/funding of Christian schools (the "school struggle").
 - Legislative and constitutional measures to secure denominational equality before the law (including equal funding, religious freedom, and limits to state power).
 - Praxis: active Christian engagement in all societal institutions (political, educational, social) rather than pietistic withdrawal or naïve assimilation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Builds on Calvinist tradition (sovereignty of God, covenantal community), influenced by Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer (political anti-revolutionary thought).
 - Opposes liberal individualism, secular state absolutism, and socialist collectivism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sovereignty of God (political and cultural implications), antithesis between Christian and non-Christian worldviews, common grace (implicit in allowance for plural social life), covenantal responsibility of believers, and practical ecclesiology (church as social actor).
 - Incarnational analogy/accommodation: theological justification for cultural engagement and institution-building by Christians. [See: Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy]
- **Closing line**
 - Kuyper's program reframes political theology: because God reigns over all spheres, Christians must organize confessionally in public life to defend plurality, parental rights, and a non-absolutist polity - a political liturgy of the Reformation translated into modern party politics. [See: Church And State Relations]

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic translation of a theological axiom (God's sovereignty) into a concrete political program: confessional party, denominational schools, and institutional pluralism.
 - Insistence that neutrality is impossible; political neutrality masks ideological dominance.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Counter to liberal state-centrism: rejects the state's absolute sovereignty and the privatization of religion.
 - Counter to pietistic retreat: rejects withdrawal from public sphere; instead promotes robust Christian institutional presence.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The party as legitimate ecclesial-social organ for political representation.
 - Early articulation of what becomes the doctrine of **sphere sovereignty** and the political theory of pillarization.
 - Use of the incarnational/accommodation analogy to argue for cultural engagement and institutional formation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate political effect: foundation and orientation of the ARP; central to Dutch school funding legislation and pillarized social structures.
 - Long-term theological influence: foundational text for Kuyperian neo-Calvinism, informing twentieth-century Reformed political theology, Christian democratic movements, and debates on church/state relations.
 - Criticized by liberals (for confessionalism), secularists (for public religion), and some evangelicals (for institutional legalism).
- **Enduring value**
 - A paradigmatic case study for integrating doctrine and public policy; crucial for courses on Reformed social ethics, political theology, and the history of Christian democracy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ons Program (Our Program)** - Kuyper's 1879 manifesto; programmatic blueprint for confessional politics.
- **Anti-Revolutionary** - political stance opposing French-Revolution principles (secularism, state absolutism) and defending Christian public life.
- **Sovereignty of God** - theological axiom used as the political foundation: God's rule implies distinct, divinely ordained social spheres.
- **Sphere sovereignty** - (incipient here) the claim that family, church, school, economy, and state have autonomous God-given authority; resists centralization.
- **Party as organ** - the political party is a legitimate, social-ecclesiastical instrument for Christians to pursue collective interests and representation.
- **Antithesis** - the deep moral and spiritual opposition between Christian and non-Christian worldviews that shapes politics and culture.
- **School struggle (Schoolstrijd)** - demand for equal funding and legal recognition of denominational schools; central policy goal.
- **Pillarization (verzuiling)** - social consequence: differentiated communal institutions (education, press, politics) organized by confessional identity.
- **Common grace (implicit use)** - explains social order and cooperation in a plural society despite spiritual antithesis.
- **Accommodation / Incarnational analogy** - theological rationale for cultural engagement: as God became flesh, Christians should incarnationally inhabit and transform cultural institutions rather than withdraw.
- **Parental rights / subsidiarity** - emphasis on parental authority in education as checked against state overreach.
- **Neutrality (critique of)** - Kuyper's claim that state neutrality is illusory and often masks anti-religious bias.
- **Public theology** - role-model for articulating doctrinal convictions into public policy and institutional design.
- **Confessional pluralism** - political stance advocating equal standing for multiple religiously-shaped institutions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Kuyperian political theology (sphere sovereignty, anti-revolutionary posture).
 - As a **polemic and programmatic model** in church-and-state debates (defense of denominational schooling, critique of state neutrality).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of accommodation/incarnational approaches to culture: justifying institutional presence and transformative engagement.
