### TITLE
Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism - Alvin Plantinga (Oxford University Press, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century analytic philosophy of religion; response to the New Atheists (Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Victor Stenger, Jerry Coyne) and to widespread claims that science and religion are in deep conflict.
 - Builds on Plantinga's earlier epistemology (notably Warranted Christian Belief, 2000) and on debates about methodological vs. metaphysical naturalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - There is not a deep conflict between **science** and **Christian theism**; the deep conflict is between **science (especially evolutionary theory)** and **philosophical naturalism**. Superficial historical clashes exist, but the fundamental epistemic clash targets naturalism, not theism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Distinguishes superficial conflicts (historical disputes, specific scientific claims vs. specific theological claims) from deep conflicts (philosophical/naturalistic worldviews incompatible with science).
 - Part II: Advances the **Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (EAAN)**:
 - If both naturalism and evolution are true, the probability that our cognitive faculties are reliable is low or inscrutable, because evolution selects for survival fitness, not truth.
 - If the probability of reliable cognitive faculties is low, then naturalism undermines confidence in beliefs (including naturalism itself) - a self-defeating position.
 - Part III: Argues that theistic accounts (e.g., design, providential guidance) do not suffer the same epistemic defect and thus are not in deep conflict with science.
 - Replies to objections and engages methodological naturalism: science can be pursued without endorsing metaphysical naturalism.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - New Atheists (Dawkins, Dennett, Coyne), philosophers of religion and epistemologists (e.g., Ernest Sosa, Michael Ruse indirectly), defenders of methodological naturalism, and commentators on evolution and cognition.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Epistemology of religious belief (**warrant**, properly basic belief), philosophy of mind (reliability of cognitive faculties), creation/evolution, design and providence, methodological vs. metaphysical naturalism, miracles in a critical register.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Theistic belief, properly understood and epistemically warranted, is not intrinsically at odds with scientific practice; the genuine philosophical threat comes from naturalism undermining the trustworthiness of human cognition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Redirects the debate: identifies **naturalism** (not theism) as the principal intellectual antagonist of science when epistemic considerations are included.
 - Centers the argument on **epistemic warrant** and the reliability of cognitive faculties rather than on empirical incompatibilities.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges New Atheist rhetoric that science straightforwardly refutes religion; shows their arguments often presuppose metaphysical naturalism or ignore epistemic self-defeat.
 - Contrasts with older "conflict thesis" histories by separating local disputes from global philosophical tensions.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of the **EAAN** as a probabilistic, epistemic critique of naturalism.
 - Reapplication of Reformed Epistemology to the science-religion interface.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in analytic theology, philosophy of religion, evangelical apologetics; provoked extensive critical literature (defenders and rebutters of EAAN).
 - Stimulated more careful discussion of methodological vs. metaphysical assumptions in science-theology dialogue.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies loci of genuine conflict; provides a robust analytic framework for assessing claims that science disproves theism; remains a standard reference in courses and debates on religion and science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (EAAN)** - Claim that naturalism combined with evolution renders reliable cognition improbable, producing self-defeat for naturalism.
- **Naturalism**
 - **Metaphysical naturalism** - the worldview that no supernatural entities exist.
 - **Methodological naturalism** - scientific practice that seeks natural explanations without metaphysical commitments.
- **Warrant** - Plantinga's technical term for what sufficiently elevates true belief to knowledge; central to arguing that theistic belief can be warranted.
- **Properly basic belief** - Beliefs rationally held without inferential evidence (e.g., belief in other minds); used to defend belief in God as non-inferentially rational.
- **Deep conflict vs. superficial conflict** - Distinction between worldview-level incompatibilities (deep) and episodic empirical/historical clashes (superficial).
- **Reliability of cognitive faculties** - The epistemic property at issue in EAAN; whether evolution yields truth-tracking beliefs.
- **Design hypothesis / theistic explanation** - The claim that theism can provide an account of cognitive reliability compatible with evolution and scientific findings.
- **Self-defeat** - The charge that a worldview undermines the rational basis for accepting that worldview.
- **Evolutionary epistemology** - The study of how evolutionary processes impact the development of cognitive faculties; used critically in Plantinga's argument.
- **Science-theology independence** - The thesis that scientific methodology does not mandate metaphysical naturalism; Plantinga defends a form of independence.
- **New Atheism** - Contemporary anti-religious movement targeted for overconfident claims of incompatibility; principal foil in the book.
- **Probabilistic reasoning** - Plantinga's use of conditional probabilities to argue about the low probability of reliable cognition under naturalism.
- **Warranted Christian belief** - Earlier Plantinga concept and background; provides scaffolding for claims in this work.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the EAAN and the "deep vs superficial" distinction in science-religion studies.
- As a **polemic** against New Atheist claims that science decisively refutes theism.
- As an **epistemological model** in apologetics and analytic theology curricula for arguing that theism can be rationally warranted.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about methodological vs. metaphysical assumptions in scientific practice.
