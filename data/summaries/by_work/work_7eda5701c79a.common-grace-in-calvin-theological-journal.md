### TITLE
Common Grace - Herman Bavinck (Calvin Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Reformed theological renewal in the Netherlands; interaction with Neo-Calvinism (Abraham Kuyper) and classical Reformed scholasticism. Bavinck writes from a covenantal-Reformed vantage within an era debating church/state, culture, and the theological grounds for Christian engagement.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Bavinck defends a robust, theologically bounded doctrine of **common grace**: God bestows non-saving blessings on the reprobate and elect alike (preservation of creation, natural knowledge, cultural goods) while reserving saving grace to Christ alone. The problem addressed is how to account for genuine goodness, truth, and cultural achievement among the unregenerate without collapsing the doctrine of sola gratia or the antithesis between Christ and the world.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define common grace and distinguish it from special (saving) grace.
 - Scripture and philosophical/theological warrant: appeal to providence, general revelation, and biblical examples of God's benevolent dealings with the world (e.g., rain on the just and unjust).
 - Functional categories: preservation of creation, restraint of sin (gratia restransiva), and distribution of common gifts (artefacts of culture and knowledge).
 - Polemical clarifications: refutation of views that either deny common grace (radical antithesis) or collapse it into preparatory/salvific working.
 - Practical implications for church, state, and culture: grounds for cooperation with non-Christians in civil society and recognition of cultural achievements as legitimately good, yet provisional and eschatologically limited.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages the Reformed tradition (Calvin), contemporary Kuyperian neo-Calvinism, opponents who deny common grace (e.g., later anti-common-grace wings such as the Protestant Reformed critics), and patristic/scriptural witnesses.
- **Doctrines treated:** providence, revelation (general vs special), sin and depravity, grace (common vs special), covenant theology, ecclesiology and the relation of church to culture, and eschatology as limiting horizon.
- **Closing line:** Bavinck centers common grace as the biblical-theological explanation for non-salvific goods in history: a providential mercy that sustains creation and culture while preserving the necessity and uniqueness of Christ's saving grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precise balance: affirms non-salvific divine favor without conceding that such favor mitigates total depravity or effects salvation.
 - Detailed functional taxonomy (preservation, restraint, gifts) linking doctrine to observable cultural phenomena.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects a caricature of Kuyperian optimism by guarding against common grace as a kind of universal salvific preparation.
 - Counters strict antithesis positions that deny any genuine good among the non-elect by grounding cultural goods in God's providential benevolence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of the term **gratia restransiva** (restraining or preserving aspect of grace) as a theological category explaining moral order in a fallen world.
 - Emphasis on **common gifts** as real but eschatologically provisional goods.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Strong influence within orthodox Kuyperian and broader Reformed circles; foundational for later Reformed treatments of culture.
 - Provoked sustained critique and division (notably by those who rejected common grace, forming distinct denominational responses).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, canonical-reformed model for engaging Christ-and-culture questions without capitulating to secularism or separatism.
 - Serves as a template for theological ethics, public theology, and apologetics that must account for both sin and genuine common good.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common Grace:** God's non-saving goodness to all persons and creation, enabling culture, knowledge, and civil order.
- **Special (Saving) Grace:** Grace that effects regeneration and salvation in Christ alone; distinct and exclusive.
- **General Revelation:** Knowledge of God available to all through creation and conscience; a component of common grace.
- **Gratia Restransiva (Restraining Grace):** The aspect of common grace that curbs the full expression of sin and sustains moral order.
- **Common Gifts:** Cultural, intellectual, and social goods produced by believers and nonbelievers under God's providence.
- **Antithesis:** The theological principle distinguishing kingdom of Christ and kingdom of the world; Bavinck affirms antithesis without denying common good.
- **Providence:** The divine governance that preserves creation and distributes common grace.
- **Total Depravity (Limit):** Bavinck insists common grace does not neutralize total depravity; it does not produce saving faith.
- **Cultural Mandate (Implication):** Scriptural call to steward creation; used to justify cooperative cultural engagement informed by common grace.
- **Eschatological Horizon:** The limiting frame-cultural goods are provisional and await consummation in Christ.
- **Covenant Theology (Relation):** Common grace explained within covenantal framework-God's dealings with creation distinct from covenant of grace.
- **Civil Cooperation:** Practical implication permitting shared civic action and recognition of non-Christian contribution.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing common vs special grace in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates over Christian engagement with culture and public theology.
- As an **exegetical-model** for interpreting biblical texts on providence, rain on the just and unjust, and general revelation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics and political theology to justify cooperative civil action while maintaining soteriological boundaries.
