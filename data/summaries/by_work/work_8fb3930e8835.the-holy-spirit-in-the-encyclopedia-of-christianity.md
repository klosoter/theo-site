### TITLE
The Holy Spirit (entry) - Cornelius Van Til, Encyclopedia of Christianity

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; Van Til writing from the vantage of Reformed dogmatics and presuppositional apologetics. Engages contemporary liberal theology, revivalist/Pentecostal movements, and modern epistemological challenges.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is the divine, personal agent who both constitutes and verifies Christian knowledge and life; genuine pneumatology must integrate Trinitarian doctrine, covenant theology, and a critique of naturalistic and experientialist alternatives.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and affirmation of the Spirit as divine Person within the Trinity.
 - The Spirit as the ground of revelation:
 - Distinguishes special revelation (Scripture, Word incarnate) from general revelation while asserting the Spirit's role in witnessing to and making Scripture authoritative for believers.
 - Epistemological emphasis:
 - The Spirit provides an internal testimony enabling knowledge of God; this is not merely subjective emotion but an objective appropriation of divine truth grounded in the covenantal work of Christ.
 - Practical and ecclesial consequences:
 - The Spirit effects regeneration, sanctification, and union with Christ; the baptism of the Spirit belongs to incorporation into Christ, not a detachable second blessing.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit contrast with liberal theology (which relativizes revelation), pietism/subjectivism (which overemphasizes feeling), and Pentecostal formulations (which separate Spirit-baptism from conversion).
 - Engagement with Reformed authorities (covenantal tradition) and with contemporary epistemological debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity, revelation (special and general), covenant, ecclesiology, sacramental/baptismal theology, sanctification, regeneration, and apologology (presuppositional epistemology).
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til centers pneumatology as the nexus where Trinitarian reality, covenantal incorporation, and the epistemic ground of Christian belief converge: the Spirit is both the divine author of Christian knowledge and the Agent who makes that knowledge present and effective in the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong epistemic claim: the Spirit is the necessary condition for true knowledge of God; Christian knowledge is not merely rational assent but Spirit-wrought appropriation.
 - Integration of presuppositional apologetics into pneumatology: theology and epistemology are bound by the Spirit's testimony, not reducible to neutral rational proof.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against liberalism: insists on the objective, supernatural character of revelation and the Spirit's role in securing Scripture's authority.
 - Against pietistic subjectivism: rejects privatized emotionalism as the measure of Spirit-activity, insisting instead on covenantal signs and Word-centered norms.
 - Against classic Pentecostal/charismatic bifurcation: treats the baptism of the Spirit as concomitant with conversion/regeneration and incorporation into Christ, not as a separate ecstatic credential.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts common pneumatological terms within an apologetic frame: "internal testimony" becomes an epistemic category with objective claims, not merely psychological experience.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed apologetic circles; used by students of presuppositionalism as a model of integrating epistemology and dogmatics.
 - Less impact in mainline academic pneumatology where historical-critical and charismatic voices hold sway; nevertheless prized for clarity and polemical force.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the relation of Spirit, Scripture, and knowledge; valuable for pastors, apologists, and theologians concerned with the cognitive and ecclesial dimensions of the Spirit's work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit** - divine Person of the Trinity; primary agent of revelation, regeneration, and sanctification.
- **Trinity** - framework within which Spirit's personhood and operations are defined; no pneumatology apart from Trinitarian relations.
- **Revelation (special vs. general)** - Spirit guarantees the reality and authority of special revelation (Scripture and Christ); general revelation remains insufficient without Spirit-wrought appropriation.
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit** - the Spirit's witness in the believer's conscience/intellect that constitutes certitude of divine truth; an epistemic category, not mere feeling.
- **Illumination** - the Spirit's enabling of proper understanding of Scripture; distinct from natural enlightenment or mere intellectual assent.
- **Regeneration / New birth** - Spirit's act of giving spiritual life; Van Til ties this to baptism of the Spirit and incorporation into Christ.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** - identified with the Spirit's work in conversion and union with Christ; not a separate, post-conversion experiential sign (contrast with Pentecostal second-blessing models).
- **Sanctification** - progressive Spirit-work in conformity to Christ; distinct phases but continuous with regeneration.
- **Covenant** - relational structure that frames Spirit's operations: Spirit applies covenantal promises, seals believers, and grounds ecclesial life.
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - methodological lens: the Spirit supplies the presuppositional warrant for Christian truth-claims against neutral reason.
- **Authority of Scripture** - grounded in the Spirit's testimony and Christ's revelation; Scripture's perspicuity and authority are effect of Spirit's covenantal work.
- **Ecclesial mediation** - the Spirit's ordinary mode is Word and sacrament within the church, not private autonomous experiences.
- **Testimony vs. Experience** - Van Til insists on objective testimony (Word-warranted) over unchecked subjective experience.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for the Spirit's epistemic role in Reformed theology.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal, pietist, and Pentecostal distortions of Spirit-activity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading texts on Spirit-baptism as identifying incorporation/regeneration.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in apologology linking epistemology, covenant doctrine, and pneumatology.
