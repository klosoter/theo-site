### TITLE
Perspectives on the Image of God (essays and lectures) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed evangelical milieu; engages broader contemporary debates about human dignity, gender, and bioethics.
 - Frame brings resources from Reformed theology, presuppositional apologetics, and his triperspectival method to a classic theological locus.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The imago Dei ought to be understood multidimensionally: as a divinely instituted *status* and *representative function* sustained by relational and ontological realities; it is damaged by the fall but essentially retained and finally restored in Christ.
 - Problematizes one-dimensional readings (purely substantive, purely functional, or merely relational) that either detach image-talk from covenant/Christology or dissolve human dignity into natural capacities.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique phase
 - Surveys the standard models: *substantive* (qualities/capacities), *functional* (task/vice‑regency), and *relational* (image as relation to God/others).
 - Locates weaknesses: reductionism, failure to account for fall and redemption, and insufficient attention to Christological and Trinitarian grounding.
 - Constructive phase
 - Proposes a composite account that preserves important insights of each model while insisting on theological priorities: covenantal status, representative authority, and relationality grounded in the Trinity and realized in Christ.
 - Emphasizes continuity: image is not annihilated by sin but distorted; restoration is accomplished in Christ and applied by the Spirit.
 - Application phase
 - Derives implications for ethics, ecclesiology, and public theology: human dignity undergirds prohibitions on killing, slavery, and demeaning treatment; it also grounds responsibilities (law‑obedience, stewardship).
 - Shows how Christology and sanctification are decisive for understanding imago Dei (Christ as exemplar and recapitulator).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Canonical scriptural loci: Genesis 1-2, Psalmic anthropologies, Pauline texts (e.g., 2 Cor, Colossians, Romans), and Christological passages (Col 1:15; 2 Cor 4:4).
 - Engages historical Reformed authorities (Calvin, Kuyper), modern systematicians, and contemporary anthropological debates (both theological and secular philosophers).
 - Converses with Barthian Christocentrism and with modern egalitarian/egalitarian critiques.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (cosmic purpose, stewardship), anthropology (status, nature, and fall), Christology (Christ as perfect image), pneumatology (renewal of the image), covenant (status and responsibility), ethics (responsibility rooted in image), and implicitly the Trinity (relationality as an analogue).

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers the imago Dei as a covenantal, representative reality-wounded by sin but essentially intact and restored in Christ-thus uniting biblical exegesis, Christology, and practical ethics under a Reformed theological frame.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on **image as status + function**: humans are placed as God's vice‑regents with both entitlements and responsibilities.
 - Integration of **Christological restoration**: the image is not merely descriptive but teleologically oriented to Christ as its fulfillment.
 - Use of Frame's broader methodological commitments (normative priority, covenantal reading) to keep imago Dei theologically anchored rather than merely anthropological.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects purely substantive accounts that make the image a bundle of capacities (reason, will) by insisting on legal/relational dimensions.
 - Counters purely functional accounts that detach dignity from ontological/relational grounding.
 - Offers a Reformed corrective to some Barthian tendencies to reduce the image to Christological representation without adequate creaturely continuity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces language of **status, representation, and responsibility** as the primary grid for imago Dei conversation.
 - Applies triperspectival sensitivity informally: normative (God's intention), situational (human role), existential (lived distortion/restoration).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical treatments of human dignity, bioethics, and pastoral theology.
 - Served as a corrective in academic debates that polarized around single‑factor models of the image.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically disciplined framework that bridges exegesis, systematic doctrine, and ethics-useful for teaching, preaching, and applied theological reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (Image of God)** - central category; understood as a covenantal status and representative function, grounded in relation to God and embodied in Christ.
- **Substantive model** - view that image = capacities/qualities (reason, will); Frame critiques its reductionism.
- **Functional model** - view that image = task (dominion, stewardship); Frame preserves function but insists on status and relational grounding.
- **Relational model** - view that image = relationship to God/others; Frame affirms but integrates with representation and ontology.
- **Representation / Vice‑regency** - human role as God's representatives; primary locus of responsibility and authority.
- **Status (legal/covenantal)** - humans possess a divinely conferred standing that entails both rights and obligations.
- **Distortion, not annihilation** - classic Reformed claim: the fall mars the image but does not obliterate it; restoration occurs in Christ and by the Spirit.
- **Christ as Image** - Christ is the perfect image and recapitulator; humanity's restoration is Christ‑centered.
- **Trinitarian grounding** - relationality of the Godhead provides an analogical basis for human relationality without collapsing Creator/creature.
- **Triperspectival method (applied)** - normative, situational, existential lenses used to keep the doctrine balanced (Frame's broader methodological habit).
- **Pneumatological application** - Spirit's renewing work is key to actualizing the restored image in believers.
- **Ethical implication** - imago Dei informs doctrines of murder, dignity, bioethics, slavery, and social justice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed teaching on human dignity and representative vocation.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist secular anthropology and one‑sided theological models.
 - As an **exegetical-model** linking Genesis anthropology with Pauline and Christological texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting doctrine of creation, Christology, and ethics in applied theology.
