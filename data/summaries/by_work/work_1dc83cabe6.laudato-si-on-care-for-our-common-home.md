### TITLE
Laudato Si: On Care for Our Common Home (Pope Francis, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published May 2015 as Pope Francis' second encyclical; emerges amid heightened scientific consensus on climate change, post-2008 financial crisis moral critique, and growing faith-based ecological movements.
 - Sits in the trajectory of Catholic social teaching (Rerum Novarum -> Pacem in Terris -> Populorum Progressio -> Caritas in Veritate) and in dialogue with contemporary environmental science, indigenous claims, and interreligious ethics.
- **Central thesis**
 - Human flourishing requires an integrated moral and practical response to ecological crisis: care for creation, justice for the poor, and reform of social, economic, and technological structures are inseparable.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Reality of the present ecological crisis and scientific grounding (climate change, biodiversity loss).
 - Part II: Roots of the crisis - anthropocentrism, consumerism, technocratic paradigm, throwaway culture.
 - Part III: Human ecology and ethical responses - dignity of the human person, the poor, and social dimensions.
 - Part IV: Integral ecology as a normative framework linking environmental, economic, cultural, and social concerns.
 - Part V: Lines of action - local to global policy, ecological education, spirituality, and conversion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Catholic tradition: Scripture, St. Francis of Assisi (explicit model), Thomas Aquinas implicitly, modern popes (John Paul II, Benedict XVI).
 - Scientific authorities: IPCC and mainstream climate science.
 - Social theory and critics of modernity (technocracy), indigenous voices and ecological movements.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation theology (cosmic and sacramental dimensions), anthropology (human dignity and vocation), moral theology (virtue, sin, social sin), social doctrine (common good, subsidiarity, solidarity), eschatology implied (care vs escapist futures), pastoral theology (conversion).
- **Closing line**
 - Laudato Si articulates **integral ecology**: a theological-moral synthesis insisting that love of neighbour and love of creation are one, thereby reframing Christian social doctrine around ecological responsibility and justice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Centers **integral ecology** as both method and moral demand - treating environmental, social, economic, cultural, and spiritual dimensions as mutually constitutive.
 - Strong moralized use of ecological science: scientific consensus is treated as normative data for moral deliberation.
 - Elevates St. Francis as a theological lens (poverty, praise, kinship with creation) rather than merely an exemplar of simplicity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves from earlier papal social teaching (primarily anthropocentric human development) to an explicit theological valuation of creation itself; sharper critique of consumer capitalism and technocracy than most predecessors.
 - While Benedict XVI had connected ecology and theology, Francis reframes ecological care as central to pastoral and social mission - more urgent, less philosophical abstraction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Integral ecology", "technocratic paradigm", "throwaway culture" as recurring analytic categories that cross disciplines.
 - Framing climate/eco-crisis as a question of **intergenerational justice** and a moral debt to the poor.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catholic institutions: rapidly adopted in seminary curricula, diocesan programs (Laudato Si Action Platform), Catholic NGOs.
 - Wider theology: catalyst for ecotheology across traditions; welcomed by many Protestants and Orthodox as a moral consensus moment, though some conservative theologians critique political-economic prescriptions or the encyclical's perceived policy technocracy.
 - Public influence: contributed to moral framing of climate policy debates, Catholic engagement in COP processes, and ecumenical collaborations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable pedagogical model linking doctrine, science, and praxis; fertile for interdisciplinary scholarship (moral theology, political theology, environmental ethics).
 - Serves as a pastoral bridge: converts abstract teaching into actionable parish and civic programs while reshaping Christian witness on environmental justice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Integral ecology**
 - Holistic framework linking environmental, social, economic, cultural, and spiritual realities; normative center of the work.
- **Common home**
 - Metaphor for planet Earth as shared dwelling that commands moral stewardship and solidarity.
- **Care for our common home**
 - Imperative combining personal conversion, public policy, and communal action.
- **Technocratic paradigm**
 - Critique of reductionist, efficiency-driven decision-making that marginalizes ethical, cultural, and ecological goods.
- **Throwaway culture**
 - Cultural diagnosis of consumerism that discards people and things (including ecosystems) seen as expendable.
- **Preferential option for the poor**
 - Applied to ecological questions: the poor suffer first and most from environmental damage; justice demands priority for their protection.
- **Stewardship vs dominion**
 - Reinterprets biblical dominion as servanthood and care rather than exploitation.
- **Ecological conversion**
 - Spiritual/ethical transformation leading to new lifestyles, virtues, and communal policies.
- **Common good**
 - Renewed emphasis on global dimensions: environmental stability is prerequisite for human flourishing.
- **Intergenerational justice**
 - Duty toward future generations; grounds for limiting present consumption and debt.
- **Subsidiarity and solidarity**
 - Governance principles: local responsibility and global cooperation in environmental action.
- **Sacramentality of creation**
 - Creation as revealing God and deserving reverent care; liturgical and spiritual implications.
- **Climate change / scientific consensus**
 - Treated as morally relevant empirical fact; grounds for urgent action and policy.
- **Consumerism / globalization**
 - Structural drivers analyzed for moral critique and policy response.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source in Catholic social teaching for ecological and social ethics (seminary and parish formation).
 - As a polemic and prophetic critique of modernity in political theology and public ethics (used to challenge neoliberal economics and technocracy).
 - As a conceptual pivot for ecotheology and interdisciplinary scholarship, providing language and categories for integrating science, moral theology, and pastoral praxis.
