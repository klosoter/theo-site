### TITLE
Ritschl, Three Essays (ed. Philip Hefner) - Albrecht Ritschl. 
Concise secondary-source edition presenting Ritschlian arguments on theology as a scientific discipline, the knowability of God in history, Christology, sin, and the Spirit; edited and contextualized by Philip Hefner.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century Protestant Germany; product of the Ritschlian school that sought to reform theology after Kantian criticism and Hegelian historiography.
 - Reaction against speculative metaphysics and against simplistic pietism: a program to make theology a normative, historically-grounded science for the Christian community.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must delimit metaphysical speculation and ground doctrine in the historical revelation of God's redeeming will as known in the Christian community; doctrines are valid insofar as they express the ethical-religious value of God's self-revelation in history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology as principled science: define its principles (principia) in terms of religious value-judgments rather than metaphysical categories.
 - Knowledge of God is mediated historically: God is knowable only in relation to God's saving acts and the community that interprets them.
 - Christology and incarnation are treated functionally: the person and work of Christ must be described in terms of their moral-historical significance for reconciliation.
 - Pneumatology and ecclesiology follow: the Spirit operates primarily as the dynamic of communal faith and moral renewal (including baptism of the Spirit).
- **Major moves (sub-bullets)**
 - Reject speculative metaphysical predicates of God as irrelevant for Christian doctrine.
 - Re-center doctrine on ethical norms and the communal reception of revelation.
 - Reinterpret classical categories (communicatio idiomatum, eternal sonship) in moral-historical, not ontological, terms.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with Kantian critique of metaphysics, Schleiermacher (reactive correction), Hegelian historicism, and traditional Protestant scholasticism.
 - Later reception implicates Barth, Harnack, Troeltsch, and North American liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and knowability of God, theological method, Christology (incarnation, sonship), communicatio idiomatum (reinterpreted), sin and human freedom, Holy Spirit (revelation and baptism), ecclesiology.
- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl's essays place the center of gravity of theology in the historically attested, ethically efficacious revelation of God in Christ and the community's value-judgments about that revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as a normative, scientific discipline grounded in religious experience of the Christian community rather than in metaphysical speculation.
 - Priority of the ethical-moral dimension: doctrines endorse God's redeeming will and foster moral reconciliation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Schleiermacher's inward feeling-centric religion by stressing objective, historical acts.
 - Rejects scholastic/metaphysical accounts that treat eternal attributes or ontological categories as primary theological data.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Use of "value-judgment" (Werturteil) as the epistemic unit for theological claims: doctrines describe what is of religious value in God's revelation.
 - Functional reading of Christological categories (incarnation, sonship) as historical and soteriological roles rather than abstract metaphysical statuses.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for late-19th/early-20th-century liberal Protestant theology and theological ethics.
 - Provoked a decisive reaction in Karl Barth and neo-orthodoxy, who argued Ritschl reduced God to an ethical ideal.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies limits of metaphysical theology; supplies a robust model for historically responsible, community-centered doctrinal method; remains a key interlocutor for debates about revelation, method, and the relation of doctrine to life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principia / theological science**
 - Theology as a disciplined science founded on principled criteria (not metaphysical speculation).
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)**
 - The basic epistemic unit: theological statements designate what is religiously valuable in God's acts.
- **Historical revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure is grasped in concrete redemptive events, especially in Christ and the church's life.
- **Divine will**
 - God is known primarily as the will that intends reconciliation and moral good, not as an abstract metaphysical substance.
- **Christology (functional)**
 - Emphasis on Christ's role and work as the historical agent of reconciliation; person-language employed in service of soteriological function.
- **Communicatio idiomatum (reinterpreted)**
 - Predication of divine and human attributes on Christ is read in terms of personal historical function and redemptive efficacy, not metaphysical composition.
- **Eternal sonship**
 - Treated cautiously: importance lies in the soteriological relation manifested in history, not in speculative eternal ontologies.
- **Sin and freedom**
 - Sin described as moral failure against the norm of God's will; human freedom is real but bounded and oriented by ethical responsibility.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit as communal dynamism)**
 - The Spirit is the power of communal faith, moral renewal, and the continuing reception of revelation (including baptism of the Spirit as ethical transformation).
- **Kingdom / ecclesial community**
 - The locus where revelation's value is realized and tested; ethics informs doctrine through communal life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for theology conceived as a normative, historical science grounded in religious value-judgments.
- As a **polemic** against metaphysical and speculative theologies (useful in critiques of ontological theology).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Christology and pneumatology to move from ontological metaphysics to moral-historical function.
- As an **exegetical model** for readings that prioritize redemptive-historical sense over abstract doctrinal formulations.
