### TITLE
On the Doctrine of Election - Friedrich Schleiermacher (Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 19th century German Protestant theology; Schleiermacher writing amid the Enlightenment, post-Kantian idealism, and reactions against strict Reformed orthodoxy and Pietism.
 - Moves theology from metaphysical and forensic categories toward anthropological and communal categories shaped by the "feeling of absolute dependence" (Gefühl der Abhängigkeit).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Election should be reinterpreted as God's gracious vocation and relational choosing that issues in a community of faith, not as an abstract, deterministic decree governing individual salvation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Traditional predestinarian formulations make election into an abstract metaphysical cause, undermine ethical responsibility, and alienate faith from lived religious consciousness.
 - Reinterpretation: Election is a dynamic, historical vocation rooted in God's universal love and realized concretely in the community of those responsive to God's revelation.
 - Soteriological consequences: Salvation is located in participation in the elect community and in the transformation effected by divine grace in human religious life rather than in forensic imputation alone.
 - Christological pivot: The person and work of Jesus are the normative locus and model of election - Christ as the unique human embodiment of God-consciousness who exemplifies the elect life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages implicitly and explicitly with Augustine and Calvin (Reformed predestination), Arminian alternatives, contemporary Enlightenment philosophers (Kant, Fichte), and pietistic emphases.
 - Scripture is read through a theological-psychological lens; ecclesial tradition is critiqued for metaphysical excesses.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: election (Erwählung), soteriology, ecclesiology.
 - Secondary: Christology, grace, freedom and responsibility, providence, anthropology of religious feeling.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher reframes election from a static decree to a living, ecclesial vocation grounded in God's universal love and realized in the sympathetic, God-aware life exemplified by Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Election as **relational and vocational**, not metaphysical arbitrariness; it is ecclesial and ethical rather than strictly forensic.
 - Theology begins with religious consciousness (Gefühl der Abhängigkeit), so election must be intelligible in terms of personal and communal religious experience.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges Augustinian-Calvinist double predestination and the suspension of moral responsibility that can follow from deterministic readings.
 - Moves away from a purely juridical framework of sin and justification toward transformation and participation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Mobilizes romantic/post-Kantian categories (selfhood, feeling, vocation) to re-describe classic loci; treats election as a function of divine-historical calling rather than immanent decretal causality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in liberal Protestantism and modern theological method: shifted hermeneutical priorities toward experience and community.
 - Criticized by conservative Reformed theologians for downplaying forensic justification and for seeming to domesticate divine sovereignty.
 - Provided a framework later used by Ritschl and other 19th-century theologians; fed into later debates about grace, church, and social dimensions of election.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a useful corrective where predestinarianism appears abstract or pastorally damaging; productive for ecclesiological and ethical reinterpretations of soteriology.
 - Serves as a methodological model for integrating historical-critical insight, philosophical reflection, and pastoral concern.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Election (Erwählung)** - Recast as God's vocational choosing that issues in communal belonging and spiritual formation, not an arbitrary metaphysical decree.
- **Vocation** - Central mode of divine action: election is call and task for the faithful community.
- **Gefühl der Abhängigkeit (feeling of absolute dependence)** - Foundational theological datum; religious consciousness that grounds receptivity to election and grace.
- **Community/Church (Ecclesia)** - Primary locus where election is realized; the elect are those who respond corporately to God's call.
- **Grace** - Transformative and normative, realized in religious life and moral formation rather than merely forensic pardon.
- **Freedom and responsibility** - Human moral response remains real; Schleiermacher resists deterministic readings that nullify ethical accountability.
- **Christology** - Christ as the paradigmatic elect human whose God-consciousness discloses divine vocation; election finds its definitive expression in Jesus.
- **Predestination vs. vocation** - Contrast term: Schleiermacher relocates meaning from static predestination to dynamic vocation.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying)** - Schleiermacher does not primarily adopt metaphysical kenotic formulations; he affirms Christ's genuine human limitation and dependence without positing an ontological depletion of divinity. His interest is psychological-ethical: Christ's self-surrender as exemplary vocation rather than speculative divine subtraction. (See Kenosis Theories And Critiques.)
- **Impeccability of Christ** - Schleiermacher treats Christ's sinlessness as moral and spiritual perfection rooted in perfect God-consciousness; he stresses real temptation and moral vulnerability rather than a metaphysical impossibility to sin. This nuance informs debates about Christ's freedom and moral example. (See Impeccability Of Christ.)
- **Providence** - Reinterpreted to emphasize personal divine guidance and the calling of persons and communities.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional pivot** in modern soteriology: redefines "election" to prioritize vocation and community.
 - As a **polemic** against deterministic Reformed formulations, often cited in pastoral critiques of predestination.
 - As an **exegetical and methodological model** for theologians who integrate philosophical anthropology and religious experience into doctrinal loci.
