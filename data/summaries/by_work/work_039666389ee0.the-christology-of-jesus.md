### TITLE
The Christology of Jesus - Ben Witherington III

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th/early 21st‑century evangelical New Testament scholarship. Written within the context of renewed historical‑Jesus research, increased attention to Jewish context of Jesus, and the rise of social‑scientific and narrative approaches to the Gospels. Witherington writes as a conservative to moderate evangelical, engaging both critical scholarship and confessional concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To recover what Jesus himself and his earliest followers meant by the titles and claims attached to him (Son of Man, Son of God, Messiah, Lord), and to show how early Christian high christology grows organically from Jesus' self‑understanding and Jewish apocalyptic/monotheistic frameworks rather than from late Hellenistic invention.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establish historical context: Palestinian Judaism, apocalyptic expectation, and Jewish monotheism as the interpretive horizon.
 - Methodology: close exegesis of Synoptic material combined with social‑scientific and narrative considerations; restraint about speculative pre‑gospel layers but willingness to infer plausibly historical sayings/actions.
 - Analysis of key titles and sayings (Son of Man, Son of God, I AM sayings, Lord/kyrios) to determine Jesus' self‑claims and their Jewish resonance.
 - The development of early Christian christology: continuity from Jesus' ministry to post‑resurrection exaltation language - resurrection as decisive interpretive event.
 - Theological synthesis: Jesus as Israel's Messiah and as uniquely identified with God's authoritative activity without necessarily adopting full Hellenistic ontological categories.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary use of Synoptics and Johannine material; interlocutors include Bultmann, Rudolph, E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright, Geza Vermes, Marcus Borg, John P. Meier; engages both liberal and conservative trajectories and recent social‑scientific interpreters.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (historical and early church), revelation (Jesus as decisive revelation of God), messianism and kingdom of God, resurrection and exaltation, the Son of Man/ Son of God titles, implications for soteriology and implicitly for Trinitarian reflection.
- **Closing line:** Witherington argues that the earliest and most theologically responsible way to understand Christian high christology is to see it as the faithful, historically grounded recognition and interpretation (grounded especially in the resurrection) of Jesus' unique role as God's authoritative agent within first‑century Jewish monotheism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on Jewish apocalyptic/monotheistic horizon as decisive for interpreting Jesus' self‑claims.
 - Use of social‑scientific and narrative tools alongside traditional historical‑critical methods to reconstruct plausible Jesus traditions.
 - Emphasis on *continuity* between Jesus' self‑understanding and later exalted Christology rather than sharp discontinuity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters radical portrayals that reduce Jesus to a mere social prophet or late theological construction (e.g., some radical critical reconstructions).
 - Pushes back on overly Hellenistic or metaphysical accounts that read later Trinitarian ontology back into Jesus' own thought.
 - Offers a corrective to minimalist Jesus studies by defending meaningful historical access to Jesus' self‑claims.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Stresses a functional reading of some titles (what Jesus does as God's agent) over purely ontological categories, while not denying the emergence of ontological language in earliest Christian proclamation.
 - Integrates honor‑shame, patronage, and social identity language to explain how titles functioned in first‑century settings.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Valued by evangelicals and many mainline scholars for its balanced historical fidelity and theological seriousness.
 - Influential as a classroom resource for integrating historical Jesus study with confessional theology; engages Reformed concerns about continuity with Scripture while remaining accessible to broader academic readership.
- **Enduring value:** Clear model for marrying careful exegesis, Jewish‑contextual sensitivity, and theological interpretation; useful for teaching historical Christology without collapsing into skepticism or anachronistic metaphysics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Son of Man:** Central self‑designation; analyzed as apocalyptic agent, representative of divine authority; Witherington emphasizes its Palestinian Jewish resonance over straightforward preexistence claims.
- **Son of God:** Treated as flexible - royal/eschatological designation within Jewish monotheism; later interpreted more ontologically by early church.
- **Messiah (Christ):** Political/royal expectations examined; Witherington distinguishes Jesus' messianic self‑presentation from popular revolutionary models.
- **Lord (Kyrios):** Explored as title of authority and divine identification, especially in post‑resurrection confession.
- **Kingdom of God:** Primary locution for Jesus' program; kingdom language grounds christological function and mission.
- **Resurrection/Exaltation:** Presented as the decisive event that catalyzes early high christology and divine identification.
- **Jewish Monotheism:** Interpretive constraint; Witherington insists Jesus' claims must be read within strict Jewish monotheistic commitments.
- **Social‑scientific method / honor‑shame:** Tools to reconstruct how titles and claims functioned in social context.
- **Preexistence vs. Functional Christology:** Distinguishes ontological preexistence claims from portrayals of Jesus as God's uniquely authorized agent; argues the latter provides the best historical fit while acknowledging later ontological development.
- **Historical Jesus vs. Early Christian Christology:** Emphasizes continuity; early christology grows interpretively from Jesus' life, teachings, and resurrection.
- **Exegesis of Synoptics:** Witherington relies heavily on synoptic material for reconstructing core christological moments.
- **Narrative theology:** Reads gospel narrative as theological and historical source, not merely later dogmatic overlay.

How the work is used:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Jesus within first‑century Jewish context.
- As a **polemic resource** against radical skepticism and reductive sociological accounts of Jesus.
- As a **definition source** for terms like Son of Man, Son of God, and for articulating how early christology develops from history to creed.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses that aim to bridge historical‑critical studies and constructive theology.
