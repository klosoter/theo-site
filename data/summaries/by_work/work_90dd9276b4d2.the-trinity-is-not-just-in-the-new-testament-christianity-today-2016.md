### TITLE
**The Trinity Is Not Just in the New Testament** - Fred Sanders (Christianity Today, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in Christianity Today, aimed at a broad evangelical readership (2016). Engages contemporary biblical-theological trends that compartmentalize Testaments and popular readings that restrict the doctrine of the Trinity to the New Testament era.
 - Milieu: evangelical biblical theology conversation, pastoral concerns about catechesis, and pushback against dispensational and strictly historical-critical readings that deny Trinitarian presence in the OT.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: The doctrine of the Trinity is rooted in the whole Bible; the Old Testament contains clear and legitimate witnesses to the triune nature of God-not as a later invention but as implicit and progressively revealed.
 - Problem addressed: the tendency to treat the OT as strictly unitarian and reserve Trinitarian language and theology only for the NT.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of representative Old Testament texts that point beyond strict monotheism to a plural or relational divine self-revelation (e.g., "Let us make man"; plurality language; the Spirit; Wisdom; the Angel of the LORD; Messianic psalms).
 - Hermeneutical claim: reading the OT in light of the NT is legitimate because the NT authors read the OT this way; the canon is unified and the NT interprets the OT christologically and trinitarianly.
 - Pastoral and theological implications: Christian teaching and worship should present the Trinity as continuous with OT revelation rather than as a purely post-resurrection doctrinal construct.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interlocutors: popular dispensational or unitarian readings, some forms of biblical theology that sharply separate Testaments.
 - Implicit references: patristic readings, NT interpreters (apostolic use of OT), recent evangelical scholars advocating canonical and christocentric readings.
 - Sanders writes as a theologian-historian conversant with evangelical hermeneutics and patristic precedent.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (progressive and corporate), Trinity, Christology (OT christophanies and typology), Pneumatology, Biblical theology (canon, hermeneutics).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **the Trinity is not an afterthought of the New Testament but the consistent pattern of God's self-revelation across Scripture; the canon must be read trinitarianly.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong canonical hermeneutic: NT witness authorizes a trinitarian reading of the OT; this is both legitimate and necessary for coherent Christian doctrine.
 - Pastoral urgency: stresses catechetical consequences-teaching the Trinity matters from Genesis onward.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that confine the Trinity to post-resurrection theology; contrasts with dispensational or strictly unitary interpretations that divorce OT monotheism from NT trinitarian claims.
 - Pushes back on a too-rigid "progressive revelation" that implies God was not triune before the NT-Sanders affirms progressive disclosure, not a substantive change in God's triune being.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No novel technical terms, but reasserts a methodological posture: canonical coherence + apostolic exegesis legitimizes retroactive trinitarian readings of OT texts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely circulated in evangelical circles as a corrective primer; useful in pulpit and classroom settings to encourage integrated Scripture teaching.
 - Criticism mainly from those who accuse it of anachronistic reading or of imposing NT categories onto OT texts; defenders argue Sanders follows apostolic precedent.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, concise apologetic for Trinitarian readings of the OT; valuable as an entry-point for pastors and students who need theological and hermeneutical justification for teaching the Trinity from Genesis onward.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity** - God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; Sanders insists this is the pattern of divine self-revelation across both Testaments.
- **Old Testament witness** - OT texts (plural language, Wisdom, Spirit, Angel of the LORD, Messianic psalms) that legitimately anticipate Trinitarian understanding.
- **New Testament authorization** - claim that apostolic use of OT validates trinitarian readings; NT interpreters serve as hermeneutical guides.
- **Progressive revelation** - God's self-disclosure unfolds over time; Sanders stresses continuity (same triune God) rather than emergence.
- **Christophany / Angel of the LORD** - OT appearances interpreted as pre-incarnate revelations of the Son; used to bridge OT/NT christology.
- **Wisdom literature** - Personified Wisdom (Proverbs, Sirach) as a locus for seeing a distinct divine agent who is later identified with the Son.
- **Pneumatology in OT** - Spirit as active and personal in creation and revelation, supporting trinitarian readings.
- **Plural divine language** - "Let us make man," divine council motifs-read in canonical and apostolic light rather than as polytheistic residue.
- **Canonical hermeneutic** - reading texts in the context of the whole canon and apostolic interpretation.
- **Typology** - OT persons/events as forms that the NT fulfills and thus interprets in trinitarian terms.
- **Christology** - the Son as interpreter of OT texts and fulfilment of OT revelation; essential to seeing Trinity in both Testaments.
- **Hermeneutical legitimacy** - Sanders' central claim that NT exegesis legitimizes seeing Trinitarian structures in the OT.
- **Monotheism vs. plurality** - Sanders reconciles strict monotheism (e.g., Deut 6:4) with a complex unity that admits distinct persons.
- **Exegetical caution** - warns against arbitrary allegorizing; advocates exegetical restraint grounded in NT reading.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for arguing that Trinitarian doctrine belongs to the whole canon.
- As a **polemic** against dispensational or strictly unitarian OT readings.
- As an **exegetical model** endorsing canonical/NT-informed hermeneutics for reading the OT christologically and trinitarianly.
- As a **pedagogical tool** in preaching and catechesis to integrate doctrine, biblical theology, and worship.
