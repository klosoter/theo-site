### TITLE
The Nature and Aims of Biblical Theology - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 19th-early 20th century Princeton Reformed milieu. Vos writes as a confessional Reformed exegete reacting to both Enlightenment-era abstraction and rising historical-critical tendencies. He labors to place theology on an exegetical, historically grounded foundation.
- **Central thesis:** Biblical theology is a distinct discipline that studies the progressive, historical revelation of God in Scripture - the organic, redemptive development of doctrine culminating in Christ - and its proper aim is to supply the historical material and structure for systematic theology without collapsing into mere history or abstract dogmatics.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define biblical theology against two errors: a purely systematic (ahistorical, abstract) theology and a mere history of doctrine (descriptive, non-normative).
 - Assert **progressive revelation**: Scripture unfolds God's self-disclosure in time; doctrines must be located in that unfolding.
 - Introduce **organic development** and **typology** as methods: Old Testament institutions, promises and types develop and find fulfillment in Christ.
 - Distinguish functions: biblical theology describes the historical growth of revelation; systematic theology formulates normative, present-day doctrine using that material.
 - Claim the **Christocentric teleology** of Scripture: the historical sequence is oriented toward the person and work of Christ and eschatological consummation.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged:** Implicit engagement with Enlightenment abstraction, Hegelian historical philosophy, and contemporary historical-critical approaches; dialogues with systematic theologians who seek timeless formulations; draws on the biblical text as primary source.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (progressive, historical), covenant and covenantal continuity, typology, Christology (central fulfillment), redemption / Heilsgeschichte, inspiration and scriptural unity, the relation of law and gospel.
- **Closing line:** Biblical theology, properly understood, recovers the Scripture's **historical, redemptive unfolding focused on Christ**, providing the indispensable, historically grounded material for sound systematic formulation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Insistence on **historical-historical** (i.e., redemptive-historical) method: doctrines must be traced through salvation history rather than abstracted from their historical moorings.
 - Emphasis on **organic development** and typological fulfillment as formative categories.
 - Forceful claim that biblical theology is neither subordinate history nor identical with dogmatics but a preparatory, normative discipline.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects abstract, ahistorical dogmatics that neglect Scripture's temporal sequence.
 - Counters purely descriptive histories of doctrine that strip normative intent and teleology from revelation.
 - Pushes back against allegorical or ethical reductions of biblical types and promises.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and popularizes the term **redemptive-historical** (Heilsgeschichte) approach within Reformed circles.
 - Articulates a working distinction between **biblical theology** (descriptive-historical, orienting) and **systematic theology** (normative-synthetic).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for the Reformed biblical theology movement; major influence on subsequent Reformed scholars and on the 20th-century recovery of redemptive-historical preaching and exegesis.
 - Served as a corrective to both liberal historical criticism and schematic confessional dogmatics; influenced curriculum formation in seminaries.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable methodological paradigm for locating doctrine within Scripture's history.
 - Remains a primary resource for those seeking a Christ-centered, historically conscious theological method for exegesis, preaching, and dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology:** Discipline tracing the historical development of revelation and doctrine within Scripture.
- **Systematic theology:** Normative synthesis that formulates present-day doctrinal statements using biblical-theological material.
 - Vos: distinct but dependent on biblical theology for historical grounding.
- **Progressive revelation:** God discloses truth step-by-step across redemptive history; later revelation clarifies earlier stages.
- **Redemptive history (Heilsgeschichte):** The historical sequence in which God accomplishes salvation; primary object of biblical theology.
- **Organic development:** The inner, living growth of revelation and institutions (promise -> type -> fulfillment).
- **Typology:** Method recognizing persons/events/institutions in Scripture as foreshadowing Christ and fulfillment.
- **Christocentrism:** The conviction that the historical process of revelation culminates in and is interpreted by Christ.
- **Historical sequence / teleology:** Attention to how temporal ordering and goal-orientation shape doctrinal content.
- **Scriptural unity:** Unity of Old and New Testaments through progressive revelation and fulfillment.
- **Covenant:** Central organizing motif in Vos's reading - covenantal relations structure redemptive history.
- **Normativity (of Scripture):** Scripture's historical events and promises provide normative content for doctrine.
- **Contrast: history of doctrine:** Descriptive, tracing doctrinal formulations post-biblical; differs from Vos's in being non-teleological.
- **Contrast: philosophical history:** Hegelian or speculative historicism that imposes external schemes on biblical data.
- **Exegetical basis:** Vos insists biblical theology must be rooted in careful exegesis of the canonical texts.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for biblical theology in curricula and handbooks.
 - As a **polemic** against ahistorical dogmatics and purely descriptive histories of doctrine.
 - As an **exegetical/modeling** resource for redemptive-historical preaching, typological interpretation, and the bridge between exegesis and dogmatics.
