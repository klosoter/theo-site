### TITLE
**Calvin and the Calvinists** - essay by **Paul Helm**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th/early 21st century Reformed scholarship; Helm writes as an analytic-minded Reformed theologian/philosopher engaging historical Calvinism and contemporary debates over divine knowledge and human freedom.
 - Dialogue occurs against the rise of modern debates about **Molinism (middle knowledge)** and libertarian accounts of freedom, and a resurgence of interest in Calvin's doctrine of providence.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Helm defends a classical Calvinian picture: **God's decrees metaphysically prior to creaturely acts** and His providence is meticulous and sovereign. He argues that Molinist middle knowledge attempts to make God's eternal plan dependent on foreseen creaturely choices and so is theologically and philosophically problematic.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Calvin's own emphases: God's absolute sovereignty, decree, and providential governance.
 - Diagnostic contrast: how some later "Calvinists" or sympathetic theologians have tried to accommodate notions of libertarian freedom via middle knowledge.
 - Philosophical critique of middle knowledge:
 - Questions the intelligibility and grounding of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
 - Argues that making God's decree responsive to creaturely foreknowledge diminishes divine causality and providential grounding.
 - Positive proposal: reassert a compatibilist understanding of human freedom compatible with determinative divine decrees, preserving Scriptural and theological weight of election and providence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary theological interlocutor: **John Calvin** (exegesis and theological orientation).
 - Historical and systematic comparators: Reformed scholastics and classical Calvinist tradition.
 - Contemporary opponents/targets: **Luis de Molina** (originator of middle knowledge) and modern Molinists (e.g., William Lane Craig among others), broadly the Molinist project and libertarianism about freedom.
 - Philosophical-theological interlocutors on free will, foreknowledge, and providence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Providence**, **predestination**, **divine knowledge** (foreknowledge vs. decree), **freedom** (compatibilist vs. libertarian), **grace and election**, and the doctrine of divine causality.

- **Closing line**
 - Helm frames the essay as a defense of the classical Calvinian center of gravity: **God's decreeing will is ontologically prior, and a compatibilist providence best secures both divine sovereignty and biblical fidelity against Molinist reconfigurations.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the *metaphysical priority* of the divine decree over any counterfactuals of creaturely choice; not merely a semantic priority but an ontological grounding.
 - Re-articulates Calvin's intuitions in analytic philosophical terms (decree-first model vs knowledge-first models).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Molinism by arguing that middle knowledge covertly surrenders divine causality to creaturely contingency.
 - Contrasts with Arminian/Liberatarian attempts to preserve libertarian free will by showing theological costs for election and providence.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions between kinds of divine knowledge (decretive/ordaining knowledge vs hypothetical/counterfactual knowledge) and reframes them in terms compatible with Reformed metaphysics.
 - Emphasizes "decree as ground" language to displace "knowledge-first" accounts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed theologians and analytic theologians defending classical doctrines of providence.
 - Frequently cited in debates where Molinism is opposed on theological and philosophical grounds.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise corrective to Molinist encroachments in Reformed theology.
 - Useful for teaching the coherence of compatibilist freedom with robust divine sovereignty and for situating Calvin's theology within contemporary philosophical-theological debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle knowledge** - Molinist notion that God knows what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom); Helm treats it as epistemically and metaphysically problematic when set as prior to decree.
- **Molinism** - The theological system grounded in Molina that uses middle knowledge to reconcile divine foreknowledge with libertarian freedom; a primary target of Helm's critique.
- **Decretive will (divine decree)** - God's determining, ordaining will; for Helm this is **ontologically prior** and grounds events, not vice versa.
- **Meticulous providence** - The idea that God sovereignly governs all events; Helm defends this against any diminution by middle-knowledge frameworks.
- **Compatibilist freedom** - Freedom compatible with causal determination; Helm endorses a version that preserves moral responsibility while upholding divine causality.
- **Libertarian freedom** - The contrary view that genuine freedom requires indeterminism; Helm argues this risks undermining divine sovereignty if paired with Molinism.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** - Statements about what a free agent would do in hypothetical circumstances; Helm questions their grounding apart from God's decree.
- **Foreknowledge (simple vs. middle)** - Distinguishes ordinary foreknowledge (God's knowledge of future facts) from middle knowledge (knowledge of what free creatures would do); Helm privileges knowledge grounded in God's decree.
- **Grounding/ontological priority** - Key analytic term Helm uses to insist on the decree grounding creatures' actions.
- **Election** - God's choosing of persons to salvation; Helm stresses that Molinism can relativize election to foreseen faith.
- **Divine causality** - The doctrine that God causes events; Helm defends a robust causal role for God against models that make God primarily a foreseer.
- **Providential governance** - Broad term Helm uses to describe God's providence as both ordering and sustaining creation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against Molinism and libertarian accommodations within Reformed circles.
- As a **definition source** and conceptual warrant for a decree-first, compatibilist model of providence and divine knowledge.
- As an **exegetical-modeling** tool for reading Calvin and Reformed texts through analytic categories to defend classical positions in contemporary debates.
