### TITLE
**The Doctrine of Scripture - Cornelius Van Til** 
(focus: Christological implications; presuppositional, Reformed perspective)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Reformed apologetic and systematic theology; Van Til as leading proponent of presuppositionalism emerging from Princeton/Westminster circles and the Kuyperian/Bavinckian tradition.
 - Reaction against liberal historicism, Enlightenment epistemologies, and neutral two‑books models of revelation and nature.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the **self‑attesting, propositional, redemptive speech of the triune God**, and must be read Christologically: the incarnate Word (Christ) is the key to canonical and ontological interpretation. The chief problem is how finite, sinful minds know divine truth without illicit appeal to autonomous human reason.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Revelation is **covenantal speech**: God speaks historically and propositional via Scripture and supremely in Christ.
 - Epistemology is *presuppositional*: all reasoning begins with God's self‑revelation; competing worldviews are inconsistent and ultimately irrational.
 - The Holy Spirit provides the internal testimony that makes Scripture known and interpretable; regeneration and ecclesial context are necessary for true understanding.
 - Christology functions both ontologically (Logos incarnate as Creator‑Sustainer) and hermeneutically (Scripture points to and is interpreted by Christ).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed forebears: Augustine, Calvin, Kuyper, Bavinck; contemporary interlocutors: B. B. Warfield, Gordon Clark, Karl Barth (selectively), Enlightenment philosophers (Kant, Hume), and modern secular thinkers.
 - Polemical engagement with proponents of natural theology, evidentialism, and the analogia entis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs special), inspiration, authority, sufficiency, Scripture as Word, Christology (Logos), Trinity (God as speaking Triune), Pneumatology (internal testimony), anthropology (noetic effects of sin), ecclesiology (community and covenant).

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til centers Scripture as the triune God's propositional, covenantal speech that finds its unity and interpretive norm in the incarnate Word-Christ-and thus demands a theological, Spirit‑wrought, presuppositional starting point for knowing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Presuppositional epistemology**: knowledge begins with God's revelation; neutrality is impossible.
 - **Christological hermeneutic**: Scripture is to be read and understood in light of the incarnate Logos; Christ is both content and interpreter.
 - **Antithesis**: radical contrast between Christian and non‑Christian thought systems shapes hermeneutics and apologetics.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges evidentialist and common‑grace approaches that posit autonomous natural theology (e.g., critiques of certain readings of Warfield/Clark).
 - Opposes the analogia entis and any idea that creaturely reason can ground knowledge of God independently.
 - Offers a corrective to pietistic subjectivism by insisting on propositional Scripture as norm.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of **transcendental presuppositional argumentation** in defense of Scripture's authority.
 - Clear coupling of **Scripture as God's speech** with **Christ as the ontological Word**, rather than treating biblical authority merely as canonical norm.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on Reformed apologetics (Greg Bahnsen, John Frame, R. C. Sproul circles); shaped curricula at Westminster and related seminaries.
 - Controversial in broader evangelicalism for its method and critique of common ground approaches; spawned both adoption and sustained critique.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative integration of epistemology, Christology, and bibliology; indispensable for students grappling with the theological foundations of Scripture and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presupposition(s)** - foundational commitments that condition all reasoning; Scripture must be the basic presupposition for Christian thought.
- **Antithesis** - moral and epistemic divide between Christian and non‑Christian worldviews; no neutral starting point.
- **Self‑attesting Word** - Scripture authenticates itself by divine speech; authenticated further by the Spirit's internal testimony.
- **Propositional revelation** - revelation comes in definite truth‑claims (not merely mystical impressions); bound to historical, verbal content.
- **Incarnate Logos** - Christ as the ontological Word; hermeneutical key to Scripture and creation.
- **Analogia entis (rejection of)** - denial that creaturely analogy provides an antecedent warrant for knowledge of God.
- **Noetic effects of sin** - human cognitive corruption that necessitates regeneration and Spirit‑illumination for true knowledge.
- **Transcendental presuppositional argument** - a method showing that non‑Christian thought is internally inconsistent without the Christian God.
- **Internal testimony of the Spirit** - Spirit's work in the believer to enable trust and understanding of Scripture.
- **Covenantal speech** - revelation framed as divine address within covenantal economy; ecclesial and communal context matter.
- **Sufficiency and authority** - Scripture alone as normative for faith and life, upheld by its divine origin in the triune God.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for bibliology and the relation of revelation to Scripture.
 - As a **polemic** against natural theology and evidentialist apologetics.
 - As an **exegetical / hermeneutical model** emphasizing Christ‑centered reading and communal Spirit‑wrought interpretation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, Pneumatology, and epistemology in systematic theology.
