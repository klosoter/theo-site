### TITLE
Contributions to Reformed Confessions and Catechisms: The Westminster Confession and Catechisms - Peter A. Lillback

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Modern scholarly defense and exposition of 17th‑century Westminster standards; written within contemporary Reformed/Presbyterian theological education and confessional retrieval movements.
 - Engages both the original Assembly texts and later catechetical practice amid 20th-21st century debates about covenant theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster standards present a coherent, biblically warranted federal system in which the **Covenant of Works** (prelapsarian covenant with Adam) and the **Covenant of Grace** (redemptive covenant in Christ) are essential for orthodox soteriology and Christology. Lillback defends and clarifies this classical Reformed articulation against revisionist readings that downplay or deny the Covenant of Works.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical retrieval: trace how the Confession and catechisms formulate covenant categories and federal headship.
 - Exegetical support: appeal to key texts (Genesis 2-3; Romans 5; Hosea; Galatians) used by the divines.
 - Systematic construction: show how Covenant of Works undergirds doctrines of original righteousness, imputed sin, and Christ as federal substitute.
 - Pastoral/catechetical implications: argue for the Confession/Catechisms as teaching tools that preserve corporate and covenantal understandings of sin and redemption.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary sources: Westminster Confession, Larger and Shorter Catechisms, Assembly minutes.
 - Patristic and Reformation precedents: Calvin, early Reformed divines, Puritan expositors.
 - Interlocutors: modern critics who minimize federal covenant categories, and proponents of alternative covenant schemas.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Covenant of Works; Covenant of Grace), federal headship, original sin and imputation, Christology (Christ as second Adam and federal substitute), law and gospel, merit and obedience.

- **Closing line**
 - Lillback locates the theological center of gravity in a robust Westminster covenantalism: the Covenant of Works is indispensable for a coherent Reformed account of Adam, Christ, and the mechanics of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the pedagogical and confessional function of catechisms in preserving the Covenant of Works as a teaching tool for corporate identity and soteriology.
 - Emphasizes continuity between the Assembly's formulations and the Puritan theological praxis rather than reading the Confession as merely juridical.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters revisionist readings that collapse pre‑ and post‑lapsarian covenants or that insist only on a Covenant of Grace; reasserts a two‑fold covenant structure as exegetically justified and doctrinally necessary.
 - Corrects liberal historical reconstructions that cast the Covenant of Works as a late or extraneous imposition.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reiterates and refines classical "federal" language (federal headship, covenantal obligation and reward) for modern catechetical use; not a novel term invention but a clarified pedagogical deployment.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian academic and ecclesiastical contexts; used as a resource for training ministers and catechists.
 - Provokes engagement from covenant critics and spurs renewed interest in catechetical fidelity.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a compact, historically grounded defense of Westminster covenantal categories suitable for seminary instruction, presbytery debates, and confessional revision discussions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - Prelapsarian covenant between God and Adam requiring perfect obedience with life promised; central focus in Lillback's treatment.
- **Covenant of Grace** - Redemptive covenant enacted after the fall; connected to but distinct from Covenant of Works.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam as representative and Christ as second Adam who fulfills covenant obligations for the elect.
- **Imputation (sin and righteousness)** - Transfer of Adam's guilt to humanity and of Christ's righteousness to believers; explained in relation to the covenants.
- **Prelapsarian / Postlapsarian** - Temporal markers for covenantal order and status of creation relevant to the Covenant of Works.
- **Merit and Reward** - Covenantal categories: obedience meriting life under Covenant of Works; Christ's merit securing reward for the elect.
- **Law and Gospel** - Distinction preserved: law as covenantal obligation; gospel as fulfillment in Christ under Covenant of Grace.
- **Catechetical function** - Role of the catechisms in inculcating covenantal categories for church formation.
- **Confessional fidelity** - The hermeneutical commitment to read theology through Westminster formulations.
- **Substitutionary obedience** - Christ's active and passive obedience understood as fulfilling Covenant of Works obligations on behalf of believers.
- **Original righteousness** - The status Adam held prior to the fall which the Covenant of Works presupposes.
- **Assembly texts** - Primary documentary basis: Confession and both catechisms as authoritative loci for these doctrines.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: concise statement of what the Westminster standards mean by Covenant of Works and related terms.
 - As a **polemic**: resource for arguing against covenantal revisionists who deny or dilute the Covenant of Works.
 - As an **exegetical model**: demonstrates linking biblical texts (Gen 2-3; Rom 5) with confessional formulations for preaching and teaching.
