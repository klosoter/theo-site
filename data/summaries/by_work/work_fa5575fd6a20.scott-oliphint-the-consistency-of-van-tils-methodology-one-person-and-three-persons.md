### TITLE
**Scott Oliphint - "The Consistency of Van Til's Methodology: One Person and Three Persons"** 
(focus: defense of Cornelius Van Til against charges arising from his use of "one-person" language)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed apologetics and systematic theology; situated within debates over presuppositional method, reactions to Gordon Clark and other critics, and intra-Reformed concerns about Trinitarian language (modalism vs social-Trinitarian emphases).
 - Oliphint writes as a Van Tillian sympathetic exegete and constructive apologist clarifying perceived tensions in Van Til's corpus.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Van Til's alternating use of "one-person" and "three-person" language is methodologically consistent, not modalistic or self-contradictory. The variation corresponds to distinct theological and epistemological contexts (ontological unity vs relational personal distinctions) and serves his presuppositional project.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Identify the charge: critics interpret occasional "one-person" phrasing as collapsing persons into a singular person (modalism) or as inconsistent with orthodox Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Exegetical recovery: demonstrate Van Til's pattern in primary texts - when discussing divine being, unity, and transcendence, Van Til stresses "one" to secure monotheism and divine simplicity; when emphasizing revelation, relations in God, and redemptive activity, he stresses three persons.
 - Conceptual clarification: distinguish **ontological categories** (being, simplicity, unity) from **relational/functional categories** (personhood, economic relations, revelation).
 - Methodological point: Van Til's apologetic aim (to ground rationality and intelligibility in the triune God) requires shifting emphases; his language is pragmatic for polemic and epistemological ends.
 - Polemical rebuttal: answer modalist and incoherence charges by showing Van Til's consistent subordination of analytic categories to theological ones and his fidelity to classical creedal distinctions when read contextually.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Cornelius Van Til - Defense of the Faith, essays, lectures.
 - Interlocutors: Critics within and outside the presuppositional school (e.g., Gordon Clark, some social-Trinity critics), and broader Trinitarian theologians raising concerns about person-language.
 - Secondary: Oliphint's own interpretive essays and Reformed systematic tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (ontological unity vs personal distinctions), revelation (epistemological priority of revelation), divine simplicity, apologology/presuppositional method, knowledge of God, and the antithesis between divine and creaturely thought.

- **Closing line**
 - Oliphint locates Van Til's theological center of gravity in a disciplined epistemological Trinitarianism: linguistic shifts are methodological tools to maintain both divine unity and threefold personal distinction as jointly necessary presuppositions for coherent knowledge and apologetic practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Trinitarian language as an epistemic instrument: the choice of "one" or "three" is governed by the apologetic and ontological point Van Til wishes to secure.
 - Prioritizes divine revelation as the foundation for human rationality rather than treating logical categories as neutral.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that equate Van Til with modalism by insisting on context-sensitive exegesis of his texts.
 - Contrasts Van Til's method with Clarkian rationalism (which secularizes epistemic norms) and with some social-Trinitarian readings that accuse Van Til of reductionism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the dispute in terms of **category-shift** (ontological vs relational/personal) rather than accusing Van Til of verbal inconsistency.
 - Reinforces the idea of an **epistemological Trinity** - the triune God as the necessary precondition of intelligibility.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among contemporary Van Tillians and Reformed apologists; used to defend presuppositionalism from internal and external critiques.
 - Helped stabilize Van Til scholarship by offering a standard interpretive reply to modalism charges.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies methodological commitments for teachers of apologetics and systematic theology; provides a reading strategy for Van Til that preserves orthodoxy while vindicating his polemical style.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - The method that grounds knowledge/logic in God's self-revelation; Van Til's apologetic framework that Oliphint defends.
- **One-person language** - Van Til's occasional emphasis on divine unity or singular authorial agency; here read as ontological emphasis to secure simplicity and sovereignty.
- **Three-person language** - Emphasis on Father, Son, Spirit in economic relations and revelation; used to account for personal distinctions and redemptive activity.
- **Ontological vs relational categories** - Key analytic move: ontological (being, simplicity, unity) vs relational/functional (persons, proceedings); Oliphint uses this to resolve apparent tensions.
- **Divine simplicity** - The classical doctrine Van Til echoes when stressing unity; prevents a fragmented or composite theism.
- **Epistemological Trinity** - The claim that the triune God is the necessary condition for rationality and intelligibility; central to Van Til's method and Oliphint's defense.
- **Antithesis** - The created/creaturely contrast; Van Til's insistence on discontinuity between divine and human thought that grounds his presuppositional critique.
- **Transcendental argument** (TCA) - The apologetic technique asserting that only the Christian God makes knowledge possible; Oliphint shows Van Til's use is consistent with Trinitarian presuppositions.
- **Modalism charge** - The accusation that Van Til collapses persons into one person; Oliphint treats this as a misreading resolved by contextual category distinctions.
- **Methodological consistency** - Oliphint's verdict: Van Til's shifts are principled and serviceable, not contradictory.
- **Revelation as epistemic ground** - The idea that divine revelation (Trinitarian) is the ultimate basis for human knowledge and logic.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what Van Til meant by shifting person-language and for articulating an epistemological Trinity.
- As a **polemic** against modalist readings and against rivals who charge incoherence in Van Til's methodology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Van Til: prioritize context, distinguish categories, and read polemical rhetoric with theological sensitivity.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on apologetics and Trinitarian theology to show how doctrine shapes methodological choices.
