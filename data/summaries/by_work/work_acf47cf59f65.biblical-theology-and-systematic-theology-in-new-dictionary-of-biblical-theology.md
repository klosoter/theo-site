### TITLE
**"Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.,** entry in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology. 
Concise expository-defense of a Reformed, Christ‑centered relation between biblical theology (historical, redemptive‑historical) and constructive systematic theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed evangelical scholarship; conversation shaped by Geerhardus Vos revival, post-World War II Reformed dogmatics, and debates with Barthian and canonical schools (e.g., Brevard Childs).
 - Aimed at clarifying method for students and ministers-situating biblical theology as distinct yet servant to systematic theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Biblical theology and systematic theology are distinct tasks but organically united: biblical theology (the diachronic, redemptive‑historical telling of Scripture) provides the raw theological material that systematic theology (the synoptic, doctrinal construction) must receive and integrate without subverting the canon's Christ‑centered unity.
- **Core argument / major moves**
 - Define and distinguish the two disciplines: biblical theology as historical, progressive revelation; systematic theology as synthetic, doctrinal articulation.
 - Argue for priority of biblical theology in source‑sense (it furnishes content) but for mutual dependence, because systematic theology supplies doctrinal categories, confessional shape, and normative interpretive horizons.
 - Emphasize **Christ as telos** of redemptive history; typology and covenant progression are the principal instruments whereby biblical theology yields doctrinally usable data.
 - Warning against two distortions:
 - Treating biblical theology as mere antiquarian history that ends without doctrinal synthesis.
 - Reducing biblical uniqueness to preconceived systematic grids that ignore historical development.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively engages Geerhardus Vos and classic Reformed covenant theologians for method and christocentric teleology.
 - Dialogues with Karl Barth on priority of revelation and with Brevard Childs on canonical theology-accepting some canonical emphases while maintaining distinct Vosian historical progress.
 - Implicitly counters tendencies toward natural theology rooted in **analogia entis**, aligning instead with analogia fidei emphases.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, unity, progress), Covenant theology (promise/fulfillment), Christology (Christ as center and consummation), soteriology and eschatology (in relation to redemptive history), ecclesiology (place of the church in receiving/redemptive narrative).
- **Closing line**
 - Scripture's historical progression, culminating in Christ, is the indispensable material for doctrinal construction; biblical theology must be neither adrift nor absorbed but must stand as the principled source for faithful systematic theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong Vosian, redemptive‑historical focus that treats biblical theology as the unfolding of a single divine purpose culminating in Christ.
 - Balances priority of biblical development with the necessity of confessional/systematic synthesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects two extremes: reductionist historicism (which stops at history) and system‑first dogmatism (which forces Scripture into external schemas).
 - Distances itself from analogia entis approaches that posit a natural knowledge of God independent of covenantal revelation; prefers an analogia fidei posture.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies methodological roles (source vs. shaping discipline) without collapsing one into the other-argues for a disciplined reciprocity.
 - Reasserts typology and covenant progression as principled hermeneutical tools linking biblical exegesis to dogmatic formulation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries as a concise methodological statement that integrates Vos and later confessional dogmatics.
 - Used by critics and proponents as a measured corrective to both Barthian anti‑historicism and liberal historicizing.
- **Enduring value**
 - A pedagogical primer: clear, compact articulation of how redemptive‑historical exegesis feeds systematic dogmatics without surrendering either discipline's integrity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - The historical, diachronic telling of God's redemptive acts and promises as they unfold in Scripture; source material for doctrine.
- **Systematic theology**
 - The synoptic, synthetic construction of doctrines, arranging biblical content under coherent, normative loci.
- **Redemptive‑historical method**
 - Reading Scripture as unified narrative of God's saving work, with progressive revelation culminating in Christ.
- **Christocentricity / Christ as Telos**
 - The principle that Christ is the goal and interpretive key for all Scriptural data.
- **Covenant theology**
 - The structural framework organizing promise‑fulfillment relations across Scripture; central to connecting history to doctrine.
- **Typology**
 - The canonical mechanism by which earlier persons/events are seen as anticipatory fulfillments in Christ; bridges biblical theology and doctrine.
- **Analogia fidei**
 - Knowledge of God ordered by faith and revelation; preferred pole against natural‑theological analogia entis.
- **Analogia entis**
 - The notion of analogy of being (natural theology)-identified as a hazard if it undermines revelation's priority.
- **Canonical criticism / unity of Scripture**
 - Emphasis that final canonical form and unity constrain theological synthesis.
- **Progressive revelation**
 - The idea that God discloses truth more fully over time; crucial for discerning the place of earlier promises in light of Christ.
- **Confessional dogmatics**
 - Systematic theology shaped by ecclesial confession that receives biblical theology as canonical input.
- **Exegetical theology**
 - The close reading of biblical texts that supplies data for both biblical and systematic tasks.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the proper relation and boundaries of biblical theology and systematic theology.
- As a **polemic/resource** against analogia entis and against methods that detach biblical history from doctrinal synthesis.
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing typology, covenant progression, and Christocentric reading.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed curricula to integrate Vosian biblical theology with confessional dogmatics.
