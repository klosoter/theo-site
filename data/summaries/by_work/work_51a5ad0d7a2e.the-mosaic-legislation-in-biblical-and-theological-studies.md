### TITLE
**The Mosaic Legislation** - B. B. Warfield (in Biblical and Theological Studies)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theological milieu; Warfield as a leading conservative Reformed theologian reacting to historical-critical trends and to internal developments in covenantal theory.
 - Essay appears within Warfield's collected studies, addressing historical-theological and exegetical questions about Israel's law.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Warfield argues that the Mosaic legislation is not a *covenant of works* "as to substance." While it includes the moral law and imposes legal obligations, it does not reproduce the prelapsarian covenant of works as the ground for salvation. The Mosaic law is an administration within redemptive history that preserves moral continuity but differs in covenantal character and soteriological function.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of Mosaic texts (Exodus, Deuteronomy) and Pauline reflections (notably Galatians and Romans) to show how law functions for Israel.
 - Analytical distinction between law types: **moral**, **ceremonial**, **civil** - with emphasis on differing permanence and purpose.
 - The law's sanctions and national covenantal features are treated as judicial/temporal rather than salvific conditions mirroring Adamic terms.
 - Theological synthesis: mosaic legislation as an administration of God's covenantal governance and typological training toward Christ and the fullness of the covenant of grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages scriptural witnesses (Moses, Prophets, Paul).
 - Converses with Reformed covenantal tradition (Westminster divines, Calvin) and contemporary interpreters who read Mosaic law as a restored covenant of works.
 - Implicit polemic against those who equate Mosaic economy with a literal re-establishment of Adamic terms for life.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (structure and administrations)
 - Law and gospel distinction
 - Soteriology (works vs. grace)
 - Typology and redemptive-historical development
 - Ecclesial/theocratic dimensions of Israel's covenant life

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Warfield balances continuity and discontinuity: the Mosaic legislation upholds the enduring moral law and serves redemptive-historical purposes, but it is not, in substance, a reassertion of the covenant of works as the ground of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear separation of *substance* (what the covenant fundamentally requires) from *form* (its legal promissory/penal structures)-used to show that appearances of works-demand do not equal original covenantal substance.
 - Strong insistence on the permanence of the moral law while denying identical covenantal soteriology between Adamic and Mosaic covenants.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects readings that treat Mosaic covenant as a literal republication of Adamic covenant of works - Warfield contends this collapses redemptive-historical nuance and risks juridical Pelagianism.
 - Pushes back on extremes that either sacralize all Mosaic institutions as perpetual or dismiss their theological import entirely.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refined use of "as to substance" language to discriminate between covenantal *terms* and covenantal *status*.
 - Nuanced account of national/judicial sanctions vs. salvific demands.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative Reformed and Princetonian circles as a corrective to simplistic federalist schemata.
 - Frequently cited in debates over republication of the law, antinomianism, and the nature of covenant administrations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for advanced students as a model of integrating exegesis, historical theology, and systematic precision; useful in teaching the law/gospel distinction within covenantal frameworks.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic legislation** - Warfield's term for the totality of Israel's law; an administration in redemptive history, not a reconstituted Adamic covenant.
- **Mosaic covenant** - The covenantal arrangement under Moses; national and theocratic, imposing law with civil/judicial sanctions.
- **Covenant of works** - The pre-fall covenant with Adam; Warfield denies the Mosaic covenant is identical *as to substance* with this covenant.
- **As to substance** - Technical qualifier Warfield uses to distinguish essential covenantal terms (soteriological demand) from accidental or formal parallels.
- **Covenant of grace** - The redemptive covenant centered in God's promise and Christ; Mosaic law functions under and points toward this covenant.
- **Moral law** - Permanent ethical content (e.g., Ten Commandments); continuous across administrations in Warfield's account.
- **Ceremonial law** - Typological, pointing to Christ; temporary and fulfilled in Christ.
- **Civil law** - National/judicial rules for Israel's theocracy; time-bound and context-specific.
- **Sanctions (blessings/curses)** - Political/judicial consequences under Mosaic covenant; not to be conflated with salvific merit.
- **Republication (of the law)** - The doctrine that the Mosaic law re-presents the law of nature/covenant of works; Warfield rejects a substantive republication.
- **Typology** - Way ceremonial law prefigures Christ; Warfield emphasizes redemptive-historical purposiveness.
- **Works-righteousness** - The mistaken soteriological inference Warfield opposes when Mosaic demands are read as ground of salvation.
- **Administration** - Warfield's favored language for distinguishing covenantal economies without collapsing them.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for careful distinctions in covenant theology (what counts as "substance" vs. "form").
 - As **polemic** against works-righteousness and against readings that treat Mosaic law as a salvific covenant of works.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for parsing law texts into moral/ceremonial/civil and for framing typology in redemptive history.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching continuity of the moral law while maintaining soteriological continuity in the covenant of grace.
