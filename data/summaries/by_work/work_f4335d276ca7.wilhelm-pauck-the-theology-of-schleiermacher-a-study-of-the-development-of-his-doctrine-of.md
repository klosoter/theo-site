### TITLE
Wilhelm Pauck, The Theology of Schleiermacher: A Study of the Development of His Doctrine of God (study of Friedrich Schleiermacher)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Schleiermacher (1768-1834) writes at the intersection of German Enlightenment, Romanticism, and post-Kantian idealism; his mature works (Reden Ueber Die Religion; Die Christliche Glaubenslehre) inaugurate modern liberal theology.
 - Pauck (20th-century historian-theologian) offers a developmental, historically sensitive reconstruction of Schleiermacher's doctrine of God, reading texts in sequence to show internal shifts and tensions.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Pauck contends that Schleiermacher's doctrine of God is best read as a developmental attempt to ground theology in religious consciousness: the "feeling of absolute dependence" becomes the key to God-talk, but this anthropocentric starting point produces recurring tensions (particularly for sin and revelation) that Pauck traces and evaluates.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-philosophical prefaces: situates Schleiermacher amid Kant, Fichte, and Hegel and against orthodox dogmatics and pietism.
 - Textual development:
 - Early emphasis on religion-as-feeling and the immediacy of God-consciousness.
 - Christology: Christ as the exemplar and revelation of perfected God-consciousness.
 - Pneumatology: increasing appeal to the Spirit as the communal and epistemic bearer of divine presence.
 - Late refinements: attempts to reconcile subjective starting point with objective claims about God, sin, and salvation.
 - Pauck closes by weighing Schleiermacher's achievements (renewal of religious epistemology and pastoral theology) against problems (doctrinal coherence, moral/juridical categories for sin).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Schleiermacher's Reden and Glaubenslehre, sermons, letters, lectures.
 - Interlocutors: Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Pietists, orthodox Lutheran/Reformed dogmatics, later critics (Barth implicitly as counterpoint in reception).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - God (doctrine of God, immanence/transcendence tensions), Trinity (implicit/pneumatological emphasis), Christology (Christ as the perfect God-consciousness), revelation (immediacy via feeling vs. propositional); sin (see Nature And Origin Of Sin below), soteriology, ecclesiology (Spirit-mediated community).

- **Closing line**
 - Pauck reads Schleiermacher as the theologian who re-centers theology on religious consciousness - whose genius for pneumatological and pastoral renewal is matched by persistent doctrinal strain when that consciousness must answer questions about sin, revelation, and the objective reality of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Religious epistemology: the primacy of the "feeling of absolute dependence" as criterion for theological knowledge.
 - Pneumatological priority: the Spirit is the living nexus that realizes religious feeling in communal life and revelation.
 - Psychological-historical method: theology as description of spiritual life rather than solely system-building.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond Kantian epistemic skepticism by making inner religious experience the ground for metaphysical claims about God.
 - Corrects Fichtean subjectivism by insisting that religious feeling aims at a real (not merely formal) divine correlate.
 - Diverges sharply from orthodox juridical categories of sin and legal atonement; treats sin primarily as a disruption in relation to God-feeling.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence," "God-consciousness," and an almost experiential hermeneutic of revelation (revelation as immediate religious self-manifestation of God in Spirit and Christ).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental for 19th-20th century liberal theology, influencing pastoral and theological method in Anglo-American contexts.
 - Provoked corrective reactions: Barthian neo-orthodoxy mounted a polemical repudiation of Schleiermacher's anthropocentrism; Reformed traditions often critique his weak juridical categories.
 - Pauck's sympathetic historical reading shaped subsequent Schleiermacher scholarship by stressing development and nuance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for pneumatology, modern doctrines of revelation, and pastoral theology; indispensable for conversations on how subjective religious experience grounds communal confession and ethical life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of Absolute Dependence** - Schleiermacher's foundational category: the immediate religious consciousness that names the divine relation; Pauck treats this as epistemic pivot and source of later tensions.
- **God-Consciousness** - the structure of self-awareness oriented toward God; central to Schleiermacher's anthropology-theology nexus.
- **Glaubenslehre (The Christian Faith)** - Schleiermacher's systematic statements; primary locus for Pauck's developmental readings.
- **Reden Ueber Die Religion (Speeches on Religion)** - early popular proclamations of the religion-as-feeling thesis; Pauck contrasts these with later technical theology.
- **Christ as Exemplar** - Christ embodies perfected God-consciousness; Pauck explores how this serves as Schleiermacher's solution to revelation and salvation without classical atonement schemas.
- **Pneumatology / Holy Spirit** - the Spirit is the power that accomplishes revelation, illumination, and communal realization of the religious life (see Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination).
 - Sub-note: Spirit functions epistemically (illumination), ecclesially (unity), and existentially (newness of life).
- **Revelation as Immediate Self-Manifestation** - revelation is not primarily propositional transmission but the self-disclosure of God in religious feeling, Christ, and the Spirit.
- **Sin (Schleiermacher)** - understood as an attenuation or distortion of God-consciousness: ontological finitude and self-centredness give rise to moral failure (see Nature And Origin Of Sin).
 - Sub-note: Pauck highlights the shift from moral/psychological descriptions to attempts at soteriological resolution via Christ and Spirit.
- **Religious Experience as Epistemology** - methodology whereby theological claims are validated by authenticity and transformation of religious feeling.
- **Developmental Method** - Pauck's historiographical stance: doctrines must be read diachronically to reveal tensions and reconciliations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for modern theological accounts that prioritize religious experience and pneumatological immediacy.
 - As a **polemic target** or contrast in systematic theology (notably Barthian critiques) to defend objective revelation and juridical accounts of sin and atonement.
 - As an **exegetical/pneumatological model** for studying the role of the Holy Spirit in revelation and illumination and for rethinking the Nature And Origin Of Sin in existential-psychological terms.
