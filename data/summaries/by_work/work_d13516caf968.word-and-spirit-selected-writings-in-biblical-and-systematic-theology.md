### TITLE
**Word and Spirit: Selected Writings in Biblical and Systematic Theology** - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Collection of late 20th / early 21st-century essays by a conservative Reformed academic rooted in the Princeton/Vosian biblical-theological tradition.
 - Responds to modern and postwar debates in evangelical theology: biblical theology vs. systematic reductionism, sacramental theology in Reformed churches, and charismatic/cessationist controversies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Spirit's work must be understood in organic relation to the objective, historical Word of God: the Spirit does not authenticate a private or new revelation but effects union with Christ through the preached and written Word and its sacramental seals.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Exposition of a Word-centered pneumatology: the Spirit's normative activity is the self-attestation and application of Christ through the objective Word.
 - Defense of the means of grace: preaching, sacraments, and prayer are vehicles of the Spirit's renewing and sustaining work.
 - Sacramental theology: the Lord's Supper conveys a real, spiritual communion with Christ (not physical presence, not mere memorial).
 - Ecclesial order and discipline: the church must govern access (fencing and admission) to the sacraments in light of covenantal reality.
 - Pneumatic gifts debate: argues that extraordinary, apostolic sign gifts were tied to the foundation of the church and are not normative for ongoing congregational life (nuanced cessationist posture).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Calvin, Geerhardus Vos, B. B. Warfield, the Westminster tradition, and contemporary interlocutors in charismatic and evangelical scholarship.
 - Engages continuationist proponents and also critiques theological liberalism and subjectivist pietism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Word and Spirit, Christology, union with Christ, sacraments (especially Lord's Supper), covenant theology, ecclesiology, Holy Spirit and spiritual gifts, pastoral theology.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: the Holy Spirit consistently and normatively applies the objective Word of God to unite sinners to Christ through ordained means (preaching, sacraments, prayer), thereby limiting both private revelation and unregulated charismatic practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - A robust **Word-centered pneumatology**: Spirit and Word are inseparable in saving action; the Spirit's authority is not independent of the objective, historical Word.
 - Emphasis on **union with Christ** as the key to understanding sacramental efficacy and the Spirit's personal work.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against charismatic tendencies that prioritize private revelation or extraordinary signs over ordinary means.
 - Counters memorialist and purely symbolic readings of the Lord's Supper by insisting on a real, spiritual communion mediated by the Spirit.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates classical Reformed categories (means of grace, sign and seal) within a contemporary biblical-theological framework, linking them tighter to the Spirit-Word nexus.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed seminaries and by pastors seeking a biblically grounded sacramental and pneumatological theology.
 - Influential in debates over cessationism vs continuationism and in defenses of confessional Reformed sacrament practice (including table fencing).
- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful exegetical-theological synthesis: resources for preaching, sacramental theology, and pastoral practice; durable corrective to both privatizing and sensationalist tendencies in pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word-centered pneumatology** - The Spirit operates primarily through the objective Word; avoids privatized revelation.
- **Objective Word** - Scripture and the preached Word as the public, historical medium of divine self-disclosure.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological and covenantal ground for sacramental benefit and sanctification.
- **Means of grace** - Preaching, sacraments, prayer as ordinary channels by which the Spirit applies redemption.
 - Includes specific treatment of **preaching** (the Spirit's principal public instrument).
- **Lord's Supper: spiritual presence** - Christ is genuinely present and communed with by believers through the Spirit; neither corporal presence nor mere memorial.
- **Fencing and admission** - Pastoral/covenantal discipline regulating sacramental participation; defense of confessing, covenantal membership prerequisites.
- **Sign and seal** - Traditional Reformed categories reinterpreted within Word-Spirit dynamics.
- **Continuationism vs Cessationism** - Gaffin advances a **nuanced cessationism**: apostolic sign gifts were foundational and not normative for ordinary church life; ordinary Spirit gifts persist in Word-mediated ministry.
- **Apostolic foundation** - Grounds for the historical restriction of extraordinary gifts to the early church.
- **Normative vs extraordinary gifts** - Distinction used to delimit charismatic expectations.
- **Public vs private revelation** - Emphasis on the sufficiency and normativity of public, objective revelation.
- **Ecclesial discipline / covenant order** - The church's responsibility to administer means of grace in covenantal integrity.
- **Biblical-theological method** - Integrates historical unfolding of redemptive revelation with systematic formulations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Word-centered pneumatology and Reformed sacramental theology.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with continuationists and charismatic theology.
- As an **exegetical-model** for correlating preaching, sacraments, and covenantal pastoral practice (table fencing, admission).
