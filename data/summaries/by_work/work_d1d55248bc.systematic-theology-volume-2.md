### TITLE
Systematic Theology, Volume 2 - Charles Hodge (Princeton Theology; 19th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑19th century American Reformed context (Princeton Seminary). Reaction against liberal theology, rationalism, and German higher criticism; engagement with Enlightenment empiricism and emerging scientific claims.
 - Hodge writes as a confessional Presbyterian academic, aiming to defend historic orthodox theology by biblical exegesis and analytic argumentation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate and defend a biblical, Reformed Christology and soteriology: who Christ is (Person) and what Christ has accomplished (Work), showing their coherence with Scripture, tradition (Chalcedon), and propositional theology.
 - To rebut views that compromise the substitutionary, penal, and federal dimensions of the atonement or that dilute the hypostatic union.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Careful exposition of the Person of Christ: deity, humanity, two natures united in one person (affirmation of Chalcedonian orthodoxy; rejection of Nestorianism, Eutychianism, and modern "Kenotic" readings).
 - Systematic treatment of the Work of Christ:
 - Active and passive obedience - Christ's righteous life and his sacrificial death.
 - Theories of the atonement - sustained defense of penal substitution and federal (representative) aspects; critique of moral‑influence and governmental theories.
 - Resurrection, ascension, session, and intercession - theological significance for justification, sanctification, and eternal life.
 - Interrelation with soteriology: imputation (both of Adam's sin and of Christ's righteousness), justification by faith, adoption, sanctification, and final perseverance.
 - Apologetic moves: use of scriptural exegesis, syllogistic logic, and historical theology against rival systems.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reliance on Scripture, Calvin, Reformed scholastics, and the classical creeds (Nicene, Chalcedon).
 - Engages contemporary critics: German higher critics, Unitarian and liberal theologians, Arminians, and Roman Catholic positions on atonement and sacerdotalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (Person, natures, offices)
 - **Soteriology** (atonement, imputation, justification, sanctification)
 - Incidental treatment of pneumatology as it relates to application of redemption; ecclesiology and sacraments treated more fully in other volumes.

- **Closing line**
 - A rigorous, confessional defense of the Chalcedonian Christ and penal‑federal soteriology that aims to make the gospel intelligible, propositional, and pastorally efficacious against 19th‑century doctrinal erosion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on propositional revelation and deductive theological method: doctrines formulated as rational theses grounded in Scripture.
 - Dogged defense of **penal substitution** and **federal headship** as the explanatory center of redemption.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects 19th‑century liberal accommodations (e.g., moral‑influence reductions of atonement) and denies Kenotic or emergentist readings of the incarnation.
 - Contrasts with more modalist, moralist, or governmental accounts by restoring sin, divine justice, and objective satisfaction to the center.

- **Conceptual / terminological contributions**
 - Clarifies and popularizes the **active/passive obedience** distinction for pastoral and soteriological use.
 - Reasserts traditional technical vocabulary (imputation, federal headship, hypostatic union) in robust analytic form.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central text in Princeton and American Reformed circles; shaped subsequent conservative Reformed and evangelical Christology and soteriology.
 - Widely used as a textbook for systematic theology; major influence on 19th-20th century conservative responses to theological liberalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of rigorous, Scripture‑centered systematic theology that integrates historical orthodoxy with polemical clarity.
 - Valuable as a resource for defending classical doctrines and for teaching the logical relations among Christology, atonement, and justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - One person, two complete natures (divine and human) united without confusion or change; Hodge upholds Chalcedon as normative.
- **Incarnation** - The eternal Son assuming human nature; rejects kenotic reductions that compromise divine immutability.
- **Active obedience** - Christ's perfect life of law‑fulfillment credited to believers; necessary for positive righteousness.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering and death as penal substitution satisfying divine justice.
- **Penal substitution** - Central atonement model: Christ bore the penalty of sin as the federal substitute; defended against moral‑influence and governmental alternatives.
- **Federal headship** - Adam and Christ as representative heads; imputation of sin and righteousness flows through covenantal representation.
- **Imputation** - Forensic transfer: Adam's guilt to humanity and Christ's righteousness to believers; key for justification.
- **Justification by faith** - Forensic acquittal based on imputed righteousness; Hodge stresses objective ground, not merely subjective renewal.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - Hermeneutical and christological standard invoked to guard orthodox statements about person and natures.
- **Obedience (double)** - Use: explains both redemption's ground (passive) and its positive righteousness (active).
- **Substitution** - Operational term linking penal satisfaction and covenantal representation.
- **Intercession / session** - Christ's present priestly ministry; grounds of assurance and ongoing application of benefits.
- **Scriptural propositionalism** - Methodological term: doctrine is summary of revealed truths stated propositionally.
- **Princeton Theology** - Intellectual context: conservative, confessional, exegetically rigorous Reformed system.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for classic Reformed Christology and penal‑federal soteriology (teaching and confessional formulation).
 - As a polemical resource against liberal, Unitarian, or non‑substitutionary atonement models and as an exegetical model for connecting Pauline forensic language to covenant theology.
