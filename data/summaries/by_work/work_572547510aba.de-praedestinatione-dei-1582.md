### TITLE
De Praedestinatione Dei (1582) - Girolamo (Jerome) Zanchi

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1582 in the milieu of late 16th-century Reformed scholasticism. Zanchi (1516-1590) wrote as an Italian Reformed theologian teaching in Zurich and later in Heidelberg; his work responds to post-Tridentine Catholicism and consolidates Calvinian-Augsburg controversies into scholastic categories.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To defend and systematically articulate the doctrine of divine predestination - both election and reprobation - as an absolute decree of God grounded in his sovereign will, compatible with human responsibility, and necessary for a coherent doctrine of grace and salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definitions and distinctions: predestination, decree, election, reprobation, foreknowledge, preterition.
 - Scriptural and patristic warrant: sustained exegesis of Pauline and Augustinian texts to establish unconditional election.
 - The relation of divine decree to human will: claim of compatibilist freedom - human acts are truly voluntary though will is bound by sin apart from grace.
 - Nature of reprobation: treated as a real decree of God compatible with his justice; distinguished from divine causation of sin in a way that preserves human culpability.
 - Practical and pastoral consequences: assurance for the elect, warning for sinners, and theodicy of divine justice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and Paul are primary witnesses; Calvin and Theodore Beza frame the Reformed baseline. Zanchi also engages scholastic categories (Aquinas, medieval distinctions), answers contemporary Catholic objections, and anticipates continental debates that later involve Arminians and Jesuit Molinists.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine decrees, election and reprobation, providence, human will and moral responsibility, total depravity, irresistible grace (efficacy), justification by faith, sin and its origin, soteriological implications.
- **Closing line:** Zanchi centers the theology of predestination on the absolute, salvific decree of God - maintaining its scriptural warrant, defending its justice, and embedding it in a rigorous scholastic account that preserves both divine sovereignty and human accountability.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precision in scholastic distinctions (e.g., types of decrees, order of decrees) used to avoid theological ambiguity while defending orthodox Reformed conclusions.
 - Strong compatibilist account of freedom: human will is truly voluntary but morally bound by sin absent sovereign grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Clarifies and systematizes Calvin/Beza on reprobation against caricatures of arbitrariness; insists reprobation is consistent with divine justice and human guilt.
 - Offers a more technically philosophical defense than earlier pastoral expositions, distinguishing Zanchi from purely polemical or devotional treatments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Adopts and adapts scholastic categories (absolutum vs. conditionale decrees, preterition, antecedent/consequent wills) for Reformed usage with high precision.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed academic circles as a model of scholastic method and careful exegetical justification for predestination; influential in continental Reformed theology and Protestant faculties.
 - Used frequently in polemics against later Remonstrants/Arminians and in debates with Molinists, though Zanchi precedes the height of those controversies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies how Reformed theology was systematized into scholastic forms; useful as a bridge between patristic/Calvinist exegesis and later systematic theology.
 - Models careful balancing of doctrinal rigor with pastoral concerns about assurance and moral responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination:** God's eternal decree ordering salvation; central organising concept for the treatise.
- **Election:** God's unconditional choice of some to salvation; argued from Scripture and divine purpose, not foreseen merit.
- **Reprobation:** God's decree concerning the non-elect; treated as a real divine act compatible with justice and human culpability.
- **Decree (decretum absolutum / decretum conditionale):** Scholastic distinction applied to explain the form and order of divine decisions.
- **Preterition:** The idea of God's passing over the non-elect; Zanchi distinguishes passing-over from causing sin.
- **Foreknowledge (praescientia):** Biblical foreseeing reinterpreted so it does not reduce predestination to mere divine foresight of human merit.
- **Providence:** God's governance of means and ends, making predestination effective in history without negating secondary causality.
- **Free will (compatibilist):** Human freedom affirmed as voluntary action within a nature bound by sin; compatible with divine predestination.
- **Total depravity:** Human inability to initiate salvation; justifies necessity of efficacious grace.
- **Efficacious grace / irresistible grace:** Grace that effectively achieves its end in the elect; consistent with Zanchi's account of divine sovereignty.
- **Preaching and assurance:** Practical terms linking doctrine to pastoral outcomes - assurance for elect, exhortation and warning for all.
- **Scriptural proof-texting:** Methodological use of Pauline and Augustinian passages as the primary warrant for doctrinal claims.
- **Divine justice and glory:** Theological motives explaining why predestination serves God's righteousness and ultimate ends.
- **Causality and culpability:** Distinctions that preserve human responsibility while affirming divine causal ordering.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a defined Reformed **definition source** for classical accounts of election and reprobation.
 - As a **polemical resource** against views minimizing divine sovereignty (Arminianism, Molinism, Catholic compromises).
 - As an **exegetical-model** blending Pauline-Augustinian exegesis with scholastic precision for systematic theology.
