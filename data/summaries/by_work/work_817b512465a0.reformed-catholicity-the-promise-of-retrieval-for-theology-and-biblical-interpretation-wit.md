### TITLE
**Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation** (Scott R. Swain with Michael A. Allen, eds., 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-2010s Reformed renewal that seeks rapprochement with historic catholic (universal) resources. Responds to both confessional Reformed insularity and modern anti-traditionalism; part of broader retrieval movements in evangelical and confessional Protestant scholarship.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reformed theology is most faithful and fruitful when it self-consciously retrieves and integrates the ecumenical patrimony (creeds, Fathers, liturgy, sacramentality) without capitulating to Roman or Eastern particularities. Retrieval promises doctrinal stability, interpretive depth, and ecumenical conversation.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Articulate the case for a genuine Reformed catholicity that is both historically grounded and theologically rigorous.
 - Defend a methodological posture where theology operates as disciplined science (principia/theology-as-science): authoritative Scripture interpreted within the church's received rule of faith.
 - Demonstrate implications for biblical interpretation, ecclesiology, sacramentology, and especially Trinitarian theology (including treatment of the Filioque within ecumenical creeds).
 - Offer models of retrieval: patristic reading, confessional renewal, liturgical recovery.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Athanasius, Cappadocians, John Calvin; modern interlocutors include neo-Scholastic and analytic Reformed voices, ecumenical Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox critics, and contemporary retrieval proponents (e.g., N. T. Wright-style ordo salutis/Scripture-centered retrievalists).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and authority (Scripture and rule of faith), theological method, Trinity (including Filioque and creed reception), Christology, covenant, sacramentology (baptism and Lord's Supper), ecclesiology and liturgy.
- **Site usages (explicit):**
 - **Theological Method (Principia: Theology as Science):** The volume defends principled theological method-Scripture as principium with the church's catholic tradition as normative aids-arguing for theology as a disciplined cognitive enterprise rather than merely private piety or pragmatic ministry.
 - **Filioque and Ecumenical Creeds:** Engages the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and the Western Filioque, urging that Reformed retrieval should recognize the creeds' normative role while pursuing careful ecumenical and historical theology concerning the procession language.
- **Closing line:** Theologically conservative yet catholic in horizon, the book proposes that Reformed identity is strengthened-not diluted-by retrieving the ecumenical tradition as a hermeneutical, confessional, and ecclesial resource.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents retrieval not as antiquarian nostalgia but as a critical, constructive discipline that reshapes doctrine and exegesis.
 - Frames theology as an intellectual science bound to principia (Scripture and rule-of-faith), countering both fideism and purely historical-critical reductionism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters pietistic and purely confessional Reformed insularity by arguing for catholic resources.
 - Distinguishes itself from Romanizing retrievals by maintaining Reformed commitments (sola Scriptura, covenantal hermeneutic) while accepting ecumenical patrimony.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes "catholicity" as a methodological category (catholicity-as-interpretive-shape) rather than merely institutional claim.
 - Uses the language of principia to rehabilitate theology-as-science within confessional Protestantism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among confessional Reformed scholars and pastors seeking classical resources; sparked further dialogue with Anglican and Roman Catholic retrieval projects.
 - Provoked critique from some evangelical anti-traditionalists and from Eastern Orthodox scholars wary of Western creedal receptions.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a concise programmatic manifesto for integrating patristic, creedal, and confessional resources into Reformed teaching and exegesis; useful for seminaries and advanced instruction in method and doctrinal retrieval.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reformed catholicity:** The project of making Reformed theology robustly ecumenical by retrieving shared church resources while retaining Reformed doctrinal commitments.
- **Retrieval:** Deliberate recovery and critical appropriation of patristic, creedal, and liturgical materials for contemporary theology.
- **Principia / theology as science:** The claim that theology is a disciplined cognitive enterprise grounded in principial commitments (Scripture as first principle, rule-of-faith as guiding principle).
 - Contrasts with private impressionism and with purely historicist reduction.
- **Rule of faith (regula fidei):** The church's received sketch of apostolic belief used to guide interpretation of Scripture and guard orthodoxy.
- **Ecumenical creeds:** Nicene-Constantinopolitan and Apostles' creeds as normative loci for doctrinal retrieval and ecumenical conversation.
- **Filioque:** The West's lexical addition about the Spirit's procession; treated as a locus classicus for showing the need for historical-grammatical as well as ecumenical sensitivity in retrieval.
- **Patristic retrieval:** Method of reading the Fathers critically and constructively as part of canonical and confessional interpretation.
- **Confessional fidelity:** Maintaining Reformed confessions (Westminster, Second Helvetic, etc.) as guides for appropriation, not as seals excluding catholic resources.
- **Lex orandi, lex credendi:** The interplay of worship and doctrine emphasized for liturgical and sacramental retrieval.
- **Sacramental ontology:** Recovery of the sacraments' objective signifying role within covenantal life.
- **Covenantal hermeneutic:** Reading Scripture and theology through covenant structures; used to integrate corporate, sacramental, and ecclesial dimensions.
- **Doctrinal retrieval:** Rearticulation of classic doctrines (Trinity, Christology) using historical categories but grounded in Scripture.
- **Ecumenical humility:** A posture recommended when engaging contested loci (e.g., Filioque) - firm in confession, open to dialogue.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "Reformed catholicity" and principled retrieval methodology in seminars on method.
- As a **polemic** against both confessional isolationism and uncritical traditionalism.
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating creedal and patristic insights into biblical interpretation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for teaching Trinitarian theology that bridges Reformed and wider ecumenical concerns (notably the Filioque debate).
