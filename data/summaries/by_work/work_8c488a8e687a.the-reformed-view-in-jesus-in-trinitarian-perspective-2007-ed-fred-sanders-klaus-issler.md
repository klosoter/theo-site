### TITLE
**"The Reformed View" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in Jesus in Trinitarian Perspective (2007)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical engagement with Trinitarian Christology; contribution to a multi-author work addressing how the doctrine of the Trinity shapes Christology.
 - Situated within renewed interest in classical Trinitarian language against both modern reductions (e.g., flattened social models) and pietistic/functional distortions.

- **Central thesis**
 - The eternal sonship of the second Person is doctrinally and soteriologically decisive: the Son, as eternally generated, alone assumes human nature; incarnation must be understood as the personal act of the eternal Son within the life of the Trinity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of the distinction between **immanent Trinity** (relations of origin) and **economic Trinity** (missions).
 - Defense of **eternal generation** as a real intra-Trinitarian relation, not a merely optional theological construct.
 - Clarification that the **incarnation** is not a change in deity but the personal assumption of human nature by the eternal Son - preserving divine impassibility and Chalcedonian two-natures-one-person.
 - Pastoral and soteriological moves: eternal sonship secures the continuity of God's redemptive purpose (e.g., covenant of redemption) and grounds the Son's reliability as mediator.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Scripture (notably John, Philippians, Hebrews) and to patristic and Reformed authorities (Athanasius, Augustine, Calvin).
 - Implicit contrast with theological trends that deny or relativize eternal generation (some readings of Barth, certain social-Trinitarian emphases, and modern denialist proposals).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs economic), Christology (eternal Sonship, incarnation, hypostatic union), soteriology (mediation, covenantal themes), and the communicatio idiomatum (careful application).

- **Closing line**
 - The Reformed perspective insists that the Son's eternal personal relation within the Godhead furnishes the only coherent foundation for the Son's incarnation, mediation, and saving action.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linking of **eternal generation** to the actuality and intelligibility of the incarnation - the person who becomes man is the Son who eternally is Son.
 - Balanced attention to both doctrinal precision (immanent Trinitarian relations) and pastoral consequences (assurance of redemption).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to views that treat sonship as merely economic or as beginning at the incarnation (adoptionist tendencies).
 - Pushback against social-Trinitarian reductions that collapse eternal personal relations into temporal relationality; also a corrective to overly speculative metaphysics that undermines biblical simplicity.

- **Conceptual/terminological notes**
 - Rehabilitates classical language (eternal generation) while warning against abstract metaphysical distortions: generation is affirmed as personal, relational, and grounded in Scripture.

- **Reception & influence**
 - Valuable in Reformed circles for restating traditional loci in contemporary debate; often cited in conservative Reformed defenses of eternal sonship.
 - Influential as a concise pedagogical resource linking Trinitarian theology to practical Christology in pastoral and confessional contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact model for teachers: integrates exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral theology to defend classical Reformed Christology against both modern rejection and naïve popularizations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Sonship** - The Son's personal identity as Son is eternal, not begun at incarnation; principal Reformed claim of Ferguson.
- **Eternal Generation** - The metaphysical/relational doctrine that the Son proceeds from the Father by way of relationship, constitutive of Sonship.
- **Incarnation** - The personal assumption of human nature by the eternal Son; not an addition to deity but an assumption of humanity.
- **Hypostatic Union** - Union of two natures in one person (the Son); preserved against mixture and separation.
- **Immanent vs Economic Trinity** - Distinction between God's inner life (relations of origin) and God's works toward creation; used to anchor incarnation in God's inner life.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - Careful use: properties of each nature ascribed to the one Person without confusion of natures.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - Intratrinitarian plan grounded in the eternal relations of Father and Son; soteriological framework linked to eternal sonship.
- **Missio Dei / Sending** - The economic expression of intra-Trinitarian relations: Father sends the Son (and Spirit), grounded in the eternal relations.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling used to illumine relational life without collapsing personal distinctions.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - The classical formula (two natures, one person) as the necessary boundary for talk about incarnation.
- **Atonement & Mediation** - Grounded in the personhood of the eternally begotten Son; sola persona enables true representation.
- **Immutability & Impassibility** - Preserved by distinguishing deity's nature from the incarnate experience of the Son's human nature.
- **Anti-adoptionism / Anti-modalism** - Negative polemical targets; Ferguson defends against both extremes.
- **Economic properties** - Roles in redemption that flow from immanent relations; not to be collapsed into essence.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed affirmation of eternal sonship in systematic theology textbooks and lectures.
 - As a **polemic and exegetical model**: used to counter modern denials of eternal generation and to read Johannine and Pauline texts Christologically in a Trinitarian frame.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian ontology to practical soteriology (mediation, covenantal assurance) in preaching and pastoral doctrine.
