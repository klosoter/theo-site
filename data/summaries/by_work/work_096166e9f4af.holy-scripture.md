### TITLE
**Holy Scripture** (Studies in Dogmatics) - G. C. Berkouwer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Dutch Reformed dogmatics; part of Berkouwer's Studies in Dogmatics.
 - Written in dialogue with neo-orthodoxy (Barth), Roman Catholic ressourcement culminating in Vatican II (Dei Verbum, 1965), and Anglo-American debates over inerrancy/fundamentalism.
 - Dutch first edition mid-1960s; English translation soon after (Eerdmans).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture's authority is grounded in God's self-revelation centered in Christ and attested by the Holy Spirit; avoid both rationalistic objectivism (formal inerrancy as protective theory) and subjectivist event-ism (Word only as existential encounter).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Revelation and Scripture**: The Word of God comes to the church normatively in the inscripturated witness; revelation and Scripture relate organically, not mechanically.
 - **Self-witness and testimonium**: Scripture's autopistia and the Spirit's inner testimony ground assurance without circularity-as-vicious; faith is Spirit-given obedience.
 - **Inspiration**: Defends organic inspiration (divine-human concursus; full humanity without diminution of divine authority).
 - **Canon and church**: The church recognizes, not creates, the canon; authority is intrinsic to Scripture's divine origin.
 - **Authority, infallibility, inerrancy**: Prefers speaking of infallibility in relation to Scripture's saving intention; warns that a defensive inerrancy can mislocate authority.
 - **Perspicuity and sufficiency**: Clarity in matters necessary for salvation; sufficiency rules out rival authorities yet invites ecclesial listening.
 - **Accommodation and genre**: Calvin's accommodation, literary forms, and historical conditions belong to God's wise giving of Scripture; handle difficulties by attending to intention and genre.
 - **Christological unity**: Promise-fulfillment and christocentric coherence govern exegesis; the Old and New Testaments form one redemptive-historical witness.
 - **Hermeneutics and obedience**: Interpretation is ecclesial, penitent, Spirit-dependent listening; Scripture judges the church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Calvin; Reformed confessions (Belgic 5, 7; Westminster); Kuyper and Bavinck (principia, organic inspiration).
 - Warfield/Hodge (inspiration and inerrancy); Barth/Brunner (revelation and the Word); Roman Catholic magisterial texts (Providentissimus, Divino Afflante, Dei Verbum).
 - Engagement with historical criticism, urging reverent, non-reductionist use.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, authority, canon, perspicuity, sufficiency, accommodation, hermeneutics.
 - Also touches christology (Scripture witnesses to Christ), pneumatology (testimonium), ecclesiology (church under Scripture), soteriology (saving intention), theology proper (God who speaks).
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Scripture serves the gospel of Christ in the power of the Spirit, summoning the church to obedient faith.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Christological concentration** without collapsing Scripture into mere witness-event.
 - **Organic inspiration** and strong use of **accommodation** and **genre** to honor Scripture's humanity.
 - **Infallibility-in-intention**: truth ordered to salvation, not a universal catalog of precision claims.
 - **Self-attestation and testimonium** as the mode of certainty, resisting evidentialist or magisterial securitization.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against **rationalist inerrantism** that treats a theory as guarantor of faith.
 - Against **subjectivism/neo-orthodoxy** where Scripture only becomes Word in encounter.
 - Nuancing **Roman Catholic** accounts that risk locating normativity in magisterial act rather than intrinsic authority.
 - Warns against **biblicism** and proof-texting detached from redemptive history.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Re-centers talk of authority around **obedience**, **intention**, and **christological unity**.
 - Clarifies the **autopistia/testimonium** nexus as Spirit-given assurance.
 - Distinguishes **error-talk** from category mistakes about Scripture's **aim** and **forms**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed circles as a mediating, confessional yet irenic bibliology.
 - Critiqued by strict inerrantists; appreciated by those integrating historical inquiry with confessional commitment.
 - Informed ecumenical dialogues post-Vatican II.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for linking exegesis, dogmatics, and ecclesial obedience.
 - Offers language to engage critical scholarship without surrendering authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation**: God's self-disclosure culminating in Christ; Scripture is its normative inscription.
- **Word of God**: Identifies Scripture as God's address, not merely a pointer to an event.
- **Self-attestation (autopistia)**: Scripture's intrinsic claim upon faith; recognized by the church.
- **Testimonium Spiritus Sancti**: The Spirit's inner witness creating assurance and obedience.
 - Not proof by external criteria; grounds certainty without fideism.
- **Organic inspiration**: Divine-human concursus respecting authorial agency and historical situatedness.
- **Infallibility**: Reliability with respect to God's saving intention; pastoral and soteriological orientation.
 - Contrasts with blanket **inerrancy** as a protective theory detached from intention.
- **Accommodation**: God's condescension to human capacity; explains forms and limitations without denying authority.
- **Perspicuity**: Clarity in what is necessary for salvation, amid localized obscurities.
- **Sufficiency**: Scripture as complete norm for faith and life; no co-norming authority.
- **Canon**: Church's recognition of intrinsic authority; rule of faith shaping reading.
- **Christological unity**: Promise-fulfillment coherence of the two Testaments; christum treiben.
- **Redemptive-historical reading**: Locates texts within the unified economy of salvation.
- **Church under Scripture**: Ecclesial posture of listening, repentance, and conformity to the Word.
- **Hermeneutical obedience**: Interpretation as moral-spiritual act under the Spirit, not technique alone.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for authority, inspiration, canon, and perspicuity in bibliology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology and hermeneutics via christological unity.
 - As a **moderating polemic** against both strict inerrantism and neo-orthodox event-ism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for genre-sensitive, redemptive-historical interpretation within the church.
