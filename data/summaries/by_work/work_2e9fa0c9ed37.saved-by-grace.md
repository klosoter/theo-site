### TITLE
**Saved by Grace** (Eerdmans, 1989) - Anthony A. Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Dutch-American Reformed theology (Calvin Seminary). Engages postwar biblical theology (Vos, Ridderbos), debates over Pentecostal second blessing, Keswick perfectionism, Roman Catholic-Tridentine soteriology, and ordo salutis reformulations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Salvation is the Spirit-wrought application of Christ to the believer **in union with Christ**, grounded in the covenant of grace, structured by the already/not yet of the kingdom; justification is forensic and by faith alone, inseparable from sanctification yet not conflated with it.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Union with Christ** as organizing center; re-frames ordo salutis as a dynamic, interrelated complex rather than a rigid sequence.
 - **Effectual calling and regeneration**: monergistic, renewing the whole person; rejects substantialist or mechanistic views of new birth.
 - **Conversion**: repentance and faith as twin, Spirit-enabled acts; faith as knowledge, assent, trust; instrument not ground.
 - **Justification**: forensic declaration on the basis of Christ's imputed righteousness; excludes merit; assures acceptance.
 - **Adoption**: filial status and privileges; pastoral weight for assurance.
 - **Sanctification**: definitive and progressive; mortification/vivification; ordinary means; rejects perfectionism and antinomianism.
 - **Perseverance and assurance**: God preserves; believers persevere; assurance rooted in Christ's promise, Spirit's witness, and evidences.
 - **Glorification**: eschatological completion; informs present sanctification (realized/future tension).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture read with Reformed confessions (Heidelberg, Belgic, Dort; Westminster); Calvin, Bavinck, Berkhof, Berkouwer, Vos, Ridderbos, John Murray. Contrasts with Trent, Wesleyan perfectionism, Keswick, Pentecostal second blessing, antinomian and legalistic distortions, aspects of Barthian conflation of justification/sanctification.
- **Doctrines treated:** Effectual calling, regeneration, conversion (faith/repentance), justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, assurance, glorification; original sin (guilt and pollution); good works and merit; Spirit-baptism; church and means of grace; human nature as psychosomatic unity.
- **Closing line:** The saving work of God is grace from first to last, applied by the Spirit in union with Christ, rendering sinners right with God and renewing them unto holy hope in the already/not yet kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Union with Christ** as the architectonic principle for the application of redemption.
 - **Definitive sanctification** alongside progressive growth (following Murray).
 - **Already/not yet eschatology** governing every soteriological locus.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Tridentine** view of infused righteousness as the formal cause of justification; affirms imputed righteousness and forensic acquittal.
 - Against **Wesleyan/Keswick perfectionism** and Pentecostal two-stage schema; sanctification is lifelong, Spirit-baptism coincides with conversion.
 - Against **antinomianism** and cheap grace; good works are necessary as fruit and evidence, never as merit.
 - Nuances **ordo salutis** rigidity; insists on interrelation in union with Christ.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Pastoral deployment of **assurance** as trifold: promises, Spirit's testimony, and evidences.
 - Clear differentiation of **instrument vs ground** in faith and justification.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became a standard Reformed soteriology text in seminaries; widely cited for balanced treatments of faith, assurance, and sanctification.
 - Helpful bridge between confessional Reformed dogmatics and biblical-theological eschatology (Ridderbos/Vos).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Reliable, irenic correctives to persistent errors (merit, perfectionism, second blessing).
 - Pedagogically clear on repentance/faith, justification/sanctification, perseverance/assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** The encompassing relation by which every saving benefit is communicated.
- **Effectual calling:** God's efficacious summons that creates what it commands; inseparable from regeneration.
- **Regeneration:** Monergistic new birth renewing the whole person; not a substance but Spirit-wrought reorientation.
- **Conversion:** **Repentance** (turning from sin) and **faith** (knowledge, assent, trust) as two inseparable acts.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration based on Christ's righteousness imputed; faith as **instrument** not **ground**.
- **Adoption:** Legal-sonship with familial privileges; supports assurance and sanctification.
- **Sanctification:** Both **definitive** break with sin and **progressive** growth by Word, sacraments, prayer.
 - **Mortification/Vivification:** Putting to death sin; enlivening unto obedience.
- **Perseverance of the saints:** God preserves; believers persevere through means; warnings are real means.
- **Assurance:** Rooted in promises, Spirit's witness, and fruits; distinct from the essence of faith yet intended for believers.
- **Good works and merit:** Works are necessary fruits; no condign or congruent merit before God.
- **Original sin:** **Guilt and pollution** derived from Adam under federal headship; explains universal death.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** Human person as a unity; sanctification renews the whole person.
- **Spirit-baptism:** Identified with conversion/initiation into Christ, not a post-conversion second blessing.
- **Ordo salutis (reframed):** An interrelated complex located within union with Christ and the already/not yet.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for justification, faith, assurance, and sanctification in Reformed classrooms.
 - As a **polemic** against perfectionism, second-blessing Pentecostalism, and merit theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking inaugurated eschatology to sanctification and perseverance.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** integrating confessional doctrine with biblical-theological motifs.
