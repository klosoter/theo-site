### TITLE
Wilhelm Dilthey, *The Theology of Schleiermacher: A Study of the Development of His Doctrine of the Soul* - a developmental, historical-critical reading of Friedrich Schleiermacher's anthropology and its implications for the Traducianism vs Creationism debate.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century intellectual history: Dilthey writes as a historian of the human sciences, reading Schleiermacher (late 18th-early 19th c.) against the backdrop of Enlightenment metaphysics, Romantic subjectivism, and emerging psychology.
 - Milieu: post-Kantian Protestant theology, reaction to rationalism, formative stage of modern theological anthropology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Dilthey argues that Schleiermacher's doctrine of the soul undergoes a decisive shift from metaphysical/ontological formulations toward a psychological, experiential account that reframes - and in effect dissolves - the traditional Traducianism vs Creationism dispute.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Traces chronological development in Schleiermacher's writings and lectures:
 - Early phase: engagement with metaphysical categories; tacit reliance on inherited formulations about soul origin.
 - Transitional phase: increasing emphasis on self-consciousness and the "feeling of absolute dependence" as normative center.
 - Mature phase: theological anthropology reframed in psychological-experiential terms; soul conceived as the function/structure of subjectivity rather than a metaphysical substance whose origin is a primary theological question.
 - Key methodological move: historicist-hermeneutical reading that reads doctrines as responses to shifting epistemological pressures (philosophy, science, pastoral needs).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Schleiermacher (primary subject), Kant, Fichte, German Romantic thinkers, traditional dogmatic sources (Lutheran, Reformed formulations on soul origin), contemporary nascent psychology.
 - Dilthey engages doctrinal debates implicitly by reconstructing Schleiermacher's conceptual moves rather than polemically defending one side.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (doctrine of the soul), origin of the soul (Traducianism vs Creationism), sin and original sin as psychical conditions, self-consciousness, freedom and religious feeling, revelation as experiential event.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Schleiermacher, as read by Dilthey, relocates the core theological question from metaphysical provenance of the soul to the empirical-phenomenal structure of religious subjectivity: the soul is understood primarily as the living unity of self-conscious feeling that constitutes religious life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Recasts theological anthropology in psychological and experiential vocabulary: the soul = dynamic subjectivity, not a metaphysical substratum.
 - Prioritizes *feeling* (Gefühl) and self-consciousness as hermeneutic keys for doctrine rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves away from systematic dogmatics that insist on answering metaphysical origin-questions (created vs generated soul) and instead treats those questions as secondary or reframed by psychology.
 - Opposes mechanistic or reductionist Enlightenment accounts by preserving a theological place for immediate religious experience.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Terminological shift: from ontology of "soul-substance" to functional descriptions (life of the soul, unity of consciousness, religious feeling).
 - Dilthey coins/uses developmental-hermeneutical vocabulary to chart theological change over a thinker's life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Helped liberal Protestant and modern theological anthropology to de-emphasize metaphysical origin disputes and focus on experiential subjectivity.
 - Provoked conservatively minded theologians who retained metaphysical commitments about the soul and creation.
 - Influenced later histories of theology and the methodology of theological biography.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Useful model for reading doctrinal development historically and for showing how changes in epistemology and psychology recast classical dogmatic questions.
 - Clarifies how the Traducianism vs Creationism debate can be reframed when the priority shifts to phenomenology of the soul.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Doctrine of the soul** - central locus examined; treated as evolving concept from substance to subjectivity.
- **Traducianism** - the view that the soul is generated/transmitted (often with the body); Dilthey shows Schleiermacher sidelines metaphysical commitment by reframing the question psychologically.
- **Creationism (of the soul)** - the view that each soul is directly created by God; discussed as a traditional option rendered problematic when focus moves to experiential selfhood.
- **Feeling of absolute dependence (Gefühl der Abhängigkeit)** - Schleiermacher's defining description of religious consciousness; becomes the primary datum for anthropology.
- **Self-consciousness / Selbstbewusstsein** - analyzed as the structural core of the soul in Schleiermacher's mature thought.
- **Psychogenesis / psychological account** - language Dilthey uses to indicate origin-talk reframed as developmental/psychological formation rather than metaphysical generation.
- **Historical-hermeneutical method** - Dilthey's interpretive stance: doctrines intelligible as historical responses to cultural-epistemic pressures.
- **Religious subjectivity** - the functional center replacing metaphysical categories; what theology must explicate.
- **Original sin (as psychical condition)** - reconceived in Schleiermacher as existential/constitutional impairment of self-relationality rather than inherited metaphysical guilt.
- **Anthropological relocation** - the methodological move from ontology to anthropology.
- **Dogmatic residue** - traditional formulations retained in language but reinterpreted through experiential categories.
- **Revelation as event** - treated as experiential encounter shaping subjectivity rather than mere propositional content.
- **Methodological exemplar** - Dilthey's study becomes a model for historical-theological reading of doctrinal development.
- **Conceptual pivot** - Schleiermacher's reframing is used as a pivot point in modern debates about whether theological anthropology must answer metaphysical origin-questions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for modern theological anthropology that centers subjectivity and feeling.
- As a **polemic tool** against metaphysical insistence on soul-origin questions, showing their displacement in modern theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for developmental readings of theologians (how doctrines change in response to philosophical and psychological shifts).
