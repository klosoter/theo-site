### TITLE
The Sinlessness of Christ - B. B. Warfield (essay: Impeccability of Christ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theological milieu; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed apologist against liberalizing currents and certain modern Christological proposals.
 - Situated within the broader debate over Christ's peccability (ability to sin) versus impeccability (inability to sin) that recurred in post-Reformation and modern theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus Christ was sinless in fact and morally incapable of sin (impeccable). This incapacity is consistent with true humanity in the hypostatic union and is necessary for his role as mediator and atoning Savior.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical exegesis: close appeal to key texts (Hebrews, John, 1 Peter, 2 Corinthians) to show both actual sinlessness and the normative impossibility of sinning for the incarnate Son.
 - Logical-theological argument:
 - Sinlessness is required by Christ's identity as the perfectly righteous mediator and federal head.
 - If Christ could sin, his work as substitute and perfect sacrifice would be undermined; imputation and covenantal representation collapse.
 - Philosophical and moral distinctions:
 - Distinguishes types of incapacity: natural/metaphysical inability, moral impossibility, and voluntary restraint.
 - Maintains that temptation and genuine freedom are compatible with impeccability; temptations test but do not imply a real propensity to fall.
 - Historical-theological appeal:
 - Reconstructs patristic, medieval, and Reformation lines supporting Christ's impeccability and corrects readings that force peccability onto the tradition.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture and classical patristic and Reformation writers are primary sources.
 - Engages contemporary proponents of the peccability thesis (late 19th/early 20th-century critical or liberal theologians) and reworks scholastic categories for clarity.
 - Dialogues indirectly with Aquinas/Scholastics and directly with Reformed expositors (Calvinic tradition).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, person and work of Christ)
 - Soteriology (atonement, imputation, active and passive obedience)
 - Sin and temptation
 - Divine perfections and mediation
 - Freedom and moral agency

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center of gravity: the Son's sinlessness is both a biblical testimony and a doctrinal necessity for Christ's mediatorial efficacy and the integrity of redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing different senses of "ability" and "possibility" (e.g., moral impossibility vs. merely improbable fall).
 - Integration of exegetical proof-texting with juridical and covenantal logic: sinlessness as intrinsic to the Savior's representative function.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Christ's sinlessness to mere moral achievement or to a post-fall avoidance; rejects any interpretation that treats peccability as essential to authentic humanity.
 - Pushes back against liberal tendencies to prioritize Christ's solidarity with human weakness by conceding actual capacity to sin.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies the compatibilist account of genuine temptation plus impeccability: real trial without ontological capacity for sin.
 - Refines the doctrine of "active obedience" by connecting it to ontological purity rather than merely exemplary conduct.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; became a standard reference for defending classical Impeccability.
 - Provoked continued debate: critics argue Warfield's position underplays Christ's full identification with fallen humanity; defenders praise his rigor and doctrinal coherence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a pedagogical model for treating contested Christological doctrines: methodically exegetical, historically aware, and logically rigorous.
 - Remains a staple for systematic treatments of Christ's person and work and for apologetic defenses of the atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability**
 - The doctrine that Christ was not only sinless but morally incapable of sinning in his incarnate person.
- **Peccability**
 - The opposing view that Christ could have sinned though he did not; Warfield argues against this.
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The union of divine and human natures in the one person of Christ; Warfield uses it to explain how true humanity coexists with incapacity to sin.
- **Temptation**
 - Real and intense in Christ's experience, yet not evidence of a propension to fall; distinguished from causative internal sinfulness.
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's positive fulfillment of the law; Warfield links this to ontological righteousness necessary for substitutionary atonement.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death; requires sinless subject to be an effective sacrifice.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of righteousness and sin; Warfield argues imputation presupposes Christ's sinlessness and incapacity to sin.
- **Freedom (moral agency)**
 - Defined so as to allow real choice and response without granting metaphysical power to sin in Christ.
- **Moral impossibility vs. natural impossibility**
 - Key analytic distinction: Christ's inability to sin is a moral impossibility grounded in his person and mission, not mere physical incapacity.
- **Representative / Federal Headship**
 - Christ as covenantal head whose sinless status is necessary for valid representation of elect humanity.
- **Solidarity with sinners**
 - Warfield affirms solidarity via assumption and temptation, while denying solidarity via shared capacity to sin.
- **Atonement efficacy**
 - Theological point that only an impeccable Christ can provide a perfect and acceptable atonement.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source and authoritative statement defending impeccability in Christology.
 - As a polemical resource against peccability and liberal Christologies that relativize sinlessness.
 - As an exegetical-model for reading key New Testament texts on Christ's sinlessness and temptation.
 - As a conceptual pivot in systematic treatments linking person (hypostatic union) to work (atonement, imputation).
