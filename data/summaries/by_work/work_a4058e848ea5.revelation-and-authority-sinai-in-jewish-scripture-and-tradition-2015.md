### TITLE
**Revelation and Authority: Sinai in Jewish Scripture and Tradition (2015)** - Benjamin D. Sommer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Monograph in contemporary Judaic studies (2015); interfaces biblical criticism, Second Temple and rabbinic traditions, and intellectual history of Jewish theology.
 - Addresses current scholarly debates about how ancient Israel construes divine communication and the social foundations of religious authority.

- **Central thesis**
 - Sinai is not a single, theologically uniform event in Jewish sources but a cluster of related traditions that construct and contest authority; the plurality of Sinai-accounts shapes how revelation and law are authorized, mediated, and remembered.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Textual survey: reads key Sinai passages in the Hebrew Bible for divergent motifs (audible voice, visual manifestation, angelic mediation, multiple divine agents).
 - Reception history: traces how Second Temple literature, Dead Sea sects, rabbinic corpora, and medieval thinkers rework Sinai to legitimize competing institutions (prophets, priests, sages).
 - Theological-political claim: authority is a social product grounded in competing readings of a revelatory event; memory and interpretation, not a single face-to-face epiphany, confer enduring authority.
 - Method: philological close reading combined with attention to literary pluralism and social function of texts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical figures: Moses, the assembly at Sinai, Angel(s), the divine voice(s).
 - Traditions engaged: Pentateuchal Sinai narratives, Second Temple texts, rabbinic midrash and Mishnah/Talmud, medieval Jewish responses (e.g., strategies for reconciling philosophical monotheism with biblical imagery).
 - Scholarly interlocutors: modern historians of religion and textual critics who posit either unity or fragmentation of Sinai traditions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (eventuality vs. textualized memory), **authority** (source and legitimation), **covenant**, **prophecy**, **law** and its mediation; implications for divine presence and agency.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Sinai functions theologically as a plural, contested memory whose varying portrayals sustain and challenge institutional claims to divine authority rather than as a single, unambiguous theophany that simply transmits fixed content.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Sinai primarily as a locus of social memory and interpretive contestation rather than merely as a doctrinally fixed revelation event.
 - Stresses textual heterogeneity within the biblical corpus and its later traditions as formative for claims to religious authority.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters models that present Sinai as a single, literal face-to-face encounter that unproblematically grounds legal authority.
 - Challenges readings that collapse Biblical, Second Temple, and rabbinic layers into a seamless genealogy of authority - instead, maps discontinuities and reconfigurations.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "revelation" as mediated, performative, and institutionalized memory; highlights **heteroglossia** of Sinai traditions as theological data rather than noise to be harmonized.

- **Reception & influence**
 - Well received among scholars of Jewish studies and biblical theology for clarifying how tradition-history informs authority claims.
 - Has prompted theologians (Jewish and Christian) to reconsider how canonical memory is mobilized for normative claims.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for studying the interplay of text, memory, and authority; valuable for courses on revelation, law, and interreligious appropriation of Sinai.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sinai** - a composite referent: geographic/theophanic event, cluster of textual traditions, and mnemonic resource for institutions.
- **Theophany** - varied: audible voice, sensory manifestations, or mediated by an angel; Sommer stresses plurality rather than one prototype.
- **Revelation (mediated vs immediate)** - revelation is often portrayed as mediated (through Moses, angels, text) and subsequently institutionalized.
- **Authority** - socially constructed and contested; legitimacy depends on which Sinai-tradition an agent invokes.
- **Covenant** - built on remembered Sinai-events; covenantal identity is negotiated through competing readings of Sinai.
- **Heteroglossia** - the coexistence of multiple voices/traditions about Sinai within the canonical and postcanonical corpus.
- **Social memory** - the mechanism by which communities shape and deploy recollections of Sinai to validate present authority.
- **Mosaic primacy** - the claim that Moses uniquely mediates Sinai; Sommer shows this claim is elaborated diversely across sources.
- **Angelic mediation** - motif that complicates direct divine-human contact and shifts authority to intermediary agents.
- **Peshat vs midrashic reworking** - distinction used to show how plain sense and interpretive expansion serve different institutional ends.
- **Institutional appropriation** - how priests, sages, prophets, and sectarians selectively read Sinai to buttress power.
- **Christophany / NT appropriation (relevance)** - while Sommer does not plead for Christian dogma, his mapping of plural theophanies is a resource for New Testament readings that see pre-Christian manifestations as polyvalent and open to Christological appropriation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a sociological and literary account of revelation and authority (useful in theology of revelation).
- As a **polemic** against monolithic models of Sinai-based authority (used in debates over canonical harmonization).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading canonical diversity: methodologically instructive for biblical and historical theologians.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Jewish-Christian dialogue on how a single sacred event can generate multiple authoritative traditions (relevant to discussions of Christophany and Trinitarian readings).
