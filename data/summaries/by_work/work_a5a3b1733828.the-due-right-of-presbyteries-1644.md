### TITLE
The Due Right of Presbyteries (1644) - Samuel Rutherford

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 1644 during the English Civil War and the Westminster Assembly era; emerges from Scottish Covenanter practice and the broader 17th-century contest over church polity (Episcopalians, Independents, Erastians). Rutherford writes as a Scottish Presbyterian divine defending national and regional church courts against civil and episcopal encroachment.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Presbyterial courts (kirk sessions, presbyteries, synods) are divinely instituted and possess autonomous spiritual jurisdiction necessary for ordination, discipline, and governance of the church; civil magistrates must not usurp these ecclesiastical rights.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scriptural exegesis establishing eldership and collective oversight as normative (NT patterns of elders, councils).
 - Historical and patristic argument showing parity with Reformation practice (Calvin, Knox) and rebutting novelty charges.
 - Polemic against Erastianism: limits of magistrate power; the church's capacity to administer censures (suspension, excommunication) without state control.
 - Practical prescriptions for presbyterial procedure: ordination, deposition, mutual oversight between ministers and ruling elders, convening of higher courts.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture, patristic citations, Calvin and Reformed confessions; interlocutors include Erastians, episcopalians, and various proponents of congregational independency; implicitly addresses civil authorities and some Westminster debates.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (office, government, sacraments), covenant theology as ecclesial framework, Christology in relation to Christ as head of the church (ground for spiritual jurisdiction), authority and magistracy, church discipline, pastoral office.
- **Closing line:** A systematic and polemical assertion that the presbytery is the biblically rooted, covenantal instrument for ordering the church's life and preserving purity against both state domination and internal faction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the *autonomy* of ecclesiastical courts within their spiritual sphere; not merely pragmatic but theologically necessary.
 - Integration of covenant theology with polity: church government is an aspect of covenant fidelity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contrasts with Erastianism by denying magistrate supremacy over ecclesiastical censures and ordination.
 - Rejects both episcopal hierarchical supremacy and congregational isolationism; argues for collective regional courts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear articulation of *parity* between ministers and elders in governance (ruling vs. teaching elders) as a theological and practical norm.
 - Sharp use of the term *due right* to connote both divine warrant and juridical entitlement for presbyteries.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in Scottish and English Presbyterian circles; formative for Presbyterian practice and for elements of the Westminster standards.
 - Provided reference-point for later Reformed defenses of church discipline and church-state boundaries; used in subsequent anti-Erastian polemics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A sustained classical Reformed defense of presbyterial polity and ecclesiastical autonomy; valuable for ecclesiology, church-state studies, and practical theology concerning discipline and ordination.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbytery:** Regional court of ministers and elders with authority for ordination, oversight, and discipline.
- **Eldership (ruling and teaching):** Distinction and parity between ministers (teaching elders) and ruling elders in governance.
- **Kirk (national church):** The national expression of covenant community ordered by presbyteries and synods.
- **Discipline (censures):** Ecclesiastical powers (admonition, suspension, excommunication) necessary to preserve purity; exercised without civil control.
- **Ordination:** A presbyterial act giving authority to ministers; not reducible to civil appointment or patronage.
- **Jurisdiction (spiritual vs. civil):** Delineation of spheres: spiritual jurisdiction belongs to church courts under Christ's headship; civil magistrate has limited, distinct authority.
- **Erastianism:** The view that civil magistrate has authority over the church; Rutherford's primary foil and frequent target.
- **Parish/patronage:** Debates over lay patronage and state imposition; Rutherford opposes external imposition on ecclesiastical appointments.
- **Covenant theology (ecclesial application):** The covenantal basis for ordered church life and mutual accountability.
- **Synod/General Assembly:** Higher courts convened by presbyteries for broader governance and adjudication.
- **Deposition:** Power of church courts to remove ministers for doctrine or moral failure.
- **Christ as Head:** Theological grounding for church autonomy; Christ's crown rights justify ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
- **Judicatory:** Any constituted court (session, presbytery, synod) exercising church government.
- **National church:** The ordered corporate expression of the covenant people under presbyterial structures.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for classic Presbyterian polity (offices, courts, discipline).
 - As polemic against Erastian and episcopal claims in church-state relations and for defending church autonomy.
 - As an exegetical-model for reading NT polity texts in support of collective eldership and judicatory structures.
