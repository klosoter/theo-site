### TITLE
The Reformation's Conflict with Rome (2001) - Robert L. Reymond

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2001 by a confessional Reformed theologian reacting to modern ecumenical and historical readings of the Reformation.
 - Situated within late 20th-century Evangelical/Reformed apologetics against Roman Catholic claims; addresses historical, theological, and polemical dimensions inherited from the sixteenth century and later councils (notably Trent).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformation represented a decisive corrective to Roman doctrinal corruption: especially on authority (Scripture vs. Church), justification, and the nature of grace and salvation. Reymond argues that the Reformers' recovery of sola scriptura, sola fide, and sola gratia is theologically necessary and historically justified.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Roman distinctives historically (medieval developments -> Council of Trent) and their clash with Reformational claims.
 - Exegesis and doctrinal critique: justification, sacraments, priesthood, papal authority, and ecclesiology.
 - Reformed constructive replies rooted in Scripture, historical confessions, and systematic theology.
 - Selected topical treatments that engage contemporary debates (e.g., human nature and divine decrees).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, the Council of Trent, Roman theologians (late medieval scholastics, post-Trent apologists).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Protestant scholastic tradition, modern Roman Catholic apologists and ecumenists.
 - Uses Reformation confessions and scriptural exegesis as loci of appeal.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority (Scripture, tradition, magisterium)
 - Justification (imputation, forensic righteousness)
 - Sacraments and sacerdotalism (Eucharist, penance, baptism)
 - Ecclesiology and papal primacy
 - Anthropology (notably trichotomy vs dichotomy) and soteriology (divine decrees: election and reprobation)
- **Closing line**
 - Reymond situates the Reformation as a necessary return to biblical soteriology and ecclesial authority: a confessional defense of God's sovereignty and Scripture's primacy against Roman theological developments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong confessional Reformed hermeneutic combining historical-polemical analysis with systematic theology; rarely treats Roman positions as mere misunderstandings-often portrays them as coherent alternatives with grave theological consequences.
 - Emphasis on **divine sovereignty** in salvation framed against Roman synergism and sacramental mediation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects what Reymond sees as modernizing or conciliatory readings of Trent; insists textual-historical fidelity shows enduring, substantive doctrinal divergence.
 - Contrasts Protestant forensic justification with Roman emphasis on infused righteousness and merit.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not so much innovation as rigorous reapplication: the work reasserts classic Reformation categories (sola scriptura, sola fide) within contemporary theological vocabulary and engages newer anthropological debates (e.g., trichotomy/dichotomy) from a Reformed vantage.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed and Evangelical circles as a clear, compact apologetic resource; used in seminary courses on Reformation theology and polemics.
 - Limited influence in Roman Catholic scholarship but used as a polemical touchstone in ecumenical discussions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear articulation of why Reformation convictions remain doctrinally significant; helpful as compact primer and as a bridge between historical theology and systematic concerns, especially on soteriology and anthropological issues.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura**
 - Scripture alone as final norm; Reymond critiques Roman appeal to tradition/magisterium as epistemically and theologically inferior.
- **Sola Fide / Forensic Justification**
 - Justification as imputed righteousness received by faith apart from works; contrasted with Roman infused righteousness and merit.
- **Sacramentalism**
 - Roman view of sacraments as instruments of grace tied to sacerdotal office; Reymond defends Protestant sacramental theology (means, not meritorious sources).
- **Papal Primacy / Infallibility**
 - Critique of papal claims as unscriptural and anachronistic; emphasizes conciliar and scriptural checks on ecclesial authority.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy**
 - Reymond addresses anthropological options, aligning with Reformed tendencies that stress **dichotomy** (body + immaterial soul/spirit as a unified immaterial aspect) over classical trichotomy; treats the debate as relevant to soteriology and sanctification.
- **Divine Decrees: Election and Reprobation**
 - Firm defense of Reformed teaching on **God's eternal decrees**, including unconditional election and the reality of reprobation; presented as coherent with divine justice and sovereignty and contrasted with Roman emphasis on prevenient grace and human cooperation.
- **Double Predestination**
 - Discussed as a logical corollary of divine sovereignty; Reymond defends its doctrinal coherence while clarifying pastoral and theological boundaries.
- **Grace vs. Merit**
 - Reformed insistence on sola gratia; critique of merit-based soteriology in Roman theology.
- **Covenant**
 - Covenantal categories used to interpret sacrament, election, and covenantal continuity/discontinuity with Israel and Church.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a succinct **polemic** resource in apologetics classes defending Reformation distinctives.
 - As a **definition source** for concise Reformed positions on authority, justification, and predestination.
 - As an **exegetical-model** resource when contrasting Protestant readings of key Pauline texts with Roman interpretations.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in seminars on ecclesial identity and the theological implications of anthropological models (dichotomy vs trichotomy) and doctrines of decree.
