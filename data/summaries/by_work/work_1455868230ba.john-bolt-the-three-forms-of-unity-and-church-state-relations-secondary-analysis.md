### TITLE
John Bolt, "The Three Forms of Unity and Church-State Relations" (secondary analysis)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Mid/late 20th-early 21st century Reformed scholarship placing the historic Dutch Reformed confessions (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort = the Three Forms of Unity) into conversation with modern church-state questions. Engages confessional Calvinism against modern secularizing and statist trends; conversant with Calvin, the Synod of Dort, and later figures (Kuyper, Bavinck).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The Three Forms present a delegated-but-distinctive ordering of spiritual and temporal authority: civil magistracy and the church each exercise legitimate authority under Christ, but with differing ends, means, and limits. Bolt argues this confessional formulation supplies a balanced paradigm resisting both state supremacy over the church and ecclesiastical theocracy.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Descriptive reading of key articles in the Three Forms that address magistrate, law, and ecclesiastical authority (Belgic Confessions on magistrate; Heidelberg on Christian duty; Canons on church unity and discipline). 
 - Theological analysis using covenant theology and Christology: Christ as king over all, yet exercising spiritual kingship differently than temporal rule. 
 - Practical implications: limits to coercion, role of magistrate in preserving civil peace and public religion, church duty to discipline and protect purity without wielding civil coercion for doctrinal enforcement beyond what the confessions allow.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: Belgic Confession (esp. Art. 36-37), Heidelberg Catechism (Lord's Day implications for vocation), Canons of Dort (ecclesial order). 
 - Secondary interlocutors: Calvin (two spheres), Kuyper (sphere sovereignty), Bavinck (public theology), contemporary debates about religious liberty and pluralism.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Christology (Christ's kingship), covenant theology (church and civil callings), ecclesiology (office, discipline, sacraments), doctrine of law (civil vs. divine law), doctrine of magistracy and Christian liberty, common and special grace.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - The confessional witness, as read by Bolt, insists on Christ's universal lordship while conserving distinct, covenantally ordered spheres for church and state: mutual accountability under God without fusion of offices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong confessional retrieval: Bolt foregrounds specific articles and catechetical texts rather than abstract doctrinal summaries, showing how the Three Forms balance respect for magistrate authority with ecclesial autonomy. 
 - Covenantal structuring: emphasis on offices and callings as covenantal duties, not merely functional roles.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushback against both theocratic impulses that would subordinate the magistrate to church courts and secular-liberal models that privatize religion entirely. 
 - Nuances Calvinist two-kingdom readings by integrating confessional attention to civil duty and public religion absent sectarian enforcement.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframing classic two-kingdom language in confessional idiom: "spiritual jurisdiction" vs. "civil jurisdiction" anchored in covenant obligations and public welfare rather than abstract sovereignty alone.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in confessional Reformed circles as a clarifying resource for polity and public theology; used in denominational training on church government and magistrate relations. Influential for conservative Reformed responses to modern secularism and state overreach.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides an accessible, textually grounded bridge from 17th-century confessional formulations to contemporary church-state ethics; useful for pastors, theologians, and students grappling with vocation, law, and public witness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Magistrate / civil magistracy:** civil office established by God to maintain public order and justice; limited authority in spiritual matters per confessional norms.
- **Spiritual jurisdiction / church authority:** church's competency in doctrine, sacraments, and discipline; coercion limited to ecclesiastical means.
- **Two kingdoms (or spheres):** distinction between temporal rule and spiritual rule under Christ; maintained but qualified by covenant obligations.
- **Covenant vocation / calling:** both magistrate and minister serve covenantally ordered tasks; public duties grounded in covenantal law and neighbor love.
- **Common grace / public righteousness:** non-saving gifts that uphold civil society and enable shared social goods; justifies magistrate's role in maintaining order.
- **Ecclesiastical discipline:** corrective practices administered by the church to preserve purity; not identical with civil punishment.
- **Coercive power:** legitimate for magistrate in civil justice; its use in religious enforcement is circumscribed by confessional teaching.
- **Christ's kingship:** central theological anchor that legitimates both spheres but specifies differing modes of rule.
- **Law and gospel distinction:** used to govern church discipline and to limit civil enforcement of doctrinal matters.
- **Confessional authority:** the Three Forms as normative interpretive lenses for polity and public engagement in confessional churches.
- **Sphere sovereignty (contrast):** Kuyperian idea sometimes juxtaposed - confessions agree on distinct spheres but define limits differently from Kuyper's wording.
- **Religious liberty / toleration:** treated cautiously; protections for civil conscience and order are affirmed, but not equated with modern liberal neutrality.
- **Public religion:** notion that religion bears public responsibilities for moral order and common good.
- **Subsidiarity (implicit):** smaller communities exercise apt authority unless larger public welfare requires intervention.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - Definition source: authoritative confessional reading for Reformed positions on church-state relations. 
 - Polemic tool: counters both statist imposition on churches and sectarian theocratic projects. 
 - Exegetical model: applies confessional texts to biblical passages on magistracy (e.g., Romans 13, Matthew 22) for preaching and classroom instruction.
