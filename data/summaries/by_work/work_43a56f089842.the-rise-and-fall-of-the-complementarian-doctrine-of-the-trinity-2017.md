### TITLE
The Rise and Fall of the Complementarian Doctrine of the Trinity (2017) - Kevin Giles

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid intensified post-2000 debates over gender, church order, and the doctrine of the Trinity, especially the controversy around **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** advanced by some complementarian theologians (notably Bruce Ware, Wayne Grudem).
 - Responds to a movement that adduces a doctrine of eternal, intra‑Trinitarian authority/submission to ground male headship in marriage and church.

- **Central thesis**
 - The claim that the Son is eternally subordinate in authority (a doctrine advanced to support complementarian gender roles) is a modern innovation and a doctrinal aberration. Classical orthodox Trinitarianism does not authorize ontological or eternal functional subordination.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey:
 - Traces the patristic and medieval tradition to show how classical authors (Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine, later scholastics) distinguished **economic** relations (roles in redemption-history) from **ontological** or eternal status.
 - Argues that alleged patristic precedents for eternal subordination are misread or taken out of context.
 - Doctrinal clarification:
 - Establishes the classical commitments to unity of ousia and equality of persons in attributes and authority.
 - Exposes conceptual slippage from economic subordination (Son's incarnational role) to ontological/economic-turned-eternal subordination.
 - Exegetical and theological critique:
 - Reinterprets NT texts appealed to for EFS (e.g., John, Philippians, passages on the Son's obedience) as referring to **economic** mission rather than eternal authority gradients.
 - Shows theological consequences: EFS tends toward subordinationism (doctrinally akin to Arianism) and confuses divine immutability and aseity.
 - Practical implications:
 - Argues that grounding gender hierarchies on an unorthodox Trinitarian claim is theologically illegitimate and pastorally dangerous.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Bruce Ware, Wayne Grudem, John Piper (as movement influences), and other modern complementarian writers endorsing EFS.
 - Historical interlocutors: Cappadocians, Athanasius, Augustine, scholastics, Reformers (Augustinian and Calvinist streams).
 - Uses patristic texts, creeds, and classic theological categories (ousia, hypostasis, perichoresis).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (central)
 - Christology (incarnation and obedience)
 - Authority and order (intra‑Trinitarian and ecclesial)
 - Soteriology and economy of redemption (as locus for functional distinctions)
 - Indirectly: anthropology and gender theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Giles locates the theological center of gravity in a classical, creedal Trinity where **ontological equality of the persons** is non‑negotiable and all subordination language belongs to the economy of salvation, not to the immanent, eternal relations of the Godhead.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Meticulous historical-theological corrective: demonstrates how modern EFS advocates selectively read patristic and medieval sources.
 - Emphasizes the analytical distinction between **economic** and **immanent** Trinity as decisive for the debate.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects contemporary complementarian claims by:
 - Arguing that appeals to "eternal authority" in the Trinity misapply texts about mission and incarnation.
 - Contrasting EFS with classical anti‑subordination positions (Athanasius, Cappadocians).
 - Contrasts with social‑Trinitarian proposals only insofar as Giles defends classical orthodoxy rather than constructing a novel social ontology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and defends precise use of terms (e.g., ousia vs hypostasis, economic vs immanent) against loose usage in recent polemics.
 - Frames EFS as a doctrinal movement with genealogical and rhetorical features (rise and potential decline).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited by egalitarian theologians and historians defending orthodox Trinitarianism.
 - Provoked sustained rebuttals from complementarian proponents; became a focal text in ongoing intra‑evangelical disputes.
 - Strengthened historical-theological standards in the debate by shifting burden of proof onto EFS advocates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective in teaching Trinitarian doctrine, especially for clarifying how christological and soteriological texts relate to immanent Trinitarian theology.
 - Models rigorous use of historical sources against theological innovation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - The claim that the Son is eternally subject in authority to the Father; Giles argues this is a modern innovation and theologically dangerous.
- **Economic Trinity** - The relations and roles of Father, Son, Spirit in salvation history; Giles insists subordination language is properly economic.
- **Immanent Trinity** - The internal, eternal relations of the Godhead; Giles defends the classical claim of equality here.
- **Ontological equality** - Equality in being, attributes, and divine life shared by the three persons; opposed to any eternal subordination.
- **Subordinationism** - Historical heresy (e.g., Arian tendencies) asserting inferiority of the Son; used to warn against EFS slide.
- **Ousia / Hypostasis** - Classical categories (essence/substance vs person); Giles reaffirms precise usage against equivocation by modern authors.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling of the persons; invoked to show relational equality and unity.
- **Monarchy of the Father** - Classical affirmation of the Father as "source" (monarchia) of the Godhead; Giles shows this does not imply authority hierarchy.
- **Economic vs. ontological distinction** - Central methodological tool Giles uses to reallocate texts of submission to the economic sphere.
- **Authority (intra‑Trinitarian)** - Distinguished from function/role; Giles warns that treating authority as ontologically graded destabilizes divine simplicity and unity.
- **Patristic precedent** - Giles' deployment of early church texts to test modern claims.
- **Complementarian appeal** - The use of Trinitarian claims to ground ecclesial/marital headship; the primary target of the book.
- **Exegetical loci** - Key NT passages (e.g., John, Philippians 2, I Corinthians 15) reinterpreted as economic, not eternal, subordination evidence.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **historical-definition source** clarifying classical Trinitarian vocabulary against modern misreadings.
 - As a **polemic** and primary rebuttal in gender/ordination debates where EFS is deployed.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading obedience/submission texts in their economic context rather than as proof texts for ontological claims.
