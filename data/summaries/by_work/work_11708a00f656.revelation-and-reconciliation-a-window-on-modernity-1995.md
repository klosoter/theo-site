### TITLE
**Revelation and Reconciliation: A Window on Modernity (1995)** - Stephen Williams

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Written in the mid-1990s by a conservative Reformed theologian wrestling with late modern/post-enlightenment culture. 
 - Positioned within postwar Reformed conversations about doctrine, epistemology, and cultural engagement; dialogue with figures such as Calvin, Barth, Torrance, and modern critics of Christian confession.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The proper doctrine of revelation - understood as divine self-disclosure that reconciles sinners to God - offers the most adequate critique and corrective to modernity's epistemic and moral errors. Central motif: revelation is both **accommodation** and analogically **incarnational**.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnosis: modernity presumes autonomous reason and a privatized faith, producing secularization and distorted categories for knowing God. 
 - Proposal: reclaim a Reformed account of revelation that emphasizes divine condescension (accommodation) and the incarnational model for how God communicates without destroying creaturely difference. 
 - Method: careful retrieval of classical Christological and covenantal resources to show how revelation mediates reconciliation and grounds ethical and epistemic life. 
 - Implications: theological epistemology, exegesis, and public theology must be retooled so that Christ-centered revelation governs how the church interprets Scripture, culture, and reason.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Historical: Calvin (incarnational motifs, accommodation), classical Reformation covenantalists. 
 - Twentieth-century interlocutors: Karl Barth (revelation-priority), T. F. Torrance (incarnational epistemology), critics of liberal theology and secular modernity. 
 - Broader cultural theorists indirectly - readings of modernity and secularization as background.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Revelation** (special and general), **Christology** (incarnation as model for disclosure), **atonement/reconciliation**, **covenant**, epistemology (how we know God), ecclesiology (church as witness), and the doctrine of divine condescension/accommodation.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** 
 - Revelation must be read as God's reconciliatory accommodation in and through the incarnate Word; this incarnational paradigm both corrects modernity's pretensions and supplies the theological grammar necessary for faithful Christian engagement with the world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Treats **accommodation** not as mere pedagogical lowering but as an intrinsically incarnational and reconciling mode of divine speech - preserving divine otherness while enabling genuine human knowledge. 
 - Argues for a unified theological posture: revelation and reconciliation belong together; to know God truly is to be drawn into reconciled relationship.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects liberal tendencies that domesticate revelation into cultural or moral insights by insisting on objective, Christ-centered disclosure. 
 - Modifies some readings of Barth and Torrance by insisting that accommodation must protect creaturely finitude without lapsing into privatized relativism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clarifies and reframes **incarnational analogy** as a methodological principle for theology (not merely a Christological claim): how God's being-with preserves distinction while enabling truth-bearing communication. 
 - Tightens the relation between *accommodation* and *reconciliation* as reciprocal: God accommodates to heal, and reconciliation validates accommodation.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely respected among conservative Reformed circles for sharpening doctrine of revelation; used in seminary courses on epistemology and doctrine of revelation. 
 - Cited in debates over public theology and the legitimacy of theological critique of modern secular assumptions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a concise, theologically robust corrective to both liberal accommodation and triumphalist apologetics; durable resource for courses on revelation, Christology, and theology-culture engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation** - God's condescending manner of speech and action so finite creatures can receive revelation; emphasized as reconciliatory rather than capitulatory. 
- **Incarnational Analogy** - The methodological and Christological principle that God's communication mirrors the mode of the Incarnation: union without confusion, presence without absorption. 
- **Revelation (special & general)** - Special revelation (Scripture/Christ) prioritized; general revelation acknowledged but subordinate and read through Christ. 
- **Reconciliation** - The soteriological goal that governs disclosure; revelation is salvific, not merely informative. 
- **Condescension / Divine Humility** - Not weakness but divine modus operandi for making knowledge of God possible. 
- **Finitude / Creaturely Difference** - The theological constraint that revelation must respect; key to avoiding assimilation into culture. 
- **Christocentrism** - The interpretive rule: Christ as hermeneutical center for Scripture, culture, and reason. 
- **Covenant Framework** - Social and relational rubric for God-human dealings; accommodation functions within covenantal promises. 
- **Epistemic Reform** - A call to reorder how theology conceives knowledge of God in light of revelation-incarnation. 
- **Secular Modernity / Secularization** - Diagnosed as a problem of autonomy and privatization that theology must address. 
- **Analogy vs. Identity** - Stresses analogy (God-without-becoming-creature) rather than identity or mere metaphor in divine-human relation. 
- **Hermeneutic of Faith** - Advocates a confessionally shaped reading of Scripture and culture that presumes revelation.
- **Public Theology** - Suggests how revelation-informed theology can critique and witness within modern public life.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition source** for "accommodation" and for the functional meaning of "incarnational analogy" in theological method. 
- As a **polemic** against both liberal assimilation and anti-intellectualist reactions to modernity. 
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** for reading Scripture Christocentrically and for structuring theological engagement with culture and epistemology.
