### TITLE
Keep in Step with the Spirit (new ed.)
Author: J. I. Packer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑to‑late 20th‑century conservative evangelical/Reformed milieu; pastoral‑theological response to both legalism and experiential extremes of renewal movements.
 - Pastoral‑academic tone aimed at laity and ministers; shaped by Packer's high regard for Scripture, historical orthodoxy, and pastoral clarity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sanctification is the Spirit‑wrought, gospel‑grounded transformation of the believer: genuine moral change that issues from union with Christ and reliance on the Spirit, not merely human effort or ecstatic experience.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of the biblical data on the Spirit and sanctification (esp. Pauline material such as Romans and Galatians).
 - Diagnosis of two errors: moralism (salvation by effort) and license/antinomianism (denial of ethical fruit).
 - Positive account: how the indwelling Spirit effects mortification (putting sin to death) and vivification (renewal of life) through means of grace.
 - Practical prescriptions for "walking by the Spirit": prayer, Scripture, means of grace, church life, discipline, and vigilance against temptation.
 - Pastoral assurance: how believers may know the Spirit's work and persevere.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis (Pauline corpus foregrounded).
 - Implicit dialogue with pietism, legalistic moralism, Keswick/Keswickism, some charismatic emphases, and mid‑century liberal moralism.
 - Draws on Reformed confessions and classic writers (Calvinian themes of union with Christ and grace), but written in plain evangelical idiom.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Holy Spirit (person, indwelling, filling), sanctification, justification (relation to sanctification), union with Christ, mortification/vivification, assurance, means of grace, ecclesiology insofar as corporate means matter.

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - The Christian life is primarily a Spirit‑led pilgrimage: true holiness is the patient, grace‑enabled fruit of union with Christ rather than moral self‑engineering or ecstatic sensationalism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Analogy of "keeping in step" (Gal. 5:25) as a practical rule: sanctification is patterned, continuous conformity under the Spirit's leadership.
 - Integrates doctrinal precision with pastoral practicality-does theology in order to shepherd.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on moralistic religiosity that reduces sanctification to effort and on antinomian or purely experiential views that decouple holiness from Scripture and doctrine.
 - Moderates charismatic excess: affirms Spirit's present work without endorsing unscriptural claims or disregarding means of grace and ecclesial order.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear pairing of mortification and vivification as Spirit‑work consequences of union with Christ.
 - Practical phraseology (e.g., "keeping in step") that reframes sanctification as ongoing, relational obedience rather than episodic achievement.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative evangelical and Reformed circles as a concise handbook on sanctification.
 - Influential among pastors, Bible‑study leaders, and seminarians for its blend of doctrine and practice; cited frequently in pastoral and catechetical contexts.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Reliable, scripture‑rooted guide to sanctification that balances theology and praxis.
 - Useful corrective to both legalism and experiential excess, and a durable model for preaching on Spirit and holiness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive, Spirit‑enabled moral and spiritual transformation grounded in justification and union with Christ.
- **Holy Spirit**
 - Personal agent of sanctification: indwelling, empowering, guiding, convicting, and producing fruit.
- **Walking/Keeping in step with the Spirit**
 - Ongoing relational obedience; practical metaphor for daily conformity to Spirit's lead.
- **Mortification**
 - Putting sin to death by the Spirit's power (practical disciplines, repentance).
- **Vivification**
 - Renewal of life and virtues by the Spirit (growth in holiness and grace).
- **Union with Christ**
 - Ontological root of sanctification; source of both justification and sanctifying power.
- **Filling of the Spirit vs. Indwelling**
 - Indwelling = permanent presence of Spirit; filling = repeated, situational empowering for obedience and ministry.
- **Means of grace**
 - Scripture, prayer, sacraments/ordinances, church discipline and fellowship as channels through which the Spirit works.
- **Assurance**
 - Evidences of Spirit‑work (fruit, perseverance, trust) that ground pastoral confidence without presumption.
- **Legalism**
 - Rejected: reliance on human effort or law observance as basis or model for sanctification.
- **Antinomianism/license**
 - Rejected: denial that sanctification necessarily follows justification.
- **Gospel‑centered holiness**
 - Holiness rooted in received mercy and grace, not performance.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a succinct doctrinal definition and pastoral manual for sanctification in systematic and practical theology courses.
 - As polemic against both moralistic and anti‑moral strands of Christian practice; a mediating model between doctrinal fidelity and spiritual vitality.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Pauline texts on the Spirit (Romans 6-8; Galatians 5) and a conceptual pivot linking Spirit‑theology to pastoral practice.
