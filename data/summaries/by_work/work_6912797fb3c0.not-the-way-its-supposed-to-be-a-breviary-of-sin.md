### TITLE
Not the Way It's Supposed to Be: A Breviary of Sin - Cornelius Plantinga Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed theological/pastoral milieu; written for scholars, pastors, and laity seeking a renewed language for sin after decades of minimization in popular piety and some academic theology.
 - Interdisciplinary tone: theological, pastoral, psychological, and cultural diagnosis.

- **Central thesis**
 - Sin is not primarily a list of prohibited acts but a pervasive disordering of creation and human loves - a condition, habit, and network of structures that makes life "not the way it's supposed to be." Understanding sin requires moral, ontological, communal, and pastoral categories.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Short, meditative entries that move from description to diagnosis to pastoral response.
 - Major moves:
 - Define sin in varied registers: personal acts, inner dispositions, habitual vices, and social/structural sin.
 - Diagnose how sin distorts vocation, relationships, institutions, and the created order.
 - Clarify theological anthropology: humans as creatures called to ordered loves but liable to disordered attending, desiring, and acting.
 - Articulate pastoral responses: lament, confession, repentance, communal accountability, and the restorative work of grace.
 - Emphasis on narrative and imagistic description rather than abstract propositional system-building.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine and classical Christian hamartiology (disordered loves), Reformed resources (Calvinist emphases on depravity and grace), and modern moral psychology/virtue ethics.
 - Engages contemporary pastors and counselors with attention to modern cultural tendencies (therapeutic and moralistic downplaying of sin).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Hamartiology (sin as state, act, condition)
 - Anthropology (disordered loves; image of God as wounded but retained)
 - Soteriology implicitly (need for repentance and grace; Christ as reordering agent)
 - Ecclesiology and social ethics (corporate/structural sin and communal repentance)
 - Eschatological horizon implied: sin's defeat points toward restoration of shalom.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically, Plantinga locates sin as the pervasive disorder of created ends and loves - a diagnosis that makes repentance, communal responsibility, and Christ's restorative grace indispensable.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sin framed as disorder of loves and purposes rather than merely legal transgression; accessible, imagistic language (hence "breviary").
 - Explicit bridging of private sin and public/structural sin: personal vices sustain and are sustained by social structures.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both moralistic reductionism (sin as rule-breaking only) and therapeutic minimization (sin as merely psychological problem).
 - Corrects pietistic privatization of sin by reasserting corporate and institutional dimensions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses everyday metaphors and pastoral categories to render classical hamartiology usable for modern congregations.
 - Treats sin simultaneously as: act, habit, condition, and structure - a multi-level taxonomy that resists reductionism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries, pastoral workshops, and small-group curricula; praised for clarity and pastoral utility.
 - Influential in renewing serious pastoral attention to sin without falling into moralism; adopted by those wanting a robust but non-technical hamartiology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, teachable introduction to sin that integrates doctrine, pastoral practice, and cultural critique.
 - Remains a go-to text for pastors and teachers seeking language to confess corporate sins and to form communities of repentance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sin** - pervasive disorder; not chiefly a rule-break but a corruption of created ends and loves.
- **Disordered loves** - central moral anthropology: sin is what happens when loves are misdirected or excessive.
- **State / Habit / Act / Structure** - four complementary levels at which sin operates (ontological, dispositional, behavioral, institutional).
- **Original sin** - background condition making persons susceptible to disordered loves; emphasized without deterministic flattening.
- **Personal sin** - concrete acts and vices that reveal and reinforce disordered loves.
- **Social/structural sin** - systemic patterns and institutions that embody and perpetuate injustice and vice.
- **Guilt and shame** - affective consequences of sin; Plantinga treats both as indicators that require pastoral wisdom.
- **Repentance (metanoia)** - reorientation of loves; central remedial practice.
- **Grace and forgiveness** - corrective and restorative acts of God through Christ that reorder loves.
- **Lament and confession** - communal practices the book encourages to name and reckon with sin.
- **Vocation / shalom** - theological telos: human callings and creation's intended peace that sin disrupts.
- **Breviary** - form: short, reflective entries designed for repeated reading and pastoral use.
- **Pastoral hamartiology** - the work's genre: theology of sin geared to pastoral formation and congregational life.
- **Virtue/vice language** - used to connect sin to character formation and moral therapy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for hamartiology in courses and sermons (accessible taxonomy of sin).
 - As a **pastoral and pedagogical model** for teaching confession, communal repentance, and integrating personal and structural analyses.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over individual vs. corporate sin, virtue ethics vs. legal paradigms, and the pastoral handling of guilt and shame.
