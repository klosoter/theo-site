### TITLE
Thinking About God: First Steps in Philosophy - Gregory E. Ganssle

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic introduction to philosophy of religion (early 21st century pedagogical milieu).
 - Aimed at undergraduates and beginning students; situated within Anglo‑American analytic theology and philosophy of religion rather than confessional systematic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Equip readers with conceptual tools to analyze classical theistic claims; treat the **problem of evil** (theodicy and divine justice) as the central litmus test for philosophical theism.
 - Emphasizes that clear argumentation, careful distinctions, and recognition of evidential limits are essential first steps.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Provides modular treatments of standard questions: existence of God, divine attributes, divine action and providence, and theodicy.
 - On theodicy specifically:
 - Distinguishes the **logical** from the **evidential** problem of evil.
 - Surveys major responses: **free will defense** (libertarian freedom), **soul‑making** (Hickian development), and **skeptical theism** (limits on human epistemic access to divine reasons).
 - Examines implications for **divine justice**: how divine goodness and justice can coexist with apparently gratuitous suffering.
 - Uses analytic tools: thought experiments, reductio arguments, epistemic modesty, and burden‑of‑proof clarifications.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Standard interlocutors in contemporary debates: J. L. Mackie, Alvin Plantinga, William Rowe, John Hick, and contemporary skeptical theists.
 - Also draws on classical theistic material (Aquinas, Augustinian lines) for background definitions of attributes.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine attributes** (omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence), **providence**, **divine justice**, **human freedom**, and **eschatological rectification** as part of theodical responses.
 - Less emphasis on systematic loci like Trinity or Christology; focus remains philosophical rather than doctrinal exposition.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Ganssle situates philosophical theism as plausibly compatible with human moral experience only when one combines analytic rigor with epistemic humility about divine reasons for suffering.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Pedagogical clarity: prioritizes conceptual distinctions (logical vs evidential, moral vs natural evil) as tools for theological engagement.
 - Stresses the practical role of **epistemic modesty**-that many theodical stalemates reflect limits of human perspective, not decisive defeat of theism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Less doctrinally committed than classical scholastic defenses; contrasts with dogmatic assurance in traditional theodicies by foregrounding epistemic constraints and argument structure.
 - More accessible and less technical than full analytic monographs (e.g., Plantinga) while still faithfully representing their moves.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No radical new theodical theory; notable for systematic framing and for recommending a pluralistic toolkit: free will defense, soul‑making, skeptical theism can be combined rather than treated as exclusive.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as an introductory text in philosophy of religion and in theology departments seeking a clear, analytic primer on theodicy.
 - Respected across denominational lines for neutrality and clarity; used in evangelical classrooms for training in apologetics and philosophy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as an entry point for students to engage theodicy with analytic rigor and theological sensitivity; serves as a primer for further study in both analytic theology and pastoral reflection on suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodicy**
 - Philosophical attempt to justify God's goodness and justice in light of evil and suffering.
- **Problem of evil**
 - Twofold: **logical** (is God and evil logically incompatible?) and **evidential** (does the amount and character of evil count as evidence against God?).
- **Free will defense**
 - Explains moral evil as a byproduct of valuable libertarian freedom; often traces to Plantinga's work.
- **Soul‑making theodicy**
 - (Hickian) argues that suffering contributes to moral and spiritual development; addresses value of certain kinds of evil.
- **Skeptical theism**
 - Epistemic response: human beings lack standpoint to judge God's reasons; used to block evidential arguments from evil.
- **Divine attributes**
 - Precise analytic definitions of omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence; used to test coherence with kinds of evil.
- **Divine justice**
 - Concerned with fairness and retributive/restorative aspects of God's moral governance; tied to eschatological vindication in theodical accounts.
- **Natural vs moral evil**
 - Distinction clarifies different justificatory strategies (soul‑making often targets natural evil; free will targets moral evil).
- **Evidential argument from evil**
 - Probabilistic claim that the observed distribution/intensity of suffering makes God's existence unlikely.
- **Logical argument from evil**
 - Claims an explicit contradiction between God's attributes and the existence of evil; largely treated as defeated by Plantinga‑style defenses.
- **Omnipotence puzzles**
 - Discussions of whether God can do the logically impossible, and implications for preventing certain evils.
- **Eschatological compensation**
 - The idea that future goods (justice, eschatological reconciliation) can factor into theodical explanations.
- **Burden of proof & epistemic modesty**
 - Clarification of who must show what; Ganssle emphasizes careful assignment of evidential burdens.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: clear, student‑level glosses of technical distinctions in theodicy.
 - As a **pedagogical model**: exemplary way to teach analytic methods in theological ethics and philosophy of religion.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: a neutral survey writers cite when summarizing major theodical moves before deploying more systematic or confessional arguments.
