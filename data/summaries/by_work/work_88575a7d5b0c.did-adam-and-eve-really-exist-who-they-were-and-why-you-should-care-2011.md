### TITLE
Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? Who They Were and Why You Should Care (C. John Collins, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2011 amid renewed evangelical debate over Genesis 1-11, human origins, and theistic evolution. Engages both conservative Reformed readers and publics influenced by scientific narratives (e.g., population genetics, evolution).
- **Central thesis**
 - **Adam and Eve were real, historical persons whose existence as federal representatives is essential to biblical teaching about sin, covenant, and Christ.** Denying their historicity undermines core doctrines (original sin, imputation, Christ as second Adam).
 - (Collins 2011 - Historicity And Federal Headship Of Adam)
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Genesis and key New Testament texts (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) to show textual commitment to a single first human pair and corporate headship.
 - Theological consequence: links historical Adam to doctrines of sin, guilt, and redemption; explains the necessity of a real Adam for the typological pairing with Christ.
 - Scientific engagement: examines population genetics, paleontology, and methodological limits of scientific inference about origins; argues that current scientific claims do not decisively rule out a historical couple and that hermeneutics must not be subordinated to provisional scientific models.
 - Hermeneutics: criticizes purely literary or non-historical readings of Genesis; insists on disciplined exegesis and warning against harmonizing Scripture to contemporary science.
 - Pastoral implications: defends teaching of original sin and human responsibility rooted in a historical Adam.
 - (Collins 2011 - Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11)
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages scripture (OT and NT), classical Reformed sources on federal headship, contemporary voices: theistic evolution proponents, John Walton-style functional readings, and popular scientific claims about human origins.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, anthropology (image of God), original sin, imputation, covenant/federal theology, revelation and authority, the relation of biblical theology to natural science.
- **Closing line**
 - Collins frames the historical Adam as the theological linchpin: without a real first human pair functioning as corporate heads, core soteriological and covenantal claims of Scripture lose their coherence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes careful grammatical-historical exegesis of Genesis and Pauline texts over sweeping appeals to current scientific consensus.
 - Couples theological necessity (federal headship) with careful interaction with empirical data rather than simple literalism or capitulation to science.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both Young Earth literalism that ignores legitimate scientific findings and theistic-evolution stances that make historicity of Adam optional or allegorical.
 - Pushes back on John Walton-style "functional ontology" when it is used to dissolve historical acts into purely cultic or functional descriptions.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reframes debate from "science vs. Bible" to "hermeneutics vs. interpretation shaped by extra-biblical presuppositions" - insists on exegetical primacy while allowing science to inform models of how God enacted creation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed circles as a moderate-conservative corrective to non-historicist readings; engaged critically by both theistic evolution advocates and young-earth proponents.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined template for integrating exegesis, theology, and scientific conversation without capitulating doctrinal essentials - useful for seminary teaching, pastoral guidance, and academic apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historical Adam** - Adam as a real, individual first man whose existence anchors biblical anthropology and soteriology. (Collins 2011 - Historicity And Federal Headship Of Adam)
- **Federal headship** - Adam as representative/corporate head whose action affects the whole human polity; necessary for the typology of Christ as second Adam.
- **Original sin** - The doctrine tied to an historical fall; Collins argues its intelligibility depends on real human agents.
- **Imputation** - Forensic transfer of the guilt/condemnation from Adam to humanity and of righteousness from Christ to believers.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - Treated as intrinsic to human ontology; linked to both creation and covenant identity.
- **Days of creation** - Survey of interpretive options (24-hour, day-age, literary/framework); Collins presses exegetical indicators and warns against simplistic concordism. (Collins 2011 - Days Of Creation)
 - Sub-note: insists Genesis communicates historical acts while genre and intent matter for precise chronology.
- **Concordism** - The attempt to force Scripture into modern scientific frameworks; Collins critiques uncritical concordism.
- **Methodological naturalism** - Discussed as the operative method of science; Collins stresses its limits for ruling theological claims in/out.
- **Population genetics** - Treated as an important empirical input but not a decisive hermeneutical trump; Collins argues models depend on assumptions and do not nullify the possibility of a historical couple. (Collins 2011 - Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11)
- **Hermeneutics of Genesis** - Emphasis on grammar, literary context, canonical reading, and Pauline reception.
- **Typology** - Adam-Christ typology as central to Pauline soteriology.
- **Genre / literary form** - Collins analyzes genre to guard against misreading poetic or theological elements as non-historical claims.
- **Covenant anthropology** - Human identity framed by covenantal representation beginning with Adam.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for conservative evangelical affirmation of a historical Adam and federal headship.
- As a **polemic** against non-historicist theologies (some strands of theistic evolution; radical literary readings) while avoiding simplistic science-rejection.
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating Genesis 1-11 exegesis with systematic theology and cautious scientific engagement.
