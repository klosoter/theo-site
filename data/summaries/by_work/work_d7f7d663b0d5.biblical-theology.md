### TITLE
**John Owen, Biblical Theology** 
Latin: Theologoumena Pantodapa; published 1661. A post-Reformation Reformed work tracing the nature, origin, progress, and study of true theology from Adam to Christ.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 1661, early Restoration England; Independent Puritan leader writing within high Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Milieu: anti-Socinian and anti-Roman polemics; mature federal (covenant) theology; scholastic method serving exegetical aims.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To demonstrate that Christian doctrine arises from the progressive history of special revelation culminating in Christ, under Scripture's self-attesting authority, and administered by the Spirit within the covenants.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Nature of theology: archetypal vs ectypal knowledge of God; natural vs supernatural revelation.
 - Origin of theology: from Eden; fall and the promise; earliest worship and sacrifices.
 - Progress of revelation: Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, prophetic economies; the Jewish church's doctrine, worship, and polity.
 - Fulfillment in Christ: person and offices, typology realized; apostolic doctrine as the canon's capstone.
 - Languages and interpretation: Hebrew as the primary instrument; rules for exegesis; divine accommodation in anthropomorphic and historical modes.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Allies: Calvin, Junius (archetypal-ectypal), Ames, Polanus; federal emphases akin to Cocceius yet more restrained.
 - Opponents: Socinus and the Racovian tradition; Bellarmine and Roman appeals to unwritten tradition; Arminian soteriology.
 - Uses patristic witnesses (esp. Augustine) and rabbinic materials critically.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture:** inspiration, canonicity, self-attestation, accommodation.
 - **Covenant theology:** works, grace, and redemption; Israel's economy and typology.
 - **Theology proper and decree:** providence, election and reprobation ordered to covenant realization.
 - **Christology:** eternal Sonship, incarnation, mediatorial offices; active and passive obedience.
 - **Soteriology:** necessity and nature of atonement; definite intention; Spirit's regeneration and indwelling promised in the new covenant.
- **Closing line**
 - The work's center of gravity: Christ the mediator, promised and typified from the beginning, revealed authoritatively in Scripture, applied by the Spirit to the elect through the covenant of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - A pre-Vos history-of-revelation that is thoroughly covenantal and typological while remaining scholastically precise.
 - Strong linguistic-philological interest in Hebrew as God's chosen vehicle of early revelation.
 - Clear deployment of archetypal-ectypal theology to discipline claims about God and Scripture.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Rome: denies parity of unwritten traditions; Scripture is autopistos and sufficient.
 - Against Socinians: affirms Trinitarian and Christological orthodoxy, penal satisfaction, and the Spirit's supernatural work.
 - Against Arminians: grounds salvation in unconditional election and a definite atonement.
 - Nuances Cocceian dispersion by guarding unity of the covenant of grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Incarnational analogy for Scripture's accommodation: divine truth in fully human words without loss of inerrant authority.
 - Tight integration of Christ's threefold office with Israel's institutions as typological pedagogy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Under-acknowledged precursor to later biblical theology; retrieved in modern Reformed scholarship.
 - Feeds confessional treatments of Scripture (autopistos, internal testimony), covenant, and atonement.
- **Enduring value**
 - A model for reading Scripture canonically and historically without sacrificing dogmatic clarity.
 - A bridge text for students moving between exegesis, history-of-revelation, and systematics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Archetypal vs Ectypal Theology**: God's self-knowledge vs our accommodated, finite participation; curbs rationalism and speculation.
- **Accommodation**: The Spirit's condescension in human language, genres, and history; safeguards inerrancy amid anthropomorphism.
- **Autopistos (Self-attestation of Scripture)**: Scripture's intrinsic authority, received by the Spirit's internal testimony.
 - Contrasts with externalist appeals to church authority.
- **Covenant of Works**: Adamic probation under law; frames guilt and need for a mediator.
- **Covenant of Grace**: Unified, progressively revealed promise administered across dispensations, fulfilled in Christ.
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption)**: Intra-Trinitarian foundation for election and definite atonement.
- **Election and Reprobation**: Divine decrees ordering history and covenant administration; assures efficacy of grace.
- **Typology**: God-ordained correspondences (priest, temple, sacrifice) culminating in Christ's person and work.
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**: The Son's eternal generation distinguished from his temporal assumption of flesh and office.
- **Active and Passive Obedience**: Christ's lifelong law-keeping and atoning sufferings together imputed to believers.
- **Penal Satisfaction and Extent**: Necessity of atonement grounded in divine justice; intention definite toward the elect.
- **Prophet, Priest, King**: Christ's mediatorial offices prefigured in Israel, perfected in the new covenant.
- **Regeneration and Indwelling**: The Spirit's effectual new birth and abiding presence promised in Jeremiah/Ezekiel and realized at Pentecost.
- **Progress of Revelation**: From protoevangelium to apostolic witness; unity-in-diversity across dispensations.
- **Hebrew Philology**: The role of the sacred tongue in early revelation and exegesis.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a covenantal, typological exegetical model for OT-NT unity.
 - As a prolegomenon to Scripture's authority and interpretation in Reformed dogmatics.
 - As a conceptual bridge linking decree, covenant, and Christology for soteriology.
 - As polemical support against Socinian and Arminian reductions of atonement and grace.
