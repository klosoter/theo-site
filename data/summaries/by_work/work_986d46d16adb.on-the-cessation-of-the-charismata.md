### TITLE
On the Cessation of the Charismata - Jon Ruthven

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed conversation over charismatic renewal (late 20th-21st c.). Positioned within pastoral and seminary debates about gifts, ecclesial order, and Scripture's sufficiency.
 - Responds to robust continuationist claims in popular and academic circles while engaging classic Reformed and evangelical cessationist literature.

- **Central thesis**
 - The charismatic "charismata" of the apostolic age - specifically the revelatory and revelatory-adjacent gifts that authenticated apostolic office and Scripture (e.g., revelatory prophecy, authenticating tongues, apostolic-sign miracles) - have ceased with the close of the apostolic era. Contemporary claims to identical revelatory authority are therefore theologically and ecclesiologically unsustainable.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical case
 - Close readings of key passages (1 Cor 12-14; Eph 4:7-16; 2 Cor 12; Heb) to show the function of gifts as foundation/authentication.
 - Distinguishes normative, non-foundational gifts (teaching, exhortation, mercy) from foundational, revelatory sign-gifts.
 - Theological-historical case
 - Argues that the purpose of certain gifts was tied to apostolic commissioning and the establishment of the canon; historical trajectory shows decline of verifiable revelatory gifts after apostles.
 - Doctrinal and pastoral implications
 - Affirms canonical closedness and sufficiency of Scripture as normative for doctrine and practice.
 - Proposes pastoral caution toward modern miraculous claims and an ecclesial focus on ordinary means of grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical cessationist writers (e.g., B. B. Warfield), Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin, Owen) and major continuationists (e.g., Gordon D. Fee, Wayne Grudem, John W. MacArthur as interlocutor on modern cessationism).
 - Appeals to early church history and modern empirical assessment of miraculous claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (gifts, witness, role of Spirit post-apostolic era)
 - Revelation (special revelation, canon, prophetic function)
 - Ecclesiology (authority, order, discernment)
 - Soteriology/Christology implicitly via apostolic foundation and the unity of the faith

- **Closing line**
 - The work locates its theological center on the interplay of apostolic authentication, canonical sufficiency, and prudent pastoral practice: the extraordinary charismata fulfilled a foundational, time-limited role and should not be equated with ongoing normative ecclesial authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear functional distinction between *foundational/revelatory* gifts (temporary) and *ministerial/ordinary* gifts (ongoing).
 - Pastoral hermeneutic: theological conclusions are operationalized into concrete ecclesial practices for discernment and discipline.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against continuationists who treat New Testament charismatic practice as permanently normative without qualifying the apostolic context.
 - Refines classical cessationism by carefully differentiating types of gifts rather than a blanket dismissal of all miraculous activity.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the term **authentication paradigm**: certain gifts served primarily to authenticate the apostolate and revelation rather than to constitute perpetual normative practice.
 - Uses a worked distinction: **revelatory-charismata** vs **ministerial-charismata** to avoid polar extremes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Receives attention in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a readable, pastorally-minded statement for cessationist conviction.
 - Used by pastors and seminary instructors as a concise defense of canonical sufficiency and gift-criticism in congregational contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an exegetically anchored, historically informed, pastorally responsible resource for teaching on gifts.
 - Useful for bridging academic theology and parish-level practice: aids discernment without merely polemicizing.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Charismata**
 - Generic: "gifts" of the Spirit; Ruthven insists on parsing types and functions.
- **Cessationism**
 - The claim that certain charismata ceased; Ruthven articulates a nuanced, functional cessationism.
- **Continuationism**
 - Opposing position; treated as interlocutor and qualified in debate rather than simply caricatured.
- **Revelatory-charismata**
 - Gifts that conveyed new, authoritative revelation or authenticated apostolic office (e.g., revelatory prophecy, certain sign miracles).
- **Ministerial-charismata**
 - Gifts that build and sustain church life without conveying new revelation (e.g., teaching, mercy, administration).
- **Authentication paradigm**
 - Framework: gifts as signs that authenticated the apostolic message and ministry.
- **Canonical sufficiency**
 - The doctrine that Scripture is sufficient and closed; used to rule out ongoing revelatory authority.
- **Apostolic foundation**
 - Ephesians 2:20 motif: apostles/prophets as foundational, implying temporality of certain gifts.
- **Discernment / pastoral prudence**
 - Practical categories for examining contemporary charismatic claims.
- **Extraordinary vs ordinary means of grace**
 - Distinguishes the rare, validating extraordinary gifts from ordinary means that sustain faith.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for functional/qualified cessationism in systematic treatments of pneumatology.
 - As a **polemic and pastoral manual** against uncritical acceptance of modern revelatory claims in congregational life.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians and Ephesians with attention to historical function of gifts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on canon, ecclesiology, and spiritual gifts emphasizing the link between apostolicity and canonical closure.
