### TITLE
Brian Davies, The Thought of Thomas Aquinas (secondary) - reading Thomas Aquinas through a contemporary analytic and historical lens. (Primary subject: Thomas Aquinas) 
Site usage: Davies treats **Faith and Repentance** (on Thomistic moral and sacramental theology) and **Divine Knowledge / Middle Knowledge and Molinism** (on providence and predestination).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century analytic-historical engagement with medieval theology; intent to render Aquinas intelligible to modern philosophy of religion and systematic theology.
 - Moves between careful historical exegesis of Thomistic texts and conceptual reconstruction for contemporary debates.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Davies argues that Aquinas offers a coherent, distinctive synthesis of metaphysics, epistemology, and Christian doctrine such that questions about faith, repentance, providence, and freedom are best understood within his metaphysical commitments (divine simplicity, causality, distinction of essence and existence).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Aquinas's metaphysics (being, act/potency, essence/existence) as the foundation.
 - Application to divine attributes: **simplicity, immutability, eternity, omniscience**.
 - Consequences for human action and salvation: how virtues (faith, charity), repentance, and sacraments operate as caused by and ordered to final beatitude.
 - Critical engagement with modern alternatives (e.g., Molinist scientia media), showing tensions with Thomistic commitments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, De Veritate, Quaestiones Disputatae).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Molina and Molinism on middle knowledge; contemporary analytic theologians on divine foreknowledge and freedom.
 - Historical contrasts with Augustine, Aristotle, and later scholastics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and assent (faith as infused virtue), moral theology (repentance, contrition), sacraments (penance), providence and predestination, divine knowledge and simplicity, free will and contingent future events.

- **Closing line**
 - Davies presents Aquinas as a metaphysically rigorous Christian thinker whose account of divine knowledge and human moral formation coheres only if one accepts his central metaphysical claims - making those claims the theological center of gravity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the centrality of **divine simplicity** as explanatorily decisive: many Thomistic moves (against Molinism, on providence) hinge on it.
 - Emphasizes the *causal* ordering of grace, virtues, and sacraments rather than purely voluntaristic or legal categories.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts Aquinas with Molina: Davies highlights Aquinas's rejection of scientia media on grounds that it posits truths (counterfactuals of freedom) independent of divine willing and thus undercuts simplicity.
 - Clarifies Augustine-Aristotelian roots against modern voluntarist or purely compatibilist readings.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys contemporary analytic distinctions (e.g., modal semantics for counterfactuals, precise notions of knowledge types) to restate medieval claims without distorting them.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Thomistic revival and analytic theology as a bridge text; influential among Catholic theologians and across confessional lines where metaphysical Thomism is considered.
 - Provokes renewed debate on providence vs. libertarian freedom in Protestant theology (esp. Reformed critiques of Thomistic determinism and Roman Catholic defenses of sacramental theology).

- **Enduring value**
 - Keeps Aquinas philosophically respectable for modern readers; valuable for teaching the integration of metaphysics and systematic theology and for debates on divine knowledge and human moral transformation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine simplicity** - God has no composition; key for Davies's reading of Aquinas on how God knows and causes.
- **Infused faith** - faith as a theological, infused virtue that disposes intellect and will to assent and trust (used in treatment of justification and sanctification).
- **Assent (intellectual act)** - the act of the mind by which one assents to revealed truth; for Aquinas, joined to will and charity for salvific effect.
- **Contrition / Attrition** - sorrow for sin: **contrition** (perfect, from love of God) and **attrition** (imperfect, from fear); Davies explicates their roles in sacramental penance.
- **Sacramental confession / absolution** - ecclesial means of reconciliation; Davies emphasizes causal efficacy in Thomistic sacramental realism.
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)** - Molina's thesis that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; Davies shows Aquinas rejects this as metaphysically inconsistent with simplicity.
- **Molinism** - theological system positing middle knowledge to reconcile divine sovereignty and libertarian freedom; contrasted sharply with Thomistic providence.
- **Prescience / Divine foreknowledge** - Aquinas: God knows future contingents by knowing causes and by eternal volitional act, not via contingent counterfactuals independent of His will.
- **Contingency and freedom** - Thomistic account grounds contingency in created causality within divine providence, preserving moral responsibility while subordinating future contingents to divine causation.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - Molinist objects; Davies explains Aquinas's rejection as rooted in metaphysical and epistemic assumptions.
- **Providence / Predestination** - ordered by God's eternal counsel; Davies shows how Aquinas integrates justice, mercy, and grace into a causal account of salvation.
- **Charity (caritas)** - central to justification and repentance; faith requires charity for final beatitude in Thomistic schema.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Thomistic metaphysics and its implications for doctrine (faith, sacraments, providence).
 - As a **polemic aid** against Molinism and libertarian accounts of foreknowledge; often cited in debates on divine knowledge.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Aquinas sympathetically but critically, useful in seminar teaching on medieval theology and philosophy of religion.
