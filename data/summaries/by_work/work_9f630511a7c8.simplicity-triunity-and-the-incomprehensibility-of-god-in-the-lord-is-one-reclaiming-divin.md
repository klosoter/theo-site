### TITLE
Simplicity, Triunity, and the Incomprehensibility of God - James E. Dolezal (in The Lord Is One: Reclaiming Divine Simplicity, 2019)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed retrieval project (late 2010s) seeking to recover classical theism and divine simplicity within evangelical/Reformed theology. The essay participates in renewed debate over Divine Simplicity (DS) against analytic critiques and revisionary proposals that prioritize relationality or metaphysical complexity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Dolezal defends the coherence and theological necessity of divine simplicity while showing its compatibility with Trinitarian doctrine and the incomprehensibility of God. He aims to reconcile the claim that God is non-composite (no metaphysical parts) with real personal distinctions among Father, Son, and Spirit and with meaningful predication of attributes.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Defend classical DS as the best account of divine being: God is metaphysically non-composite; attributes are identical to the divine essence rather than separable properties.
 - Show that Trinitarian distinctions (persons) are not compositional parts but real relational distinctions grounded in relations of origin internal to the one simple divine essence.
 - Treat incomprehensibility: distinguish negative (God is beyond full intellectual grasp) and positive (we can truly know God by revelation) senses; DS supports a robust doctrine of analogical predication and limits human conceptualization without denying genuine knowledge.
 - Use the **absolute vs relative attributes** distinction to handle apparent pluralities of divine properties: absolute attributes (e.g., omniscience, aseity) point to the one essence; relative attributes (e.g., Fatherhood, Lordship) express relationality without implying metaphysical composition.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical sources (Augustine, Aquinas), Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed writers (Calvin, Owen, classical Reformed scholastics), and contemporary critics from analytic philosophy of religion and theology who challenge DS (unnamed broadly as "modern critics"); Dolezal leverages patristic and scholastic moves to respond to modern objections.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (immanent and economic), divine attributes (absolute and relative), divine simplicity, incomprehensibility/negative theology, revelation and analogical knowledge.
- **Closing line:** Dolezal locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that the one, simple divine essence grounds both Trinitarian personhood and our limited but true knowledge of God-simplicity preserves divine unity, triune distinctness, and the inevitability of divine incomprehensibility together.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Re-articulates DS within a Reformed, Trinitarian framework that stresses the ontological priority of the divine essence without reducing persons to modes.
 - Emphasizes the explanatory role of DS for both the unity of attributes and the intelligibility of Trinitarian relations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against modern proposals that abandon DS on grounds that it collapses personal distinctions or renders attributes meaningless; argues these critiques often conflate conceptual and real distinctions.
 - Contrasts with modalist or social-Trinitarian tendencies that treat persons as ontologically separable centers; instead insists on relations of origin as internally grounded and compatible with non-compositeness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes the **absolute/relative attributes** distinction as a tool for reading classical sources into contemporary debate.
 - Reframes incomprehensibility so it functions positively for epistemology (limits but secures analogical, propositional knowledge).
- **Reception and influence:** Serves as a prominent contemporary Reformed defense of DS; cited in discussions that aim to rehabilitate classical theism within evangelical and academic circles. Helps re-center patristic-scholastic moves in modern analytic-theological debate.
- **Enduring value:** Useful for teaching DS alongside Trinitarian doctrine; provides a compact model for reconciling simplicity, personal distinctions, and human knowledge of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity (DS):** God is non-composite; no metaphysical parts; attributes are identical with God's essence.
- **Triunity / Trinity:** One divine essence subsisting in three persons; persons distinguished by relations of origin, not by composition.
- **Incomprehensibility:** Twofold sense - negative (God transcends full human understanding) and positive (we can know God truly via revelation and analogical language).
- **Absolute attributes:** Properties attributed to God considered without reference to creatures (e.g., aseity, immutability); point to the essence.
- **Relative attributes:** Properties that involve relation (e.g., Fatherhood, Lordship); for Dolezal, these are compatible with DS when understood as internal relations rather than extrinsic accidents.
- **Real distinction vs conceptual distinction:** Real distinctions are metaphysically grounded (e.g., persons via relations); conceptual distinctions are distinctions in our cognition or language, not in God's simple being.
- **Relations of origin:** Internal relations grounding Trinitarian personal distinctions (begetting, procession) that do not introduce composition.
- **Analogical predication:** Human talk of God is analogical - neither univocal nor purely equivocal; a way to affirm attributes without collapsing divine transcendence.
- **Divine essence / ousia:** The one being of God to which attributes are identical.
- **Hypostasis / person:** The particular subsisting realities (Father, Son, Spirit) within the one essence.
- **Negative theology (apophatic):** Emphasized to preserve humility before God's transcendence while allowing positive revelation.
- **Non-composite / simple:** Synonymous in Dolezal's usage; denies metaphysical parts or internal composition.
- **Economic vs immanent Trinity:** Distinction preserved; DS supplies metaphysical resources to account for immanent relations without plurality of essences.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional and exegetical source for rehabilitating classical DS and clarifying absolute/relative attribute usage.
 - As a polemical resource against analytic objections that link DS to incoherence with Trinitarian personal distinctions.
 - As a conceptual pivot in theological method courses for integrating metaphysics (simplicity) with doctrine (Trinity, revelation, attributes).
