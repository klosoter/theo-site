### TITLE
Adopted by God: From Wayward Sinners to Cherished Children (2001) - Robert A. Peterson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in 2001 amid renewed evangelical interest in the language of adoption as a central soteriological motif. Situated in a conservative Reformed/Biblical-theological milieu that seeks to recover biblical metaphors neglected by overly forensic accounts of salvation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Peterson contends that adoption is a distinct, theologically rich component of salvation that is both legal and relational, grounded in the Trinitarian work of God and indispensable for Christian identity, assurance, ethics, and worship.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of adoption imagery in Old and New Testaments (Israelic sonship, prophetic language, Pauline and Johannine usage).
 - Theological synthesis: locates adoption within the economy of redemption - Father as adopter, Son as procuring Redeemer, Spirit as enactor and seal.
 - Doctrinal distinctions: clarifies relation of adoption to justification, union with Christ, and sanctification.
 - Pastoral applications: implications for assurance, prayer (Abba), corporate worship, pastoral care, and mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis is primary; receives implicit debt to Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvinian emphases on union with Christ), while dialoguing critically with pietistic/sentimental and strictly forensic accounts of salvation prevalent in some evangelical circles.
- **Doctrines treated:** Adoption (central), justification, union with Christ, sanctification, pneumatology (seal/guarantee), covenant theology (blessings of the covenant), Trinitarian economy.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is that adoption is a necessary, Trinitarianly grounded dimension of salvation that transforms legal standing into intimate filial communion with God, with concrete pastoral and ethical consequences.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses adoption as both juridical and relational - not merely a change of legal status but an entrance into a real filial relationship and household.
 - Gives careful attention to the Spirit's role as both seal/guarantor and the personal presence that effects filial assurance and Abba-prayer.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals:**
 - Corrects reductionist accounts that treat adoption as mere metaphor or secondary to justification; insists adoption is a distinct blessing inseparable from union with Christ.
 - Pushes back against overly sentimentalized portrayals of adoption that underplay doctrinal anchors like covenant and forensic redemption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Integrates covenantal language with personal-family metaphors to show how corporate covenant promises become personal filial realities.
 - Emphasizes the interlocking roles of Father, Son, and Spirit in adoption as a way to prevent two-dimensional (legal-only or relational-only) readings.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical pastoral theology for bringing adoption to the fore as a catechetical and homiletical resource.
 - Used widely in seminary preaching and pastoral care courses; cited by pastors and authors seeking a biblically robust account of Christian identity and assurance.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, balanced account useful for ministers, theologians, and advanced students; durable as both theological synthesis and pastoral handbook.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adoption:** The act by which God receives sinners into his family - juridically real and relationally transformative.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological ground in which adoption is realized; adoption flows from being "in Christ."
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration that enables legal standing; correlated with but not identical to adoption.
 - Peterson emphasizes distinct but inseparable relations: justification secures status; adoption secures familial relationship.
- **Abba:** The intimate word for Father that expresses filial access and prayer as evidence of adoption.
- **Heirs / Inheritance:** The practical consequence of adoption - believers become co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8; Galatians 4).
- **Seal / Spirit:** The Spirit as guarantee and personal down-payment, who effects assurance and produces filial fruit.
- **Covenant blessings:** Adoption presented as one of the covenantal benefits realized in Christ.
- **Legal vs. Relational language:** Peterson insists on holding both registers together to avoid distortions.
- **Old Testament sonship:** Corporate and typological foundations (Israel, kingly sonship) that anticipate Christian adoption.
- **Pastoral assurance:** Adoption as foundation for assurance of salvation and perseverance.
- **Ethical formation:** Filial status as motive for holiness and obedience.
- **Trinitarian economy:** Father as adopter, Son as procurer, Spirit as enactor - adoption explicated through the threefold work of God.
- **Mission and worship:** Adoption as impetus for evangelism (to enlarge the family) and for worship (filial access and praise).
- **Household imagery:** Use of familial/household metaphors to explain ecclesial life and discipline.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definitional source** for the term "adoption" in soteriology and pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic resource** against either purely forensic or merely sentimental models of salvation.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and Johannine adoption texts within covenantal and Trinitarian frameworks.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and catechesis to connect doctrine (union, justification) with pastoral life (assurance, prayer, ethics).
