### TITLE
The Biblical Idea of Revelation - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton Calvinist milieu; Warfield writes as defender of classical Reformed orthodoxy against liberal biblical criticism and modernist reinterpretation of Scripture and doctrine.
- **Central thesis**
 - Revelation is God's self-disclosure that is historically mediated, verbally authoritative, and epistemically sufficient: Scripture as special revelation is the divinely given, knowable ground for theology and faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes the reality and knowability of God as a precondition of revelation (addresses **Existence And Knowability Of God**).
 - Defines revelation as divine self-communication that is both supernatural and adapted to human capacities (introduces **Accommodation And Incarnational Analogy**: God condescends as in the Incarnation).
 - Argues for Scripture's organic unity and plenary, verbal inspiration; the Bible conveys truth reliably and authoritatively for doctrine and life.
 - Treats typology and historical fulfillment: Scripture's events and institutions are Christ-centered types whose meaning is fulfilled historically (site on **Typology And Fulfillment**).
 - Applies revelation to doctrines of providence and foreknowledge, showing compatibility of divine sovereignty and human responsibility (engages **Divine Foreknowledge Providence And The Problem Of Evil**).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed orthodox tradition, Charles Hodge and Princeton predecessors; opponents: higher criticism, Ritschlian and liberal theologians (Schleiermacheric tendencies), and emergent modernist readings that reduce revelation to religious experience.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture (inspiration, authority, inerrancy), Christology (incarnational analogy), typology, covenantal continuity, providence, divine foreknowledge, and implications for theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the center of gravity in a revelation that is both objectively given and incarnationally accommodated: Scripture is the verbally authoritative medium through which the sovereign, knowable God Himself discloses saving truth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm articulation of **verbal plenary inspiration** integrated with a high view of the historical character of revelation; not merely propositional but historically enacted and narratively embodied.
 - Stress on the **incarnational analogy**: divine accommodation in revelation is analogous to the Incarnation-truth condescends without loss of divine reality.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal reductions of revelation to religious feeling or ethical insight; opposes critical theories that detach meaning from divine authorship.
 - Refines earlier mechanistic models of inspiration (word-for-word dictation) into an organic view that preserves authorial intention and verbal authority.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic linkage of typology and fulfillment to a doctrine of revelation that makes biblical history itself revelatory rather than merely illustrative.
 - Clarifies how revelation informs systematic theology without collapsing biblical theology into systematics; sees biblical theology as the historical content that systematics orders.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on conservative Reformed and evangelical treatments of inspiration, inerrancy, and biblical authority; foundational for later twentieth-century defenses of Scripture.
 - Criticized by neo-orthodoxy and liberal scholars for its confidence in propositional revelation and objective knowability of God.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous integration of historical exegesis with dogmatic commitment; indispensable for courses on revelation, inspiration, and Reformed epistemology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation** - divine self-disclosure that is supernatural, propositional, and historical.
- **Special revelation** - Scripture and Christ as the unique, saving disclosure beyond general revelation.
- **General revelation** - natural knowledge of God's existence and attributes; sufficient for culpability but insufficient for saving knowledge.
- **Inspiration (verbal plenary)** - all words of Scripture are divinely commissioned; human authors operate under divine superintendence.
 - Distinguish from dictation: Warfield allows human personality while maintaining divine origin and verbal reliability.
- **Inerrancy / Authority** - Scripture is free from error in its claims as intended by God and is the final norm for faith and practice.
- **Accommodation / Incarnational analogy** - God adapts revelation to human capacities analogously to the Incarnation: genuine condescension without metaphysical diminishment.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - biblical persons, rites, and events function as divinely intended types whose true meaning is realized in Christ and redemptive history.
- **Biblical theology** - historical exposition of revelation as given; the content that systematic theology organizes.
- **Systematic theology** - doctrinal ordering and articulation that presupposes the content of revelation.
- **Providence & Foreknowledge** - God's sovereign governance and exhaustive foreknowledge are compatible with moral responsibility; used to address theodicy.
- **Sovereignty** - God's absolute rule over creation and salvation; undergirds Warfield's assurance of revelation's reliability.
- **Canon** - recognition of Scripture's bounded corpus as the locus of authoritative revelation.
- **Theodicy (Problem of Evil)** - treated through the lens of providence and divine purposes revealed in Scripture.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed doctrines of inspiration and accommodation.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal/reductionist theories of revelation and higher criticism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading typology and fulfillment in biblical theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking revelation to doctrines of providence, foreknowledge, and theodicy.
