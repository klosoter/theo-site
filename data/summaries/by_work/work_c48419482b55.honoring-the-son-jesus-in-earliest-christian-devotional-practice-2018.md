### TITLE
Honoring the Son: Jesus in Earliest Christian Devotional Practice (Larry Hurtado, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late modern NT scholarship; follows Hurtado's earlier programmatic works (Lord Jesus Christ, 2003; How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God?, 2005). 
 - Moves beyond purely philological or doctrinal history to a social- and practice-based account drawing on literary, epigraphic, and archaeological evidence. 
 - Engages debates over the origins and timing of Christian worship of Jesus within first-century Judaism and Greco-Roman religiosity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Earliest Christians developed **devotional practices that honored Jesus with divine-style worship** (prayer, hymns, baptismal and eucharistic cultic acts, invocation, inscriptions) very early and within a Jewish monotheistic horizon; this practice helps explain the emergence of high Christology and is a key datum for understanding the revelation of the Trinity, though not yet a formal Trinitarian doctrine.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Survey of devotional behaviors attested in earliest Christian literature and material culture. 
 - Demonstrates that such practices targeted Jesus with the same forms and language previously reserved for God (OT/Yahweh) and for divine figures. 
 - Argues that Jewish monotheism constrained and shaped how Jesus could be honored-resulting in a distinctive reconfiguration rather than abandonment of monotheism. 
 - Positions these devotional facts as explanatorily prior to later theological formulations (e.g., explicit Trinitarian creeds); thus practice drives doctrinal articulation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: Pauline and deutero-Pauline letters, Gospel materials, early Christian hymnic fragments, baptismal and eucharistic texts, inscriptions, and patristic echo. 
 - Interlocutors: older evolutionary/late-development models (Harnack, Bousset), scholars emphasizing low or adoptionist christologies, and proponents of early high Christology (e.g., Richard Bauckham). 
 - Methodological interlocutors include historians of religion and anthropologists of ritual.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Christology** (origin and shape of devotion to Jesus), **Revelation** (how OT and NT revelation frame divine honor), and implications for **Trinity** (early binitarian practice as precursor to trinitarian doctrinal development).

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - Early Christian reverence of Jesus as an object of divine honor is a primary historical datum that both arises from and reshapes Jewish monotheistic revelation, serving as the practical basis from which later Trinitarian doctrine was formulated.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Prioritizes **ritual and devotional practice** over purely propositional doctrinal development as the locus where early Christology is formed and expressed. 
 - Emphasizes **continuity with Jewish monotheism**-Jesus is honored without abandoning monotheistic commitments; worship is reconfigured, not paganized.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against models that place worship of Jesus late and primarily Gentile in origin; insists on early Jewish-Palestinian roots in many devotional phenomena. 
 - Challenges purely theological or textual reconstructions that neglect the socioreligious matrix of honor, worship, and ritual.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Articulates the category of **"devotional practice"** as primary explanatory factor; uses terms like **"binitarian devotion"** descriptively (honor directed to both God the Father and the Son) without anachronistically imputing later Trinitarian formulas.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely influential in NT studies, early Christian history, and trinitarian historiography as a corrective emphasizing practice. 
 - Adopted in confessional and ecumenical discussions as historical support for early high Christology; critiqued by some for weight given to later or ambiguous evidence.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Supplies a methodological template (practice-focused, multi-source) for studying doctrinal emergence. 
 - Valuable corrective to accounts that either secularize or dehistoricize Christological origins.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Devotional practice:** Rituals and communal acts (prayer, hymns, baptism, eucharist, invocation) through which early Christians honored Jesus; primary datum for Hurtado.
- **High Christology:** Conceptions of Jesus as divine or as an object of divine honor; Hurtado shows this emerges very early in communal life.
- **Binitarian devotion:** Descriptive term for patterns of honor directed to both Father and Son before formal Trinitarian formulations.
- **Divine honors / adoration:** Forms of cultic language and behavior (proskuneo, doxa, kyrios) applied to Jesus.
- **Kyrios (Lord):** Title used of Jesus that in Greco-Jewish contexts carries divine associations; central to Hurtado's argument about reverence.
- **Son (huios):** Title framed within Jewish scriptural revelation and used devotionally rather than merely as filial descriptor.
- **Jewish monotheism:** The theological horizon that shaped and constrained early Christian worship; Hurtado stresses continuity and rearticulation, not overthrow.
- **Revelation (OT & NT):** The scriptural matrix (Yahweh traditions) that both grounds and complicates early Christian worship of Jesus; used to show how devotion to the Son was intelligible within revelation.
- **Cultic practices:** Specific ritual acts (baptismal formulas, eucharistic prayers, inscriptions) evidencing Jesus-directed worship.
- **Inscriptional / epigraphic evidence:** Non-literary data (grave inscriptions, tituli) that corroborate literary attestations of devotional practice.
- **Proto-Trinitarian:** He uses cautiously to describe early doctrinal trajectory implied by devotional binitarianism.
- **Practice-driven theology:** Methodological principle: communal worship shapes doctrinal articulation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what counts as early Christian worship of Jesus in discussions of Christology and Trinity history. 
- As a **polemic** against late-development/evolutionary models of Christology. 
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing ritual and social practice alongside textual exegesis for reconstructing first-century belief. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the relation between revelation (OT/NT), worship, and the eventual formulation of Trinitarian doctrine.
