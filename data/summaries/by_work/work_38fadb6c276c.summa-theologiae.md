### TITLE
**Summa Theologiae** - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context.** c. 1265-1273, Dominican pedagogy for theology students; high scholasticism at Paris and Italy; synthesis amid the Latin recovery of Aristotle; mendicant pastoral reform and university disputation culture.
- **Central thesis / problem.** What is sacra doctrina and how do all things proceed from God and return to God? The Summa orders revealed truth scientifically to lead rational creatures, by Christ and grace, to the **beatific vision**.
- **Core argument / structure.**
 - **Prima Pars:** God as **ipsum esse subsistens**; divine names, simplicity, Trinity; creation, angels, providence/predestination; imago Dei.
 - **Prima Secundae:** Human acts, ends, happiness; passions; **habitus** and virtues; sin; grace as healing/elevating.
 - **Secunda Secundae:** Theological and cardinal virtues, gifts, vices; states of life; law in practice.
 - **Tertia Pars:** Christology (Incarnation, **hypostatic union**, satisfaction/merit), Marian questions; the **sacraments** as instrumental causes of grace. (Supplement from the Sentences on penance, orders, eschatology.)
 - Method: each article with objections, sed contra, respondeo, replies; Scripture primary, reason ministerial.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors.** Scripture; Augustine; Pseudo-Dionysius; Boethius; Lombard; Aristotle (metaphysics, ethics); Avicenna/Averroes; Jewish and Islamic kalam; correcting Latin Averroism and engaging Augustinian Platonism.
- **Doctrines treated.** Revelation and the senses of Scripture; God and Trinity; creation and providence; anthropology and sin; grace and justification; law and virtue; Christology and soteriology; ecclesiology and sacramental economy; eschatology (resurrection, judgment, purgatory, vision of God); Old/New Law as covenantal economies.
- **Center of gravity.** The exitus-reditus of creatures: from God, ordered by law and grace, restored by Christ the Head, returning to God in the vision of glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases.**
 - **Analogy** of divine naming; God as pure act of being; strong **divine simplicity**.
 - Nature elevated by **grace** without collapse; virtue as **habitus**; a full **treatise on law** (eternal, natural, human, divine).
 - **Instrumental causality** of sacraments (ex opere operato); Christ s Passion as **satisfaction and merit**; Christ as **Head** communicating grace.
 - Literal sense of Scripture primary, spiritual senses subordinated.
- **Corrections / contrasts.**
 - Against Latin Averroism: no single separate intellect; personal immortality, providence over singulars.
 - Nuancing Augustinian Platonism: from exemplarism to **act/potency** and **participation** metaphysics.
 - Broadens Anselm: satisfaction within charity, merit, and sacramental application.
 - Diverges from later Scotus/Ockham: **analogy** vs univocity; intellect-weighted psychology; robust secondary causality.
 - Reformed contrasts: forensic justification vs **fides caritate formata**; sacramental causality contested; yet shared classical theism and natural law.
- **Conceptual innovations.**
 - **Ipsum esse subsistens**, essence/existence distinction; the Five Ways; **primary/secondary causality**; habits/virtues architecture; law taxonomy; New Law as grace of the Spirit.
- **Reception and influence.**
 - Normative in Tridentine and neo-Thomist Catholicism; major source for classical theism.
 - Selective appropriation by Reformed scholastics (simplicity, providence, natural law, virtue); modern ecumenical retrievals in ethics and metaphysics.
- **Enduring value.**
 - A stable grid of distinctions for dogmatics; exemplary method of objections/replies; deep Christology and sacramental coherence; the beatific end keeps soteriology, ethics, and ecclesiology teleologically ordered.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacra doctrina (sacred doctrine):** A science from God as first truth, with Scripture as principle; reason serves revelation.
- **Analogia entis:** Predication about God is analogical, safeguarding transcendence without equivocity.
- **Ipsum esse subsistens:** God as subsistent act of being; grounds simplicity, immutability, infinity.
- **Participation:** Creatures share in being, goodness, and causality from God, enabling natural law and virtue.
- **Act/potency:** Metaphysical grammar for change, causality, and divine immutability.
- **Primary/secondary causality:** God moves creatures as true causes; basis for providence, grace, and sacramental instrumentality.
- **Five Ways:** Philosophical demonstrations to God s existence from motion, causality, contingency, degrees, teleology.
- **Law taxonomy:** Eternal, natural, human, and **divine law**; the **New Law** chiefly the grace of the Spirit, secondarily written precepts.
- **Habitus and virtues:** Stable dispositions; cardinal and theological virtues; gifts of the Spirit; vice and sin as privations.
- **Grace:** Healing/elevating; prevenient/cooperating; habitual grace and infused virtues; distinguishes gratum faciens from gratis datae.
- **Justification:** God s motion remitting sin by infused grace, faith **formed by charity**, and the beginnings of merit (condign/congruent).
- **Satisfaction and merit:** Christ s passion superabundantly satisfactory; believers participate by grace.
- **Hypostatic union:** Two natures in one person; communication of idioms; Christ as **Head** distributing grace.
- **Sacraments:** Signs that cause grace **ex opere operato**; matter/form/minister; character; **transubstantiation** in the Eucharist.
- **Beatific vision:** The final end; immediate intuitive vision of God by a light of glory; eschatological horizon for ethics and worship.
- **Scripture s senses:** Literal sense primary; spiritual senses (allegorical, moral, anagogical) founded on the literal.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for classical theism (simplicity, providence, analogy) and natural law.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking Christology, grace, virtue, and sacrament to the beatific end.
 - As a polemical foil or dialogue partner on justification and sacramental causality.
 - As an exegetical model for the primacy of the literal sense within a fourfold reading.
