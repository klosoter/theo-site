### TITLE
New Testament and the People of God (1992) - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published as the first volume of Wright's Christian Origins and the Question of God series (early 1990s). Engages trends in historical Jesus research, the New Perspective on Paul (E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn), and renewed interest in Second Temple Judaism.
 - Milieu: academic biblical studies moving away from pietistic/individualistic readings toward social-historical and covenantal frameworks.

- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament must be read as the story of God reconstituting Israel and inaugurating the renewal of the whole creation in and through Jesus the Messiah. Jesus and Paul are best understood within Second Temple Jewish categories; the NT announces a realized-but-not-yet eschatological ingathering of God's people.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs Second Temple Judaism to provide background for Jesus and Paul.
 - Re-reads Jesus as Israel's Messiah who inaugurates God's kingdom through death, resurrection, and vindication.
 - Interprets Paul as articulating how Gentile inclusion and covenantal status work within this narrative (justification language as covenantal/declared status rather than purely forensic exchange).
 - Argues for an overarching biblical storyline: creation - election/covenant - exile - new exodus/return - renewed creation.
 - Emphasizes mission: the people of God are called to embody and announce the kingdom.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Dialogues with E. P. Sanders (covenantal nomism), James D. G. Dunn (New Perspective), and older interpreters (Käsemann, Bultmann) while also addressing historical Jesus scholarship and Jewish texts (Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Qumran materials).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant, election, law/torah, Christology (Messiah), eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), justification and Pauline theology, ecclesiology (Israel/church relation), mission, canon formation.

- **Closing line**
 - The NT proclaims that God, faithful to covenant, has acted in Jesus to launch the restoration of Israel and the cosmos - a decisive, historical inauguration of God's kingdom that is "already" effected but "not yet" consummated.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong narrative and covenantal reading of scripture: the NT as continuation and climax of Israel's story.
 - Priority of Second Temple Jewish categories in interpreting Jesus and Paul.
 - Stress on the corporate and political dimensions of salvation (people and world), not merely individual soteriology.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that privatize Paul (individualistic soteriology) or that portray Judaism as legalistic antithesis to Christianity.
 - Counters extremes of both "purely realized" eschatology and "purely future" eschatology by framing Jesus' work as inaugurated eschatology.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear articulation of an **inaugurated eschatology** (already/not yet) within a covenantal framework.
 - Re-frames justification language in covenantal and corporate terms (important precursor to later New Perspective debates).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential across Reformed and broader evangelical scholarship; central to the New Perspective on Paul conversation and recent Pauline studies.
 - Provoked contention among conservative theologians over justification and the role of works/faith language.
 - Adopted in many seminary curricula as a corrective to reductionist readings of Paul and Jesus.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological exemplar: historically informed, canon-conscious, narrative theology.
 - Stimulates rethinking of mission, ecclesiology, and the relationship between Israel and the church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The kingdom of God has been begun decisively in Jesus (resurrection, vindication) but awaits consummation.

- **Realized vs Future Eschatology**
 - Wright rejects either/or reduction: the NT presents a **realized-but-not-yet** pattern - some eschatological benefits already present, full fulfillment future.

- **Second Temple Judaism**
 - Treated as the legitimate theological and social matrix for NT texts; not merely background but theological kinship.

- **Covenant / Covenant Faithfulness**
 - Central interpretive key: God remains faithful to Israel; Jesus is the means of covenant renewal and expansion.

- **Messiah / New Exodus**
 - Jesus as the eschatological agent who enacts a new exodus (liberation, return, temple renewal).

- **Kingdom of God**
 - Political, social, and cosmic restoration under God's rule; embodied in the people of God.

- **Justification**
 - Read covenantally: language denotes covenantal status and community inclusion rather than only individual forensic pardon.

- **Israel and the Church**
 - Continuity with Israel is primary; the church exists as the people called into Israel's story, not as a separate replacement.

- **Law / Torah**
 - Torah as defining the shape of covenant life; Paul and Jesus reinterpret its function within the covenant story.

- **Apocalyptic**
 - Used to frame hope and vindication language; apocalyptic motifs denote God's intervention for history.

- **Mission (missio Dei)**
 - The people of God participate in God's missionary action to renew creation and gather the nations.

- **Canon and Narrative**
 - Scripture read as unified story; canonical reading informs theology and ethics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a defining resource for **inaugurated eschatology** and the "already/not yet" formulation.
- As a polemical and corrective source in debates over the **New Perspective on Paul** (reframing justification and covenant).
- As an **exegetical and narrative model** for reading NT texts within Second Temple Jewish and canonical storyline contexts.
- As a conceptual pivot for ecclesiology and mission: grounds the church's vocation in Israel-shaped covenant and kingdom theology.
