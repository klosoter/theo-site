### TITLE
Sanctification: Union with Christ and the Twofold Grace of God - J. V. Fesko

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed theological conversation (21st century). Situated in renewed interest in classical Reformed doctrine of union with Christ, the ongoing pastoral debate over assurance, and clarifying relations between justification and sanctification.
- **Central thesis**
 - Sanctification must be understood theologically as rooted in **union with Christ** and enacted by a **twofold grace** of God: the grace that declares (forensic/justifying) and the grace that transforms (sanctifying/quickening). These aspects are distinct but inseparable in the believer's life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis: traces biblical language for union with Christ (Pauline corpus, Johannine motifs) and links it to progressive sanctification.
 - Historical-theological survey: recovers Reformation and Puritan accounts (Calvinic emphasis, covenantal formulations) showing continuity in locating sanctification in corporate and mystical union.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: defines the twofold grace, explains their interrelation (how justification provides status and union-basis while sanctifying grace effects conformity), and resists both antinomian and moralistic errors.
 - Pastoral application: addresses assurance, means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer), and Christian growth-linking doctrinal clarity to pastoral care.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformation and post-Reformation figures (Calvin, the Westminster tradition, Puritans) and contemporary Reformed scholars. Dialogues implicitly with views that either collapse justification and sanctification or unduly separate them (e.g., certain Free Grace and perfectionist tendencies).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, perseverance), Christology (union with Christ), Pneumatology (Spirit as agent of sanctifying union), Covenant theology, means of grace, imputation vs. impartation.
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically robust sanctification is Union-centered: believers grow in holiness only because, as members of Christ, they receive the twofold grace of God that both declares them righteous and progressively conforms them to Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers **union with Christ** as the theological hinge for sanctification rather than primarily ethical exhortation or psychological models of growth.
 - Articulates **twofold grace** terminology to keep distinct the declarative and transformative activities of God while insisting on their inseparability in experience.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against formulations that treat sanctification as merely an effect or evidence of justification (reductive evidentialism) or that treat justification and sanctification as entirely unrelated spheres.
 - Corrects both antinomian tendencies (minimizing moral transformation) and legalistic schemes (making sanctification the ground of acceptance).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Revitalizes the phrase **twofold grace** as a compact analytic tool for pastoral and dogmatic clarity.
 - Recasts traditional imputation/impartation debates in terms of union and covenantal participation, reducing sterile polarity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Gained traction in Reformed academic and pastoral circles as a clear, historically grounded corrective to contemporary confusions about growth in holiness.
 - Used in seminary courses and pastoral formation as a concise statement bridging doctrine and practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for teaching sanctification that preserves confessional commitments while engaging present pastoral controversies; helpful for homiletics, discipleship, and doctrinal instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - The believer's ontological and covenantal participation in Christ; the fountainhead for all saving benefits, including sanctification.
- **Twofold grace** - Dual aspect of God's saving work: (1) **declarative/forensic grace** (justification), (2) **transformative/sanctifying grace** (renewal).
 - Emphasis: distinct in function, inseparable in application.
- **Justification** - Forensic declaration of righteousness; secures believer's standing before God and grounds assurance.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive (imperfect) moral and spiritual conformity to Christ effected by the Spirit through union.
- **Imputation vs. impartation** - Rearticulated as relational realities within union: righteousness imputed (status) and grace imparted (habitual renewal).
- **Means of grace** - Word, sacraments, and Spirit-work as the ordinary channels by which union is nourished and sanctifying grace applied.
- **Mortification and vivification** - Traditional Puritan categories reiterated: dying to sin and living unto righteousness as distinct but intertwined processes in sanctification.
- **Covenant theology** - Framework for locating sanctification within God's redeeming purpose and familial life with Christ.
- **Perseverance** - Treated as the fruit of union and the continued outworking of sanctifying grace.
- **Assurance** - Grounded properly in union and the twofold grace, not merely evidentialism or subjective feeling.
- **Forensic/transformative distinction** - Analytical tool to avoid conflation without implying separation.
- **Pneumatological agency** - The Holy Spirit as the personal agent who effects union and applies sanctifying grace.
- **Practical pastoral uses**
 - Definition source for seminary syllabi on sanctification and union.
 - Polemic resource against both antinomian and moralistic distortions.
 - Exegetical model for reading Pauline union texts.
 - Conceptual pivot in teaching Reformed soteriology that unifies justification and sanctification under covenantal union.
