### TITLE
Peter Lombard, The Sentences, Book 3: On the Incarnation of the Word (selected English translation sections) - focus: communicatio idiomatum and the hypostatic union

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-12th century scholastic milieu (Peter Lombard c. 1096-1160); Sentences composed ca. 1150s as a systematic theological handbook for cathedral schools and emerging universities.
 - Method: compilation of patristic sententiae arranged quaestio-by-quaestio with scholastic distinctions and authorities cited.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How the eternal Word assumed a human nature without confusion of natures, and how predicates normally proper to one nature can be asserted of the single Person of Christ (the problem of communicatio idiomatum).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory use of Scripture and Fathers to define the Incarnation.
 - Analysis of the manner of union
 - Distinction of natures (divine, human) upheld against Monophysitism/Eutychianism.
 - Real personal union: one Person (the Word) subsisting in two natures.
 - Exposition of communicatio idiomatum
 - How properties (idiomata) of either nature are predicated of the one Person.
 - Modes of predication: appropriation, personal attribution, operations shared or distinct.
 - Practical consequences considered
 - Passibility vs. impassibility; how Scripture can say "God suffered" without implying change in the divine nature.
 - Christ's wills, actions, virtues; soteriological implications (Redemption through assumed humanity).
 - Conclusions drawn by appeal to patristic authorities and reasoned distinctions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy use of Augustine, Cyril of Alexandria, Leo I, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome; engagement with earlier theological controversies (Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Apollinarianism).
 - Lombard organizes and harmonizes patristic texts rather than offers novel exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, person/nature distinction), pneumatology as implicated in Christ's operations, doctrines of predication and properties (idiomata), soteriology (assumption and redemption), brief links to sacramental language treated elsewhere.

- **Closing line**
 - Lombard's Book 3 aims to secure orthodox Christology by preserving both the real distinction of natures and the unity of the Person, explaining how predicates move between natures through a disciplined theory of communicatio idiomatum.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic, pedagogical arrangement of patristic sententiae with scholastic distinctions - clarity through authoritative compilation rather than speculative innovation.
 - Careful taxonomy of how predicates attach to Christ: appropriation, personal predication, and communication of operations.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Upholds Cyril/Leo against both Nestorian separations of person and Eutychian fusion; reframes patristic phrases in scholastic categories (nature vs. person, idiomata vs. operation).
 - Less polemical than later scholastics; more synthetic curation of authorities.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Operational clarity in the use of communicatio idiomatum: distinguishes kinds of communication (e.g., of idioms, of operations) that later scholastics and Reformers inherit and refine.
 - Routine use of 'appropriation' (appropriatio) to justify scriptural ascriptions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - The Sentences became the standard medieval theological textbook; Book 3 shaped the high-medieval baseline for Christological instruction.
 - Influenced Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and scholastic curricula; later Reformation theologians (both Lutheran and Reformed) interacted repeatedly with Lombardian frameworks, adopting or polemicizing his uses of communicatio idiomatum.

- **Enduring value**
 - Essential for understanding pre-Thomistic Christological categories and medieval interpretive practice.
 - Valuable pedagogical model: dense, source-centered method that clarifies how patristic testimony is marshaled into coherent doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The communication of properties between Christ's two natures allowing predicates proper to one nature to be asserted of the one Person.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - The personal union in which the Word (hypostasis) assumes a human nature without confusion.
- **Nature (natura) / Person (persona)**
 - Key ontological categories distinguished: two natures, one person; Lombard uses both to avoid Nestorian and Monophysite errors.
- **Idiomatum (properties / idioms)**
 - Attributes proper to a nature (e.g., omnipotence to divinity, passibility to humanity) and their regulation in predication.
- **Appropriation (appropriatio)**
 - Assigning certain actions or attributes more fittingly to one nature while recognizing personal unity for attribution.
- **Operation (operatio)**
 - Acts performed by Christ; Lombard distinguishes common/shared operations from those proper to a nature.
- **Predication**
 - Linguistic-theological rules for asserting statements like "God suffered" - whether such predication is personal or material.
- **Assumption**
 - The act of the Word taking to himself human nature; central to soteriology.
- **Passibility / Impassibility**
 - Debate resolved by Lombard via personal attribution: God (as Person) can be said to suffer in the assumed human nature without changing divine impassibility.
- **Dyothelitism (two wills)**
 - Implicit affirmation: Christ has human and divine will as tied to two natures in one person (anticipatory to later formal declarations).
- **Sententia / Distinctio**
 - Lombard's methodological markers: collected sententiae and structured distinctions that frame theological argumentation.
- **Appropriation vs. Communication**
 - Appropriation: assigning of predicates by fittingness; Communication: allowable transfer of idioms by virtue of personal union.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: supplies medieval formulations of hypostatic union and communicatio idiomatum used by later scholastics.
 - As **polemic ammunition**: referenced in debates on the Eucharist, Christ's passibility, and Reformation Christology by both critics and defenders.
 - As an **exegetical model**: demonstrates how to marshal patristic texts into doctrinal synthesis and to regulate predication in Scripture.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: provides the vocabulary (appropriation, communication of idioms, person/nature distinction) that structures subsequent Christological and sacramental theology.
