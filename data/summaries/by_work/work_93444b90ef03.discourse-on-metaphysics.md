### TITLE
Discourse on Metaphysics - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written ca. 1686 amid the late 17th-century Rationalist and early Enlightenment milieu; drafted in French, circulated in manuscript among philosophers and theologians (Leibniz, a Lutheran polymath, engaged both Protestant and Catholic interlocutors); reflective reaction to Cartesian dualism, Spinozist necessitarianism, and Scholastic metaphysics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To ground a rational theodicy and a coherent doctrine of divine action by showing how God, as omniscient and free, chooses the most perfect, **compossible** world in accordance with the Principle of Sufficient Reason, thereby reconciling divine goodness, foreknowledge, and the existence of contingent evil.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Introduces metaphysical primitives: simple substances (later called **monads**), acts-perceptions, and intrinsic principles of change (appetition).
 - Distinguishes **truths of reason** (necessary, analytic) from **truths of fact** (contingent, synthetic); contingency depends on God's free creation among possible worlds.
 - Articulates the **Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)**: nothing is without a reason why it is rather than is not; PSR grounds both metaphysics and a theology of divine choice.
 - Defends **pre-established harmony**: created substances do not causally interact; God coordinates them from eternity to produce lawful appearance of interaction-this preserves divine sovereignty and creaturely spontaneity.
 - Concludes with a theodical account: evils are compatible with the world's maximal overall perfection; God permits some privative or necessary evils because they enable greater goods or are entailed by the best compossible set.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Descartes (dualism and mechanism), Spinoza (necessitarian monism), Scholasticism (notably Thomistic and late medieval schools), and contemporary theologians (Arnauld, Malebranche indirectly).
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, divine omniscience and omnipotence, freedom and necessity, divine justice and providence, problem of evil/theodicy, metaphysics of substance (with implications for soul, mind-body relation).
- **Closing line:** Leibniz centers theology on a rational, freedom-preserving account of divine choice: God selects the most perfect compossible order, explaining contingency and permitting limited evil within an overarching divine justice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **PSR as theological axis:** God's acts are intelligible, not arbitrary; metaphysics and theology are unified by sufficient reason.
 - **Compossibility:** originality in treating possible worlds as constrained by mutual compatibility rather than sheer plurality.
 - **Freedom reconciled with foreknowledge:** freedom is preserved because contingent truths depend on God's creative act, not logical compulsion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Rebuts Spinozist determinism by insisting on divine freedom and plurality of substances.
 - Modifies Cartesian mechanism-rejects direct physical interaction in favor of pre-established coordination.
 - Moves beyond scholastic accounts by formalizing modal distinctions (necessary vs contingent) and by systematizing theodicy via optimization (best world).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Early systematic use of **possible worlds**, **compossibility**, and a metaphysical PSR applied to theology.
 - Proto-monadology elements (monads as simple substances with perceptions) that ground moral and theological claims.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Heavily influential in Protestant German scholasticism (Wolffianism) and Enlightenment natural theology; provoked critical responses (e.g., Voltaire's satire) and shaped debates on divine justice, freedom, and providence.
 - Provided a philosophical framework later contested by Kant, but retained use in theological discussions of providence and moral evil.
- **Enduring value:** Supplies a compact, rigorous model for defending theodicy that preserves divine freedom and justice while making metaphysical claims usable in systematic theology and natural theology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR):** every fact has an explanation; foundational to Leibniz's account of divine choice and to theodicy.
- **Possible worlds:** complete ways reality might have been; God actualizes one among them.
 - **Compossibility:** constraint that only mutually compatible elements can coexist in a world.
- **Necessary vs. Contingent truths:** necessary truths true in all possible worlds; contingent truths depend on God's creative decision.
- **Pre-established harmony:** God harmonizes independent substances so their perceptions correspond without causal interaction.
- **Simple substances / monads (incipient):** indivisible centers of activity/perception; metaphysical atoms underpin created reality.
- **Best of all possible worlds:** God's choice principle-selecting the world that maximizes perfection while respecting compossibility.
- **Divine freedom:** genuine choice consistent with perfection and PSR; God's wills are not arbitrary but are free within rational constraints.
- **Theodicy / Divine justice:** evils explained as necessary or instrumentally required for the maximal overall good; justice understood as ordered goodness within the chosen compossible.
- **Contingency and creation:** contingency rooted in God's creative act rather than in metaphysical indeterminacy.
- **Appetition / internal principle of change:** explains change in monads without external causation.
- **Compossibility vs. logical possibility:** distinguishes coherence for a whole world from mere absence of contradiction in isolated propositions.
- **Grounds for providence:** lawful regularities stem from God's pre-established configuration, not from blind mechanism.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for modal metaphysics (PSR, possible worlds) in theological arguments about providence.
 - As a **polemic resource** against necessitarian and interactionist accounts (Spinoza, occasionalism).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of theodicy-modeling how divine justice and freedom coexist with the reality of evil.
