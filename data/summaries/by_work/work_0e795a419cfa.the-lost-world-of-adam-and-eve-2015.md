### TITLE
The Lost World of Adam and Eve (2015) - John H. Walton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2015 within contemporary evangelical scholarship engaging evolutionary science and ANE studies.
 - Builds on Walton's earlier work (notably The Lost World of Genesis One) and the "functional/temple" reading of Genesis 1.
 - Aimed at conservative and mainstream Protestants wrestling with Genesis 1-11, historical readings of Adam, and compatibility with paleoanthropology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Adam and Eve are best read as **archetypal representatives**-functional heads of humanity with covenantal/representative status-rather than necessarily the first biological pair from whom all humans descend.
 - This reading preserves theological claims (e.g., Paul's use of Adam) while allowing compatibility with scientific accounts of human origins.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Genesis should be read in its ANE cognitive world: much of Genesis 1-11 communicates **functional ontology** (what things do/mean) rather than modern material origins.
 - Adam and Eve's significance is **functional and social** (roles, relationships, covenantal status) not merely biological genesis.
 - Paul's theology (e.g., Romans 5) treats Adam as a representative head; Walton argues this is compatible with archetypal representation without demanding genetic primacy.
 - The Fall is interpreted as the loss of **functional/relational status** (dominion, covenantal standing), not as the immediate introduction of biological death into a pristine biosphere.
 - Engages empirical science: death in nature predates humans; therefore theological doctrine must not be hostage to a biological-first-human model.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - ANE literature and linguistics, Old Testament exegesis, Pauline theology (esp. Romans 5), contemporary paleoanthropology.
 - Critical interlocutors: Young-Earth Creationists, literalist historicizers, and scholars insisting on biological first-pair readings; dialogues with various evangelical exegetes and philosophers of science.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (functional ontology), image of God (functional/role), sin and the Fall (representational and relational), covenant/representation, death and its theological meaning, Scripture and science hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - Walton reframes Genesis 1-11 so that Adam and Eve function as covenantal archetypes: theology of sin, image, and redemption remains intact while permitting scientific accounts of human origins.

- **Site usage (three topical references)**
 - Days Of Creation; The Fall And Its Consequences; Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong advocacy for **functional ontology** (things are described by their role/function within created order) across Genesis 1-11.
 - Presents **Adam as archetypal headship** (representative role) rather than necessary biological progenitor.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with traditional Augustinian/Western readings that assume material primacy (first biological pair) and inherited biological guilt.
 - Challenges literal-historical reconstructions that make doctrines dependent on a genetic bottleneck of two individuals.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of **"archetype"** as a hermeneutical category for Genesis figures.
 - Clear distinction between **constitutive/functional status** vs. **material/biological origins**.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical academia and congregational apologetics as a constructive middle way between YEC and secular naturalism.
 - Provoked critique from conservative theologians concerned about implications for original sin, imputation, and Pauline exegesis.
 - Adopted as a teaching resource in many seminaries for science-theology engagement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Robust exegetical model for reading Genesis in ANE context.
 - Practical bridge for theologians seeking to preserve core doctrines while taking evolutionary science seriously.
 - Stimulates rethinking of how theological categories (image, sin, death) map onto empirical claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam (archetypal representative)** - headship and covenantal office representing humanity.
- **Eve (archetypal partner)** - partner in the representative role; social/functional significance emphasized.
- **Functional ontology** - primary mode of biblical description in Genesis; focus on function/role not material origin.
- **Image of God (functional)** - God's image as relational/functional status (role, dominion, cultic/temple function) rather than anatomic/biological attribute.
- **Archetype vs. Biological Progenitor** - hermeneutical contrast: archetypal reads allow non-exclusive biological origins.
- **Representative headship** - theological model (used to interpret Paul) where corporate status is transmitted by role, not necessarily genetics.
- **The Fall (relational/functional consequences)** - loss of covenantal/dominion status and relational rupture; does not require introduction of prior non-human death into theology.
- **Death in nature** - Walton affirms empirical death pre-dates humans; theological death (spiritual/relational) differs from biological death.
- **Genesis 1-11 as ANE cognitive world** - these chapters communicate meaning in ANE frameworks (temple, function, etiologies).
- **Temple/Function reading** - Genesis 1 portrays creation as assigning functions akin to temple inauguration.
- **Historicizing vs. Historicity** - distinguishes treating narrative as concrete ancient historiography vs. recognizing theological historicity without modern scientific mapping.
- **Constitutive vs. Material reading** - constitutive (how humans are constituted as image-bearers) vs. material (how humans originated biologically).
- **Pauline exegesis (Adam-Christ typology)** - Walton: typology remains valid when Adam is archetype; demands nuanced reading of imputation and federal headship.
- **Science-theology hermeneutic** - method for integrating scientific data without collapsing theological claims.

- **How this work is used**
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis in ANE context and teaching functional ontology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in science-theology dialogue to reconcile evolutionary anthropology with doctrines of sin and image.
 - As a **polemic** against readings that force theological commitments to depend on a genetic first-couple claim.
