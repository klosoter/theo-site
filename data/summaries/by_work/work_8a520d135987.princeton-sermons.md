### TITLE
**Princeton Sermons** by Charles Hodge (posthumous collection of Princeton Seminary chapel sermons, c. 1829-1878; published 1879, edited within the Old Princeton circle)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Old Princeton, confessional Presbyterianism, 19th-century America. Shaped by Scottish Common Sense Realism, post-Second Great Awakening debates, and engagement with German rationalism and Anglo-American revivalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To model doctrinal preaching that is exegetical, catholicly Reformed, and pastorally aimed at holiness. The sermons press Scripture-grounded, precise theology against contemporary errors while forming ministers and laity in experimental piety.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Begins with a biblical text; states the doctrine; marshals proofs; answers objections; concludes with uses (applications).
 - Major arcs:
 - **Theology Proper and Revelation:** God knowable by revelation; Scripture as inspired, authoritative, sufficient.
 - **Christology:** Full deity and true humanity of Christ; the unity of the person; offices of Mediator; substitutionary atonement.
 - **Pneumatology:** Regeneration, illumination, sanctification, assurance as the Spirit's work through appointed means.
 - **Soteriology (ordo salutis):** Election; effectual calling; union with Christ; justification by faith alone; adoption; sanctification; perseverance.
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacraments:** Visible/invisible church; Presbyterian polity; baptism and the Supper as means of grace with spiritual presence.
 - **Eschatology:** Death and intermediate state; resurrection; final judgment; eternal destinies; sober posture on millennial schemes.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture foremost; Reformed confessions (Westminster Standards); Augustine, Calvin, Turretin; Princeton predecessors (A. Alexander, S. Miller). In debate with New England Theology (Taylor), revivalist perfectionism (Finney), Socinian/Unitarian reductions, Tractarian sacramentalism, and German critical theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration; attributes and decree; creation and providence; Trinity; person and work of Christ; covenants; sin and imputation; atonement and justification; union and sanctification; church and sacraments; Spirit and assurance; last things.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is **union with Christ** effectually applied by the **Holy Spirit**, grounded in **Scripture's authority**, unto the **glory of God and the holiness of the church**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Doctrinal preaching as pastoral care: truth unto godliness.
 - Clear definitions with ordered heads and uses; catechetical cadence within homiletic form.
 - Integration of federal theology (covenant, imputation) with experimental piety.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against subjectivist or moral-influence accounts of the cross; for penal substitution and satisfaction.
 - Against perfectionism and synergism; for effectual grace and perseverance.
 - Against sacerdotalism and bare memorialism; for spiritual real presence and means-of-grace piety.
 - Against rationalist reduction of inspiration; for plenary, trustworthy Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not novelty but method: Princeton inductive theology, careful term-definition, and objection-handling within sermons.
 - Emphasis on **immediate imputation** within Adam-Christ federal parallel applied pastorally.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - A template for Reformed doctrinal homiletics; mined across loci for crisp formulations.
 - Stabilized Old School Presbyterian identity amid 19th-century controversies.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Reliable doctrinal compass for teaching core loci.
 - Exemplifies how confessional theology preaches: exegetical, polemical when needed, always doxological and practical.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration (plenary):** Scripture as divinely breathed, infallible in all it affirms; rule of faith and life.
- **Common Sense Realism:** Epistemic posture grounding theology in trustworthy sense perception and ordinary language under Scripture.
- **Divine Attributes and Decree:** God immutable, omniscient, sovereign; decree comprehensive yet non-violent to secondary causes.
- **Trinity:** One essence, three persons; coequality and consubstantiality; economic missions reveal but do not reduce the immanent Trinity.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; guilt and righteousness imputed.
 - **Immediate imputation:** Adam's first sin reckoned to his posterity by federal relation, not via inherited corruption causality.
- **Penal Substitution and Satisfaction:** Christ bears the penalty of sin as substitute, satisfying divine justice.
- **Union with Christ:** The comprehensive soteriological hinge; legal and vital aspects; by the Spirit, through faith.
- **Effectual Calling and Regeneration:** Monergistic work of the Spirit, renewing the will and illumining the mind.
- **Faith as Instrument:** The sole instrument of justification; receives and rests on Christ alone.
- **Justification by Faith Alone:** Imputation of Christ's righteousness; pardon and acceptance grounded extra nos.
- **Sanctification (progressive):** Spirit-wrought conformity to Christ via means of grace; distinguishes from justification.
- **Assurance:** Ordinary fruit of faith through promises and the Spirit's witness; not of the essence of faith, yet attainable.
- **Visible/Invisible Church:** External covenant community and the company of the elect; marks of true church: Word, sacraments, discipline.
- **Means of Grace:** Word, sacraments, and prayer as ordained conduits of the Spirit's sanctifying work.
- **Resurrection and Judgment:** Bodily resurrection, personal return of Christ, eternal destinies; rejects universalism and annihilationism.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definition source for classic Reformed terms (imputation, union, means of grace).
 - As a polemical touchstone against moral influence, perfectionism, and sacerdotalism.
 - As an exegetical-homiletical model for moving from text to doctrine to uses.
 - As a conceptual pivot linking ordo salutis to ecclesiology and sacramental practice.
