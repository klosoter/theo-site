### TITLE
Contributions to The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century (ed. Peter A. Lillback)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century confessional renewal within conservative Reformed circles.
 - Aimed at rearticulating the Westminster Confession (WCF) for contemporary theological, ecclesial, and pastoral challenges.
 - Responds to both historical-critical revisionism and popular theological movements (e.g., dispensationalism, liberal revisionism).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The WCF remains the doctrinally coherent and pastorally useful framework for orthodox Reformed faith; it needs re-presentation and defense for modern contexts without abandoning confessional fidelity.
 - Addresses how covenantal structures of the Confession should inform present-day doctrine and practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical retrieval: situates the WCF within 17th-century theology and its scriptural exegesis.
 - Doctrinal exposition: systematic treatment of major loci (Scripture, God, Christ, salvation, sacraments, church, state, eschatology) through a confessional lens.
 - Practical application: articulates implications for preaching, pastoral care, worship, and ecclesial polity in the 21st century.
 - Polemical engagement: counters contemporary deviations (e.g., weak covenant theology, antinomian trends, and theological liberalism).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: the Westminster divines and the text of the Confession itself.
 - Secondary conversation with historic Reformed theologians (post-Westminster interpreters) and contemporary critics of confessionalism.
 - Engages biblical exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (authority, sufficiency, hermeneutics).
 - **Covenant theology** (esp. Covenant of Grace vs. Covenant of Works).
 - **Christology and soteriology** (union with Christ, justification, sanctification).
 - **Sacraments** (baptism, Lord's Supper; sacramental efficacy and signs).
 - **Ecclesiology and polity** (church government, worship, regulative principle).
 - **Law and gospel** (ethical application, Sabbath/Lord's Day).
 - **Eschatology and civil magistrate** (state-church relations, end-times perspective).

- **Closing line**
 - The volume centers the Westminster Confession as the covenantal, scripturally grounded hermeneutic for orthodox Reformed theology and ecclesial life in the 21st century.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reasserts the **Covenant of Grace** as the central motif for reading Scripture and organizing doctrine and practice.
 - Balances rigorous historical fidelity with contemporary pastoral application-aiming for confessional theology that is both learned and usable.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both liberal revision of confessions and reductionist readings (e.g., detached moralism or purely symbolic sacrament views).
 - Contrasts with dispensational frameworks by emphasizing covenant continuity and federal interpretation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced language on **continuity and discontinuity** in covenantal administration (clarifying typology, sacramental signs, and covenant epochs).
 - Rearticulates federal headship and covenantal federalism in pastoral idiom for congregational teaching.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted as a reference in confessional Reformed seminaries and denominational training.
 - Cited in debates over confessional subscription, worship practice, and covenantal preaching.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, accessible compendium for teaching the WCF today; valuable for pastors, students, and elders seeking a confessional, covenantal framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession (WCF)** - The primary confessional text; treated as normative for doctrine and ecclesial ordering.
- **Covenant of Grace** - Central hermeneutical category; the volume defends its continuity through redemptive history and its pastoral significance.
 - Site usage: Covenant Of Grace (explicitly deployed as interpretive key).
- **Covenant Theology** - Systematic framework connecting covenants, sacraments, and soteriology.
 - Site usage: Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition (used to reclaim historic federalism).
- **Federal Headship** - Doctrine of representative solidarity (Adam/Christ) used to explain original sin and redemption.
- **Solus Scriptura / Authority of Scripture** - Affirms Scripture as the ultimate norm, grounding Confessional assertions.

- **Sacramental Efficacy** - Clarifies sign/means of grace function (baptism and Lord's Supper) in covenantal continuity.
- **Justification by Faith** - Treated as the center of soteriology; WCF formulations defended against both legalism and antinomianism.

 - As a **polemic** against dispensational and revisionist readings of redemptive history.
 - As an **exegetical-model** resource for reading covenant texts (e.g., Genesis, Exodus, Pauline covenantal passages).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in confessional formation, guiding seminary curricula and denominational standards.
