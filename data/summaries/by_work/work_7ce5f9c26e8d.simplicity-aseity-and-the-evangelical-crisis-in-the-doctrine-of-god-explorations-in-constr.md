### TITLE
"Simplicity, Aseity, and the Evangelical Crisis" - James E. Dolezal (in The Doctrine of God: Explorations in Constructive Dogmatics, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Mid-21st-century constructive dogmatics project; aimed at evangelical and Reformed readership wrestling with analytic philosophy of religion, historical theology, and contemporary challenges to classical theism.
- **Central thesis:** Recovery and robust defense of **divine simplicity** and **aseity** are doctrinally indispensable for orthodox evangelical theology; relinquishing these doctrines precipitates an evangelical crisis that undermines key doctrines (Trinity, Christology, revelation, providence).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary moves away from classical theism (e.g., versions of open theism, relational theism, and property-view accounts) produce theological and pastoral problems.
 - Exegetical and historical reclamation: reads Scripture through the patristic, medieval, and Reformation consensus to show biblical warrant for simplicity and aseity.
 - Philosophical-theological defense: clarifies classical formulations (simplicity = no real composition; aseity = non-contingent self-existence) and argues they secure coherence for other attributes (immutability, impassibility, eternity).
 - Systematic consequences: shows how simplicity/aseity sustain Trinitarian coherence, the incarnation (unchanged divine nature participating in kenosis), divine freedom, and reliable divine action in creation.
 - Polemic and pastoral implication: warns that abandoning these doctrines often slights transcendence and elevates creaturely categories into God, leading to instability in worship, prayer, and doctrine.
- **Figures and sources engaged:** broad appeal to patristic (Augustine), medieval (Anselm, Aquinas), Reformation (Calvin), Reformed scholastics; critical engagement with contemporary evangelical and analytic theologians who reject classical simplicity or advocate "property" or "relational" accounts of divine attributes.
- **Doctrines treated:** divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity (relations and identity), Christology (implications for incarnation and divine participation), revelation and providence.
- **Closing line:** Dolezal insists that reclaiming **simplicity and aseity** is not antiquarian but necessary: without them evangelical theology loses the metaphysical ground of God's transcendence, reliability, and unity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Treats simplicity and aseity as the *hinge* doctrines that hold together the coherence of evangelical dogmatics, not merely abstruse metaphysical add-ons.
 - Integrates historical-theological fidelity with analytic clarity: classical formulations are defended but rearticulated for contemporary evangelical concerns.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters revisionist approaches that make divine attributes real, distinct properties that compose God, arguing such moves collapse Creator/creature distinctions and risk making God contingent on linguistic or modal schemes.
 - Pushes back on emotional or pastoral critiques of immutability/impassibility by showing properly understood these attributes safeguard divine reliability and loving constancy.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Reinforces an explanatory priority: **aseity** grounds divine simplicity; simplicity then secures immutability and impassibility as coherent Christian affirmations rather than philosophical oddities.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued by those within Reformed and evangelical circles seeking a rigorous recovery of classical theism; used as a corrective in doctoral seminars and systematic theology courses addressing divine attributes.
 - Stimulates renewed conversation between analytic philosophers of religion and historically minded theologians inside evangelicalism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact model for defending classical theism within evangelical dogmatics and for showing the systemic costs of doctrinal revision.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God is not composite; attributes are identical to divine essence. Used to defend unity of God and prevent additive, creaturely descriptions from constituting God.
- **Aseity:** God is self-existent, not dependent on anything; explains divine non-contingency and ultimate ground of being.
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo essential change; defended as consonant with faithful revelation and reliable promise-keeping.
- **Impassibility:** God is not passively affected by creation in a way that alters His nature; reframed to preserve genuine divine compassion without ontological change.
- **Classical Theism:** The constellation of simplicity, aseity, eternity, immutability, and impassibility; presented as the orthodox framework to which evangelicalism should return.
- **Attributes-as-Identity (vs. property pluralism):** The view that divine attributes are identical with the divine essence, contrasted with views holding attributes as separable properties.
- **Creator/creature distinction:** A conceptual boundary preserved by simplicity/aseity; protects theology from imputing creaturely dependency to God.
- **Trinitarian Coherence:** How simplicity and aseity condition orthodox talk about divine relations and personhood in the Trinity.
- **Christological Consequences:** Implications for the incarnation-how an immutable, simple divine nature can genuinely be present in the person of Christ without ontological fragmentation.
- **Theological Method:** Historical fidelity + analytic clarification; Dolezal models reading classical sources to solve contemporary problems.
- **Evangelical Crisis (phrase):** The cumulative doctrinal instability and pastoral consequences when classical attributes are discarded.
- **Divine Freedom:** Rearticulated in light of simplicity/aseity to avoid arbitrariness and to secure rational grounding for divine decisions.
- **Providence & Revelation:** Shown to depend on an immutable, aseitic God for coherence of promise and trustworthy action.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for courses on divine attributes and systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against open theism/relationalism and property-view accounts of the attributes.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading biblical texts about God's constancy and transcendence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking metaphysical doctrines (aseity, simplicity) to practical loci (worship, prayer, pastoral assurance).
