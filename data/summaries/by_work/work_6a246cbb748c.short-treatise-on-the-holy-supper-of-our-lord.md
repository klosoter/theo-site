### TITLE
**Short Treatise on the Holy Supper of Our Lord** - John Calvin (Reformation Geneva, mid-16th century). 
Concise pastoral-theological manual addressing the nature, purpose, administration, and reception of the Lord's Supper within a Reformed covenant framework.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed amid Reformation controversies (Catholic transubstantiation, Lutheran sacramental union, Zwinglian memorialism). Written for pastoral instruction and to standardize practice in Geneva.
 - Movement: Early Reformed theology; Calvinian pastoral and polemical concern to order worship and discipline.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper is a sacrament that truly communicates Christ to believers - not by physical presence of his human nature in the elements, but by a **real, spiritual presence** accomplished by the Spirit and embraced by faith. It must be rightly administered and received; the church must guard (fence) the table.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: sacraments as **visible words** - signs and seals of God's promises that convey the promised benefit when received in faith.
 - Christology & presence: argues against bodily presence in the elements; insists on spiritual feeding on Christ by the Spirit.
 - Pastoral & ecclesial praxis: sets norms for admission, worthy reception, and exclusion of unrepentant persons (fencing the table).
 - Connection to baptism: integrates sacramental theology into covenant continuity (infant baptism as covenant sign/seal).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Roman Catholic positions (transubstantiation, ex opere operato), Lutheran claims of ubiquity/sacramental union, and Zwinglian memorialism.
 - Deploys Scripture (Pauline eucharistic texts, Johannine and synoptic material), patristic witnesses selectively, and Reformed confessional reasoning.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (presence and communicative office), pneumatology (Spirit as instrumental in sacramental benefit), covenant theology (sacraments as covenant signs), ecclesiology (discipline, table admission), soteriology (faith as requisite for sacramental benefit).
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin locates the supper at the intersection of promise and faith: sacraments are ordained instruments by which the Spirit unites believers to Christ and confirms covenant blessings when received in faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Spiritual real presence**: Christ is truly present and communicated, yet not by a local physical transfer into bread and wine; presence is effected by the Holy Spirit and received by faith.
 - **Sacraments as "visible word"**: stresses that sacraments are not mere signs nor automatic conveyors of grace but the sensuous form of God's promise, intelligible and efficacious only through faith.
 - **Fencing the table**: robust pastoral discipline - public admission and exclusion safeguard the sacrament's integrity and the church's purity.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Rome: rejects metaphysical change (transubstantiation) and any impassive efficacy (ex opere operato).
 - Against Luther: denies bodily ubiquity or sacramental union that places Christ's flesh in the elements.
 - Against Zwingli: opposes bare memorialism; insists on more than remembrance - a real spiritual feeding.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies instrumentality: sacraments themselves are not the cause but the **instrument** through which God, by the Spirit, imparts what they signify.
 - Tightens covenant logic: links baptismal inclusion (infant baptism) and communion participation as covenantal continuities requiring faith-formation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on Reformed confessions (Second Helvetic, Westminster, Heidelberg Catechism) and Reformed pastoral practice concerning communion and discipline.
 - Ongoing reference point in debates over presence, communion admission, and sacramental theology across Protestant traditions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a middle path: robust sacramental realism without corporealism; practical pastoral ordering of sacraments; a durable Reformed account of means of grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament / Sacramentum** - a visible sign and seal of the promise; sensible form of the Word.
- **Visible word** - Calvin's phrase for sacrament: the Word made sensible; not separate from preaching.
- **Sign and seal** - sign points to promise; seal guarantees and confirms God's pledge.
- **Spiritual presence** - Christ truly communicates himself to believers in the supper by the Spirit, not by local bodily presence.
- **Reception by faith** - sacramental benefit is realized only when appropriated by faith; faith is the instrumental condition.
- **Means of grace** - sacraments are ordained instruments through which God ordinarily bestows grace when accompanied by the Spirit and faith.
- **Fencing the table** - pastoral practice of admitting only those prepared and excluding unrepentant sinners; discipline to preserve sacramental integrity.
- **Admission / worthy reception** - not a claim of personal perfection but of genuine faith, repentance, and communal readiness.
- **Infant baptism** - baptism as covenant sign/seal; infants of believers belong to the covenant community and receive the sign, subject to later personal faith.
 - Contrasts with believer's baptism: Calvin argues covenantal logic supports paedobaptism; efficacy always depends on God's promise and future appropriation by faith.
- **Mode (immersion/affusion)** - Calvin focuses on sign and covenant continuity rather than insisting on a single physical mode; practice varied, with affusion accepted.
- **Ex opere operato** - (rejected) the idea that sacraments confer grace by virtue of the rite alone is denied; divine promise + Spirit + faith necessary.
- **Union with Christ** - sacramental feeding is an enactment of union effected by the Spirit.
- **Efficacy** - not mechanical; distinguished between objective promise and subjective appropriation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental theology (what sacraments are and how they function). 
- As a **polemic reference** against transubstantiation, Lutheran corporeal presence, and Zwinglian memorialism. 
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for administering communion, framing admission/fencing, and teaching the covenantal logic linking baptism and the Lord's Supper.
