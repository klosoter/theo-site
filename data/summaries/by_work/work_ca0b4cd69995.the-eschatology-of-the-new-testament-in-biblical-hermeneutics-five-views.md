### TITLE
The Eschatology of the New Testament (essay by Richard B. Gaffin Jr.) - in Biblical Hermeneutics: Five Views

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical-Reformed scholarship; contribution to a multi-author volume on hermeneutical approaches. Gaffin writes against both mid-century "realized eschatology" excesses and novel futurist/speculative readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents eschatology as **inaugurated**: decisive eschatological realities have occurred in Christ (especially in his resurrection and giving of the Spirit), yet the final consummation remains future. The problem addressed is how to hold the "already" without collapsing the "not yet."
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes exegetical priority of Pauline and broader NT texts that tie resurrection, Spirit, and justification to eschatological promises.
 - Argues resurrection is the climactic, historical eschatological event that inaugurates new creation and justifies present Christian identity.
 - Shows NT language of "already/not yet" is neither purely realized (Dodd) nor purely futuristic (classical dispensationalism).
 - Maintains a consistent covenantal/redemptive-historical framework: present gifts (Spirit, new life, adoption) are anticipatory signs; bodily resurrection, final judgment, and cosmic renewal are future consummations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages C. H. Dodd (realized eschatology), George Eldon Ladd (already/not yet schema), and various Pauline interpreters. Draws on Reformed covenantal tradition (Vos, Warfield) and contemporary evangelical exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (resurrection as eschatological act), Pneumatology (Spirit as present eschatological power), Soteriology/Justification (eschatological structure of justification), Ecclesiology (church as covenant community in tension), Resurrection and New Creation, Judgment and Parousia.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Gaffin centers NT eschatology on the historical resurrection as the inaugurated presence of God's future new-creation reign: present salvific realities are real signs and down-payments but require future consummation to fulfill their eschatological telos.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous insistence that the resurrection is the pivotal eschatological event: not a mere confirmation but the decisive inbreaking of the age to come.
 - Strongly covenantal/redeemio-historical reading of Pauline texts that resists either over-spiritualizing or over-futurizing.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Dodd-style "realized eschatology" that risks denying substantive future consummation.
 - Contrasts with dispensational futurism that severs present salvation from inaugurated reality and minimizes the resurrection's historical definitiveness.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and defends the precision of "inaugurated eschatology" as a theological category grounded in NT narrative and sacramental signs (Spirit, Word, sacrament).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a measured, text-centered corrective to extremes; influential in Pauline eschatology discussions and in debates over the role of resurrection in soteriology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical model for balancing present experience and future hope; useful for teaching the unity of redemption-history and for resisting reductive readings that deny future bodily fulfillment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The NT reality that the last days have begun in Christ while awaiting consummation.
- **Already / Not yet** - Formula for the tension: present possession of eschatological benefits vs. awaiting final completion.
- **Resurrection (eschatological event)** - Central, historical act that inaugurates the new age; basis for Christian identity and hope.
- **Parousia** - Future visible return of Christ; the consummating event that completes what is inaugurated.
- **New Creation** - The eschatological goal: cosmic renewal tied to resurrection and final judgment.
- **Spirit (down-payment/guarantee)** - Present eschatological presence and pledge of future inheritance; mediation of new life.
- **Justification in eschatological perspective** - Treated as embedded in the coming age inaugurated by Christ; not merely forensic but covenantal-historical.
- **Bodily resurrection / corporeal hope** - Emphasized as necessary future fulfillment against purely spiritualized readings.
- **Kingdom of God (inaugurated rule)** - Present reality in Christ's person and work, to be consummated universally.
- **Realized eschatology (critique)** - Gaffin critiques versions that eliminate future consummation or reduce eschatology to present ethical/spiritual states.
- **Typological / redemptive-historical method** - Reading OT promises as realized in Christ in stages, not fully replaced nor left pending.
- **Eschatological judgment** - Future event that complements inaugurated salvation; not to be moralized away.
- **Hermeneutical priority of Paul and NT narrative** - Gaffin stresses reading eschatology within apostolic proclamation rather than abstract theological systematizing.
- **Sacramental signs as provisional presence** - Spirit, Word, and sacraments function as anticipatory realities.

How the work is used:
- As a primary **definition source** for inaugurated eschatology in Reformed and evangelical teaching.
- As a **polemic** against extreme realized eschatology and sectarian futurism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts within a redemptive-historical framework and for linking resurrection, Spirit, and final hope.
