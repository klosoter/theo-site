### TITLE
Imputation and the Active Obedience of Christ (WTJ 2009) - T. David Gordon

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-modern Reformed theological discussion (2000s). Appears in Westminster Theological Journal, engaging contemporary disputes about the nature of justification within confessional Protestantism and contrast with "new perspective" and other revisionist readings.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Gordon defends the classical Reformed thesis that **both the passive and the active obedience of Christ are imputed** to believers. He argues that the imputation of Christ's active obedience (Christ's fulfilled law-keeping) is necessary to account for the positive righteousness required in forensic justification.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Brief survey of the doctrinal stakes: what is required for justification beyond the removal of guilt.
 - Biblical exegesis of Pauline and forensic texts (e.g., Romans, Galatians, 2 Corinthians, Philippians) to show language of righteousness and imputation presupposes both aspects of Christ's work.
 - Historical-theological defense: tracing Reformed confessions and theologians that articulate active obedience as imputed (covenant/federal theology).
 - Systematic response to objections: addresses claims that forgiveness alone or passive obedience suffices; critiques views that reduce justification to pardon or that refuse a positive imputed righteousness.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: reasserts forensic, covenantal, and substitutionary frameworks that make active obedience intelligible and necessary.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primarily scriptural testimony and classical Reformed/confessional sources; engages contemporary critics of active-obedience imputation (broadly described), and interacts with systematic-methodological debates in recent Protestant scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (covenant of works and grace), Christology (person and work of Christ, active/passive obedience), soteriology (justification, imputation, forensic declaration), forensic language of sin and righteousness.
- **Closing line:** Gordon locates the doctrine of the imputed active obedience at the heart of a robust, forensic Reformed doctrine of justification: without it, justification is left with mere pardon and loses the positive, alien righteousness required by divine law.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **positivity of justification**: not merely remission of sins but bestowal of Christ's righteousness (active obedience) as legally constitutive for the believer.
 - Clear linking of **federal headship** and imputation-Christ as covenantal representative whose law-keeping is transferable to those in union with him.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against views that equate justification with forgiveness only or that confine imputation to passive obedience. Corrects reductionist accounts that downplay the necessity of Christ's fulfilled law-obedience.
 - Reaffirms confessional/Reformation consensus against modern minimizations of forensic righteousness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precision in use of "active obedience" as the obedience of Christ unto merit and positive righteousness, kept distinct from but complementary to penal substitution and passive suffering.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Functions as a concise, scholarly restatement within conservative Reformed circles; useful in debates over justification and in seminary instruction. Cited selectively in apologetic and confessional defenses of traditional imputation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Compact, clear defense of a contested doctrine; valuable for courses on justification, covenant theology, and polemics versus revisionist positions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation:** The forensic crediting of Christ's obedience or sin to believers; central technical category.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's life of perfect law-keeping, producing positive righteousness credited to believers.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death as penalty-bearing substitution for sin (atonement).
- **Forensic justification:** God's legal declaration of sinners as righteous; involves both pardon and the reckoning of righteousness.
- **Righteousness of Christ:** The alien righteousness Christ possesses and which is given to believers by imputation.
- **Double imputation (common phrase):** The doctrine that sin is imputed to Christ and righteousness imputed to believers-Gordon defends the latter as including active obedience.
- **Federal headship / covenant representation:** The framework making imputation intelligible: Christ as representative head whose acts are reckoned to his people.
- **Merit (divine/Christological):** The value of Christ's obedience that renders imputation coherent without violating divine justice.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** The theological scaffolding distinguishing what Christ fulfilled and what believers receive.
- **Alien righteousness:** Righteousness not inherent in the believer but accounted to them by God.
- **Positional righteousness vs practical sanctification:** Clarifies that imputation concerns position (justification), not the actual growth in personal holiness (sanctification).
- **Substitutionary atonement:** Christ bearing penalty for sin (passive), complementary to active obedience.
- **Forensic language (crediting, reckoning, counting):** Key verbs used exegetically to argue imputation.
- **Exegetical loci used:** Romans (esp. ch. 4 & 5), 2 Corinthians 5:21, Philippians 3:9-texts treated as central evidence.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for imputation and the necessity of active obedience in systematic theologies.
 - As a **polemic** or corrective against views that reduce justification to pardon or deny positive righteousness.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading forensic Pauline texts within covenantal/federal frameworks.
