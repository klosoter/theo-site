### TITLE
Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach to the Place of Science - Vern S. Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical engagement with science (first published 2006).
 - Responds to pervasive scientism and to models that segregate theology and natural science.
 - Situated within a Kuyperian/Reformed concern for the lordship of Christ over all fields of human inquiry.

- **Central thesis**
 - Science must be redeemed by locating it under the authority of the triune God: scientific practice is a creaturely, fallible, providentially-ordered human activity that both manifests and distorts the Creator's order and therefore must be theologically informed and critiqued.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of secular presuppositions: methodological naturalism and scientism illegitimately absolutize a limited method.
 - Positive account: science is a culturally embedded craft anchored in the created order, common grace, and the providential governance of God.
 - Epistemology: scientific knowledge is model-based and analogical (it represents aspects of created reality but is not exhaustive or autonomous).
 - Theology of nature: laws of nature are not autonomous regularities but signs of God's sustaining action; scientific laws are human descriptions of God-ordained patterns.
 - Practical implications: scientific pursuits should be guided by theological commitments (ethics, stewardship, humility about limits), and Christian communities should cultivate responsible scientific vocations.
 - Concluding synthesis: restore science to a God-centered epistemic framework without rejecting legitimate scientific methods.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit contrasts with proponents of secular scientism and strict methodological naturalism.
 - Conversational debt to Reformed thinkers (Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck) and to contemporary Christian philosophers of science (e.g., Alvin Plantinga-style critiques of naturalism).
 - Engagement with scientific practice broadly rather than sustained dialogue with specific scientific theorists.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (order, creatureliness, general revelation).
 - **Providence** (sustaining, regularity of nature).
 - **Common grace** (enabling secular science; explaining genuine knowledge outside the church).
 - **Authority of Scripture** (norming role for interpreting creation and bounding science).
 - **Sin and fall** (distortion of cognitive faculties and cultural practices).
 - Implicit Trinitarian framing (God as lawgiver, sustainer, and covenant Lord of knowledge).

- **Closing line**
 - A Reformed, God-centered framework that treats science as a fallible, model-based cultural practice accountable to Scripture and grounded in the Creator's covenantal ordering of creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that scientific laws and regularities are contingent on divine covenantal ordering rather than autonomous metaphysical necessities.
 - Focus on *redeeming* science - not rejecting modern science but reorienting its telos toward God's glory and human stewardship.
 - Emphasis on science as *craft* and *model-building* rather than pure theory-confirmation or naïve realism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both secular scientism (which de-theologizes science) and overly separatist Christian positions that dismiss modern scientific practice.
 - Contrasts with conciliatory approaches that simply seek non-overlapping magisteria by instead arguing for theological normativity in evaluating scientific presuppositions and aims.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes an integrated vocabulary: laws as divine ordinances, models as analogical instruments, science as culturally situated craft.
 - Practical taxonomy of ways theology interacts with science (critique, support, reorientation).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed Christian colleges, apologetics circles, and among theologians seeking constructive engagement with science.
 - Influential for pastors and educators wanting a principled alternative to both scientism and anti-scientific fideism.
 - Less engaged in mainstream philosophy of science journals but fruitful as a theological corrective and pedagogical resource.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable framework for curriculum development in Christian higher education.
 - Useful as a bridge between systematic theology and philosophy of science, especially in teaching contexts.
 - Enduringly valuable for pastoral and ethical formation of Christian scientists.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redeeming** - Restoring science to its rightful place under God's lordship rather than abandoning or uncritically adopting secular presuppositions.
- **Common grace** - God's non-saving gifts that preserve order and enable true knowledge in fallen human cultures; explains why non-Christians can do good science.
- **Creation ordinances / laws as divine ordinances** - Natural regularities are grounded in God's covenantal governance rather than autonomous natural necessity.
- **Methodological naturalism (critique)** - The methodological rule excluding supernatural explanation is described as an illicit absolutization of a limited method.
- **Model-based science** - Science proceeds through analogical, partial models; knowledge is representational and instrumentally reliable, not exhaustively literal.
- **Theistic realism** - A moderate realism: the world is intelligible because God designed it; scientific success is expected but interpretively constrained by theology.
- **Two-books metaphor (reinterpreted)** - Scripture and creation are complementary testimonies; Scripture norms interpretation of nature and the aims of science.
- **Providence** - Sustaining action of God that grounds the regularities scientists observe and the intelligibility of creation.
- **Fall / distortion** - Sin affects cognition and culture, producing distortions in scientific aims and interpretations; cautions humility and corrective theology.
- **Stewardship / telos** - Science should serve human flourishing under God, guided by Christian ethics and eschatological hope.
- **Analogy and analogical knowledge** - Scientific models provide analogies to reality; they are partial and normative interpretation is theological.
- **Worldview coherence** - Science must be assessed within a coherent Christian worldview that integrates epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.
- **Practical craft** - Emphasizes training, practices, instruments, and communities as essential to scientific work.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - Clarifies theological vocabulary for the relationship of faith and science (common grace, creation ordinances, model-based science).
- **Polemic** - Frequently cited to critique scientism and methodological naturalism in public theology and apologetics.
- **Conceptual pivot / pedagogical model** - Serves as a practical curriculum and conceptual backbone for Christian higher-education courses integrating theology and science.
