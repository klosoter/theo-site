### TITLE
The Power of God Unto Salvation - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Princetonian Reformed theology. Reaction against theological liberalism and speculative theology; defense of classical orthodoxy and biblical authority.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel proclaimed is intrinsically **the power of God unto salvation**: Christ's objective work (atonement and resurrection) together with the Spirit's sovereign application through the ordinary means of grace effects saving transformation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Statement of the gospel's claim: God in Christ has accomplished salvation (legal and redemptive ground).
 - Defense of the objective reality of atonement as necessary for forgiveness and reconciliation (cf. Atonement: Necessity, Extent And Theories).
 - Explanation of how the Spirit applies this accomplished salvation:
 - Spirit as the efficient cause of conversion, present in Christ's ministry and raising him from the dead (cf. Spirits Role In Christs Ministry And Resurrection).
 - Union with Christ wrought by Spirit as the bond that makes atonement effective for sinners.
 - Elucidation of the ordinary instruments: the Word, preaching, sacraments, and prayer as channels whereby the Spirit ordinarily communicates the saving power (cf. Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer).
 - Resurrection and eschatological significance: Christ's resurrection as the vindication and inaugurative event of the new creation; personal resurrection of believers follows as participation in Christ's triumph (cf. Resurrection And New Creation).
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages liberal and pietistic tendencies that reduce atonement to moral influence; counters German critical reductionism that undermines the objective historicity of Christ's work.
 - Dialogue with classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Augustine via tradition) and contemporary defenders of penal substitution.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, Christology (incarnation, substitution), Atonement (necessity and extent), Pneumatology (application, resurrection), Sacramental theology, Soteriology (effectual calling, union with Christ), Eschatology (resurrection, new creation), Election and grace.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center of gravity: **Christ's accomplished redemption + the Spirit's sovereign application through ordained means = the power of God unto salvation.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Firm insistence on the coexistence of the objective and subjective dimensions of salvation: an accomplished objective work that is effectually applied by the Spirit.
 - Priority of **preaching** as the principal ordinary channel of the gospel's saving power, with sacraments and prayer as subordinate yet real means.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to moral-influence theories of atonement and to theological liberalism that demythologizes resurrection and Spirit action.
 - Reasserts penal/substitutionary language while clarifying **sufficiency vs efficiency** (atonement sufficient for all, efficient for those united to Christ).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tightened vocabulary linking "power" (dunamis) to the combined realities of atonement, Spirit, and means - framing soteriology as an interplay of accomplished fact and applied power.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries; used as a touchstone in 20th-century defenses of penal substitution, sacramental usefulness, and Spirit-empowered preaching.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful theological integration of doctrinal precision, biblical exegesis, and pastoral concern; remains a go-to resource for teaching classical Reformed soteriology and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Power of God (dunamis)** - Gospel considered as divine enabling reality, not mere proposition.
- **Gospel (euangelion)** - Announcement of Christ's accomplishment; objectively true and redemptively efficacious.
- **Substitutionary / Penal Atonement** - Christ bears penalty due to sinners; objective satisfaction is necessary for forgiveness.
 - Warfield stresses **both** the objective satisfaction and its Spirit-wrought appropriation.
- **Necessity of Atonement** - Sin required a divine remedy; mere moral example inadequate.
- **Extent of Atonement** - Distinguishes sufficiency (for all) and efficiency (applied to the elect).
- **Means of Grace** - Ordinary instruments by which the Spirit applies redemption:
 - Preaching: primary instrument (proclamation as the ordained vehicle of dunamis).
 - Sacraments: confirmatory, covenantal signs effecting grace in union with the Word.
 - Prayer: participatory instrument accompanying the means.
- **Spirit (Pneuma)** - Active in Christ's ministry, in raising Jesus, and in effecting union with Christ; the efficient cause of regeneration.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological bond making atonement effectual for individuals; mediated by Spirit.
- **Effectual Calling** - The Spirit's real operation rendering the gospel effectual.
- **Resurrection** - Vindication of Christ's work; the firstfruits of new creation and pattern for believer resurrection.
- **New Creation** - Eschatological consummation inaugurated in the resurrection; soteriology tied to cosmic renewal.
- **Objective vs Subjective** - Distinct but inseparable moments: objective accomplishment and subjective application.
- **Ordinary / Extraordinary Means** - Differentiates sacramental/wordly channels from miraculous interventions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulations of penal substitution and the relation of sufficiency/efficiency.
 - As a **polemic** against moral-influence atonement theories and theological liberalism that downplays Spirit and resurrection.
 - As an **exegetical model** for connecting texts (e.g., Romans) on "power" with soteriological structure.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking atonement, pneumatology, preaching, and eschatology into a coherent scheme for preaching and pastoral theology.
